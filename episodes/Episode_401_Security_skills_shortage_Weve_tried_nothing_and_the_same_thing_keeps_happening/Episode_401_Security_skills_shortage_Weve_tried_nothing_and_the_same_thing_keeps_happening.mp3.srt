Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,270
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Conjoin.

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,159
Disjointed ideas. Josh Pre,

3
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:14,609
I'm

4
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:19,840
so as many of, you know, I generally don't let Kurt surprise me with topics, but,

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,569
-- but
-- every time I do, you're happy

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,280
life got away from me

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,049
and he snuck this one in. So I have no idea what's going on. All I know is I have

8
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,819
to share my screen at some point with

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:30,260
you.

10
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,310
That's gonna be the very end of the show. You're gonna enjoy it and I enjoy it. I mean,

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,310
ok, so I'm not going to list the third thing because that's the, that's dessert. Ok.

12
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,259
So we're gonna start with the,

13
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,340
we're gonna start with the entree and then the main.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,259
So essentially

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,669
there's Bruce Schneier

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,779
has weighed in on the cybersecurity skills shortage,

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,290
right.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,959
And so

19
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:57,560
do we even need to tell viewers what that is

20
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,169
or they're just going to be familiar with it because

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,040
-- to put it bluntly,
-- we should always be

22
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:05,410
in two years assuming we've solved all these problems,

23
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:07,699
no one will understand what we're talking about.

24
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,410
Well, but see, that's the point of this is that it's,

25
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,779
this has been a problem for 20 years, at least, maybe more like, because,

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,519
I mean, and, and when you and I started,

27
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:21,400
there was a legitimate cyber security skill shortage for the simple fact of, like,

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,730
it wasn't ta anywhere like you have to self learn it.

29
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,529
-- Right. If you were lucky,
-- you know,

30
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,080
and now I would teach you because we all hated it.

31
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,639
And now, I mean, there are university courses, there are professional courses

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,180
and still a massive gap

33
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:36,230
and,

34
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,160
and also even in like, even, um, people are talking in North America, you know,

35
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:44,169
there's this constant refrain of like, we don't have enough electricians,

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,440
we don't have enough truck drivers, we don't have enough plumbers

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,629
and

38
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,489
to point something out, you know, there's always number one,

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,370
there's always that solution of, well,

40
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,239
like if you pay a million dollars a year,

41
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,620
I guarantee you there will not be a shortage of plumbers.

42
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,279
That's right. That's right.

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,940
And remember back in the early aughts, like a lot of people gone into com sci

44
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,209
tech because of the.com boom and like, holy cow, I can make six figures a year,

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,949
like cranking out crappy websites.

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,758
And the answer is yes. Yes, you can

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,440
not anymore. Now it's prompt engineering. You gotta be a prompt engineer.

48
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,360
That's the current hot.

49
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,410
But

50
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,190
it just makes me laugh that we keep talking about

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,940
the blank insert here and it could be cyber

52
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,929
security could be plumbers or it could be electricians,

53
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,350
it could be whatever the skills crisis and shortage

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,029
and for something that's not completely new.

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,149
Like, I get, like, in a, I,

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,830
right now we have an actual shortage of A I security people because, I mean, sure

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,350
we just sort of are in the process of inventing it.

58
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:37,800
-- It
-- doesn't exist.

59
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,190
Right.

60
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,949
But, like, cloud security, like,

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,300
the cloud security lines had its 15th anniversary.

62
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:44,350
Wow.

63
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,820
Well, I mean,

64
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,309
yeah, and it's,

65
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,149
and for the organizations that have been doing it for a long time,

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,990
like Amazon Microsoft Google,

67
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,630
they're pretty darn good at it. Like they're, they're doing custom silicon now.

68
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,649
What did, what did Schneier

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,369
say? Does he agree there is a shortage or does he think there isn't,

70
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,039
uh

71
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,429
sort of

72
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,442
one of those things? Da da da,

73
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:05,772
da,

74
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:06,082
da,

75
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:06,733
da, da, da, da da.

76
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,192
Here we go. Yeah, here we go.

77
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:09,552
And this is a different person, Kuer.

78
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,533
But anyways, uh what there is

79
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,343
is and I'm paraphrasing here because it's a little bit mangled.

80
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:18,272
What there is is a shortage of computer scientists, developers,

81
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,382
engineers and information security professionals who

82
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:23,082
can code understand technical security architecture,

83
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,373
product security and applications,

84
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:27,186
security specialist analyst with threat hunting and incident response skills.

85
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:29,656
And the one thing I've seen popping up a lot

86
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,345
more now is you and I come from this golden era

87
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:38,065
of we were just at that cusp of computers were simple enough to sort of understand,

88
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,175
but fast enough to be useful

89
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:44,695
and the architectures that you and I grew up on still exist

90
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,429
like X 86 and so on.

91
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:51,630
-- Yeah.
-- And, and like the way the internet works, I PV four still exists like my I PV four

92
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:51,949
R

93
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:53,880
I like how you

94
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:54,750
still exists

95
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,059
in like it's going to go away some day.

96
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,860
-- That's cute.
-- Eternally hopeful that I PV four will die someday.

97
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,229
I'm gonna pretend Kurt, like give this one to me.

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,850
Dude, there's going to be some space probe that they can't turn it off for

99
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,000
-- maybe,
-- you know, whatever the D

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,300
A or whatever it is going to be like, you know,

101
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:12,100
I PV four for like the probes we sent out 50 years ago.

102
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,100
I pe four will never die.

103
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,050
Yeah,

104
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,820
but

105
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,010
thank goodness I have all this I PV

106
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,500
four routing knowledge that's still applicable today.

107
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,540
Well, and it is because for example, it'll help you.

108
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:23,799
It's,

109
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,339
it's the foundation of I PV six and

110
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,220
it's the foundation of troubleshooting in general,

111
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,329
right? Like

112
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,779
I have a ton of email knowledge. And

113
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,660
so when we get some weird email problems,

114
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,750
I can usually track them down pretty fast because

115
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,489
I know how to read a raw email.

116
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,700
Like I looked at the raw email and I'm like, but we didn't send it

117
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,059
like literally we had a case of somebody complaining and I'm like,

118
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,049
we, we didn't send this like

119
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:46,029
it's been spammed through

120
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:46,220
Jira

121
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,100
through and,

122
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,980
and then our support person did a bit of a look up and it's like, oh,

123
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,739
they have an own spamming problem where, you know, people are free anyways.

124
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,589
Long story short,

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,649
it's like there's a knowledge based article saying like if

126
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
you get spam claiming to be from you blah,

127
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,019
-- blah, blah, sent to abuse, ok,
-- we're off in the weeds.

128
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,700
-- Let's bring this
-- back

129
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,619
back to this. So we're that golden age where we kind of have

130
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,970
like, I know what ac pu register is.

131
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:13,445
Most web devs apparently nowadays don't know what an http status code is.

132
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,035
And

133
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,295
we, you and I have privately had this discussion, but I realized

134
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,255
it, it doesn't matter for them by

135
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,195
right? They're, they're

136
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:25,605
like the, the fact when I show them how to set up a static website and hand it at HTML.

137
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:26,915
They're like, whoa, you can do that.

138
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:33,165
-- I'm like
-- my, my absolute favorite is when I call into an arrest API

139
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,269
and it returns like a proper http.

140
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:41,019
I forget what you call them. The, the statement to me, write a document

141
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,720
and inside of it, it says error 500.

142
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,429
And I'm like,

143
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:49,644
-- there's literally an HTTP status code for this every four
-- oh or is it 200?

144
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:52,265
Now? That's like, I'm sorry, we couldn't find what you're looking for

145
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,744
because seo

146
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,684
search engine optimization,

147
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:56,924
I don't want to give you an actual four

148
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,904
or four because then Google's gonna penalize me,

149
00:05:59,174 --> 00:05:59,214
right?

150
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:00,304
So,

151
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:04,024
and that's the other thing, right is the web developers in today's world.

152
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,730
It's not the world that it was 20 years ago.

153
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,890
Thank goodness.

154
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,609
Like I literally had this discussion with my web devs where I'm like,

155
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,380
there are like two red lines in the sand for

156
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,429
us is we can never serve a virus off our website

157
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,250
because Google might deist us.

158
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,480
Oh, no,

159
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,640
I don't care about like serving a virus to people

160
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:21,649
so much as I care about Google delisting us.

161
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,959
No, seriously, I can recover. Like

162
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,540
I

163
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:24,779
suppose,

164
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,630
you know what I'm saying? Like if Google Dl Us,

165
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,640
that's bad. Like that's,

166
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,019
that's showing at Curt by a lot of people bad. That's

167
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,170
probably fair, you know.

168
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:35,660
And hopefully anyways and I forget what the second thing was. Um

169
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,170
oh, is that we should serve proper 40 fours and stuff.

170
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:41,600
But honestly, if we kind of return like uh we didn't find it here as a search page.

171
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:42,269
Sure.

172
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:42,700
Yeah.

173
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,440
Ok.

174
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,790
-- Whatever everyone
-- does it and, and in fairness,

175
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,579
-- it's quite a bit friendlier to the human viewing
-- it.

176
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:49,880
I

177
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,070
mean, you can return a special 404 status page,

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,410
right? Like

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,209
-- the
-- browser

180
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,339
and

181
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
do something stupid.

182
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't think they do anymore.

183
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,510
Do you want to take that? Right?

184
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:04,359
-- Or you just want to return to 200 with the search page? Whatever
-- it doesn't matter.

185
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,730
Anyway, what is the purpose of all this conversation?

186
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,059
And this is uh

187
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,170
but this leads to the idea I've been thinking about is, well,

188
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,720
we've tried everything twice at the same time, the same way

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,799
and we have the same problems.

190
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,130
-- So, what do we do now? No,
-- we haven't tried everything at all.

191
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,820
We've tried nothing and the same thing keeps happening.

192
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,160
-- Well, no, but
-- we keep trying the same things like

193
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,279
people are like, well educate developers not to write insecure code.

194
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,119
And I'm like, no, like we did 20 years ago like the last and not even 20 years ago,

195
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,100
but 20 years ago in the same language that they're now still using.

196
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,670
See,

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,220
right?

198
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,600
Well, now C plus sauce or C# but people

199
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,000
-- are
-- using C

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
thank goodness

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,220
this is, yeah, C has

202
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,440
but there's a ton of legacy code like, well, there's a lot.

203
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,429
Oh yeah, yeah,

204
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,200
I mean github,

205
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,899
you search for C it's, there's a lot,

206
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,920
there's plenty

207
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,339
but it just, it's gotten me thinking of like what new things

208
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,640
you know, should we be trying and also the world, but the world changes with us.

209
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:06,730
So for example,

210
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,059
here we go

211
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,950
a British Air and this is from a few days ago.

212
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,309
Uh Literally, this is from uh October 20th.

213
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,179
Uh so a British Airways Boeing 787-9 registration blah blah, blah,

214
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,029
performing a flight from Tokyo to London Heathrow

215
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:28,209
was en route uh flight level 30 so 37,000 ft over the Beaufort Sea

216
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,649
northeast of Anchorage because they're doing the Polar road obviously,

217
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,710
uh when they declared pan pan pan, which was smoke.

218
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,380
Ok. Why,

219
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,739
-- why did they declare their smoke?
-- Why did they declare pan

220
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,429
pan pan and do an emergency landing?

221
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:43,859
Was there smoke?

222
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,568
Somebody dropped their cell phone

223
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,650
and then it lit on fire.

224
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,179
Well,

225
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,809
that's the problem is apparently now all these like massive seats

226
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,010
in first class have like gears and stuff to like,

227
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,710
you know, do the full recline and everything.

228
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,840
And if you drop your phone in there and then you recline

229
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,380
the seat and it chews the phone up all the ink.

230
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,880
Remember all the, the battery

231
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:02,940
out

232
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,859
potentially. Yes.

233
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,710
Uh In this case,

234
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,010
not quite that,

235
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,179
but they diverted and had to like take the thing apart to get the phone out.

236
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:12,679
So wait,

237
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,900
they diverted a flight simply because someone dropped their phone in the seat

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,119
and apparently they couldn't get it out.

239
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,820
This is a thing.

240
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:21,679
So the, the,

241
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,140
the recommendation now by all airlines is that if you drop your phone

242
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,400
and it goes into the seat and you cannot immediately retrieve it,

243
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,700
you have to notify flight crew

244
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,380
and then you're not allowed to move the seat.

245
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,059
And

246
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,640
essentially when they land the plane, then they have a,

247
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,950
a maintenance crew come and take the seat apart.

248
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,619
-- Yeah,
-- I'm ok with that. But why would they

249
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,719
land early because of that?

250
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,460
-- I, well, they did, it doesn't say if it was
-- unless the person moved the seat.

251
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,400
Oh, sorry, there was smoke in the cabin. Yeah, it did. So, it did catch fire

252
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:49,580
a

253
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:49,969
bit.

254
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,809
-- Oh,
-- there was smoke. So, if there's smoke that makes sense.

255
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,200
Like, smoke in an airplane is bad.

256
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,650
-- But it's
-- just a little fire.

257
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,030
No, there's no such thing as a little fire on an airplane.

258
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,909
Like, when you're on an airplane, if there's smoke, you land

259
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,969
like that's it.

260
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,320
And

261
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,929
what gets me is somebody built an airline seat with like,

262
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,169
moving gears and meshing stuff.

263
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,270
And clearly I won't buy a sofa that doesn't

264
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,140
have removable cushions for my Children because like,

265
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,260
I have to get food out of there.

266
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,710
I have to vacuum it. You, you have a dog,

267
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:21,770
you don't buy a sofa with cushions you can't remove. Right?

268
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,099
-- Because how are you going to vacuum it?
-- I would never buy a sofa with cushions.

269
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,359
I can't remove just because I feel like that would be

270
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,799
covered in filth

271
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,859
-- in like a year.
-- Exactly.

272
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,119
And like, I have two, I have two nice couches in the living room that, like,

273
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,630
the kids are basically not allowed to use because the cushions don't come off.

274
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:37,840
But

275
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,539
-- the really nice couches,
-- you just said you wouldn't buy a couch with

276
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:40,799
the

277
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,059
c

278
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,190
for

279
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,880
the one in the family room is like an IKEA thing. That's,

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you know, look, here's, here's, you just, you just solve your problem.

281
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,020
You are special

282
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,619
so you can violate the rules,

283
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,659
but no one else can that is fundamentally the problem.

284
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,210
If I'm designing an airplane seat,

285
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,539
it better be like

286
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,630
people drop phones. Like I

287
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,619
-- remember reading and, but
-- they designed these airplane seats in what,

288
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,099
like in 1985 when no one owns cell phones.

289
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,299
These are pretty new.

290
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,260
These are relatively newer, like they were full recline bed things.

291
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,369
But I remember reading a report where it was like one

292
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,599
of the original reports where I forget which company it was.

293
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,900
But they commissioned report because they were getting a

294
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,169
lot more warranty claims than they had expected.

295
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,729
And they discovered people were dropping their laptops and like,

296
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:24,789
like straight up knocking them off tables and dropping them

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,169
and stuff and they were horrified because they're like,

298
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,200
these things cost between five and $10,000.

299
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,570
Why would you smash it on the phone? And they're like, because that's life.

300
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,210
-- It just happens,
-- people drop things and that's exactly how it works

301
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:34,770
or yes,

302
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,770
it's plugged in and you snake the cord and it

303
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,369
smashed. I mean, the whole make safe connector.

304
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,719
Like I love the make safe connector because

305
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,770
that was just not a possibility.

306
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:48,809
And I mean, I've seen cats pull devices off of tables because they grab the cable.

307
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:53,690
I feel like we're in the weeds or is this part of your proposed conversation path?

308
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,260
Well, this is the whole ongoing is like,

309
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,609
how have we not

310
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,539
-- solved this problem
-- because it's not the airline's problem. It is one of the look.

311
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:05,020
Fundamentally, here's the thing,

312
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,739
all of the problems in the world for the most part that

313
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,900
people look at and say, why can't you do this? And it can be

314
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,679
traffic in your city.

315
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,299
It can be dropping things on the floor and they break, it can be seats on an airplane.

316
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,520
It can be, why can't I hire an electrician for A

317
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:22,556
I like?

318
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,265
And fundamentally at the end of the day,

319
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,906
it all comes down to the fact that

320
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:33,666
the cost associated with these things are someone else's problems. So no one cares.

321
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:36,505
-- So it's an externalized cost, not my problem.
-- 100%.

322
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,056
So that is

323
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:37,875
guaranteed.

324
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:42,596
So I want you now in your open up your browser and share your screen with me.

325
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,856
I'm gonna send you a link

326
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,312
horrified by this.

327
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,921
It's just, it's a simple game.

328
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:53,512
-- It's you have to make a password.
-- Oh, is it that uh that one that has all the hilarious?

329
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:53,861
Uh

330
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,552
Oh, well, anyways pretend like you don't know what this is

331
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:57,021
the,

332
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,702
I don't think I've seen this one. Please

333
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,971
-- choose a password
-- so

334
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:01,281
I

335
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:01,521
can see

336
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:01,692
it.

337
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,911
-- I am sharing my screen
-- aren't I? No, you're not.

338
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,252
-- I thought I
-- was

339
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,481
no. When we started recording it went away like

340
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:07,831
it,

341
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,351
share entire screen

342
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:11,752
over the web

343
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:12,052
there,

344
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:12,302
you

345
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:12,591
see

346
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:13,041
it.

347
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:15,510
Ok.

348
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,710
I'll start over

349
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,789
-- and we'll put the link to this in the show notes,
-- obviously, of course,

350
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,969
choose password 1234.

351
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,539
So, ok, Josh has chosen the password password now.

352
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,599
Ok. So just hold

353
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,690
on a sec. So your password must be at least five characters.

354
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,609
Rule number two, your password must include a number. Ok, he's done that.

355
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,530
Rule number three, your password must include an uppercase letter.

356
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,599
I don't know that one. So I'll just do a capital P. Of course,

357
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,729
rule four, your password must include a special character

358
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,320
this

359
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,609
point.

360
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,169
Ok.

361
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,650
In your password must add up to 25. I approve.

362
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,909
Uh Let's see here. I got,

363
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,150
-- let's let's figure out. So
-- like the single digits.

364
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,330
So like 55555 or something like that,

365
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,070
I suppose I could just do five fives that would solve that.

366
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,690
That's easier than this

367
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:58,840
five fives

368
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,450
the month of the year.

369
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:00,830
Your pass

370
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,500
-- must include a month of
-- the year

371
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,190
must include one of our sponsors. I love it.

372
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,770
Pepsi, the taste of a new generation, right?

373
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,400
-- I'm actually literally drinking a Pepsi,
-- the Roman numerals in your,

374
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,289
I don't even know what Roman numerals are to multiply to 35.

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:16,909
And

376
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,809
-- so like
-- what if I just take that out?

377
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,250
V

378
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,929
and Vi

379
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:21,179
I

380
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,640
June

381
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,130
password must include a Roman numeral

382
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,929
35 what A V

383
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,409
five and what is 35

384
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,085
five times six?

385
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:39,025
-- No, but the Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35
-- multiply. So I need

386
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:42,455
five times 67.

387
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:44,155
So like V times vi

388
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:44,354
I,

389
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:45,765
there we go Oh, and I've got the

390
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:46,244
capcha

391
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,844
PDYC eight.

392
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:52,744
-- But now you're, you got to fix the, the 25.
-- Very clever. So now I need to,

393
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:58,304
-- what? I've got to turn that into a three. No, two. Right. Wait, no,
-- eight and five.

394
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,525
Remove a five and turn a five into a three.

395
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:02,065
There we go. Ok.

396
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,179
No, that's wrong. Ok. There we go.

397
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,020
No, no, that's not. Right either.

398
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,270
The

399
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,690
digits

400
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,440
they must add to 25. I'm getting out of calculus. So

401
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,989
any, some of the people listening might know this because I brought it up before.

402
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,409
-- But I literally cannot do math in my head.
-- Well, arithmetic technically is the word

403
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,020
whatever because there's math

404
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,909
like I'm sure you can tell me what the area of a square is.

405
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,460
But like, yeah, you can't multiply 27 times five,

406
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
22.

407
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,919
There you go. There we go. Pastor must include today's veral answer.

408
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,520
The today's veral answer was given

409
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,830
-- given.
-- There you go.

410
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,630
Oh, and they got it right. I'm impressed they knew that.

411
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,409
-- Oh,
-- yeah.

412
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:37,219
No, this,

413
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,219
see, that's funny. I, well, Kurt was slow to the podcast.

414
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:44,299
I played Wordle literally while I was waiting for him. So that's why I knew that

415
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,460
uh the current phase of the moon is an emoji.

416
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,299
Oh, I bet there's a website for this current

417
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,729
moon phase.

418
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,409
OK. Why are we doing this? This feels like it would be boring for anyone but us,

419
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,049
I went.

420
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,880
-- No,
-- no. No, just keep going for a minute.

421
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,659
But the point is

422
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,260
you think this is bad,

423
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,340
this is what it feels like for a normal person with normal password rules.

424
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,090
I have no doubt.

425
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,750
Right. You and I just have a, a pain threshold for passwords. That is obscene

426
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:14,780
-- because we've been doing this for 30 well, 2530 years, whatever. I
-- mean.

427
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,750
Yes. And I agree with that and, ok, I'm going to stop sharing now because I'm,

428
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,950
-- I'm becoming bored of this game and I'm sure anyone listening to me,
-- oh,

429
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,679
it gets better there.

430
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,349
It's like you have to identify the country from the

431
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,820
photo and you have to do like a geographical,

432
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:26,565
like the, the

433
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:26,775
geo

434
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,065
hunt

435
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,364
and then there's, um, like, it just, it gets

436
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:31,395
very mean.

437
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:34,445
I understand what you're talking about when you say

438
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:37,375
this is what other people feel like

439
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:41,244
I'm grossly aware of that point whenever I can

440
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:42,244
because

441
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:45,034
I have pretty old parents now

442
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,840
and dealing with them with technology

443
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:52,679
is bananas sometimes. Like, actually I pawned this off of my kid yesterday.

444
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,349
So we had family pictures taken. My mom was like, I want a nice family picture.

445
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:59,809
-- So like everyone come and we're taking our picture like
-- we get a haircut. Get a suit.

446
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,900
No, no, I wore a sweater. We were out in the woods outdoors.

447
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,310
-- Yeah,
-- it was an outdoorsy thing. So I'm like, fine,

448
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,858
get the picture taken and then the photographer sends him a link of

449
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:11,790
like download all your pictures because they just paid for the like,

450
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,108
copyright and all that crap.

451
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:14,868
Instead of trying to buy pictures.

452
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,469
Then she's like, what do I do with these? I'm like,

453
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,270
Jackson, go help.

454
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,880
And so he, he went and he spent like two hours there and basically he, he, he was like,

455
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,739
do you have a flash drive?

456
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,750
They're like a what? He's like, oh, we have to go get a flash drive.

457
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,760
-- Honestly.
-- See my answer this week, I dump them into icloud Photos.

458
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,280
-- Well,
-- that's what ended up happening.

459
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,770
But they, they decided they wanted it on a flash drive but they didn't

460
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:39,369
flash drive, it turned out. So it, it turned into this whole big thing

461
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,630
as you can imagine. But it's like, I'm so glad I wasn't there. But at the same time,

462
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,439
I totally understand how

463
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,219
anyone who exists from, let's say, 20 plus years ago,

464
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,979
they don't have the skills needed

465
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,439
to accommodate much of this. Now, some people do. I'm not saying no one does because

466
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,219
-- you can keep up.
-- Dude, I spent yesterday fighting

467
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,300
to get logged into my Gmail account on my phone

468
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,000
and it

469
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,890
wouldn't work like I entered my user name and password because what

470
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,270
happened is I changed my password and I also set up a

471
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:13,739
pasy

472
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,680
to start working with it and on my phone,

473
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,650
I entered my user name and password and it

474
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,510
said you have to do a secondary authentication.

475
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm like, yeah, of course, that's

476
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,219
how it's required,

477
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:24,619
plugged in my

478
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,739
UB key

479
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,380
didn't work.

480
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:28,750
Ok.

481
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:30,239
I

482
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:34,199
mean, I tried NFC, tried plugging it in, didn't work, wouldn't work at all.

483
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,650
Ended up doing the thing, you know, where you log on your computer,

484
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,599
go to the Google security thing or whatever and get a secondary code.

485
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:40,930
Sorry.

486
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:43,280
Oh, no, actually, no, I got the secondary code through my ipad,

487
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,520
through the youtube app of all things.

488
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,650
It's like go to the youtube app and do this. And I'm like,

489
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,869
because the youtube app is like a full fat

490
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,520
Google app that I guess does a lot of extra stuff.

491
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,829
It be. Yeah.

492
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,109
So anyways, but like I literally was on my phone

493
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,550
and I couldn't access my email

494
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,800
and I could not get locked back in

495
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,729
without having access to a secondary device to send myself a code.

496
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:07,520
But like I had my key on my key chain. I had my, my UB key that is and like

497
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:12,819
-- even II, I got locked out of my email for a little while.
-- It happens all the time, man.

498
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,150
-- I mean, like, what
-- the heck Google, like, why wouldn't it

499
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,479
work

500
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,239
-- well and look, and
-- I made sure that up key is set up and it works like it's,

501
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,920
that's the key I used to log in.

502
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,150
It's my daily key,

503
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,800
but here's the thing, right?

504
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:24,359
No,

505
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,920
the people have technology problems all the time and they

506
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,160
don't even understand how to describe the problem they have.

507
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,670
And then it becomes an insurmountable task because if you

508
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,959
don't have the language to even describe what you're doing.

509
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,959
And this is basically how everyone deals with security.

510
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,500
This is something I, I talk to the people I work with about all the time

511
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,869
is I, I tell them honest to God, like

512
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,180
I will help you with your personal security because we have entered a phase

513
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,500
where your home network is part of our corporate network, whether I like it or not,

514
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,319
-- the
-- CS A, we have a, a very much bring your own device culture. So yeah,

515
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,430
100%

516
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,290
sure. And look last pass got hacked

517
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,589
complex.

518
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,030
Well, not again. No, I mean, the big one, right? Was,

519
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:07,939
wasn't it

520
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,260
like they wanted their people? And

521
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,180
Octa got hacked and like,

522
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,619
-- remember Octa got hacked last week that
-- just got hacked. I don't know.

523
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,219
Well, last week we don't know when this is coming out. But

524
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:18,859
yeah,

525
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,500
anyways, Octa got hacked and they're supposed to be good at security.

526
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,989
And what was really amusing to me is on the hacker news story.

527
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,229
People are like, why aren't people? Like, why isn't cloud

528
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,199
FFL immediately dropping Octa even though they found the

529
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,729
hack and like took two weeks to convince them

530
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:30,859
and somebody pointed out

531
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,949
the Octa may not be bad. Like this might be as good as a

532
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,395
and from what

533
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:39,305
-- it, it probably is
-- like from what I know of these vendors. That's,

534
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:42,984
and, and look, here's the way I look at this. So like

535
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:46,464
Acor, I'll use as an example. Cloud security alliance would be another example.

536
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,395
Your security team is in the single digits,

537
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:50,114
right?

538
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,994
My security team is in the single digits. Like we're not a huge company.

539
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,135
Well, the fact that they have a security person is already,

540
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,714
they're at the far end of the bell curve.

541
00:20:58,744 --> 00:20:59,744
Exactly.

542
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,770
Exactly. But the reality is

543
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,390
I cannot run

544
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,030
a single sign on solution.

545
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,469
We don't have the staff to do it and we don't have the budget to do it.

546
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,430
-- That's just the reality,
-- dude.

547
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,530
You, you couldn't run a web server reliably,

548
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,969
let alone something as complicated as an off server.

549
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:19,260
Hey, I could run a web server. I'm confident in my ability to run reliably,

550
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,469
but I didn't say that I said I could run it.

551
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:25,550
-- Right.
-- That's the thing whenever Dev is like, oh, we should blank and I'm like,

552
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,449
so you're gonna wake up at three in the morning to fix it and they're like, oh, right.

553
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,560
Right. Who's on call?

554
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,619
It's like I loved when we talked to Jerry Bell and I even watch him on Master.

555
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,250
He runs Infosec dot Exchange and he was like,

556
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:38,390
at

557
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,510
one point he said, I have learned more

558
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:41,130
about,

559
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,859
like system administration work running Infosec dot Exchange than I did in my,

560
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,500
like, entire 30 plus years of career behind me.

561
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:51,569
And I get that. I totally get that.

562
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,479
There's two things he's at the cutting edge of now

563
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:56,670
is the cutting edge of performance on a budget.

564
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:00,270
-- If you don't have a budget, performance is easy.
-- Exactly. 100. Right.

565
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,920
Yes,

566
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,250
I love all these security people.

567
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,689
They're like, oh, just turn that off and disable this and lock this down.

568
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,819
And I'm like, but I need the computer to, like, do work.

569
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:09,869
Right. And so I can't just

570
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,349
turn off all this crap.

571
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,819
Like,

572
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,939
sorry, every time somebody brings up holding BS D, I'm like, super

573
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,520
duper.

574
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,219
Yes, it's secure by default.

575
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,310
And what does it do by default? It ros packets and listens to,

576
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:23,160
you

577
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,020
have to install a web server and a web framework and a bunch of other stuff that,

578
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,229
that's one of my,

579
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:32,420
one of my favorite things right now is people are going on and on about, oh,

580
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,569
you know, the, the cool thing right now is like containers that are so small,

581
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,739
they have little to no vulnerabilities in them, right?

582
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:41,270
And

583
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,339
functionality. That's cool.

584
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,140
Except as soon as I start installing stuff to actually run my application now,

585
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,719
I'm right back where I was like,

586
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:52,699
this wasn't actually solve a problem. It looks good on paper.

587
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,969
And I, I mean, I think this is,

588
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,780
this is what it just drives me nuts about security people.

589
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:02,800
Is there are a nontrivial number of security people

590
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,390
that do not live in the same world.

591
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,760
The people they're trying to help live in.

592
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,510
It's, and it, it is a disservice to your users.

593
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:14,630
I would actually say the thing, a lot of security people forget

594
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,550
is that security exists to serve the business and the user.

595
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,290
No, I'm serious. And you laugh but

596
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:23,780
security exists.

597
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,209
Business and the user,

598
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,560
-- in theory, we don't,
-- like, let me put it this way.

599
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,069
If I have a choice between the business getting business done

600
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,390
and the business being secure and getting less business done,

601
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,800
I'm going to pick more business with less security.

602
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:36,910
Yeah, 100%.

603
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,420
Look, here's so, here's an honest to God conversation I have on a regular basis,

604
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,979
we could hire a developer who's going to have a focus on upgrading some of

605
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,410
the older packages that we know need to be upgraded and brought up to date

606
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,339
or I can hire a developer to add those features the customer wants.

607
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:57,900
So they'll spend more money with us.

608
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,859
This isn't even a conversation

609
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,410
and that's why

610
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,300
people use

611
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,800
Octa instead of writing it themselves or running it themselves because. Right.

612
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,260
Right.

613
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,540
But now, now here's the thing, here's what I want to say.

614
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:13,229
So it's easy to crap on security people and say like, oh, you don't have,

615
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,729
you don't live in reality, you know what's going on and a lot of them don't,

616
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,780
-- I'm not gonna, I mean, I was one of them for a long time
-- and conversely,

617
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,930
a lot of them do want to do the right thing

618
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:25,109
-- and can't do to budgetary or organizational culture constraints
-- for sure.

619
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,349
But like here's the deal.

620
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,069
So I'm not going to get a developer whose only job is upgrading packages, right?

621
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,229
Never gonna happen.

622
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,000
But what I can do

623
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,040
is I can put together a program that's like, OK,

624
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,459
here's what our current state of our packages looks like.

625
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:43,449
Here are,

626
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,849
here is an order I would like to see us upgrade this

627
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,609
stuff in and I would really like you developers to do,

628
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,810
like, let's say 2 to 5 of these per release

629
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,689
that would make me happy.

630
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,089
And you know what happened?

631
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:57,930
They do it because I'm nice to them

632
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:03,180
and it, it, they know we need to do this, but they also don't want to do it all the time.

633
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:07,800
One argument I've found somewhat successful in

634
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,890
keeping more up to date is that essentially

635
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:16,300
we can keep more up to date more often and have smaller delta, smaller change.

636
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,699
So, if there is a problem, oh, now it's one of these three things,

637
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,489
if we do an update every like two months,

638
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,209
well, crap, something broke. It's one of these 150 changes

639
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,339
-- for sure.
-- And

640
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,780
one of the,

641
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,160
that's one of the very few

642
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,640
usable arguments I've found with people because here's the problem is if you

643
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,449
constantly upgrade you absolutely, 100% will run into problems.

644
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,060
No, here's, here's, that's not, that's not the argument,

645
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:45,160
but

646
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,719
and that's the problem is people make that argument and they're right.

647
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,770
Like, if we constantly upgrade stuff, we're gonna be constantly breaking stuff.

648
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,199
And it's like,

649
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:52,500
yeah, basically. Right.

650
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,219
-- No, no,
-- no, I'm, I'm not suggesting we upgrade at breakneck speed though either.

651
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,780
But my suggestion is

652
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:01,439
is that we create essentially AAA risk.

653
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,280
Like these are the riskier packages.

654
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,959
These are the less because there's obviously things we're using.

655
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,160
-- But
-- the fact that you can say and assign some risk rating to them,

656
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,880
even if it's completely made up

657
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,359
is you're already

658
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,500
-- beyond most places comfortable
-- saying it's at least 70% made up.

659
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:19,430
But the

660
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,790
fact

661
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,300
that

662
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:25,430
like that's the thing that gets me is like if I looked at my webs s bomb,

663
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,839
you know, because it's rails. So it's, there's a, what is it packages dot

664
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,109
json

665
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:29,800
or something

666
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,000
like I, I would look at it and be like, cool, like, I guess I just see which of these was,

667
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:37,849
is kind of the most out of sync and maybe go with that or do a CV scan.

668
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,189
Well, they already do CV scans so we're good there.

669
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,310
But,

670
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:41,839
you know,

671
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,859
like literally the only real argument I can make is

672
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,339
that we can pay the delta cost in incremental pieces.

673
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:47,599
So it's less painful.

674
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,500
Like it's, the paint is smaller but spread out more or like a big chunk once in a while.

675
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:54,160
Right. Right. You know,

676
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:57,949
and then the secondary part of that argument is, and this is, oh,

677
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:00,050
rebooting phones. That was the other thing.

678
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,660
Remember that whole thing about, like,

679
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,949
people being told to reboot their phones to get rid of advanced

680
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,489
persistent threats that can't be gotten rid of any other way.

681
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:07,160
And I,

682
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,390
again,

683
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,150
I suspect it's for two reasons. People keep saying that is number one,

684
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,510
I have said in the past I reboot my service on a regular basis

685
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,670
so that

686
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,969
if there's a problem it's happening on my schedule.

687
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,280
Not, oh, I have to do an emergency reboot crap.

688
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,479
Now,

689
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:22,680
it didn't come up at two in the morning and now

690
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,089
I have to fight with it at two in the morning

691
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,910
versus like, ok, it's three in the afternoon. I'm gonna reboot it.

692
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,329
Now I have some time to deal with it

693
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:30,459
and fix it and, like, find out, oh,

694
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,569
I didn't enable this service or this thing wasn't turned

695
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,219
on or this thing has a type or whatever.

696
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,209
Right. Because, you know, you make changes and things

697
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,285
or whatever. And so I think that's part of it.

698
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:42,244
And then the second thing is especially on mobile devices. Like, what else can I do?

699
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:43,045
Like,

700
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:47,285
II, I sort of could run antivirus on my phone. But do I really trust that stuff?

701
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,625
I mean, it's not like I can pull the hard drive out and scan it.

702
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,734
-- Well, no, no,
-- I mean, look, this has to be

703
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,204
-- seen
-- to be doing something though,

704
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,364
especially if you're a security person being asked to fix a problem,

705
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,939
at least telling the user to reboot their phone.

706
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,569
They're doing something and they're maybe going to

707
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,199
stop yelling at you for five minutes.

708
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,880
I mean,

709
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,760
maybe look, rebooting phones

710
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,000
often works though because a lot of the malware

711
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,260
isn't able to gain that persistence foothold versus so rebooting your phone,

712
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:19,685
like, wipes it out and, and it murders it. So it makes sense in that context.

713
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:20,444
Well, and it's

714
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:26,005
in theory a relatively cheap, low risk security activity,

715
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:31,005
it's not even a low risk security activity. Like rebooting things often fixes them.

716
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:31,635
I mean,

717
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,619
there's like, I love the it crowd has that like,

718
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,119
and he tried turning it off and out again.

719
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,619
That's literally the first thing they say because it's true.

720
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,020
Well,

721
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,790
and the thing I've pointed out to people is rebooting and seeing

722
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,260
if the problem stays or goes away establishes something very solid,

723
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,780
which is, is this

724
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,109
like an ongoing problem or does it like, build up to it?

725
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,300
Like, does it happen after a month or a week

726
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,500
or is it like just if you reboot and is the problem still there? Oh, ok.

727
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:02,180
Now it's something that's like maybe a file got corrupted or

728
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,349
whatever, right? Like it happens,

729
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,739
you know, something got out of sync, whatever.

730
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:07,510
But

731
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,300
I think a lot of this boils down to is we don't have a lot of actual

732
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,140
really effective tools and methodology,

733
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,489
right?

734
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,510
And this is like this is exactly what the cloud security lines has

735
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,660
been working on for 15 years is coming up with methodology and tools

736
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,790
and practices

737
00:29:23,189 --> 00:29:23,619
and

738
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,260
as much as we've done,

739
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,410
there's part of the challenge is things keep changing so much.

740
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,579
That is one of the big challenges.

741
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,910
Yes, like I look at road construction locally right now,

742
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,930
they're using all the GEO blocks so much like 1520 years ago,

743
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:38,920
you never saw a geo block.

744
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,329
So geo blocks are these giant styrofoam blocks

745
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,010
that they use instead of infill

746
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:43,910
because

747
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,030
geo blocks

748
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:48,209
have two really interesting properties is one, they don't compress

749
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,050
because

750
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,949
uh if you go watch a bunch of youtube videos,

751
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,170
it's actually really hard to make a layer of dirt and compact it.

752
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,609
So it doesn't squish more.

753
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,329
And like you get big divots in your road, right?

754
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,209
And number two, they actually, like, they really help prevent against frost e

755
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,579
which is an issue here. Yes, I did hear that as well. Exactly.

756
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,099
And they're relatively cheap and easy to work with.

757
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,359
They're just giant blocks of styrofoam which, you know,

758
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:12,530
anybody can literally pick up and place.

759
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,329
Yeah, they don't weigh much.

760
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,859
And so

761
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,030
like, but we don't have like, God,

762
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,589
we're on like which set of technologies again in the web right now?

763
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,050
Like we're on web three with,

764
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,469
I mean, OK, look,

765
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,869
here's what I'm gonna get on my soapbox here

766
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,530
for a minute and this is completely related to the

767
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,150
training problem we talk about

768
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,449
and there's not enough cybersecurity skills and all this stuff.

769
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,959
If you look at an industry like construction or

770
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:43,079
electricians or plumbers or any of those skilled trades,

771
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,729
especially the skilled trades,

772
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,140
they don't just get to do whatever they feel like doing

773
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,719
right.

774
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:53,520
There are like legal standards they have to follow. There's the guidebooks.

775
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,800
Have you watched a home renovation show where they

776
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,079
fix the problems that the previous person left?

777
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,160
And, but then

778
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:02,545
that's generally not from a contractor.

779
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:06,885
If you pull a building permit, someone is going to come and inspect the work.

780
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:07,814
-- I
-- disagree.

781
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,364
I've seen enough like homes on homes with

782
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,214
new builds that are fully inspected and look,

783
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:15,165
I'm not going to say it's always perfect, but generally speaking,

784
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,000
there are rules and process that have to be followed, right?

785
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,619
-- There are like literal, especially like when we talk about,
-- well,

786
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,930
there's supposed to be inspections,

787
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,780
-- right?
-- II I think large construction projects like roads, for example,

788
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,719
those are, and again,

789
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,579
there's always going to be things that fall through the cracks.

790
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:35,119
There's always going to be issues. I'm not saying there aren't,

791
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,989
but we exist in an industry,

792
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,199
the tech industry where we have virtually no regulation.

793
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,689
We have very few like concrete standards. We have to adhere to,

794
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:51,209
there's minimal like human harm from any of this.

795
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,609
So we generally don't worry about it.

796
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:57,819
Even the standards we have like sock two are kind of, like, everybody knows,

797
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,770
you just hire the auditor that will pass you.

798
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:01,050
I mean, there's some of that

799
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,359
and so we have that conflict of interest aspect as well where we

800
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,209
get to pick who audits us for a lot of these standards.

801
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,770
-- But
-- look, there's lots of people who fail so

802
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,000
too. I mean,

803
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:12,270
and, and let's,

804
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:14,170
even if you pass it,

805
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,290
like PC I,

806
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,420
one of my favorite examples was like every credit

807
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,339
card breach was against a PC I compliant company.

808
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:20,800
Right.

809
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:23,359
-- Well, I mean, the, where else would the data be?
-- Right. Right.

810
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,439
So anyway,

811
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,160
and of course, I'm not saying regulation will fix everything, right.

812
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,119
But I think

813
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,750
we exist in an industry that is

814
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,939
heavily unregulated.

815
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,510
It is, it moves quickly

816
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,180
and there's just honestly chaos all around us and we're

817
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:44,030
doing our best with what we have by far.

818
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,180
One thing that's been coming up more and more recently,

819
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:49,439
especially I've noticed with the whole web three crypto effort.

820
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,349
And now A I

821
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:52,869
is a lot of the larger companies are actively

822
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:57,910
diverting any regulation, they're actively campaigning against any regulation.

823
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,030
Well, of course, they are,

824
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,349
every industry throughout time has always said if you regulate us, we will die,

825
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,910
-- which I think at this point with crypto would be ok.
-- Well, I mean, that one's fine,

826
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,150
that one might because like illegal activity is generally illegal.

827
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,239
But anyway, like my favorite of all time

828
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,640
is the refrigerator industry

829
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:24,599
with the, if you don't let us have these like latching doors that

830
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:27,150
and like, ok, this is actually a perfect example.

831
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,900
I know I brought this up a couple of episodes ago and I'm going to bring it up again.

832
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,229
Right? Refrigerators used to have those like doors that locked from the outside.

833
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,160
And if, if someone got trapped on the inside,

834
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:36,500
they died

835
00:33:36,729 --> 00:33:37,089
because

836
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:37,510
you

837
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,790
couldn't open the door.

838
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:43,189
And now the crazy thing is like, I think it was only like six people died.

839
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:45,829
It's an incredibly small number of people.

840
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,199
And then the regulators were like, fix it.

841
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,530
And the refrigerator industry was like, oh my goodness,

842
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,349
we can't possibly fix this problem.

843
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,380
Like there's nothing we can do. What was us?

844
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,609
And then they were like, oh, we'll just put bag this on the door.

845
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,640
It was quite a bit more than six.

846
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,540
How many was it?

847
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,699
-- Oh,
-- for example,

848
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:07,000
statistics for the 18 months from January 54 to June 56 show that 54 Children

849
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,399
were known to have been trapped in household refrigerators and that 39 of them died.

850
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,554
-- Ok.
-- So, I mean, that's quite,

851
00:34:12,695 --> 00:34:15,425
but still here's the thing. 39 people

852
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:20,543
you think about how many people die on the roads or

853
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:23,625
die in firearm accidents or die in whatever per year,

854
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:24,114
right?

855
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:26,625
But roads are a great example in that the

856
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,554
deaths per passenger mile travel

857
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:33,378
-- has dropped.
-- It has for sure because of regulation

858
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:33,559
seat

859
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:36,178
belts and airbags and all that stuff. Absolutely.

860
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,418
And I mean, that's another easy one. Right.

861
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:42,618
But here's the thing in tech, how many people are we killing? It's not zero.

862
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:45,978
But we don't really know either. And it's probably not a lot. It's,

863
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,947
well, it also depends on your definition of killing. To be blunt.

864
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,083
Are we talking about outright killing or, like, shaving a year off their life?

865
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:54,543
No, it's got to be like, outright death. Right. Like,

866
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,803
I mean, you have to remember before we had

867
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:59,233
like usable pollution regulation,

868
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:02,983
rivers were literally lighting on fire until tech is killing

869
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:05,684
like literally tens of thousands of people per year.

870
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:07,164
No one's gonna care.

871
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:10,964
Well, like, uh how many Tesla deaths

872
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,040
because Tesla self-driving 17 deaths?

873
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,689
That's not enough to matter and they keep blaming the people.

874
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,679
That's the reality of it.

875
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:20,610
And,

876
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,439
but now what's funny is sometimes things work though, like,

877
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,120
do you remember lawn jars cart?

878
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,840
Did you have lawn jars when you were a kid?

879
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:27,520
That

880
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,830
one person died, I think from that and

881
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:30,699
ban them? Yeah.

882
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:34,189
But also like that's a risk to reward ratio of like we're gonna throw this

883
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,939
giant pointed spiky thing up in the air and like stare up at it.

884
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,520
It does feel

885
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:39,600
obvious

886
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:40,209
but

887
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,909
-- still like,
-- well, my favorite thing is this guy wrote

888
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:48,219
uh when uh the Apple smartphones came out and the whole app Store thing came out

889
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,879
and he wrote a game which using the sensor was how

890
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:56,100
throwing your phone in the air for the longest and like Apple put the

891
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,040
on that pretty darn quick.

892
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,699
I get that. Like that's,

893
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:03,120
we all know how that story ends

894
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:03,850
-- and that's
-- a

895
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,310
lot of smashed.

896
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,000
So, anyway,

897
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:06,080
anyway,

898
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,969
let's, let's tie this one all up and bring it back.

899
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:12,659
So, do you think there is a cybersecurity skills shortage? Car?

900
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,219
Yes, there is. Absolutely.

901
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:17,520
-- And I would say
-- yes. But,

902
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:19,120
well, and I was about to say,

903
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,040
but

904
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,889
the challenge is

905
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:22,870
like

906
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,110
there's a lot of other problems. Uh

907
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,489
I don't want to say that come before it, but that are tightly meshed with it. Like

908
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,469
cybersecurity pay uh access to training, access to certification, right?

909
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,790
Like, oh, I switched on security.

910
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,389
Remember tet did about the whole um certificates, blah, blah, blah.

911
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:40,800
And I replied that well,

912
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,629
like good or bad doesn't matter because certificates are the only thing that scales

913
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,750
as far as like cybersecurity training goes like,

914
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,209
yeah, they're not perfect.

915
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:52,340
People cheat and don't know the material and blah, blah, blah. But

916
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,699
the only way,

917
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:54,699
but they're,

918
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,239
they're one of the few things that will work at

919
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,419
a scale of millions or tens of millions of people.

920
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:58,870
Like

921
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,409
mentoring, mentoring is great. Mentoring doesn't scale to a million people,

922
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:03,040
easily.

923
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:03,699
Not,

924
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:04,709
it

925
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,695
kind of can, but it, it, no,

926
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:10,354
it probably does because if you look at like plumbing and electrical.

927
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:11,814
But how do you find mentoring?

928
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:14,794
Well, we'd have to have that whole apprentice system set up.

929
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:18,854
They have an apprentice system. Exactly like that is part of the,

930
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:21,324
the whole structure of that industry.

931
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,844
And in some cases like carpentry in Germany, you have that structure going back

932
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,620
multiple centuries.

933
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,429
Like my cousin in Germany is a proper carpenter and like he has taken place

934
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,540
or he's taken,

935
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,530
uh, he's participated in traditional activities like the VD,

936
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,250
but it's like a 500 year old thing that you do.

937
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,709
And it's like, well, you want to be a carpenter, you gotta do that tough,

938
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,790
you know,

939
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,389
and we have, you know,

940
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:46,139
people actively campaigning against any form of organization or

941
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:49,860
kind of forced, mandatory, required education or anything.

942
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:52,709
-- And I mean,
-- yeah,

943
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:53,800
I don't know

944
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,669
again though, this comes back to

945
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,310
Carol Nichols

946
00:37:58,459 --> 00:37:59,969
who gave that talk

947
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:05,209
on the railroad safety brakes, the air brakes took 80 years,

948
00:38:05,729 --> 00:38:10,270
-- 80 years to get there.
-- Well, and we still have, for example, now in Canada

949
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:12,600
where they had to pass some new regulations saying you couldn't leave

950
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,929
them like open to move the trains and stuff that you actually

951
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,739
um we had a problem with some runaway trains where they were like

952
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,370
leaving the train parked overnight and not getting the air brakes on,

953
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:21,010
man.

954
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:21,810
Yeah,

955
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,340
so like you have to engage their breaks now,

956
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,010
but of course the people working are like,

957
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:27,429
but our bosses are saying you have to do

958
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,199
this much work and get this stuff done quickly.

959
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:32,590
And if we do it properly safely. We, we can't get the work done

960
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:37,239
and we get yelled at or not paid or whatever. You know, it's like when you find out,

961
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:40,709
when do you think airline crews start getting paid?

962
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,129
Oh, it's when the door shuts.

963
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:44,879
Actually, I think the flight attendants got that fixed. Right.

964
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,010
I don't think so.

965
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:46,610
No,

966
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,409
-- not
-- sad.

967
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,689
-- But yeah, it's like when the door is shut and then like,
-- yeah, I know.

968
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,600
That's embarrassing. That makes me angry.

969
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,129
Like those poor people.

970
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:56,949
I'm pretty sure, like, if they're standing on the plane telling you where to go,

971
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,899
that counts as work.

972
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:02,239
I agree. Like, not just that. Have you watched people board an airplane?

973
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,129
Holy crap. I like,

974
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,250
-- oh, my goodness. I would,
-- it's been a while but I imagine it's worse.

975
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,120
I would rather be a school teacher

976
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,949
with Children than help people board an airplane.

977
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,469
And I would be a very bad school teacher. Like, that's all I have to say to that.

978
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:16,830
Yeah, for real?

979
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,129
Oh, my goodness. Just

980
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:21,830
never before in my life have I wanted to, like,

981
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,840
stand up and yell at people more than watching people board an airplane car.

982
00:39:24,979 --> 00:39:25,350
Like,

983
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:27,379
-- uh, anyway, I'm not going to get into that.
-- Now.

984
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,110
My favorite is when they try and, like,

985
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,830
jam m, like, it's just, you gotta check your luggage. Like, I know it sucks.

986
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,030
And it's scary to check your luggage.

987
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,629
But, like, come on, you can't be bringing three pieces on board. Sure.

988
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,649
I, I'm not getting into this now because I could,

989
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,080
I could have a multi hour podcast of me ranting

990
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,750
about people boarding airplanes and I'm not gonna do it,

991
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,260
but

992
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,830
I think we're gonna call this one.

00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,290
