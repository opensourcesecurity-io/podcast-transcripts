Hello and welcome to the open source podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,359
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Extemporaneous podcasting.

2
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,010
-- Josh Bresser. We're
-- the open

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,310
source security pod.

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:15,930
You said the open

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,229
source podcast?

6
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:20,239
-- Oh,
-- whoops. I missed a word. Oh, you know what the stack?

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,979
My, my, I literally put a new word in the stack and it popped off an old one.

8
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:27,799
You filled your brain up and now one of the old words had to leave.

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:28,930
-- Which word was
-- that again?

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,250
The most important word of the name,

11
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:38,049
security, the open source Security podcast.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,930
Sorry.

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,500
That's one of my favorite scenes from the ticket

14
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,849
is where the one guy gets electrocuted so much.

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,909
The other guy is like, you know, we're, we're worried about Dave because

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,520
he, he doesn't know about Tuesdays anymore.

17
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,930
Like he's, he's lost the concept of Tuesday.

18
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:52,830
She was like, oh, you'll be

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,040
fine.

20
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:55,520
-- Yeah,
-- that's, that feels like

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,849
-- right now.
-- Oh

22
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:57,880
my God. Yes.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,360
Anyway,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,930
I'm happy to say

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,930
our topic today is not log for Jay.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,569
We might talk about it a little bit but fundamentally not log for Jay.

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,410
I'm very excited.

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,519
-- So, what are we talking about? Kurt?
-- Will there ever be

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,279
no security vulnerabilities.

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,029
The answer is no. Thanks for listening. Everyone.

31
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:19,410
-- Pretty
-- much. That's the show.

32
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,370
Unless you're willing to wait for the heat, death of the universe

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,440
-- anyway.
-- No, no.

34
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:28,349
II I, so there was a question posted to Reddit I found, oh,

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,930
it's been a couple of days I think.

36
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:30,639
And

37
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,870
the person asked it a legitimate and honest question of basically,

38
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,650
will we ever fix all the security vulnerabilities be it?

39
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,690
We have better technologies or whatever, right?

40
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,819
And I remember getting asked this 20 years ago when they were like, oh,

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,169
you're in security, what are you going to do when all the security bones were fixed?

42
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,970
And I was just like,

43
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,290
uh

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,760
I've never had that.

45
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:48,900
But anyway, it,

46
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,019
Kurt and I started chatting about it a little bit and I thought this is

47
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,419
a really good topic because I think there's kind of two pieces to it.

48
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,620
There's the, the part where you just

49
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,660
answer the question of why the answer is no.

50
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:03,019
And anyone in the industry says no laughs and then moves on.

51
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,729
But then also there's the question of how do you talk about this to a normal person?

52
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,949
Because I think this is actually a lot harder to answer than any of us think it is.

53
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:15,910
Well, and also to not to invoke the COVID pandemic.

54
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,610
But all the, all the research on messaging shows,

55
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,190
you can't just show people the bad news, you have to show them some hope or good news.

56
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,250
So the example

57
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:27,070
with COVID is like, here's what's going to happen with COVID rates

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,559
and if we mask

59
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,250
it will be X and better and if we mask and vaccinate, it will be even better.

60
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:32,990
And if we, you know what I mean?

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,529
Like here's a bunch of scenarios where the line doesn't

62
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,750
go shooting up into the right and things are better.

63
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,910
And I think that's part of the challenge here is like, ok, so you're saying

64
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:44,220
there will never be no security vulnerabilities? Cool.

65
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,940
So, like, thanks for the bad news. Moving along.

66
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,960
Yeah. Now what, like, yeah, exactly. Now what

67
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:49,940
and

68
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,600
-- why am I paying you? Yeah.
-- Right.

69
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,470
And so, but what, what good news or what hope can we offer them?

70
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,880
And the one thing I always come back to is like, look, I, as much as,

71
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,330
as bad as the security, like, for example, we had not

72
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:04,279
pia and that was by far one of the worst cyberattacks ever.

73
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,949
Like, it shut down entire companies, big companies like Maersk,

74
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,070
hold on, hold on.

75
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
Which, which one was that?

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,089
Not Petya

77
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,380
was the one where the Russian government infiltrated the Ukrainian

78
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,559
accounting firm and they wanted to basically target Ukrainian firms,

79
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,089
but it escaped outside of Ukraine and went Rawle

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,600
stomping through a bunch of unpatched networks.

81
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,119
Yeah, I would point out as bad as that stuff is,

82
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,240
like,

83
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,720
fundamentally the world is still chugging along working,

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,160
you know.

85
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,330
So it's it's like this log for G thing.

86
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,639
Everybody's like, oh, it's the end of the world.

87
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,860
It is the worst vulnerability in 20 years and it

88
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:38,039
is the worst vulnerability probably in 20 years and yet,

89
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,940
-- like, things are still here.
-- Christmas happened.

90
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,339
Yeah.

91
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:45,080
And so I think that's part of it is offering that, that, you know, uh,

92
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,240
like when they opened up Pandora's box, what, you know, what was the last thing that,

93
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,070
to come out of it?

94
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,240
Well, that didn't come out,

95
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:54,279
hope, didn't get out, hope was still in the box

96
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,039
-- anyway.
-- So

97
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:57,179
as, as quote

98
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,929
unquote, bad as things are it,

99
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,100
it's not the end of the world bad.

100
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,820
No, I, I agree. I agree. But, but that's not the point of the question.

101
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,339
The point of the question is,

102
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,330
will we ever have no security vulnerabilities

103
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,039
in

104
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,210
software?

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,850
But what I'm saying is that supposes that the question itself is correct and

106
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,570
useful and I'm not sure that the question is actually all that useful.

107
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,380
It doesn't matter. That's not the point.

108
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,980
The point is someone is going to ask the question and we have to answer it

109
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,019
and your rambling answer, but not p

110
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,320
you

111
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,350
isn't going to fly with normal people.

112
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,089
-- So,
-- well, my short answer is basically no,

113
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,559
there will always be security vulnerabilities

114
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,730
and that's ok because everything in life

115
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,890
has sort of these problems, you know, roads are never perfect.

116
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,260
The health care system is never, you know,

117
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,970
everybody's not healthy at any time in point.

118
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,989
-- And, and that's ok. You know, life goes on.
-- I think you're on the right path. But

119
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,929
I think the difference is

120
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,799
we understand roads, we understand you build a road and then

121
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:56,929
it's used by traffic

122
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,269
-- and there's free star cycles in certain places
-- and

123
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:00,459
put

124
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:01,279
salt on it and

125
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,170
it

126
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,910
makes everything better.

127
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,100
You know what I mean? And so we, we get that, we understand what that means.

128
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,519
But when we talk about security,

129
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,760
I think there's a lot of unknowns. I think it's an industry.

130
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,720
We've often not done a great job of explaining what's happening.

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,730
And I think to normal people they just think

132
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,899
-- why is, why can't you make it better? What is wrong with you?
-- Yeah.

133
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,160
Like, why can't you make a baby stroller that actually works or why can't you? Yeah.

134
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:28,829
No, I agree.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,260
And

136
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,299
I, I think there's a number of things to consider. I think on, on one hand,

137
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,239
this is a very immature industry.

138
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,380
I mean, security really has only been a thing for what, like, kind of 20 years ish.

139
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,540
I mean, really?

140
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,720
Well, yeah, I mean, you look at the car companies, right?

141
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,390
And they weren't shamed into safety until the fifties and sixties.

142
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,109
Yeah, they exist

143
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,404
for almost 50 years before things actually started to get, like,

144
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,954
safer in that regard.

145
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:53,345
I mean,

146
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:56,904
you can almost view, uh, just technology in general.

147
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:59,605
I mean, think about the last 50 years of technology. I think

148
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:03,695
we've made enormous leaps and bounds and maybe it's time to start saying, ok,

149
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:05,494
we've made all this progress.

150
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,304
Maybe we need to start taking safety more seriously as part of these discussions,

151
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,424
which we're still not.

152
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:12,454
The problem is if a company starts to

153
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,924
take safety more seriously and slows down their future

154
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,524
sort of count and their future deployment,

155
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,510
a competitor won't

156
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,559
that competitor will eat their lunch.

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,440
And the market has shown consistently that

158
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:29,429
they, they will prize features over safety

159
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:34,570
outside of like three niche niche corner cases that basically don't matter.

160
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,369
That's right.

161
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,489
And I think you can,

162
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:39,950
the auto industry is a lovely parallel because I

163
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,130
think if you look at the auto industry,

164
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,529
this was completely true. If you would have said,

165
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,070
ok, I'm going to put seatbelts in my car,

166
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,890
but it's going to cost $1000 more because of all these seatbelts.

167
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,359
-- I'm putting in
-- it, not even $1000 more.

168
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,779
It's going to slow down the production of the car by a week.

169
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,390
Uh Sure, whatever you get, you get the idea though, right?

170
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,549
And the competitors like, no, I'm not doing that

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,570
and then

172
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,059
the consumer is going to show up.

173
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,320
And I mean, it's historically been proven time and time again

174
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,649
that price price drives consumers

175
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,700
-- in, in most situations
-- and safety behavior, right?

176
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,119
There's those us congressional hearings of people essentially saying, you know,

177
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,399
seatbelt mandates and laws are un American and the death of freedom as we know it.

178
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,239
That's right. That's right.

179
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:20,609
Like I,

180
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:24,000
I keep coming back to that seatbelt compliance chart of

181
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,679
numbers and it's nowhere near 100% in some cases.

182
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,739
It's like 40 or 50%.

183
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,779
That's right. That's right.

184
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,920
And now I think, let's frame this in another way. If we ask the question,

185
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,260
will we ever solve car accidents?

186
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,660
Uh, no, not collisions?

187
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,480
Ok. Whatever

188
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,980
the word matters.

189
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,899
Ok. Fine.

190
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,010
Let's say, will we ever solve collisions?

191
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:49,339
And I think even if we have computers driving our cars,

192
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,890
it isn't going to be zero,

193
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,940
we can make it a lot less, but it won't be zero.

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,450
Well,

195
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,070
but also cars now I love that people get in car accident

196
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,019
and complain about how much it costs to fix their car.

197
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,329
And I'm like, yeah, but you're fine. Right.

198
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:02,179
And they're like, yeah, I'm like dad,

199
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,429
exactly that $5000 bumper that ate all that impact

200
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:10,790
-- and you don't even have whiplash.
-- Right. Right. Exactly. And so I think this is,

201
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,619
this is a conversation about security and I think this

202
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,170
is how you can talk to normal people about it

203
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,209
is that

204
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,450
if you look at the industry,

205
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,660
we have a complete lack of regulation for the most

206
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,779
part and it's coming in some places I think,

207
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,730
and, and I also think we have to be careful because,

208
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,150
I mean, we talked to what the, the, the person from the R Street Institute.

209
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,570
Um, I don't remember her name now, but anyway, basically, like,

210
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,440
too much regulation is bad, too little regulation is bad.

211
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,760
-- And so it's really hard,
-- also bad, regulation is bad.

212
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,010
-- Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly. That

213
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,859
and,

214
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,159
and so while I always say, oh, I think regulation can help here,

215
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,390
I'm also very aware that there is,

216
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,679
you could make things much worse.

217
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,330
And so it was Catherine Walden.

218
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,169
And so a perfect example of this regulation making things worse. GDPR.

219
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,559
Like GDPR has objectively made the web worse with the cookie pop ups.

220
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,969
Is that GDPR though?

221
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,010
Yeah, the cookie stuff, the cookie warnings, I thought that was GDPR.

222
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,400
-- I don't know, but the cookies are stupid
-- anyway, the cookie stuff is garbage.

223
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,450
It's completely worth it.

224
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,239
And here's the thing, somebody pointed out to me,

225
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,919
all the massive companies like Facebook and linkedin, they

226
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,090
didn't care about GDPR. They were fine with it.

227
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,450
-- Well, yeah,
-- because they know how to get

228
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,919
around it.

229
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,890
Well, they have that, you know, automated systems in place.

230
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,840
And so the fact that

231
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,739
ostensibly what the companies that were supposed to

232
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,219
be targeted by GDPR are kind of like,

233
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:35,429
cool.

234
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,929
We don't, it doesn't scare us.

235
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,960
GDPR is not good regulation, in my opinion.

236
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,750
I mean,

237
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,179
it

238
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,390
primarily

239
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,229
raises the bar and punishes small and medium

240
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:49,200
sized firms with this just extremely expensive.

241
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:54,549
Like I know at the CS A it costs us well into the five figures to be GDPR. Compliance

242
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,859
and a lot of it is stuff we would have done anyway because like, Qantas,

243
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,440
we don't really want your data, but everyone knows this

244
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,059
and, and that's part of the problem though is, is

245
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,909
you're gonna get regulation.

246
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,510
Well, who's going to fund the lobbyists that will help craft it?

247
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,890
Well, the large companies, the companies with a vested interest in making sure

248
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,169
you want

249
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,270
to talk about regulation. I'm pulling us out of this hole. No more.

250
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,159
Talk of regulation.

251
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,909
The point is that

252
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:20,140
if we compare this all to the auto industry, right?

253
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:21,309
It is.

254
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,859
I think,

255
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,640
I think a lot of people can understand kind of what is going on where we are on the path.

256
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,549
We've made amazing progress with the technology.

257
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,510
And I think

258
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,679
a lot of security has been trying really hard,

259
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,469
like we're running as fast as we can in most cases and we still

260
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:39,210
can't quite keep up because I think everything is moving so very fast.

261
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:42,390
And even when security does keep up though, you have to deal with the users, you know,

262
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,710
that uh the thing with Google

263
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:47,969
deploying two factor authentication and forcing people into it.

264
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,359
And people are like, oh my God, no. And it's like, well,

265
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,119
you, you can't have it both ways.

266
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Like if you want security, you can't rely on a user name and password. It just

267
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,159
like

268
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,520
the,

269
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,809
the what is it like eight or 12 or how many

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,809
of our billions of records and have I been pawned?

271
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,909
I think sort of would have put the password, argument to rest by now, but

272
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,940
-- apparently
-- not.

273
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,500
But, but again, this is normal people, normal people don't really care. I mean,

274
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:16,635
I think even today, if there was a car for $10,000 less expensive with no seatbelts,

275
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:17,875
I think people would buy it.

276
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:18,755
I really do

277
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:21,655
because most people would be like, hey, I've never been in an accident.

278
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:25,075
I'll probably be ok, except the one time you really need them.

279
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,044
You know,

280
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:26,674
it's,

281
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,234
well, even simpler.

282
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,434
Given a choice between,

283
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,635
would you like the product now or would you like the product

284
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:38,114
later with it being a bit more quote unquote safe or worse?

285
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,155
Would you be willing to give up features for safety and security?

286
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,229
And most people would not be willing to give up features

287
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,830
people.

288
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:49,250
But, but I think this is, so this is part of the problem is you pose this question

289
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:55,380
and everyone knows the correct answer is I would definitely pick the safe option.

290
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,510
I would definitely pick the more expensive option because it's safer. Right.

291
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,390
And I, I even want to say that in my head,

292
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,250
but

293
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,570
I think when, when the rubber meets the road

294
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,739
it's different and there's a lot of people

295
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,650
who don't understand any of this stuff either.

296
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
And you know what I mean?

297
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,739
And so I think that's, will we ever fix all the security vulnerabilities?

298
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,799
-- Obviously not
-- Well,

299
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,510
a really simple example of this is how

300
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,969
many people don't have carbon monoxide detectors.

301
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,169
It's more than zero.

302
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,559
And what's interesting is

303
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,159
when I, when I got my new furnace in AC and they did the virtual inspection remotely,

304
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:28,940
like using um,

305
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,280
some video app,

306
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,299
one of the things they checked was I had to have a carbon monoxide detector

307
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,669
that's required now and I, I for sure that didn't used to be required that,

308
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,500
that changed at some point in the last few years.

309
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,599
And so something as simple as a $20 carbon monoxide detector.

310
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:48,510
And yet how many people don't have one? I, I honestly don't know. I assume a lot.

311
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,909
Now, I will say when I got a bunch of

312
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,710
electrical work done in my house,

313
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,270
I had them install those magic smoke detectors that are like,

314
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,340
all connected and they all go off at the same time

315
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,309
and I had them put too many carbon

316
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,369
monoxide detectors in because the electricians were like,

317
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,429
oh, you don't need this many.

318
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,950
And I was like, yes, I do.

319
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,719
But again, like, we're talking a couple of 100 bucks. Right.

320
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,299
-- Which for
-- a lot of people is,

321
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:08,510
I

322
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,909
know

323
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,869
they don't have a couple 100 bucks

324
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,840
on fixing their car.

325
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,349
Yeah. Right. Right.

326
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:16,559
And, and

327
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:16,770
I,

328
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,549
I think that that is kind of the discussion and

329
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,409
that is where the whole security aspect comes in,

330
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,700
I think as well is

331
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,469
every organization on the planet has a limited budget?

332
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you going to take your limited budget?

333
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,840
And are you going to spend it on security something

334
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,820
or are you going to add a feature that

335
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,359
will get you another sale that will increase your budget

336
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,380
well and worse. It's not just the money but the time, the time constraint,

337
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,299
you know, it's, it's not only does the safety feature take you time,

338
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,929
but that gives you your competitor time to push out that feature though.

339
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,799
Ok. Now let's change the conversation.

340
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,099
Let's say there's regulation that says you have to

341
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,640
add a reasonable amount of security to your products.

342
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,080
And let's say that starts happening.

343
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,460
Now, why aren't we, why are there still security vulnerabilities at that point?

344
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:08,590
So part of it is the industry is changing

345
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,940
and evolving so rapidly.

346
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,140
And I mean, fundamentally

347
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,719
the closest I could say it's like if the building

348
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,890
industry came up with new building materials every six months.

349
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,820
And I don't mean like a new type of brick, I mean, a fundamentally new substance.

350
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,979
You are correct.

351
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,530
But let's say we were still, let's say we freeze all the technology and and

352
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,219
we say no new technology,

353
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,599
no new technology, right? You don't have to worry about anything new.

354
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,000
We can spend all of our time fixing what we have.

355
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,780
We still couldn't get rid of all the security vulnerabilities.

356
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,969
I would say arguably that would be worse because then you

357
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,739
have this massive technical debt like as we've seen with say,

358
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,039
Rust and sea.

359
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,020
Let me put it this way. What, what do you think will,

360
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,609
what is more realistic taking all the sea

361
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:55,049
code and fixing the buffer overflows in it or rewriting that entire

362
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,299
-- pile of fire in rust in a memory safe language?
-- Rephrase this.

363
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:03,890
Let's say we have a computer language with no memory safety

364
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,000
issues with no temporary file issues with no escaping issues.

365
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,250
There would still be vulnerabilities

366
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,630
in the code humans. Right.

367
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,979
Well, and that's assuming also the specification and the, the, the,

368
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,340
the fundamental architectural ideas are correct.

369
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:19,580
Right.

370
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,739
That's well perfect. Like again,

371
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,690
all the hardware vulnerabilities in Intel many years

372
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,619
ago were because of all of that,

373
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:31,299
you know, in insanely cool Magic Intel did to make the CP us faster

374
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,179
and uh turns out there were security implications.

375
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,219
Right. Right.

376
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,320
Well, everyone knew this was always going to be possible.

377
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,679
We just figured you couldn't do it remotely so no one cared

378
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,559
and then they figured out how to do it over the network and we were all like, well,

379
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,429
crap,

380
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,020
roll hammer and whatnot.

381
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,830
So here is, here is the point to all of this I think

382
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,539
is

383
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,479
today,

384
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,489
human beings build software

385
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,599
and any time a human is involved,

386
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,880
they're going to make mistakes. It doesn't matter what it is.

387
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,539
This is true of building cars and building houses of cooking meals,

388
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,979
everything human beings make mistakes.

389
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,619
And so as long as human beings create software.

390
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,559
There are going to be security problems in the software

391
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,000
-- like that is basically the answer
-- at a minimum.

392
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,750
When you build a bridge,

393
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,340
you have the idea that it should carry this load without falling down.

394
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,109
We don't have that concept for most software.

395
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,599
-- What does not
-- falling down mean for software,

396
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,260
it doesn't matter. We don't care.

397
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:38,210
I, I think,

398
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:43,309
I, I think claiming the, the quality argument on software is a nonstarter

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,260
because

400
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,700
-- quality,
-- what I'm saying is we can't even define quality, let alone measure it.

401
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,309
How would you, I mean, I mean, that's what I'm saying, right? Like how,

402
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,419
how do you,

403
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,440
how do you define security

404
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:56,599
in software?

405
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,200
It does what it's supposed to do.

406
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,270
-- Well, that's what J and D I and log for J were doing.
-- I mean, in that particular case.

407
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,329
Yes. And, and again, though that comes back to humans, I think humans are

408
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,280
you, even if the humans aren't

409
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,130
building the software itself,

410
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,969
you're going to have a human architecting it somewhere

411
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,300
like humans are fundamentally the problem in this story.

412
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,660
Well,

413
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,358
and I think part of it is we need better

414
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,719
feedback loops so that when a problem is spotted,

415
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:20,380
is this

416
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,180
like a small one off problem or is this problem

417
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,260
an endemic systemic,

418
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,020
you know, is basically, is this piece of wood rot,

419
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,000
just a little piece of wood rot or do I have a leak in the roof?

420
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,699
-- And I need a new roof for my house.
-- You got to tear it apart to find out. Well, exactly.

421
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,130
That's one of the problems.

422
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,540
I mean, it,

423
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,949
I, I feel like we haven't answered this question.

424
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,030
I, I think this is so hard to answer

425
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,089
that we can't even do it and we keep going off

426
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,780
into these weird little nooks and crannies of the actual problem.

427
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,189
Perfect example. I found a mystery puddle of water in my basement the other day.

428
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,670
That's terrifying. I know.

429
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,099
I'm pretty sure I know what it is. It's, uh, related to the bathroom fan and whatnot.

430
00:17:59,109 --> 00:17:59,910
But the point is,

431
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,290
does it matter in the sense of, do I need a house? That's perfect.

432
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,579
No, I have a house that has problems and as they kind of crop up we fix them,

433
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,569
well, every house has problems, you know, we had cracks in the foundation fixed

434
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,979
like

435
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,959
it's just what happens. Right. Stuff settles over 4050 years.

436
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:22,819
And so you ji I think it's some epoxy stuff gets jammed into the crack and well,

437
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:23,839
no more water leaks

438
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,630
and, and that's kind of how software is, is, it's ok to have these vulnerabilities

439
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,709
as long as we have some process for sort of dealing with them.

440
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:36,829
I mean, or, and you can choose to just to simply ignore them

441
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,849
that probably won't be so ideal long term. But

442
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:40,829
again,

443
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,010
how many, you know,

444
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,199
dry cleaners are there with a doss box running

445
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,359
their point of sale system still more than one.

446
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,439
Yeah, there are.

447
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,449
And in fairness they'd be much better off going to, like,

448
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:53,069
a square tablet and getting, you know, a whole bunch of new features and, like,

449
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,310
automatically emailing you when your dry cleaning is done.

450
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,109
Except that doesn't manage all the dry cleaning. I bet.

451
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:01,900
Well, you know what I'm saying? Right. There's, there's some probably real

452
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,189
anyways. The point is

453
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,859
infrastructure doesn't have to be perfect. Like,

454
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,510
as much as, ok,

455
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,540
I don't want bridges to fall down because generally people die when that happens.

456
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,010
Having potholes in the road is not the end of the world.

457
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:16,609
It's not ideal but it's not the end of the world.

458
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,109
I think it's expected

459
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,770
in my climate. Yes.

460
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:24,189
I think anyone anywhere recognizes roads will have potholes.

461
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,680
That's just how roads work.

462
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,270
But the problem is

463
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,930
in the security space,

464
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:34,439
what is a pothole and what is a gaping hole of, of lava?

465
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:35,699
Well, and more the point,

466
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,900
I think in the security space we treat everything like an airport runway and that it,

467
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:43,170
no, most things are not airport runways, they're just regular roads that, you know,

468
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,560
you can bounce around on a bit.

469
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:49,209
I mean, kind of, I, I don't, I don't think you're wrong.

470
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,170
It's,

471
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,650
but, but again, the question was,

472
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,930
will we ever fix all the security vulnerabilities?

473
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:58,170
And I think we're dancing around the answer because I think it's, it's really,

474
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,130
really hard to answer.

475
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,449
Well, like I said, I'm not sure. Well, it, I

476
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,369
think the answer is obviously no, based on the last 50 years

477
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:07,569
and we know that,

478
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,250
but

479
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,709
I also think that it's just, it's not that important.

480
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,800
Well,

481
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,709
I think what is important is, is I hate to use this term, but risk management.

482
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,949
-- I mean,
-- yes, that's exactly right. It's,

483
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,510
it's kind of like

484
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,390
how you inspect a bridge is different than how

485
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,680
you inspect the road in front of my house.

486
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:26,569
And it should be

487
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,349
because if the road in front of my house fails,

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,199
it doesn't really matter.

489
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,469
Right. What, what, what does that even mean? How would it fail? A big, big pothole?

490
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:34,780
Maybe

491
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,010
we had a big sinkhole in one intersection that's

492
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,719
-- taken forever to fix and
-- it's a cone in

493
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:38,979
it.

494
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,969
We're good enough for now

495
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,579
and, and in the su world, I, I think so part of this discussion now,

496
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,250
I think kind of brings us into,

497
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,780
we don't have a good way to even talk about a lot of these issues.

498
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,359
Like log for J is a great example. Right?

499
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,609
Where, what the fourth log for jcbe that just came out a little while ago.

500
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,609
The fourth one is like a complete trash CV E. It shouldn't have been a sign.

501
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,770
It's not a real problem,

502
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:05,329
but you end up in this situation where no one knows what's going on.

503
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,189
We're all just running around with hair on fire and it's really hard to communicate.

504
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:12,130
Like this doesn't matter, go, everyone go back to eating, you know,

505
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,209
turkey or whatever.

506
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,939
But, but we, we, we can't do that.

507
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,430
And so I think that's part of the

508
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,619
challenge is the only time people hear about security

509
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,859
is when it's on fire and it feels like it's on fire all the freaking time now.

510
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:26,739
Survivor bias. Right. And,

511
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,520
yeah. Yeah. I, I think part of this speaks to having better data

512
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:34,229
in that really one thing I keep coming back to is how big is this.

513
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,479
And I don't need a specific number.

514
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:39,680
I just want to know within two or three orders of magnitude.

515
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,560
Like for example,

516
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,510
how many remote code execution flaws do you think

517
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,060
there are in the Linux kernel right now?

518
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,880
You know, 1000 million a billion,

519
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:48,280
we'll never know.

520
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,959
But it's, it's not one.

521
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,349
Yeah, it's more than one, probably less than a trillion,

522
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,500
hopefully somewhere in the middle,

523
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,650
but more useful would be, you know, I,

524
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,150
I remember one of the colonel de saying basically

525
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,930
they wanted to get better cwe data on defining,

526
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:01,109
you know,

527
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,310
memory flaws because there were some old

528
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,560
memory kind of management patterns that are

529
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,390
dangerous, but he can't prove that they're dangerous and get people to fix them,

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,329
right.

531
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:11,829
You know,

532
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,119
he can't get people to spend the time and effort fixing

533
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,989
it because he can basically say like it's probably dangerous.

534
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,380
But, you know, if he had some actual data,

535
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,189
you know, if we fix this now,

536
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,890
it'll save us this much down the road of emergency response.

537
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,599
People would probably be

538
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,930
more willing to do. So,

539
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,969
maybe that one, that one's still pretty hard to push.

540
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:33,369
I think, I think prevention is, well, we all know it's better.

541
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,939
It's, it doesn't matter, the industry, it's always difficult for prevention.

542
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:37,640
-- I mean,
-- and that's

543
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,550
why I suspect long term the better option,

544
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,910
for example is to get all the drivers in the LS kernel rewritten and rust,

545
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,489
I mean. Sure. Right.

546
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,750
It's, it's the same way how we solve drunk driving and burning red lights

547
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,800
with self driving cars

548
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:52,890
that obey the law.

549
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,280
You know, I love that. Google.

550
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,630
Everybody's like, oh google cars keep getting rear ended.

551
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,819
They must not be safe and it's like, no,

552
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:00,839
because they actually report every accident.

553
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,719
Whereas humans are like,

554
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,050
-- you, you sort of just dinged me. No
-- biggie.

555
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,130
Oh man. When I owned a pickup truck and I didn't care what it looked like.

556
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,359
I got it every now and then I get rear ended by someone.

557
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,890
It's like, eh, I don't care, we're fine,

558
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,349
you know, like

559
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,160
it didn't, I didn't care. I didn't want their insurance to go up.

560
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,140
I don't want my insurance to go up. There was my, my truck was fine.

561
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,369
Their car was all messed up, but it's like, who cares? Like, not my problem.

562
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,540
It's always weird like that. It was always when I was sitting at like a stop sign

563
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,380
every time I've been rear ended at a red light or a stop sign or I got a yield sign.

564
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:32,540
I've never understood that. Well, I know it.

565
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,130
They're looking at their cell phones but

566
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:35,579
let's face it

567
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,930
anyway. Anyway.

568
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,380
Ok, we're,

569
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,069
I, I feel like we've come near an answer to this, but

570
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,280
I don't think we're, we're there yet.

571
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,199
And I think this is part of the problem with our industry is

572
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,339
I think if you asked

573
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:53,250
a, a civil engineer

574
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,810
to explain failure,

575
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,229
they would have no trouble doing it because

576
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,989
they have literally thousands of years of failure

577
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,020
that they can draw

578
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,250
well defined in the.

579
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,589
See, the problem is when software fails, it doesn't fall down.

580
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,670
It just like you restart the system.

581
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,910
-- I mean,
-- sometimes and, and we're also conditioned to say, turn it off,

582
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,739
turn it back on again.

583
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,829
I mean, this happens

584
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:16,310
all the time.

585
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:17,349
It works.

586
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,430
Yeah, it does.

587
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:22,989
And it's hilarious because my, my kids, actually, my, my daughter was,

588
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,800
I think it was, she wanted to use, we have an Oculus something or other VR headset.

589
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,810
I, it, it, the rift. I think it's a rift

590
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,709
anyway.

591
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,520
She says, oh, it's not working dad. I said, did you restart the computer?

592
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,599
No, go restart it and come back and talk to me if it doesn't work.

593
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,920
And then an hour later I'm like, did it work? She's like, oh, yeah, it worked fine,

594
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,079
you know, what I mean?

595
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,640
I mean,

596
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,079
you can't do that with a building.

597
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,729
You can't be like, oh, the building fell down, turn it off, turn it back on again.

598
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,180
Like, no, it fell down. That, that's all we're done now.

599
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,979
You know, I, I think that's a good point.

600
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:55,089
I, I think it changes the way we think of this, which makes

601
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:57,540
explaining this problem even harder,

602
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,030
which means when we talk about will we ever fix all security vulnerabilities?

603
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,939
We think of it in the context of turn it off and turn it back on again.

604
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,920
And it's, this is, this is a problem closer to buildings collapsing,

605
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,400
not to turn off the computer and make the VR headset work.

606
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:13,560
Yeah.

607
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,910
All right. I, I feel like

608
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,229
I feel like we've made progress.

609
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:18,300
I,

610
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,130
I was really excited about this one because I knew that we

611
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,849
were going to end in a strange place that I hadn't imagined.

612
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,050
And II, I think we're there.

613
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,880
I, I'm feeling better about this, this answer now a little bit.

614
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,329
I think,

615
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:32,939
I think here's how I want to think about this and here's what I want to add on is I

616
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,469
think the point of all this is if we think

617
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:38,310
about it in the context of let's say other engineering,

618
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,800
be it a mechanical engineer or a civil engineer

619
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,050
or even an electrical engineer to a degree,

620
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,569
you make a thing

621
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,170
and that thing has an expected lifespan, right? We don't have that in software.

622
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,699
So let's say I build a bridge, the bridge has an expected lifespan.

623
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,229
And what happens is during the life of it, it's going to be inspected for

624
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,640
problems because there could be an issue with how it was built.

625
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:02,819
And we know

626
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,640
we had a bridge that was repainted improperly and started rusting right away.

627
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:09,060
It's now been a court case for 15 years

628
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,479
-- and
-- so, but, but we, we know what to look for.

629
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,229
We don't know what to look for in software today.

630
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,000
I think that's something we have to start to figure out

631
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:19,550
and saying it's impossible is ridiculous. It's not impossible.

632
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,890
We just don't know how to do it yet. It's the problem.

633
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,790
So you had the ability to inspect things and as you inspect it,

634
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:29,469
you're, you recognize that there are expected wear and tear,

635
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,550
there is expected failures along the way, right?

636
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,260
Like bridges are gonna get potholes, bridge, you know. And so

637
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:41,729
you end up in this place that we know how to inspect this thing. We ha it has a life.

638
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,010
We know when it's co coming to the end of its life

639
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,079
and then something near the end of its life.

640
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:49,290
And now you have decisions, you can often repair

641
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,680
the original, which has a cost,

642
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,660
you can tear it down and build a new one which has

643
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,160
another cost or you could do nothing and suffer catastrophic failure.

644
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,410
Right?

645
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,010
And I think in the world of software we've often chosen,

646
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,050
do nothing and suffer catastrophic failure.

647
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,849
Well, I think in the world of software you often don't have any other choice.

648
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:07,489
I mean,

649
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,689
-- sometimes you don't.
-- Right.

650
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:14,219
Because, well, I, I, one thing I really feel for is all these government,

651
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:17,300
it systems that are legislated to behave a certain way

652
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,920
and replacing them and rewriting them may or

653
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,170
may not be possible based on the legislation.

654
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,640
I mean, some of it.

655
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,849
Yeah, like I know, for example, locally, the welfare uh it's not welfare,

656
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:31,670
but basically the welfare system uses a repurposed.

657
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,140
Uh I think it's an insurance program

658
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,359
that they basically over the last 20 or 30 years.

659
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,260
So hint you kind of know what software or like what operating system runs on now,

660
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,930
you know that they've basically beaten into shape.

661
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:47,119
But, and the problem is how do you extract all that

662
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,849
legal and regulatory

663
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,119
configuration and knowledge

664
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,349
to even define what the new system should do?

665
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,869
Sure. Sure. Now, now I think that is

666
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:00,229
a different problem.

667
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:05,040
What you're talking about there is that's building the James Webb space telescope,

668
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,719
-- right? That is a one off, but
-- it's a common case.

669
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,380
-- It's
-- a, it is not,

670
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,400
there's 50 states with 50 welfare systems. Yes.

671
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,109
And that is a problem in a different space.

672
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,979
I think you have everyone building their own thing.

673
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,760
Could they come together and build one? I mean, maybe, maybe not.

674
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,849
I don't know, but the point is

675
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,734
we're not just, we're not, I'm not talking, talking about one off software.

676
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:29,415
I'm talking about like things that scale, right?

677
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,314
You don't build one car and then redesign and build another one,

678
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:35,614
you build millions of the same car.

679
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,295
Speaking of scale, there can be a piece of software that, you know,

680
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:42,094
only essentially one copy of it exists but DNS

681
00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:46,055
-- DNS server without that thing, the internet stops working well.
-- Right. Right.

682
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:49,694
And that, that all software happens at scale, right. I mean, fundamentally,

683
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:54,579
but I, I think that's another thing is we, we often fall into these traps of

684
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:57,300
talking about one off and talking about

685
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,439
mass market.

686
00:28:58,699 --> 00:28:58,810
But

687
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,699
10% of the population uses that one off software.

688
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:04,339
It's not one off. If 10% uses a curt,

689
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:08,459
I'm talking about, see this is a problem like you don't even understand this is,

690
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:09,949
this is what makes it so hard.

691
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,310
Well, how are you defining one off? Because like literally that in

692
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,030
-- that insurance mangled program is one
-- off is the,

693
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,810
the welfare system used by one province or state

694
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:23,854
that's one off. They built it, they own it. There's nowhere else to go.

695
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,734
This is like at the James Love stays. Telescope has a problem.

696
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:29,084
NASA can't pick up the phone and ask for help.

697
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:33,395
There's no tech support for that telescope. Like it's, it, you are, it,

698
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,444
you have to solve the problem,

699
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:36,594
you know what I mean?

700
00:29:36,604 --> 00:29:41,104
And so there's a difference between running Amazon web services

701
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:46,724
and running this Bespoke system that was written in 1978 in Cobalt.

702
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,329
Yeah.

703
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,329
And they're not comparable. And I think we have to be mindful of that

704
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,250
because one off silly things while that may be

705
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,780
a terrible decision made by someone long ago,

706
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,040
that is not the same thing as saying

707
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,880
we have this software run by millions of people

708
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,410
and it's insecure.

709
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:04,449
Why?

710
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,540
Yeah.

711
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,680
Anyway, and I feel like that was very ranty

712
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,280
-- but it, this is, this is so hard.
-- No, it's, it's a good point because

713
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,010
how do I put this? Simply we talk about the software industry

714
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:22,459
as a sort of single thing and it's, it's not at all homogeneous.

715
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:22,760
I mean,

716
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,500
you look at mobile apps versus apps written

717
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,260
50 years ago versus stuff written today versus log

718
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,359
for J versus

719
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,349
that insurance program versus

720
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,160
Windows 11. These,

721
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,420
the, the,

722
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,229
there, this is like talking about the animal kingdom and it's like, well, OK,

723
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,420
we've got everything from like

724
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,380
viruses to the blue whale and everything in between and they're all sort of the same.

725
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,939
Well, except

726
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:50,459
like, no, not really, like, there's some major, like, like things like tar

727
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,060
rates where it's like, oh, they, you know,

728
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:54,329
they play kind of by a different set of rules than zebras.

729
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,939
Right. Right. But, but

730
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,859
we don't even have a way to define the software industry very sensibly.

731
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:05,099
-- No, I agree. I agree. I think, I think that makes a
-- lot of sense.

732
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:05,939
Here's a simple question.

733
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,459
How do you define a software product versus something

734
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,550
that was written as consulting ware for one customer?

735
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:11,839
I mean,

736
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,359
and I don't even have an answer for that. I've done it.

737
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,219
No, I don't think there's a good answer today. I think that's part of the problem.

738
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,439
And I guess this is,

739
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,839
this is the difficulty of being in the industry that has to grow up.

740
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,579
That's what it really comes down to the security industry.

741
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,439
The time is now we have to grow up. And I think

742
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:33,280
this is where when I talk about like log for Jay right now,

743
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:36,780
if you think about it in the context of heartbleed happened, we were all like,

744
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,959
oh my goodness, we have to make sure this never happens again.

745
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,810
And then everyone got really excited for a little while and then it kind of

746
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,119
fizzled out, right?

747
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,069
And I think the reason is

748
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:49,579
we didn't have the tools or the know how to do anything after heartbeat,

749
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:50,359
right?

750
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:55,069
I think after log for Jay, we have a lot more tools and we have a lot more know how no,

751
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,290
it doesn't mean it isn't going to fizzle out or we're not going to screw this up.

752
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,099
But I think we are in a better place today

753
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,609
to make sure this doesn't happen again.

754
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:08,619
Then we were after, I think after heartbleed, there was no way we could fix it.

755
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,709
I think now we have a chance, we might not.

756
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,869
And if we don't, hopefully we'll be in a place when the next one happens,

757
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:17,099
that'll be it.

758
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:22,369
Well, and ironically part of it, assuming we have the tools and the willingness to,

759
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,069
to fix it,

760
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,650
it might become a self fulfilling prophecy in the sense of somebody starts looking,

761
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,089
finds a package that's, you know, used by 8% of everything in maven

762
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,930
and then goes digging around the source code and finds out,

763
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,969
you know, it's

764
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,930
whatever they,

765
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,650
they added this feature,

766
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,339
some

767
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,619
crazy, scary thing

768
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,810
and, and I can't help but wonder

769
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,579
essentially this will look worse because people, oh my God.

770
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,680
Now we're having a log for Jay every week

771
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:52,780
-- as people actually start to look for these and fix them. I, I,
-- I hope so.

772
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,819
I hope that happens

773
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,719
because that will also make us finally deal with this correctly.

774
00:32:58,819 --> 00:32:59,150
Yeah,

775
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,069
I mean, you have no choice at that point.

776
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,829
-- Oh, no,
-- you have choices.

777
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,160
That's true.

778
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,119
That's true.

779
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,880
There's one thing I've learned in life, it's that

780
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,560
you can point out to somebody that, you know,

781
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:16,510
like you need to stop smoking five packs a day and chugging a liter of vodka and

782
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,780
they might just keep doing it.

783
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,989
-- And
-- that sounds like a pretty good life to me right now.

784
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,119
Way better than,

785
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,250
you know, like it's

786
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,619
anyway.

787
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,910
All right. All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one. I think

788
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,660
I, I have a lot to think about and I'm pleased with this discussion and it always,

789
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,849
it brings a smile to my face

790
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:41,140
when I go into something, thinking we're going to talk about.

791
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,979
Like, I have my list of topics I want and I have my ideas and,

792
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,339
and it all got thrown away and I love it.

793
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,060
So.

794
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,219
