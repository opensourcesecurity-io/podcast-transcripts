Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 101 with myself,

1
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,689
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,899
So it's new man.

3
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:17,979
My little part of the world is no longer on danger of catching fire.

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,290
So we can now have campfires

5
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:20,809
and I'm so happy.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,010
Yeah, we had a beau

7
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:27,809
we had like literally the best May long weekend we've had in years and

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,139
fire band because it's been so dry and hot for like a month.

9
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,650
Oh, I got you. I got you.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,849
It happens,

11
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,240
-- but we had rain so now we can set things on fire safely.
-- Sweet

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,189
and exciting.

13
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,259
Life is good.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,979
So this week

15
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:46,919
the world isn't on fire that much.

16
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,259
There's not anything super crazy going on, which is

17
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:51,299
nice.

18
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,459
I don't know what to say.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,779
Well, I mean, there are super crazy things going on as usual in the world.

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,419
Uh for example, the whole tariff war thing, but I don't want to get into that because

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,169
you know, you bring up softwood lumber with Canadian and we just get ornery

22
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:06,930
and uh

23
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,709
OK, it's a thing. Hey,

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,569
dude,

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,739
some of my earliest childhood memories are hearing

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,819
about softwood lumber disputes on the news,

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,629
watching the news with my dad in the evening.

28
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,489
I feel bad for you in your childhood.

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,949
But uh yeah, no one thing that was interesting though is,

30
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,879
is this whole electric scooter thing?

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,160
Those are wild man. So I remember when I was out in San Francisco at RS A,

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,059
they were everywhere and at first I was like,

33
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:34,199
who are these people who are leaving these scooters all over the place?

34
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:38,069
And then after about a day, I realized this is like a rental type thing

35
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:38,809
and, and,

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,169
but, right, I mean, look, if you're in a new place and you see, like, scooters,

37
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,209
you're gonna think who left their scooter here?

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,559
Why is no one stealing it?

39
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:49,779
Well, yeah, it's like, I mean, city bikes, I get, you know, they, but they get, like,

40
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,510
locked up and stuff and they have, like, the little,

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,769
a lot of them have like that wheel lock thing that doesn't disengage until you, like,

42
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:55,660
hire the bike.

43
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,089
Does it work? Do the scooters do that?

44
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,110
No, they're just like sitting there.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,220
I, I don't, I assume they, they don't work in some manner until you use your app to

46
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:04,809
get

47
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:05,949
-- the electric
-- assist.

48
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,110
Well,

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm certain you don't get the app but I also have

50
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,149
a suspicion that they may have a break or something.

51
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,589
I didn't actually touch one.

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,960
I should have, I should have, I wish I would have known more about it.

53
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,220
I would have given it a go

54
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,639
although, although they were very annoying, but that's kind of another story.

55
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:20,559
Well, and, and that's,

56
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,690
it's funny you mentioned that because actually I just had this talk with my parents.

57
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,660
My parents no longer like walking in the, in Edmonton here.

58
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,720
We have a beautiful river valley with these like really nice paved trails

59
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:33,729
that are for cyclists and, you know, roller bladers and, and people walking

60
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:34,860
and, um,

61
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:37,139
my parents no longer like walking on them because

62
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,339
the problem is you have so many different um,

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,119
speeds of traffic, right?

64
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,699
You have people on bicycles that are just

65
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,259
like going leisurely with their little kids,

66
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,850
you know,

67
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,179
and then you have like some pretty hardcore cyclists that are doing like,

68
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,380
you know, 20 kilometers an hour

69
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,089
I

70
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,250
hate

71
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,600
and

72
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,449
yeah, you know, my parents don't want to get clobbered,

73
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,800
right. So, you know,

74
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,389
um, they no longer walk in those places and,

75
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,589
and, you know, that's something I've really noticed like

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,990
at the mall. Oh,

77
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,399
the tourists, because the tourists walk slow and want to look at everything, right?

78
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,199
I, the only reason I go to the mall is I have like, things to do a mission to accomplish,

79
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,630
you know,

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,690
get some fro

81
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,949
yo and a, and a new device at the Apple store.

82
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,539
Oh my God. I just want to run over them.

83
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,619
-- You know,
-- you have, you have like a problem with tourists at your mall

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,139
and

85
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,539
it used to be the world's largest mall and it's still a major tourist attraction.

86
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,149
Oh, I see. I see.

87
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:26,690
You know, it's,

88
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,580
I didn't realize that all I've ever heard about is the Mall of America.

89
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,580
The mall of America is bigger. But my understanding is West

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,860
Mall has better attractions. Like, it has a water park with a wave pool.

91
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:40,580
It's got, you know, like a whole bunch of theaters. It's got the hotel, it's got,

92
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,360
um, the amusement park with the indoor roller coaster and all that stuff.

93
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:47,800
Um, you know, too many golf courses, indoor cart racing.

94
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,960
Now, I want to come and see this mall.

95
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah, it's actually, I mean, as malls go it's, you know,

96
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:56,199
I just, I personally hate it because, you know, it's always full of people.

97
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,610
Right. And people are the problem as we know.

98
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,570
So, anyway, you talk of the

99
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:02,929
bicycle

100
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,520
and that's a real problem, right. Traditionally on,

101
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,199
on, uh, large,

102
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,309
you know, in large urban environments on the sidewalks, you have people walking

103
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,729
and that's it.

104
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,880
And, and especially in denser places like San Francisco and New York City.

105
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,720
You, that's it because, like, you,

106
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,369
you physically could not ride a bicycle there if you wanted to

107
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,750
right there just is not enough room and more

108
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,239
to the point you'd have to go at walking speed

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,769
because you can't even get out of people. Right.

110
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:28,359
Whereas, like,

111
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,820
say here in Edmonton we have vastly fewer pedestrians and a

112
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,630
lot of people ride their bikes on the sidewalks which,

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,839
as a pedestrian, I absolutely abhor and hate, but as a cyclist. Yeah.

114
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,570
No, I have like, a dividend, my chin from a Volvo.

115
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,649
So I totally get, wanted to ride on the sidewalk.

116
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,839
You know, I got clipped by a car when I was a kid

117
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,649
riding, uh, to home from school one day.

118
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,339
Yeah.

119
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,040
And so, yeah.

120
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:50,529
No, I get it, you know, because that's, well,

121
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,730
like anybody who drives on the highway and comes up on somebody doing like 20 miles

122
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,510
an hour under the speed limit or 20 miles an hour over the speed limit,

123
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,339
like that is insanely dangerous.

124
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,269
Like people who merge at

125
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,980
not highway speeds,

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,859
I, I

127
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:07,260
think that should be pretty much an automatic suspension of their license

128
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,100
-- because no, it's really
-- dangerous.

129
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,609
It is, it really is,

130
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,519
you know.

131
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,940
Um, and so, you know, now you're creating that problem, like sidewalks,

132
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,709
traditionally you had people walking and granted some people walk slow or worse.

133
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,309
You had like three or four people walking abreast of each other

134
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,709
again.

135
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,839
Uh The, you know,

136
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,709
it's funny because if you Google on Reddit for those comments around that,

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,619
there's quite a lot of rage around those people,

138
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,500
you know, that like form like a rolling roadblock down the side.

139
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:39,250
I mean, it's not rage inducing but I do find it annoying. Yes.

140
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,100
But, um,

141
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,760
but now the problem is, yeah, you add these electric scooters,

142
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,570
which are going quite a bit faster and more to the point.

143
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,200
I feel like these people didn't take a training course.

144
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:49,399
You know,

145
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,820
and, and see that's the thing I was thinking about, like, the thing with, um,

146
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,920
oh, what the heck,

147
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:57,149
what's the two wheeled one that was supposed to change the world in the

148
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,109
se the se,

149
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,670
yeah,

150
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,220
I remember that thing was supposed to be like a game changer and world transport

151
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,690
and even the segue takes some skill to ride.

152
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,190
Like there are some pretty funny youtube videos of people on those things.

153
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,250
-- Just, you
-- know, I've never been on one

154
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:12,929
part of

155
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,535
he wants to and part of me is like, I just don't care.

156
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:16,625
Honestly, the,

157
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:20,505
the thing I can most liken it to is like riding a well trained horse because

158
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:24,364
it's not like I'm, you know, you've ridden a bicycle, you've done roller skating,

159
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:24,494
right?

160
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:26,934
They're just a machine that doesn't care.

161
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,334
Like if you want to lean to the left and fall over, cool. You do that

162
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,424
right? Like the bicycle doesn't care.

163
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,350
But on the segway, like you start to lean forward and it kind of comes up under you,

164
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,970
you know, so you don't fall on your face, right?

165
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,239
It starts moving forward. Like when you lean forwards, you start to fall forwards,

166
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,579
the segway moves forward.

167
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,869
So you don't fall, you know, you lean backwards to break it,

168
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,950
it breaks and comes back under you So it's,

169
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,970
it's like I said, the closest thing I,

170
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,000
I would compare it to is like being on a horse where, you know, the horse,

171
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,299
like a well trained horse.

172
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,850
Mind, you

173
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,989
will like, move under you to like, keep you on its back

174
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,989
if you start to fall off or start to with it a bit. You know what I mean?

175
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,690
And, and for a machine to do that is I, I found it quite unsettling, like,

176
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,799
because it's just something

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,820
-- I've literally never experienced before.
-- Right.

178
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:12,839
Well, in, in the advantage to a horse is a horse will avoid obstacles.

179
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,160
I

180
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,529
assume a

181
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:13,970
segue.

182
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:18,320
Will you say that? But not always some horses are dumb.

183
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,920
Well, ok, in, in there's dumb people, all the segues are dumb.

184
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,920
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,769
Yeah, they don't have like the little obstacle avoidance,

186
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,000
beeper thing or whatever.

187
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:28,959
Um

188
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,220
But yeah, so that's, that's, that's the problem, right?

189
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,359
Is these electric scooters, I think kind of hit that

190
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,390
mediums of, they're easy enough for pretty much anybody to ride because you,

191
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,720
you really only have to be able to balance left and right.

192
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Like you don't really have to balance forwards and backwards as well.

193
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,760
So

194
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,679
most people can walk without falling over.

195
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,910
So most people have that left to right balance thing. Pretty, pretty damn.

196
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,459
Uh That's again, one of my favorite videos on youtube are,

197
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,130
are the people with the field sobriety

198
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,059
test trying to walk a straight line

199
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,200
because normally people can walk a straight line to toe

200
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,429
and drunk people. Not so much,

201
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:02,089
you know.

202
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,059
You know, my favorite is the one that, where it's, like,

203
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,480
lean over and she just leans over and like, falls on her head.

204
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,019
Right. It's like, yeah, you're drunk. Seriously.

205
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:12,920
I love watching these videos because as, as poor as some of my life choices are,

206
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,079
they've never been that bad.

207
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,350
That's the spirit.

208
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,010
You know.

209
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,910
So, you know, you get, basically, you get untrained people on an electric scooter.

210
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,019
And I don't mean just untrained in a technical sense of like,

211
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,640
how do I ride this thing safely but untrained in the sense of like

212
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,630
kind of what's the culture on this? Do scooters yield to people,

213
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,309
-- do people yield to scooters?
-- No

214
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,869
-- scooters
-- yield. It's

215
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,669
well, ok, so

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,429
I spend a lot of time riding my bicycle on trails

217
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,097
and I try very hard to not be the bicycle. That is the terrible human being.

218
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:47,888
And I give people, you know, I know I'm coming, I slow down when there's

219
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,549
because there's nothing that ticks me off more when there's kind of, you know,

220
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:54,179
two walkers meeting on a trail and there's like the bicycle that

221
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:57,419
just blows through the middle and almost runs them over and no,

222
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,908
don't, it doesn't work that way.

223
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,229
You're the bike. You wait

224
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,830
and, and

225
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,349
the scooters should be the same way, obviously.

226
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,750
But I think that's easier said than done because I mean,

227
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,169
look you go on these trails and there's signs everywhere,

228
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,940
telling bicycles that walkers have the right of way.

229
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:18,039
And I bet less than 10% of bicycles actually pay attention to those

230
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:21,409
signs and it infuriates me to no end.

231
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,669
And so I can see where

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,989
the scooter shouldn't have the right of way, but I'm sure a lot of the people on them

233
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,159
believe they own the sidewalk

234
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,760
or they just don't care and they're not paying attention like

235
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,330
in that text while making left hand turns in traffic,

236
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,190
-- right,
-- like straight up, you know.

237
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:37,650
Yeah.

238
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,059
So, so you get that, that,

239
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,760
that problem of not just the technical lack of skill but like that lack of,

240
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,359
here's the biggest problem, right?

241
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,940
The reason traffic works is because we have some

242
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,609
very well defined rules that most people follow,

243
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,630
you know, red means stop,

244
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,150
green means it's

245
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,190
well, green means it's safe to proceed.

246
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,469
Uh rather no green means

247
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,900
you have the right of way and you can do so if it is safe to proceed,

248
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,809
but it's on you to make sure it's safe to proceed, right?

249
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,940
Because there might be a fire truck

250
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,469
and, you know, in most of the world we drive on the right side of the road,

251
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,760
not the wrong side of the road.

252
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:09,440
That's

253
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:09,659
right.

254
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,830
And so,

255
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,950
you know, traffic generally works if people do that and when people don't do that,

256
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:15,789
uh it,

257
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,309
well, it doesn't work,

258
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,989
you know,

259
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,750
but I feel like,

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,520
we don't have these rules or even this culture in North America of who yields to?

261
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,030
What? On a sidewalk? Is it faster moving? Is it bigger? Is it,

262
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,510
you know what if you're bigger but slower moving?

263
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,640
Like, what if you're on, like, a tricycle bike and you're going really slow?

264
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,409
Do you have to yield pedestrians still?

265
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,500
And same thing with this electric scooter? Right.

266
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,919
What if you have a really small personal electric

267
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,659
scooter coming up on a really big person,

268
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,440
you know? Do you do wheels always yield to feet?

269
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,830
Yes.

270
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,690
You know, I, yeah, I would agree. I think that would generally make sense.

271
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,450
But the problem is,

272
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,760
like, do these electric scooters have brakes?

273
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,200
I assume. So,

274
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,440
uh,

275
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,429
I'd be shocked if they don't.

276
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,359
Well, and now, like,

277
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:03,849
I know the little razor scooters their break is you smash your heel into the,

278
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:04,969
the rear fender?

279
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:06,150
Oh. And it, like,

280
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,000
like, uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,760
And those work really well

282
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,260
if you know how to use it.

283
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,719
Ah, ok. It does have, it does have

284
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,650
a, a break built into the handles

285
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,989
with the right hand to accelerate and break with the left

286
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,429
anyway. We, we're in the weeds,

287
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,789
but basically this is a classic security problem of,

288
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,599
we have all these new behaviors with no defined,

289
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,159
uh, you know, no defined way to sync them

290
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,030
and

291
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,229
we end up with this huge problem, you know, it reminds me of like, the early web,

292
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,119
right, with web browsers and web clients, they just did all

293
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,320
sorts

294
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:35,489
of,

295
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,380
let's, let's back it away from the web though for a second.

296
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,869
So you say we have a new technology

297
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:44,030
and we don't have clear rules.

298
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,719
-- The problem is it's not a new technology, it's an old technology, but we're
-- actually

299
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,260
using

300
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,090
it now.

301
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,909
Let's pretend it's new

302
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,109
now

303
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,789
in history

304
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,539
when something new like this has shown up,

305
00:11:57,109 --> 00:12:01,250
how does it get dealt with? Do people just decide on some rules and say that's neat.

306
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,450
I'm going to do it this way

307
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,429
-- occasionally but never,
-- they never,

308
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,130
it's regulation

309
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,659
every time expecting people to do the right thing.

310
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,059
In fact,

311
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,750
the only instance I can think of where an industry purposely self regulated was

312
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,179
the ESRB rating video games simply because they didn't want the government to do it

313
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:21,919
well.

314
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,539
Well,

315
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,140
and that's interesting that you mention that because

316
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,799
that actually is kind of a core component.

317
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,340
Now of a lot of these start ups,

318
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,229
like Uber has literally part of their

319
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,739
business strategy is to bypass legislation and laws

320
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:38,030
-- and,
-- and sometimes they do

321
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,679
well, like locally they did.

322
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,750
And then it was funny because the, the police actually started investigating them

323
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,799
and Uber would block their credit cards

324
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:48,590
and, you know, somebody mentioned, like,

325
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,559
does that count as obstruction of justice?

326
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,960
-- No, like
-- straight up. Right. Not when you have a lot of money.

327
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,640
Exactly.

328
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,479
So, yeah, they came to a deal with the city. But

329
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,979
actually do you know what I read the other day about Uber?

330
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,460
So I mean, you've been, you've been to SFO and when you take an Uber,

331
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:04,419
they pick you up on the top level,

332
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,659
which is arrivals and the bottom level is departures.

333
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,559
And I read they're now giving advice to people that when you arrive,

334
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,580
drop people off in the departures level because the

335
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,799
arrivals level is too busy with Uber drivers.

336
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,659
And it's like that is the dumbest freaking thing.

337
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,760
How would you too busy with Uber drivers?

338
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,440
-- It would be the same amount of cars dropping people off. No,
-- no, no.

339
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,299
They, they,

340
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,580
they told Uber drivers you're not allowed to pick people up in departures.

341
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,859
So they started picking them up in arrivals

342
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,840
and now there's so many cars that arrivals

343
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:36,900
because in Uber you can't drop people off and it's like this is so freaking stupid.

344
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:37,340
It's not

345
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,700
the first thing here. The uh the airport cab

346
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,419
company authority, whatever it was

347
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,940
decided to not let city cabs pick people up at the airport. So the city cab

348
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,609
commission, whatever retaliated by not letting the airport cabs pick up fares in.

349
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:49,679
And

350
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,059
so you had the situation of

351
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,119
the airport cabs could take people from the airport into

352
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,059
the city and then they had to dead head back and

353
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,619
and the city cabs could take people to the airport and then had to deadhead back,

354
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,099
which

355
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:03,030
obviously that's, I mean, our airport is like a good,

356
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,530
you know, it's a ways out of the city. Right.

357
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,469
And

358
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,979
exactly, and it was like that for a year or two and then they finally, you know,

359
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,859
stop playing chicken with each other and came to an agreement.

360
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,500
But

361
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,090
yeah, I mean, fundamentally we will need

362
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,020
legislation to handle this but more to the point will it,

363
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,520
well, people know or care because, I mean, part of it, you know,

364
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,070
like Uber is a great example.

365
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,539
One of the reasons I love Uber

366
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,960
is because we have Uber everywhere now.

367
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,349
So I just pull up my phone wherever I am in North America basically.

368
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:37,580
And I like, get a car there in five minutes and then I get my receipt emailed to me and

369
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:41,640
I don't have to like, know which of the local cab companies are dodgy or not dodgy,

370
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,929
you know, I don't have to like,

371
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,770
you know, like,

372
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,809
yeah, I just, whatever I take my Uber, right?

373
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,989
And the same thing with these scooters, right?

374
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,219
If, if this, uh, what is it bird or whatever thing takes off and is

375
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,950
all over North America,

376
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,849
then,

377
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,940
you know. Yeah, different cities will probably end up with different rules.

378
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,549
But as a bird rider, like, what the heck do I know about?

379
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,840
Like, these rules even in my own city, let alone in some city I'm visiting.

380
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,190
No, no, you're gonna have to care though because,

381
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:11,609
and, and this is something that will be interesting because generally speaking,

382
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:16,340
like in the context of Uber, it's up to the drivers and Uber to follow the rules.

383
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,869
But in the context of Bird,

384
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,539
it's gonna be also heavily dependent on the writer

385
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:25,299
and, and look, if you don't follow the rules, man, you're gonna get a ticket.

386
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,539
That's just how this works.

387
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,940
And, and being ignorant of the law isn't an excuse in any jurisdiction.

388
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,619
And so

389
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,580
this

390
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,679
in all seriousness,

391
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,734
this, this might be the money factory these cities need

392
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,724
now that, like, their, their drunk driving fines are way down because of Uber.

393
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:43,775
That's actually a really good point is that, you know, in theory,

394
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:46,104
when we get to self driving cars in 10 or 20 years,

395
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:49,955
pretty much 100% of revenue from speeding tickets,

396
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,494
red light cameras and so on should,

397
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,039
yeah,

398
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:52,669
it'll be.

399
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,789
Exactly,

400
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,049
it should be.

401
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,390
And so, yeah, do we, we do we shift to for lack of a better term,

402
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,239
pedestrian traffic enforcement.

403
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,559
Well, look, they're gonna do something because they want the money. Right.

404
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:05,900
-- Yeah.
-- No, this is interesting.

405
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:08,820
I mean, because I, especially in places like San Francisco, right.

406
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,630
There's a lot of things where, you know,

407
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,039
you want to travel one or two kilometers which is, you know, it's a bit of a walk,

408
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,679
especially up and down those hills.

409
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,750
But, you know, if you, if you do an Uber,

410
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,929
the Uber actually takes longer than walking because traffic is so horrendous.

411
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,369
-- Most of the time
-- it does.

412
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,390
In fact, I remember at RSA, I took an Uber and the guy was like,

413
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,789
you can walk faster than this.

414
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,669
And I said, look, man,

415
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm so tired. I don't care. Just let me, let me sit here for a

416
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:31,520
little

417
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,219
seriously. I need air conditioning

418
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:36,325
and I said, if it takes a little longer, whatever that

419
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,155
I had that happen in Ireland, the guy is like,

420
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,945
this is literally a three block away dress and I'm like, yeah, but I can't find it.

421
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:41,765
So like down

422
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:42,674
there before,

423
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:48,025
yeah, it's like I'm, my phone isn't behaving and Google Maps isn't helping me and

424
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,114
take me to my hotel, please.

425
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,219
I don't care.

426
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:53,520
Although I,

427
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,140
I saw there was something on Reddit once where somebody was lost in the city

428
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:57,900
and they,

429
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:00,440
they got it in an Uber and literally like they were

430
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,710
on the wrong corner of a city block from their hotel.

431
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:03,859
Uber

432
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,910
driver, like, literally drove them down one street,

433
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,000
turned a corner down the street and dropped them off.

434
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,219
It's like that story, you know,

435
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,108
the car mechanic that like spends five minutes

436
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,260
fixing the engine and charges them 1000 bucks

437
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,650
when it's like 999 bucks for knowing which part

438
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,348
to replace and a buck for the spark plug.

439
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,098
That's right.

440
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,339
That's right. You know,

441
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,469
there, there's actually, I read a story of a better story than that.

442
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,400
Uh, just recently was,

443
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,670
I guess Picasso Pablo Picasso was in a cafe one time uh doodling on a napkin

444
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:36,219
and a woman saw him and he was, he was like going to throw it out. And she said,

445
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:39,989
can I have that? And he said, no, I'll sell it to you for $20,000.

446
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,390
And she was, of course appalled and said, but you drew it in like two minutes.

447
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,430
Well, I don't,

448
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,939
whatever. It's a story.

449
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,430
Uh and, and she says, you drew it in like two minutes and he says, no, ma'am, I,

450
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,469
I drew this, it took me 65 years to draw this, right?

451
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,270
And like, that's very true.

452
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,270
Oh, totally.

453
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,910
So back to this,

454
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,630
the other thing I found really fascinating with this bird story

455
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,829
was the whole because I was kind of wondering that too.

456
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,089
I'm like,

457
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:04,609
how do these things get recharged because they don't have like docking base.

458
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,579
It's like again, going back to like places that have city bikes,

459
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,719
they have those big ranks,

460
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,849
right? You're like take the bike, jam it in

461
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,829
and

462
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,010
I get it. But it's also very uh me as a rider. That's very inconvenient, right?

463
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,209
I ideally I want to go from point

464
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,469
-- to point B and not have to do any care and feeding of this device.
-- Yeah.

465
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,969
And the, the, the bird scooters you like find one on the street,

466
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,369
you scan it, it starts working and then you like literally park it and that's it.

467
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,969
And it just sits in the middle of the frigging. It's crazy.

468
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,650
And so apparently the way it works is they have these people,

469
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,459
they pay kind of piece meal again, like the sharecropping, you know,

470
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,530
piece work economy

471
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,359
and they get paid to, you know, pick up these bird scooters,

472
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,839
take them home and charge them up and then

473
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,599
it sounds like Pokemon go.

474
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:47,609
Yeah.

475
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,949
And, you know, they're talking about this and there's some really, like, you know,

476
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,550
they get into some very aggressive, angry situations because,

477
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,290
you know, it's a first come first serve, right?

478
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,540
Like there's a pile of scooters on the map. Go find them.

479
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,079
Good luck, you know,

480
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,479
and some of them people throw them in garbage cans or people

481
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,520
hide them or throw them in the lake or whatever because,

482
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,310
you know, they're angry at these scooters.

483
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,439
Um, you know, it's like when in, what was it, Amsterdam,

484
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:08,959
when they tried their first city bike program,

485
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,000
like within a week they all ended up in the canals.

486
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,390
I know.

487
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:12,890
Not

488
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,239
surprised.

489
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,560
Um

490
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,599
Yeah. So

491
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,130
I, again, it kind of comes like I get it, you know, people, businesses,

492
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,640
especially literally if you tried to

493
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,640
create a legislative framework for your product

494
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,119
prior to releasing it by definition,

495
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,469
that would take so long you'd go out of business.

496
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,689
And I do agree with that.

497
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:36,010
And I also think,

498
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,410
and this is true of nearly any industry that I think

499
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,849
trying to regulate before release is a nonstarter you know,

500
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,250
it reminds me of TCP.

501
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,010
Flow control.

502
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,859
Remember when TCP was invented,

503
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,364
they came up with all these flow control ideas and implemented

504
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,494
them in software and guess what did any of them work?

505
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:55,994
-- Really? No, no. In fact, most of them made it much, much worse.
-- You know.

506
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,574
That's funny you say that because I mean, it's the old saying,

507
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,074
premature optimization is the root of all evil

508
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,785
and that's true of regulation as well.

509
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,425
If you prematurely regulate,

510
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,069
you end up stifling innovation and potentially ruining

511
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,400
-- the industry even
-- more to the point.

512
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,760
Do we need regulation? Right?

513
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,000
I, I see all these things were like, oh, we should regulate Xy and Z and I'm like, well,

514
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,869
what is the actual cost to society of Xy and Z?

515
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,709
Like, I, I hate to say it but, you know, if, for the sake of argument, some

516
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,630
food product or whatever technology kills, let's say one person per year.

517
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,280
Is it worth spending $10 to regulate it? Well, yeah,

518
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:31,709
yeah, that, that definitely 10 bucks for, to saving a life. Sure.

519
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,319
What if it cost $10 billion?

520
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,060
Well,

521
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,739
we very easily could spend that $10 billion somewhere else and

522
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,849
save a lot more than one life part of it too.

523
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,099
Is even if we want, like, even if there are good reasons to regulate this, does,

524
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:44,089
does it make economic sense to do so?

525
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,540
You know, is that the best way to spend our money? And time

526
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:47,339
and

527
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,140
will these regulations even work, right?

528
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,910
Like, dude, we've had seatbelt laws in,

529
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,540
in, in Canada and Alberta for

530
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:56,579
decades.

531
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,060
Like I remember as a little kid it went from like, you, whatever,

532
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,459
you probably should wear your seatbelt to like you have to wear your seatbelt.

533
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,140
The argument being

534
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,219
especially with socialized health care,

535
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,040
like we're paying for you to go through

536
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,760
the windshield so you better wear your seatbelt.

537
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,719
Yeah, that seems fair.

538
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,609
And there are still people getting seatbelt tickets 30 some years later,

539
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,079
it'll never go away, man.

540
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:14,910
-- You
-- know, I had,

541
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,900
I had to move my car from the driveway to across

542
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,640
the street so I could move another car into it.

543
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,589
And I'm like, I, I started backing up without my seatbelt on.

544
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,099
I'm like, oh, that feels just weird.

545
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,415
Put my seatbelt on, move the car, like through defeat

546
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,104
on the flip side though.

547
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:29,994
I see like what Uber has done in some of these cities and it's just like, man,

548
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:33,165
that's like borderline evil, like some of the stuff they've done is

549
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:34,854
literally like, quite,

550
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:38,015
you know, morally, ethically and legally questionable.

551
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:41,015
So, yeah, I don't know where that happy medium is. And then

552
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,494
the other thing is too, like,

553
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:45,204
stuff like this scooter regulation that's going to be on a city level and

554
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:48,275
there's going to be like all sorts of different rules and different things.

555
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:48,765
Yeah.

556
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:49,214
Yeah.

557
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:51,614
Well, a great example would be, I know in European cities, there's, um,

558
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,734
a lot of city centers.

559
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,550
We have, uh, pedestrian zones, uh, that are open to pedestrians, bicycles,

560
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,420
some of them, you have to walk your bike, some of them you can ride your bike.

561
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,180
Most of them obviously allow emergency vehicles.

562
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,219
Many of them allow commercial delivery vehicles. Right.

563
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,260
Because you know the stores and stuff and they're gonna, like,

564
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,180
do stuff and like have food to serve you and then there's, you know,

565
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:15,180
the different strategies, like, uh, one of my favorite strategies, Cobblestones

566
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:16,560
straight up. Right.

567
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:20,280
You try roller blading or skateboarding on cobblestones. And the answer is no,

568
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,810
no.

569
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:21,719
Right.

570
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,119
And,

571
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,000
and that's one of my favorite ways of making

572
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,739
an area pedestrian friendly is just use cobblestones.

573
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:29,390
That is true. And Europe has tons of

574
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Coles

575
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,030
even riding in cars on those things is terrible.

576
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,119
It's when they're wet on a bicycle, you wipe out a lot.

577
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:41,640
I don't think I've ever ridden a bicycle in Europe because all the

578
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,410
bicyclists in Europe are crazy people and I'm afraid to interact with.

579
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:50,920
They, like, they take it very seriously. It's not quite as leisurely as

580
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:51,410
the

581
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,770
thing is, I don't want to get run over by a car and conversely,

582
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,689
I don't want to run over a pedestrian because that would be a

583
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,239
very rude thing to do.

584
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,400
-- So.
-- Have you ever been to Amsterdam before?

585
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,319
Yeah. In Amsterdam. I'm not afraid of the cars. I'm afraid of the bikes.

586
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:06,949
Well, but see, the thing is conversely, like, I feel, you know,

587
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,510
like in Germany just don't walk on the red pavement,

588
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,430
the red pavement is for cyclists. Right.

589
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,869
Right.

590
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,510
Yeah, that too. They, they're pretty brutal there as well.

591
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,140
Less so than Amsterdam, but it's, it's definitely serious.

592
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,660
But, uh, no, so I'm just, it is curious to see, like,

593
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,069
it's, it's pretty clear to me at this point.

594
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,680
Uber has won over cab companies because, like, even locally,

595
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,310
all the cab companies now there's two or three main ones and they have, like,

596
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,579
we have an app and you can order us online and it's like, yeah, great.

597
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,969
Except every time I try and, like, use you guys,

598
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:38,479
it's just a freaking nightmare and it takes like 20 minutes for your cab to get here

599
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,770
and it smells weird, you know, and, and more to the point.

600
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,369
Uber emails me that nice receipt and also Uber works in all the places I travel to.

601
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,310
Right. My local cab company. Not so much

602
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:52,069
and I feel like this scooter thing, I feel like Segway

603
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,670
didn't work because it just requires a level of skill that

604
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,660
a lot of people don't have

605
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:56,589
expensive.

606
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,140
Yeah.

607
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,189
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

608
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,270
Well, less so now because the electronics have really come down in price.

609
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,569
But still compared to like, these scooters. Yeah, they're, they're pretty pricey.

610
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:04,869
So,

611
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:07,000
I feel like these scooters have a good chance

612
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,739
of winning that 1 to 2 kilometer travel thing,

613
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,060
you know.

614
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,619
So, like, ideally you get off public transit and then you,

615
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,660
you grab a bird and do your one or two K to your office or whatever.

616
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,979
I feel like these could really be actually useful and successful

617
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,130
except, you know, places where I live here,

618
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,619
like where we get snow and stuff and it's not going to work so good.

619
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,739
Right. And I'm, I'm familiar with that problem also.

620
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,500
It is, I don't know. I mean, I, I look at this and

621
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:33,119
I think

622
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,609
it is, it is one of those unique problems

623
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,800
where

624
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:39,689
it's, it's a new idea

625
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,219
and it's kind of a nuisance and something probably needs to be done.

626
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,469
But I, I think you have a fair point about regulation. Is it a big enough nuisance?

627
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,040
Something will be done? I have a suspicion.

628
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,560
Yes.

629
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,130
Well, and the other thing is, is you go back to, is it a big enough problem?

630
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,670
And that's the thing. Right.

631
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,060
There's al,

632
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,339
there's always been one or two people that will ride their

633
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:58,459
razor in pedestrian traffic and if it's one or two people,

634
00:24:58,469 --> 00:24:59,250
like, who cares?

635
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,670
It's like

636
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:03,020
if there's one person riding a horse in downtown New York, that's fine.

637
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:05,640
There's 10 of them.

638
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,739
If there's 10 of them,

639
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,550
it's kind of like this is getting a little weird and annoying and if there's like,

640
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:13,550
1000 of them then, like, I, I'm pretty sure traffic would come to a standstill,

641
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,430
-- you
-- know.

642
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:18,849
And no, no, like that, that argument though, I think is invalid just because

643
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:19,989
there aren't

644
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:22,170
horses everywhere in New York City.

645
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,930
Well, no, but what I mean is with the scooter,

646
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:24,329
scooter

647
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,010
as long as there's like one or two scooters, who cares?

648
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,770
But when there's like,

649
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,130
say 10,000 of these floating around New York being actively used

650
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,770
and, and at that point,

651
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,599
I guess we're going to see regulation that's going to clearly define

652
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,140
what has to happen.

653
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,060
And I keep thinking about this in the context of, of security on the internet

654
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,380
and,

655
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,979
and I'm coming back to your point about how much is it going

656
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:51,069
to cost to regulate and how much value do you get back?

657
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,819
And, and I, I'm wondering,

658
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,140
it is quite possible that regulating computers on the internet

659
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:02,550
will have a negative return on investment essentially from the context of,

660
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,089
of what you get versus what you have.

661
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,390
And if that's true,

662
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,569
it just might not ever make sense

663
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,359
to have that

664
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:12,170
-- stuff.
-- And,

665
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,959
you know, I look at like

666
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,739
right now I've, you know, I'm buying, uh, the led light bulbs and they're,

667
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,459
they've really come down in price, you know, they're, there are a few bucks now,

668
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,699
but quite frankly, like, you know, trying to convince me to spend like,

669
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,459
50 bucks or 100 bucks on one of those, like,

670
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:29,680
really nice iot light bulbs with the changing lights or the music or whatever.

671
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,589
Good luck.

672
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,209
But when they're $10 sure

673
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:35,540
Well, even in that context, like, look, let's say like meds.

674
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,449
Right.

675
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,449
There's clear value

676
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:39,900
of

677
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,839
-- you.
-- Right. Right.

678
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,530
There's clear value there because people literally die.

679
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,050
If I have a light bulb, that's part of a botnet,

680
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,089
is it, is it really negatively affecting me? Nope, it sure isn't.

681
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,189
Is it negatively affecting the world

682
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:55,469
so far? We've yet to see any sort of DD OS

683
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:59,140
-- that has been more than like a day's worth of annoyance.
-- So

684
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,670
talking about

685
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,270
doctor sloppy handwriting kills more than 7000 people

686
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,420
annually in the United States of America.

687
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,380
And this is from 2007.

688
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:12,670
So you know that 7000 is too small of a number for killing people before anyone cares

689
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,839
well, and it's also distributed, right?

690
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,040
You know, it's not like you have 7000 people die in one event and ok,

691
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,270
-- now we care a bit
-- or, or even from one specific product,

692
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,520
like let's say you have one pacemaker and 7000 people die, people would flip out.

693
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,959
But, but I think if it's,

694
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:31,680
if it's random distributed sampling 7000 is obviously too low of a number,

695
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:32,760
it would be interesting

696
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,959
to look at what is the threshold when people start to care because you look at

697
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:40,430
like automobile safety man and it was horrifying

698
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,310
how many people were dying before they really,

699
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,390
really started to care

700
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:43,949
well,

701
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,020
and the industry actively campaigned against it

702
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,339
because of the perceived costs and whatnot.

703
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:52,869
You know, like they fought tooth and nail for a long time.

704
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,334
And, yeah, it took Ralph Nader to, to really,

705
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,055
you know,

706
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:59,114
to put it bluntly, to publicly shame them into,

707
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,974
you know, it's funny and people don't always like it when I say this,

708
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,464
but I consider what Nader did to be stunt hacking.

709
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:06,125
Oh, it totally was. And it works.

710
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,974
And I think that's part of it is, people have to understand and, you know, the,

711
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,334
the optics on a thing, right?

712
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:11,214
Like, no offense.

713
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,295
But if I show you a real server hack,

714
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,724
what you will see is a rack of computers with blinking lights

715
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,839
and that's it, nothing will change, right?

716
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:21,310
Literally, the lights won't blink more or less.

717
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,680
-- It won't catch fire,
-- it

718
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:23,880
-- won't
-- bloke more.

719
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,579
Like, look the yellow lights blinking twice as fast as it was

720
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:26,910
before.

721
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,900
You know, that little network light is solid now

722
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,060
and like, literally, who cares? Right.

723
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:35,719
Whereas, you know, you do like a skater demo hack and it's like, ok,

724
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,050
you know, this thing does this thing again, who cares?

725
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,680
Like, when you can make something blow up? Oh, ok.

726
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:45,920
-- Now I'm going to blow up this house with, with my computer,
-- you know,

727
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,469
or turn every traffic light in the city green

728
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:50,949
or it'd be even funnier to turn them all red

729
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,829
and never turn them green. Measure

730
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:53,680
the patients.

731
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,489
I,

732
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,290
I wonder, I mean,

733
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,280
-- everyone has a limit but I bet there's a lot of people that would be
-- actually,

734
00:28:59,290 --> 00:28:59,790
you know, it's funny.

735
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,520
No, because when it's, uh, red all the way around then you treat it as a four way stop.

736
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,189
So this is the thing is there's an actual rule to deal with that,

737
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,089
whereas there is no rule to deal with all green.

738
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:08,339
That's

739
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,750
true.

740
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:09,689
That's a good point.

741
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,170
Although when this happens though, most people do tend to ignore it.

742
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:14,170
So

743
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,439
interesting, man. I don't know. We'll, we'll see. It's,

744
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,319
I, I have a feeling

745
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,439
we will be revisiting this topic more than once

746
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,680
in the coming days.

747
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,790
You know what I'm really curious about what other

748
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,270
transport alternatives are gonna be coming out because

749
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,959
I would have never guessed electric scooters.

750
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,800
Well, it's even more than just transport. I mean, I think so

751
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,219
the story, I think the

752
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:39,020
-- drone thing is going to be
-- the biggest, well, drones are coming. There's so, so

753
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,199
we are approaching a point where we have an

754
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,979
amazing amount of technology kind of coming together in

755
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:48,390
this interesting way and it's because of things like

756
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,550
cell phones and cloud computing and GSM networks and,

757
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,130
and everything we have

758
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:57,369
and so people are able to do crazy things nobody could have dreamed of.

759
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:58,959
-- It's just like
-- the internet 20 years ago.

760
00:29:58,969 --> 00:29:59,250
Right.

761
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,599
-- Yeah, exactly.
-- We, we suddenly hit this inflection point

762
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:02,719
of

763
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,569
not every, a lot of people are on the internet,

764
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,930
they have enough internet speed to actually do something interesting with it.

765
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,895
We have enough servers, we have enough bandwidth.

766
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,594
We have programming languages, like, well back in the day,

767
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,614
Pearl and stuff that are finally getting smart enough to do useful things with.

768
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,104
And, yeah, and, and the,

769
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,694
the two thousands was the amount of creative destruction

770
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:23,145
that went on in the.com world was stunning.

771
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,935
And we're doing that again with drones and with, you know, well,

772
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:27,984
like 3D printing and,

773
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:31,824
you know, computer vision. I mean, yeah, all these things coming together is

774
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:35,500
like, when I think about, if I had a hobby nowadays and I could spend like,

775
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,349
20 hours a week on it and say 50 grand, I, you know, I could build like a drone that,

776
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,770
like, catches squirrels

777
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,709
-- and delivers them to people. I don't
-- like,

778
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:43,880
oh, my goodness.

779
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:46,229
We need a Kickstarter for this.

780
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,390
Like a squirrel catching drone. I would pay huge money for that.

781
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,439
And if it can catch or kill rabbits also, oh, man, that'd be golden.

782
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:57,339
-- Like, they're the bane of my existence.
-- I thought you had a dog.

783
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:57,464
I

784
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:58,755
do have a dog.

785
00:30:58,974 --> 00:30:59,494
They're still,

786
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:01,395
he's not outside all the time.

787
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:03,535
Well, isn't that the traditional solution?

788
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,665
He's helping actually, for what it's worth.

789
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:09,635
I do have less rabbits in my backyard but, but only where the dog is, right. I have a f,

790
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:10,474
in area

791
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:15,094
and, and the squirrels are squirrels, climb up things. Right. Like when

792
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:15,915
I, I'm,

793
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:18,765
I'm very militant about keeping branches away

794
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,864
from my house because I hate squirrels.

795
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,305
I hate them so much. You have no idea.

796
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,420
And, well,

797
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,050
they used to live in my house and it took a long time

798
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,040
to get rid of them because they kept chewing holes and stuff.

799
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,180
And so anyway, now I just keep all the branches very far away from the house

800
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,150
and I still see them on there every now and then. I'm like, oh,

801
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:38,540
if I could go up there and get you, I would. But it's too far

802
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,089
anyway. Sorry, I'm done ranting with squirrels

803
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,180
anyway.

804
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:44,949
Right.

805
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,729
No, it's, it's,

806
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,040
it's interesting and I think we're going to

807
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,459
see even crazier stuff in the near future.

808
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:52,920
-- But
-- yeah, so going back, like my favorite thing with drones is like,

809
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,859
you think it's bad to get pooped on by a bird?

810
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,280
Imagine when a drone carrying a milkshake hits you?

811
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,619
-- That's going
-- to be epic.

812
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,969
I hope I am the first person to have a drone carried milkshake dumped on his head.

813
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,660
II, I hope I can only pray,

814
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,439
you know, are people going to be just be randomly covered in Chinese? Take out?

815
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,369
I don't know. And I think that's how we ended.

816
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,699
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

817
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,780
If you want any of the show notes from the discussion today,

you can go to open source security podcast.com.

819
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,430
We have links there to Facebook group

821
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,010
So Yeah, I guess until next time, Kurt just keep looking up, man.

822
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
Watch out for that Chinese

823
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:35,969
take care.

824
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,270
Thanks folks.
