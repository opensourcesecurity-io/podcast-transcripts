Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,579
Kurt Siefried and my partner enjoying in, enjoying buttered toast.

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,069
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I mean, butter toast is ok.

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:18,200
But why, why would you even use that as your example at the beginning of the show?

4
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:21,770
-- I'm confused.
-- Well, because I used to eat my toast dry like I put jam or whatever on it.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,290
But then I,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,930
-- I started buttering it again and it's just so much better.
-- Ok.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,909
So you're gonna, well, you think I'm weird anyway, so this won't,

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,979
this won't shock you in any meaningful way.

9
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,529
But if I'm eating just a piece of toast with,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,919
say my breakfast with my eggs or whatever, I'll put butter on it.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,750
But if I'm putting jam on the toast, I don't put butter on first.

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,459
I prefer just jam on the bread versus jam and butter on the bread.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,950
Well, see, and I'm sort of the same way,

14
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:47,220
I will only put jam on a piece of bread with butter if it

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,470
is toast and the butter melts, like I don't want a layer of butter and a layer of jam.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,810
-- I do not want that.
-- I mean, that sounds awful. But I don't even like melted butter.

17
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:59,150
-- I know a lot of people that like it that way and I'm not one of them,
-- whatever.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,590
Anyway, we have an interesting topic. So I want to get cracking.

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,910
So, Sonatype released a report. Uh, I don't know, like a week or two ago from the time.

20
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:08,389
I don't know.

21
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,319
Anyway,

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,040
it's called the ninth annual

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,040
State of the software supply chain.

24
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,580
And it's, I, I'm gonna, I wanna start out and I even I sent, uh,

25
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:20,860
Brian Fox is like their CTO.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,940
I think I sent him a message the other day. I'm like, holy crap.

27
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,760
You didn't put this behind a web form where I have to, like,

28
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,819
fill out all my information.

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,080
Like,

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,110
thank you so much.

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,889
-- I just realized that when I opened it, I was like, it, it,
-- that's, yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,779
II, I like,

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,360
it's funny because I call them information paywalls

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,800
and then people get grumpy at me.

35
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,589
I'm like, but that's what they are. I'm,

36
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,589
I'm giving you my information.

37
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,669
Well, but ok, just not to segue for a second. But

38
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:48,949
there are also times where I want to give them my

39
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,629
information and I actually do want their newsletter or whatever.

40
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:55,105
Like I do, actually, I want to sign because if they have good information in a report,

41
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:56,654
chances are I might want to like,

42
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,845
-- like when this thing comes out next year, tell me, I'm
-- sure

43
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,885
sonatype has a sign. Up for our newsletter link somewhere on their web page

44
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:04,675
for

45
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:04,864
it.

46
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:05,964
-- I'd never
-- look

47
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:06,985
whatever. No.

48
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,684
Ok. Ok. I'll give you this.

49
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:13,514
I would be comfortable with a website that said you may optionally give

50
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:17,445
us your personal information or click this button to download the report.

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,850
-- Well, anyway,
-- I know a lot like ours. We, we, I think we force you to

52
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:23,619
do a log

53
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,089
thing,

54
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,250
but you also default to not

55
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,369
spamming you.

56
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,070
I get a lot of CS A email.

57
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,570
-- So click
-- unsubscribe,

58
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,039
I'm lazy and some of your stuff is all right.

59
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,520
So

60
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:35,350
I, I

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,160
actually,

62
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:41,880
I just today unsubscribed from OS S security because I realized I've

63
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,839
been filtering it and not reading it for like five years.

64
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,589
I think I'm still subscribed to that actually.

65
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,130
Well,

66
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,110
all of it goes to spam anyways because like they

67
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:50,639
don't have their DKIM and SPF and everything set up,

68
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:50,839
right?

69
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,639
Like they don't rewrite the from and all that

70
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,050
for A R C.

71
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,270
Ok.

72
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:59,000
-- Off track already.
-- Which kind of ties into this open source thing where

73
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,720
basically everything is the same but worse but better.

74
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,039
OK. So

75
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:08,080
I have one specific data point I really want us to talk about because fundamentally,

76
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,270
I think

77
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,490
nothing in here should surprise anyone.

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,710
Like open source use is going up, the open source development is going up.

79
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,869
-- I was actually shocked to see it apparently dipped a bit like
-- what the use or the,

80
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,639
-- yeah, the growth rate the
-- growth

81
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:24,949
-- rate of one
-- of those,

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
the growth rate dipped because like we have 95% of the market.

83
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,550
Well, and, and it might be that I think the growth rate they're talking about

84
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,050
is the, like

85
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:40,496
the, the speed at which new packages are being added to the ecosystem is my,

86
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,195
my understanding I could be misreading that,

87
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,436
but I'm pretty sure that's what that is.

88
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:45,936
I'm not shocked by this just because

89
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,175
there's a lot of freaking open source right now.

90
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:49,466
It's

91
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:49,675
pretty, it,

92
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:55,485
it's getting mature and I think you're just not seeing the volume of new stuff.

93
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,615
And now I do have some of my,

94
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,061
my graphs from like N PM and stuff. I started pulling my data from the

95
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,942
ecosystems dot E

96
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:04,912
ecosystem

97
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:07,531
S, I'll put a link in the show notes. A

98
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,231
guy named Andrew Nesbitt

99
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:13,761
runs this site that has tons and tons and tons of open source metrics.

100
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,052
And it was funny because at one point he's like, oh yeah,

101
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,002
you can hit my API it'll take it.

102
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,361
And like a week ago he emailed me.

103
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,861
He was like, can I just give you some files to download instead

104
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:22,022
of

105
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:23,182
-- I'm
-- like, this is,

106
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:24,641
this is the thing I love about

107
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:25,671
github is

108
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,420
if you have your data source in github, not only can I just go go

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,459
the whole thing.

110
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:30,839
There

111
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,109
-- is
-- like, this is like 10 gigabytes of data.

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,450
I

113
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:33,589
know.

114
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,920
-- Well, you pay for those one gigabyte data packs.
-- Why, why would anyone do that?

115
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,320
-- That's, that's, they're shockingly expensive.
-- Actually,

116
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:41,670
I guess S3 is a good,

117
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:46,420
another good old or I guess the Amazon R two or Amazon Cloud Flare R two or whatever.

118
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,239
Now, like the one thing that gets me is like, remember when serving

119
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,320
100 megabyte file took,

120
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,200
well, how many people did?

121
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,619
And Red Hat have working with a comite to serve those files. Like,

122
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,350
but anyway,

123
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,640
so the data point I actually think is the most interesting in this report and the one

124
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,320
I want us to talk about because I don't have my thoughts fully formed on this.

125
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:10,000
Only 11% of projects are actively maintained.

126
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm actually shocked it's that high.

127
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,559
Like if you look at the app, no, go to N PM, js.org.

128
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,660
Yeah. Type in a random word

129
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,149
and start

130
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:19,420
up

131
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:20,519
3

132
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,100
million.

133
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,940
Well, ignore all the one like there's a gazillion tutorial upload one.

134
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:26,980
So it,

135
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:30,619
it get rid of all like let's be kind and get rid of everything that's

136
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,200
only been ever updated five times and is

137
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,339
clearly like was some little experiment that got

138
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,480
but still like even stuff that's downloaded thousands

139
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,190
or even millions of times a week.

140
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
-- Now,
-- lots

141
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,880
-- of
-- stuff is downloaded millions of times a week.

142
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,000
Like we were talking about this the other day, like there were some,

143
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,339
I I did a quick spot check of the most kind of popular ones

144
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,269
and there was a couple there that, well,

145
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,230
one was officially deprecated and said go use this other one.

146
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:59,829
But the deprecated one is still being downloaded. It was over 100,000 times a week.

147
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,119
There was one

148
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,779
that is in the millions of downloads a week

149
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,299
and hadn't been updated in over four years.

150
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,480
And it was like the core one. What was it called again? I forget the name of it.

151
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,440
-- But like this is normal.
-- Yeah. No, no, it is. Ok. Well, so

152
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,950
here's the thing I've got in my brain

153
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,589
kind of around all of this.

154
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:20,670
So

155
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:21,910
we have

156
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,899
all of these foundations and people and companies

157
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,000
and everyone talking about supply chain security and

158
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,500
how we need to worry about our CV ES and we need to update our,

159
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,750
our dependencies as fast as possible and all this kind of stuff

160
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,709
and 11%

161
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:41,239
is what we and, and no one even knows this.

162
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,350
I mean, I suspect most companies don't even know what all the open sources they have,

163
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,959
but even fewer

164
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,760
are gonna even know about 11% of the things you're using

165
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,190
are. It's probably not 11% of the things you're using. I I should clarify.

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,040
There's one I think important data caveat here

167
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,239
is like you said,

168
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,179
there's a lot of stuff that is functionally dead or never going to be used,

169
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,600
right?

170
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,359
And there's also a lot of stuff that's done like that.

171
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,670
Like my favorite example always, I mean,

172
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:12,925
-- like it converts a normal national date into that month, day, year thing.
-- And,

173
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,825
and yeah, that, that doesn't need an update and there's, there's a certain amount of

174
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:17,455
let's,

175
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,645
but here's the thing, even if we

176
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:24,585
were generous with how we organize the data and we filtered

177
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,515
things out and we did a whole bunch of work,

178
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:31,466
I think it's still going to be less than 50% of the like actively used open source

179
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,355
is actually maintained at this point.

180
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,885
And then comes the difficult part of how do we know

181
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:41,881
like CV SS style, assign a temporal score of how important is this software?

182
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:42,911
Because for example,

183
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:46,652
there's a big difference between a package that is a

184
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:51,582
well loved and used web server public facing eating attacks

185
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,671
versus

186
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,252
something that doesn't

187
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:55,282
like uh

188
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:59,592
uh a config file parser where it's running on relatively trusted data.

189
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:00,571
That's right. That's right.

190
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:01,421
And then there's of course,

191
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,791
a lot of stuff in between where it's kind of like it turns out like

192
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:05,971
uh what was that one with the file?

193
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:10,630
It was like the file data for CD roms or something that when

194
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,059
Gnome parsed it

195
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,739
-- the Q thing.
-- Oh The Well, so the

196
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,040
gnome one lit lib

197
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,470
QQ. This is a good example because

198
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,910
when you open like a file manager,

199
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,899
this is true of Windows or Mac Os or Gnome or whatever.

200
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,760
When you open the file manager, it gives you that little preview

201
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,079
of what you have.

202
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:29,880
And

203
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,909
if you had a Q file, which most people probably don't anymore.

204
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,070
But let's say you downloaded one from some random place,

205
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,880
you get a zip file and there's one

206
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:38,650
that's

207
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,289
like,

208
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:39,419
I,

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,539
I just had somebody send me a zip file and there

210
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,409
was that Doc Mac Os Blob in there and I'm like

211
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:44,599
a

212
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,530
-- little thumbnails and stuff and I'm
-- like,

213
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:47,929
but anyway,

214
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,780
I mean, like lib Q

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,549
and it's a weird package

216
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,750
that probably won't actually affect a lot of people.

217
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,419
But if it affects you, it does affect you,

218
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,940
-- it'd be
-- very

219
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,349
useful, for example, for targeted attack or, you know,

220
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:03,229
but the thing is the problem is there's a lot of these,

221
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,750
there's a lot of soft

222
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:06,030
where thought

223
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,320
ultimately,

224
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,570
I want to say Ken.

225
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,119
Yes, Ken is the correct word, parse attacker supplied data in not super exotic,

226
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,119
crazy ways, like for sure, mission impossible,

227
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,390
-- whatever stuff.
-- Here's what I have in my brain though, over all this,

228
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,330
let's say 50% of open source is functionally unmaintained. Right.

229
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,849
-- And I'm gonna be generous with that because the,
-- oh, it's more than that. But sure,

230
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,500
the report says 11.

231
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,719
Let's pretend it's not because I think like one

232
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,409
of the things I saw was people nitpicking.

233
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,770
Oh, I don't know if you can actually measure 11% accurately and it's like

234
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,979
the number isn't important

235
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:41,030
because

236
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,719
it's a lot. Right.

237
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,434
This is like 123, more than three, we're dealing with more than three

238
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:47,284
you know what I mean?

239
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,184
The reality is if here's a perfect example on your system,

240
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,244
look at all like on a Linux system, I'm saying, sorry,

241
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,554
look at all your packages installed and what version they are

242
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:55,885
and when the last time they got an update is,

243
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,244
and I'm guessing for some of them it's like, never,

244
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,844
like you install that package with

245
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:04,044
-- Debbie Inversion, whatever. And it's never had an update.
-- Oh, for sure, for sure.

246
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:04,484
There's,

247
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:05,630
yeah, I mean,

248
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,109
unless it has a very serious security vulnerability in it

249
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,750
that is known

250
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,059
you're probably not going to see an update to

251
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,650
the vast majority of this software because quite frankly,

252
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,130
it just,

253
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,169
it doesn't need tons of updates. Right.

254
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,700
I mean, it's not like a web browser where you have constant and consistent updates.

255
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,869
Uh, some of this stuff, like,

256
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,380
if you have a JPEG parsing library, if it doesn't have a critical bug in it,

257
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,549
why would you update that?

258
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,539
You know? However, however, I don't think that's the case

259
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,919
for most of this software. I think most of the open source is

260
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,460
someone released it,

261
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,429
it got used,

262
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,159
they probably updated it a few times

263
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,979
and now for whatever reason

264
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,190
they can't or won't update it.

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
Well, the thing to remember too is ok,

266
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,140
let's say I build a piece of open source and I scratch my itch.

267
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,869
Right. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well, I'm done scratching my itch.

268
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,710
I have other itches to scratch. Yeah. That happens all the time. No,

269
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,804
people forget this.

270
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,604
People forget this, that, like,

271
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,994
I have other things to do with my life and other software.

272
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,784
And so, unless for me personally,

273
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,364
there's something I need for my software that I need to update or

274
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,924
somebody files a bug report and I'm super nice and awesome.

275
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:20,364
Right. Right. And I decide to fix it. Like, unless somebody reports it to me. Like,

276
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,729
and that's the other thing I'm seeing is I'm seeing a lot of,

277
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:23,950
oh,

278
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:26,349
what was that thing I was talking about the other day where there was

279
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,859
a feature request that I'd asked for and I was like the fourth.

280
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh Yeah. Sorry. OK.

281
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,099
So static website generators beginning to hate them because holy cow.

282
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,260
Did they ever make generating a simple website?

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,780
So I was using Jenkins with its um

284
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
default theme of minimum.

285
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,469
Um Hang on a sec. Where is it on github?

286
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,409
I want to actually check the state of the uh here we go.

287
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,830
Minima is a one size fits all, check a theme for writers. And what I would like to do

288
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,309
is put the CS, a logo

289
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,770
on the top left hand corner of the website.

290
00:11:58,989 --> 00:11:59,460
OK.

291
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,010
This seems like a reasonable thing to want. Yes, I would agree.

292
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,099
Yeah. No,

293
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,419
no, the answer is no, I'm not totally surprised.

294
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,679
Like you can't do it without hand editing the

295
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,539
CS S that it generates and stuff like that.

296
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,299
And so I asked for it. Oh, did they close the issue?

297
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,690
So there was an issue, ah, how do I add a site logo?

298
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,440
And somebody else asked,

299
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,679
I'd like to add the site logo on the top left of the site title.

300
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,809
How do I do that context

301
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,549
github pages?

302
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,880
Anyways, blah, blah, blah.

303
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:32,250
And then it gets auto closed. But the thing is if you Google search

304
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,729
like Jekyll

305
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,075
ad logo,

306
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,804
millions of people asking probably, I mean, look going back 10 years.

307
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:43,335
But this is a great example, Kurt of someone needs to

308
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:47,335
build that functionality. It's open source hatch is welcome.

309
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,405
If the author doesn't want to do that.

310
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,280
Ok. Like they don't have to.

311
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,000
No, no, they certainly don't.

312
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,880
But it's just, it's interesting to me that

313
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,530
like because to put it bluntly, the, the minimum theme is kind of on life support like

314
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,030
there are this year

315
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,280
012345, basically five sets of commits for this year. I mean,

316
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,849
I

317
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,400
like again, it's a mature project but does this count as unmaintained?

318
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,159
I mean, it might,

319
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,919
it, I don't know if sonatype,

320
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,359
I don't remember them saying how they measured that.

321
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,799
Like I would guess this council supported because there is activity in the last year

322
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,190
and I'm guessing if there's actually a severe

323
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,059
like security flaw that they'll fix it.

324
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,960
So you just rattled the cobweb in my brain is

325
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,039
the

326
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,679
the metric they used for updated was basically got

327
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,049
an update in 2022 but didn't get an update

328
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,669
in 2022 like basically one from over the span

329
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,809
they measured the previous year had an update,

330
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,679
the current year does not.

331
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,979
And that's a very reasonable way to measure this stuff. But

332
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,000
like you said, in the context of a mature, mature package,

333
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,299
it, it doesn't matter, right?

334
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,380
Because it's mature and you, you maybe won't see updates.

335
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,419
However, however, I don't think that matters either.

336
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:03,140
I think the thing I keep thinking of is there is this like obsession

337
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:08,219
with supply chain security and knowing what you have and updating your stuff.

338
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,070
And the reality is

339
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:16,919
we generally have no idea what things we're using are maybe mature

340
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,400
or abandoned

341
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:24,380
-- or being like maliciously not maintained or, or
-- does the attacker talk to it?

342
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,799
Because

343
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:28,229
remember prior to that, like, remember bash shells shaw came out and we're all like,

344
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,719
oh flaw and bash, OK, that's

345
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,840
whatever

346
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,179
like, OK, what do you mean Apache is what? Like

347
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:37,159
I remember looking at that thinking like

348
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,919
this has got to be a mistake.

349
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,630
Like somebody has some weird version of custom bash Apache that they,

350
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,229
no, that's just how it works. And it's like, oh, well, today I learned

351
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,700
like, no really like I'm open to learning because as we've discovered from like,

352
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,359
like there's all sorts of wonky

353
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,580
interactions on a Linux system. But

354
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,450
if you told me 10 or 20 years ago, I would have been like, that's completely insane.

355
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,140
That should never happen. That's dangerous. And

356
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,119
-- that's how things work.
-- Right. Right. But, but

357
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,940
ignoring, ignoring that point, let's pretend

358
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,520
everything is critical. Right. Because it doesn't really matter.

359
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,349
Well, everything is interrelated. It's an equal

360
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,020
system.

361
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,260
It's

362
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,719
a rain forest and you

363
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,559
affect one thing.

364
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,390
Sure. It's an, it, crowd reference

365
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,909
is it, I don't remember. I haven't watched it crowd in so long

366
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,200
-- when
-- they let, what's his face out of the room? No

367
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,429
fielding, right.

368
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,989
I forget what his name. He's the vampire, right? The goth guy.

369
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,460
-- No,
-- he's not a vampire. He's just very pale and listens to a lot of death metal

370
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:35,330
of filth.

371
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,119
I love

372
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,030
-- through some hard times.
-- I love that show so much.

373
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:39,609
I love,

374
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,359
oh, it's so good anyway.

375
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,049
OK.

376
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:42,919
So

377
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,409
all of this obsession with supply chain and I feel like there's all these unknowns

378
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:50,250
and I don't even think there's a way to measure a lot of this stuff.

379
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,580
Like, how can you tell if a project is mature versus abandon?

380
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:57,289
See, well, I was about to say number one, you have the data aspect of it

381
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,830
of like

382
00:15:58,979 --> 00:15:59,809
looking at the

383
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,400
github

384
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,369
commit history, right? That's data.

385
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,250
But

386
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:08,609
I would argue also maintained is even worse than that because maintained is not just

387
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,400
sort of a factual state, it's an intentional state. And by that, I mean,

388
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,140
you could have a piece of software

389
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,609
with no commits for a year

390
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,000
but with a developer who is eyeballing it every week and just waiting

391
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,159
for someone to file an issue that they're going to fix right away.

392
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,150
-- That's fair. I mean, and, but there's no way to know that. Right.
-- Exactly.

393
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,400
And that's so that, I think that's part of it too is.

394
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,880
So I think what we can do is we can bucket it into three groups

395
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,469
super actively maintained,

396
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,010
you know, things like Apache engine

397
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,080
-- X,
-- which apparently is 11% of open source.

398
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:40,900
Well,

399
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,950
and in a lot of cases, it's the 11% that matters. It's the public facing 11% right?

400
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:47,059
-- And then
-- there's

401
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:48,380
I

402
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:48,750
would say

403
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:48,989
that

404
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:51,919
well, and then there's the bucket of clearly dead.

405
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,619
Like we can set some metric for no updates in 10 years,

406
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,979
no updates in five years

407
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,580
or the developer is actually dead. That also happens.

408
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,450
And then there's everything in the middle, which is like 80% of it.

409
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,920
So this isn't a very helpful set of buckets.

410
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,469
That's, that's part of the problem, right

411
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,670
is we,

412
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,020
we kind of inherently know it's super actively maintained and we kind of know it's,

413
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,180
well, the debt is often surprised. So I'm just gonna again, I'm going to go back to.

414
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,089
So I looked at what was I the 10 most popular N PM packages

415
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,319
and like express

416
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:22,598
a

417
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,108
slow dash moment. We pack Redux babble just and typescript.

418
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,479
So babble is my favorite because the last published babble was seven years ago.

419
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,369
And it says like

420
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:33,689
don't use me use Babble Dash. I forget the name of it.

421
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,910
Oh yeah. Use Babble Dash cli it

422
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,760
gets 100 and 24,000 weekly downloads and on github

423
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,510
-- it's used by 16.9 million.
-- Yeah, I mean Lo Dash is a similar story.

424
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,439
We just talked about Lo Dash. What, like two or three episodes ago.

425
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:49,199
-- It's
-- basically dead as far as I can tell because

426
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:49,219
I

427
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:49,670
Lo Dash

428
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,550
might be coming back to life but

429
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,910
it hasn't had an update on N PM js.org in three years.

430
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,140
It gets 50 million downloads a week.

431
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,520
It's like, so hopefully it's just really well written and mature.

432
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,310
It's not, it's had tons of security issues.

433
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:06,420
Yeah.

434
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,079
And the thing is if some attacker,

435
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,439
I promise the reason there haven't been any in the

436
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:13,239
last year or two isn't because people aren't looking,

437
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,040
I have a suspicion. It's because

438
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,319
there just isn't,

439
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,319
it's not maintained and I think a lot of them would fly under

440
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,479
the radar and it's just our broken CV E system at work.

441
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,479
Well, and that's the thing.

442
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:26,359
Like, it's, it's hard to, if you find something good and publish it,

443
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,790
like you put out a tweet and if it doesn't get traction, like it's,

444
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,839
it's like if a tree falls in a forest and you know,

445
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,439
falls on the lumberjack and kills them,

446
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,199
nobody knows where the lumberjack is.

447
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,160
What really gets me is if you look at low dash for example,

448
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,709
they only have eight issues in github

449
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,619
and

450
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,780
some of them are new because it was dead. But the fact is

451
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,510
-- people filed issues in the last two weeks. So people care,
-- everyone uses it.

452
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,780
-- I think lots of people
-- care. Everybody uses Lib. Jasper. Nobody cares.

453
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,300
Here's what I think I find interesting about care

454
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,780
because I care about my stuff working. But how many people care enough

455
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,849
to actually give money or help

456
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,260
to an open source project. And I think that number is exceedingly small.

457
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,699
Well, it's effectively zero.

458
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,459
Like if you take a big enough number and

459
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,290
-- the ratio is 0 50
-- million

460
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,180
versus

461
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:19,989
50 million

462
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,020
-- a week.
-- Right. Right.

463
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,949
You know, and I feel like we've had those developers where they're like, you know,

464
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:29,650
my software is used on like 70% of the top 100 websites on the planet.

465
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,229
And I've gotten exactly a cup,

466
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:36,079
a cup of coffee at a conference once from some nice old lady.

467
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,810
It wasn't a company

468
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,949
and,

469
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,819
but from the company's point of view, it's like,

470
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,979
so the license says I can use this for free open source.

471
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,219
-- It, it does
-- and that's how open source works. That's fine.

472
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:49,260
And it's not like, actively catching fire.

473
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,699
So, like,

474
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:52,069
why would we put resources into this when

475
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,219
we could put resources into marketing or sales or

476
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,300
my bonus?

477
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,780
Well, here's the other thing

478
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,739
if I am a company

479
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,239
and I pay someone to work on lo

480
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:00,760
dash

481
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:04,530
is that going to impact my sales at all?

482
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,739
No, absolutely not.

483
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:10,880
But if I pay that developer to build features into my product,

484
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,250
will that impact sales?

485
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,819
-- Probably? Yes.
-- Yeah.

486
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,619
See the thing I keep coming back to is I'm looking at this from like the supply chain

487
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,359
and I say security, not in the terms of information security,

488
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,680
but security in terms of like availability more.

489
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:23,579
Where

490
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,859
now what's interesting to me is in traditional classical physical supply chains,

491
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,250
stuff can just

492
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,650
go like it's just not available like the factory burned down, sorry.

493
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,890
No more ra M chips for you, right? That happened once, remember

494
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,209
the Samsung factory burned down and ram prices went to the moon,

495
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,780
not a metaphor or like when hard drives

496
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,790
got expensive because there was flooding in Thailand,

497
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,229
right?

498
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,689
And then all the hard drive for six months

499
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:49,979
afterwards were pretty dodgy because they had to sell something

500
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,819
they needed cash flow, right? No cash flow, no business. So

501
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,650
in software terms,

502
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,329
the software can't really go away outside of

503
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,530
like some really bizarre corner cases like postfix with

504
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,150
that wonky IBM license where IBM is like we can revoke your usage of post fix and

505
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,699
you know,

506
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,020
but double promises swears these will give you something

507
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,089
of equal or better value to replace it.

508
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,270
And everybody was like,

509
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:14,109
I like postfix but like II I just can't deal with that kind of weird ambiguity.

510
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:14,800
So

511
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,609
ignoring

512
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,790
like those seven weird corner cases,

513
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,790
software can't really disappear. Especially if you, like,

514
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,180
just grab a copy of it and fork it or download the Tar Ball or whatever. Like,

515
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,920
software. Absolutely does.

516
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,199
Like archive.org is a great example of stuff can disappear. Right.

517
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,089
There used to be a nice website at sun.com.

518
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,439
Yeah.

519
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,359
That's right. Yeah.

520
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,489
And then one day it went away, generally speaking, if you're reasonably competent,

521
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,930
you don't have to worry about your, your software supply chain suddenly going

522
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:42,650
kof.

523
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:46,609
Right. That's right. You know, and I think that's why it gets ignored a lot. Right.

524
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,880
I mean, even the supply chains, we have physical supply chains,

525
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,250
there is actually a really good podcast.

526
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,380
I'm going to put a link in the show notes. Um, it's called Reality Two Point. Oh,

527
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,520
it's, uh, Doc Searls and Catherine drunk.

528
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,939
And they just talked to a supply chain guy.

529
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:00,079
I don't know what

530
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,459
in my feed I listened to it yesterday.

531
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:05,219
I don't, I'm way behind those so I don't know how long ago it came out.

532
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,140
But anyway,

533
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,469
like this guy had some really interesting stories.

534
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:11,930
This is a, a, like, literal brick and mortar supply chain person.

535
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,930
Right. And

536
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:16,739
you think prior to a year ago or two years ago,

537
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,699
no one thought twice about supply chain stuff because it all basically just worked.

538
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:24,660
And now he's like, now everyone wants to talk to me. Right.

539
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,819
I mean, that's even one of the things they talk about is like, you know,

540
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:27,880
a year or two ago

541
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,755
this podcast would have never happened because, like, cares,

542
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,566
-- it's
-- like pop tarts and plywood.

543
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:35,456
-- Like, nobody cares until there's a hurricane coming. Yeah.
-- That's right.

544
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:37,156
And fortunately though,

545
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:41,495
like Walmart and all those big giants have weather teams that monitor the stuff and,

546
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:42,225
like, premo,

547
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:44,375
everything they've been doing that for decades

548
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:45,906
because then they sell stuff.

549
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:49,156
Yeah. Right. Right. 100%. But you, I think you're right.

550
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:53,475
This is where software doesn't comply to our existing rules. And so much

551
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,171
it is so common now

552
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,411
to try to like pound the

553
00:22:57,661 --> 00:23:01,491
open source square peg into the supply chain round hole

554
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,771
and the parallels just don't make sense.

555
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,131
-- Well, again,
-- I am not your supplier.

556
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:08,761
That's the, I think that's one of the core,

557
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:11,131
fundamental problems of this argument is that we call

558
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,952
it a supply chain and we are inherently framing it

559
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,972
as a supply chain and it's not, it's,

560
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:16,901
I

561
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:20,959
found this book that had some helpful text that

562
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,979
somebody wrote for free and distributed for free,

563
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,520
like baking instructions and now

564
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:29,920
like I expect support from it or something like it's, it's, I, I don't,

565
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:33,979
I'm beginning to not like calling open source of supply chain because it just,

566
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,099
it pigeonholes it into the traditional

567
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:39,040
supply chain metaphors and responsibilities and everything

568
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,060
and some of it I think should overlap.

569
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:45,800
Like if I buy food, I want to know what's in it and not

570
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,949
even just for allergies.

571
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,689
But if I'm buying food from you, I want to know that you have the competency

572
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,010
to know what's in the food.

573
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,989
Perfect example, there's a house

574
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:59,290
about seven or eight houses down that put up a sign in their front yard

575
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,170
saying Somoza is for sale

576
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,319
and a phone number

577
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,010
like delicious. I'm sure the the picture looks good

578
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:05,680
but like

579
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:06,439
samosas, you know,

580
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:06,900
samosas,

581
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,290
so they're selling samosas out of their house. They have a phone number.

582
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,229
-- What is
-- a samosa for people who don't know,

583
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:12,739
it's like a

584
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,989
pastry dough style thing with the filling

585
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:17,410
and then you fry it.

586
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,189
Everyone has

587
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,290
-- and
-- they're delicious.

588
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,900
Anyway, they are good.

589
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,770
I don't know what kind they are like. Could be. Ethiopian could be Indian.

590
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,510
I don't know.

591
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,040
Right.

592
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,040
It doesn't matter.

593
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,060
-- Fried bread with filling is good no matter
-- what fried starchy substance.

594
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,420
But so the thing is like

595
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,520
with software again, if I'm consuming some software,

596
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,050
I kind of want to know that you have the competency

597
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,300
to know what's going in there and you have some degree of

598
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,569
control and Q A and you're not just throwing random junk in.

599
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,979
It's less about the security side of it and

600
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,369
more about you having some basic internal controls.

601
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,829
Like I made this argument a long time ago

602
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,160
with Excel

603
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,910
having a flight simulator in it.

604
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,619
Remember I don't remember this but old versions

605
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,819
of Excel had a flight simulator in them

606
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,489
and I, yes, no. I'm making this up. Yes. Really? I don't know.

607
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,189
You went to a certain cell type, a certain value, blah, blah, blah.

608
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:12,380
And you got dropped into a flight simulator with a joint tape and stuff. All right.

609
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:12,630
II,

610
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,810
I basically wrote an article basically talking about how software

611
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,849
Easter eggs are kind of cute and fun and all,

612
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,479
but they show a lack of control and discipline and if you have these going in,

613
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,630
what else is there?

614
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,829
And the answer is you don't know, maybe,

615
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,469
-- I don't know.
-- Ok.

616
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,680
Do you think the dod wants to buy F-35

617
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,729
control software with a surprise Easter egg in it?

618
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:33,430
I mean,

619
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:34,770
I'm,

620
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:34,920
I

621
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,709
like to say they don't use Excel for that, but they probably do.

622
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:38,349
But

623
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,150
I mean, ok, here's where you lose me in this conversation though

624
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:45,119
is you're talking about controlling your software

625
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,869
and there's kind of two pieces to this.

626
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,369
If I'm working with a vendor,

627
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,630
I expect the vendor to take responsibility for

628
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,150
all the software and the thing they're shipping.

629
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,089
If I'm consuming open source to build a service or something where I'm the vendor

630
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:00,469
that's on you, buddy, then, then it's a very different situation.

631
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:04,530
And I think both of those situations are viewed in a very similar way,

632
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,680
even though they're actually very, very, very different.

633
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,699
And I think it's worse because there's a third way,

634
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:12,410
which is the more common ways you do not directly consume that open source.

635
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,180
You are directly consuming Kernes

636
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,530
and then Kubernetes is like, hey, me and some friends,

637
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,640
I mean, is that any worse than a flight simulator in Excel or is it any different?

638
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,890
-- I should say.
-- Well,

639
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:24,859
in theory,

640
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,609
Kubernetes knows what they're actually pulling in

641
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,209
and isn't pulling in any Easter eggs.

642
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,069
They, they do, they do

643
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,369
-- like, they're pretty good about it, but not everyone
-- is.

644
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,119
And I think that's the problem again, is framing this as I consume open source.

645
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,589
No, I don't, I'm consuming the tip of an iceberg.

646
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,239
I don't know about the iceberg under the water. No, I really don't

647
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,250
like I use open source all the time.

648
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,699
And oh, perfect example.

649
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:48,849
I was um I just wiped my virtual machines on my windows, uh my, my Linux,

650
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,290
whatever they are WSL two things, right? Because

651
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,250
I copied in like 300 gigabytes of data into one and then

652
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,810
I deleted it and it, the file size didn't shrink and I'm like, well, ok,

653
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,010
time to spring clean.

654
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,000
So I deleted them all and created some new ones.

655
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,489
And of course I've been, you know, apt get installing like, oh crap.

656
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,010
I also needed uh poplar for doing some PDF work and this and this and this

657
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,290
and of course some of them like poplar, you, you install that and it's like,

658
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:18,939
I'm going to have to install poplar and these 124 megabytes of stuff.

659
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,900
And I'm like, that's very common. Yes,

660
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,680
because what else am I going to do?

661
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,660
Like, I don't even bother reading it.

662
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,349
I just did that the other day. What did I install?

663
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,790
I installed something and it pulled in like, literally 700 megabytes of crap.

664
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,520
And I was like,

665
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:32,800
oh, well,

666
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,560
yeah, I, what was the thing?

667
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,010
I, I wanted to pull an X and some other stuff and I was like, sure

668
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,119
you do. You buddy,

669
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,849
I just need this thing to work so I can extract text from a PDF or whatever. And so

670
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,300
the thing is like

671
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,270
there's a, there's a degree of trust and sort of compensating controls in that.

672
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm like running this in a container and I'm also using anyways.

673
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:57,010
But the point is that is the more common way of consuming software is I want that

674
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,956
the thing I want, it's like I consume a car.

675
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:00,656
Ok.

676
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,125
Well, I also need to apparently buy windshield wiper,

677
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,676
food and oil for the damn thing like, ok,

678
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:09,406
and like tires, like I, I guess it needs tires they wear

679
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:13,296
out or something. I don't know, man. Like they, they told me I should buy new tires.

680
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:14,206
But the point is

681
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:17,906
that is like three things that are physical and kind of in your face. Whereas

682
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:21,515
software could be pulling in 1000 or 2000 dependencies.

683
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:23,631
-- Look,
-- here's, here's a, here's maybe an example.

684
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:26,682
I don't think it's a good example, but how many screws are in your car?

685
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:27,942
You have? No idea.

686
00:28:27,952 --> 00:28:30,121
I know for a fact there's a lot of plastic clips because

687
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:32,621
when I watched the diagram of how to replace the headlights,

688
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:33,982
I was like, well, we're never doing that.

689
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:37,832
-- Yeah,
-- I know that terrifies me because every time I touch a plastic clip, I,

690
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:39,862
-- it's like,
-- please don't break, please don't break, don't break,

691
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:40,381
please don't break.

692
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,741
And please also

693
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:43,001
did I weaken it?

694
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:44,332
Oh, for sure. Yeah.

695
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,312
-- Exactly.
-- Because I was only meant to go in there once.

696
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,000
Exactly.

697
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,910
So anyway,

698
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,239
and this is,

699
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,599
but the screws in my car

700
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,699
randomly catch fire and fall out.

701
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,640
-- Like most of the time,
-- usually, usually,

702
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,589
I mean, look, I feel like we've been talking about this for like half an hour now

703
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,160
and I don't have

704
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,290
any more insights into what it means.

705
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,989
-- If only 11% of open source is actively maintained.
-- Here's the thought,

706
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,869
what if in S bomb

707
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,630
instead of just having

708
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,430
contains food also had,

709
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:20,000
for example, here's the head end project of food,

710
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,540
like here's the github.com or the wherever it lives officially,

711
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,109
right?

712
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:29,969
And for example, had some information about like, OK, here's like,

713
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:35,209
well, basically you're running food 2.7 and like upstream has like food.

714
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,150
And so you could go check upstream and be like, oh, there's now like f

715
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,829
17.4

716
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:41,050
or whatever

717
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,569
and you could start to

718
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:47,130
gather some data in an automated fashion about like what's the delta between what

719
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,849
we grabbed and where it is and is there stuff in between that matters?

720
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,250
And that's obviously what your company does with CV stuff? Right? Like, yes,

721
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,010
yes.

722
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,119
But what if it was more like also it would go upstream and grab it and say, hey,

723
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:57,510
you know,

724
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,050
there's been no updates in six months, like maybe it's a problem. Maybe it's cool.

725
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,449
I don't know.

726
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:07,810
So the, the open SSF scorecard project is trying to capture some of this data.

727
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,439
But I think the problem is

728
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,459
-- like does, is this data meaningful? Does it matter? Does it work?
-- Not yet?

729
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,390
Because the problem is we don't know if it correlates, let alone

730
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,229
causes anything.

731
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:22,599
-- And
-- I, I think that's the question

732
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:24,719
but without the data, we can't start to begin to

733
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,810
-- figure it out
-- and, and OK, OK,

734
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,560
here's how I want to end this because I think I think you're on a good point.

735
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:34,780
Sonatype says 11% of open source is actively maintained, meaning 89% of it is not,

736
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,219
that feels like a bad thing

737
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,839
but is it

738
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,140
no, everything seems to work? OK.

739
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:47,689
It does work. And I think that's the challenge is starting to unwind the question of

740
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,540
like, is this OK? And if it's not OK, what part of it isn't? OK?

741
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,859
And I think this is where we there's, there's boring,

742
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:58,640
horrible work that needs to be done that isn't going to

743
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,405
be can make a headline on the register or something,

744
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:01,635
right?

745
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:02,515
This is going like

746
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:06,084
11% of open source is maintained. That's an exciting headline.

747
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,714
Everyone's going to latch on to the the story behind.

748
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:11,954
-- It is not going to be exciting, but it's, it's important,
-- right?

749
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:15,734
Well, like what we need is a CS V file from github of all the public

750
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:19,069
github.com/blah/bla

751
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,750
with how many forks, how many stars,

752
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:25,869
-- what uses it and you know, publish
-- that, you can get that easily

753
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,000
and

754
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,359
well, and then,

755
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,689
and then you need to start processing and

756
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:32,199
figuring out what if anything it actually means

757
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,040
-- and it may not mean anything,
-- someone needs to do that work.

758
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,920
And there's going to be a lot of false starts.

759
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,920
There's gonna be a lot of like, oh, this feels important but, oh, it turns out it's not

760
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:45,160
like I have no doubt the number of stars a project have is completely meaningless

761
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,760
because there have been so many times I've had people say like, oh,

762
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,229
you should go start my project.

763
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:49,709
And I'm like,

764
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,170
I don't want to,

765
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:55,050
I actually had that happen where a Dev was like, this project only has one star.

766
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,640
We can't use it. And I'm like, what

767
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:57,510
I mean?

768
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,859
One star is

769
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:02,229
maybe questionable. I don't know.

770
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:04,750
-- It's hard to say. Does it matter? I don't
-- know.

771
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,300
It's for kind of an obscure thing.

772
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,930
That's just it too. Exactly.

773
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:11,630
-- Like,
-- so among obscure things, one star might be pretty damn good. Yeah.

774
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,550
Yeah, we don't know.

775
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:12,989
Anyway,

776
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,030
says podcast, like, what's our rating.

777
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:18,864
-- Like no, seriously. Right. Like we're kind of a niche thing.
-- So we are very niche.

778
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:20,824
I have a suspicion.

779
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:23,805
We do. Well, so I, what, what are we at now?

780
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:27,574
We do like 6000 downloads a week, basically give or take.

781
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:30,685
-- So between five and six we'll say to be generous.
-- Ok.

782
00:32:30,694 --> 00:32:32,385
So that means we have approximately,

783
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,770
uh, what's, uh, I can't do these big numbers in my

784
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:36,060
head.

785
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,890
But remember some people are downloading the whole back catalog in one go.

786
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,050
Right. We have hundreds of episodes at this point.

787
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:43,640
I

788
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:43,920
don't

789
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,770
know what that means.

790
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:50,250
And maybe it's a lot. Maybe it's not, I don't know. Luckily we don't have to care.

791
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,609
We have approximately

792
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:56,229
0.0013% of the global podcast listening market.

793
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:56,869
I mean,

794
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,630
maybe II, I

795
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,310
imagine it's not huge, but I don't know.

796
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,989
Well, 6000 out of 464 million, that's the thing.

797
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,030
Even like with podcast data, I, I tried to look up one time of like,

798
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,770
what's the average, like, what is normal for podcast downloads?

799
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,270
And what does all this stuff look like?

800
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,069
-- Well, it's going to be a Power Distribution Law. It's,
-- it, I, I have no idea.

801
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,250
I can't figure anything out.

802
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,385
I don't, it doesn't make sense. And luckily we don't have sponsors. We don't care.

803
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,505
Like,

804
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,556
and somebody pointed out this is one of the problems

805
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,475
with Spotify and like a lot of these streaming services,

806
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,936
why the streaming services don't want to give the data to like the se

807
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:30,625
and the Writers guild and stuff is because

808
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:32,645
there's probably shenanigans going on with the

809
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:34,485
numbers where they're telling the advertisers.

810
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:37,895
Oh, yeah, like a gazillion people looked at that thing.

811
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:41,526
So here's your bill and then, you know, to the writers and the IP owners, it's like,

812
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,276
oh, it's kind of sad, like only four people watch

813
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:43,472
your

814
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:44,541
show this week. Sorry.

815
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,141
Well, and that's the beauty is we, we have so little data,

816
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,381
the meaningful data that we could just make stuff up.

817
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:49,901
That's right.

818
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:54,322
Exactly. It's, I mean, this comes back to like, what's the old advertising saying?

819
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,521
Half of your advertising money is wasted. You just don't know which half

820
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:59,521
like I feel like that's what all this metrics

821
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:01,802
-- for open source and everything is or
-- even better.

822
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:03,891
Uh N pr just, they left Twitter.

823
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,862
Yes, apparently didn't matter

824
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,971
-- 1%.
-- So I could have told you that like, this is one of the things,

825
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,699
you know, I've been publishing a lot of blog posts and podcasts for a long time.

826
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,250
So I have like years of evidence behind this.

827
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,330
And I can tell you now that when we had like

828
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,719
an episode tweet or something that blew up and got like,

829
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:22,830
you know, like thousands and thousands of retweets and likes and stuff,

830
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,590
the amount of web traffic I saw barely moved.

831
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,270
The only thing I see that makes web traffic go up like crazy. Is hacker news?

832
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,310
That is the only site love it or hate it.

833
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,110
But, like, that's the only thing I've

834
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,475
seen to meaningfully change our

835
00:34:37,764 --> 00:34:40,554
web traffic for, for open social security dot com.

836
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,034
Well, but also we're small enough that it can mean, like,

837
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,955
if we had a million listeners, hacker news wouldn't statistically

838
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:47,594
true. That could very well be.

839
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:47,745
That

840
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:48,715
thing is,

841
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:49,145
yeah.

842
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,833
Yeah. Anyway. All right. All right. So I guess this is what I'll say.

843
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:54,175
I'm going to end. The show

844
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:54,824
is

845
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:59,868
11% sounds bad because we're like humans and we don't know better,

846
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:03,229
but we honestly have no idea if it's good or not and someone needs to do the

847
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,658
research and the research is going to be boring and it's not going to get a headline.

848
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,708
So it may, it may never get done

849
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:13,099
academia. Hopefully, I, I hope academia latches on to this because

850
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:16,678
like this, this date is really important. Is it? I think it is.

851
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,979
Here's, here's an example, I'll, I'll leave on

852
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:24,099
it. I would say it's kind of like testing screws, right. Our cars are full of screws

853
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:28,159
and there are what probably millions of pages have been written

854
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,840
about how to test the durability and strength of a screw.

855
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,479
-- Do you think it's ever made a headline?
-- Know a scary lot about this?

856
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:37,469
Oh, you want to talk about sheer strength of screws?

857
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,020
And there's these new things called hurricane

858
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,290
nails that are not technically a screw,

859
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,159
but kind of like a screw.

860
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:44,719
-- But like, seriously their po strength is insane. They're so cool.
-- You get the idea.

861
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,830
But how many of those are making headlines

862
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,439
in the news? It doesn't because, like,

863
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,479
unless you're in the obscure universe of really caring about screws, which there,

864
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:54,699
there are a lot of people who do and thank

865
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:57,139
goodness there are because society wouldn't function without them.

866
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:57,560
-- But you know what
-- I

867
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:57,919
mean?

868
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,360
Like the international Fastener show, like,

869
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,520
seriously some of the stuff coming out of there is um I watched a youtube video on it.

870
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,399
It's insane.

871
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,520
I bet, I bet it is. But you know what I mean?

872
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,080
And I think a lot of this open source stuff, the data we need is similar.

873
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,800
It's, it's, it's interesting to people like us who are like weird open source,

874
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,610
you know, security nerds,

875
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,639
but for literally everyone else,

876
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,750
-- well, it's plumbing if
-- we do it properly

877
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,959
and it works, it just

878
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:24,280
-- people call a plumber once every 10 years. And like, that's
-- right.

879
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,840
-- Don't have to care anyway.
-- All right, it's time to go. Thank you, Kurt.

880
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,290
