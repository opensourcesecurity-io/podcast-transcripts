Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:10,960
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,930
-- Josh
-- Pressers.

3
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,210
Oh, it's Thought Crime again. That's very exciting. We have

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,390
a

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,640
ghost.

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:15,189
Yeah,

7
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,520
I know we do. I'm super excited. We are here.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,959
We have the man, the myth, the legend,

9
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:24,200
Larry Cash Dollar who is a senior security researcher at Akamai Technologies.

10
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,389
We have talked about Larry literally for years

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,489
and he's finally honored us with his presence.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,940
Larry, welcome to the show.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,380
Hey, it's great being here. We are ecstatic. So I guess we

14
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:35,034
start out, tell us who you are,

15
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:38,534
tell us what you do and then we'll get into some of the why you're here.

16
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:39,584
So I'm Larry Kasher.

17
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:40,884
I work at

18
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:45,224
a my technologies in the, the security intelligence response team.

19
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,825
And generally they sort of pay me to look for

20
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,384
either vulnerabilities on the internet threats on the internet.

21
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:54,974
-- So it's sort of like being paid to break things and write about them. So
-- awesome.

22
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,865
-- Awesome. And Kurt I'll let you do the honors. Why is Larry
-- here?

23
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,415
Well, because that one year he broke CV.

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,430
-- Oh, he didn't break CV, but he screwed up. All the stats. All right.
-- Let's go.

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,569
Why don't you?

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,669
Well, I guess Larry's here, Kurt doesn't have to explain what happened.

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,879
Larry, tell us what you've done.

28
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,769
-- I'm
-- assuming the year you're talking about is when I started

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,410
attacking Ruby Jams. Right.

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,480
Yeah. So the back story to this goes, I was bored

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,639
and looking for something to poke at on the internet.

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,559
That might be interesting to find vulnerabilities in.

33
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,639
And I noticed that there wasn't a lot of stuff for Ruby Jam.

34
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,660
So I decided to download a bunch of them and

35
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,940
just start looking through them at places where easy stuff,

36
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:41,239
you know, low hanging fruit where folks were

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,680
pulling in user supply data into, you know,

38
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,080
functions that were shelling out so you can get

39
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,099
command injection and found a bunch of stuff.

40
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,040
So I guess there were no

41
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:56,860
that impacted Ruby gems until I started poking at them and found a bunch.

42
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,180
-- So I don't remember how many, but it was a bunch. Wait,
-- there were none

43
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,000
-- before that.
-- I think there might have been one. Wow,

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,129
that's madness.

45
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,839
This is common for most of these large ecosystems.

46
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,820
Like if you look at Ruby gems or node or whatever,

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,339
they generally are quietly ignored,

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,720
-- chug along and
-- I don't know if I'd say that's necessarily true anymore.

49
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:20,460
I mean, it might have been back in the day for sure,

50
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,380
still ecosystems that are vastly ignored like every web

51
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,759
-- browser that's not Firefox chrome or edge or
-- Safari?

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,300
That's fair. That's fair. OK? So

53
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,220
we're not going to argue about this. Larry's here talking to Larry.

54
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,779
And I'm curious because one thing I noticed is

55
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,559
with the research you did on the Ruby gems is

56
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,750
you sort of set a cut off for like these

57
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,979
actually sort of have to matter like command injection,

58
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,740
for example.

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,380
Yeah, I was looking for code execution really was my thing for that.

60
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,660
I have this joy which I'm sure everybody else

61
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,179
has of getting code injection or command injection on,

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,979
on stuff. So that, that's what I was looking for.

63
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,320
And they were relatively easy to find just

64
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,830
looking for functions that would shell out,

65
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:04,399
you know, if somebody was executing a curl command and then sticking in

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:04,669
a

67
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,740
user supply data into the command line to for a query parameter

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,779
on the URL that I was looking for stuff like that.

69
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:14,979
And I found a bunch. So it was, it was a lucrative enterprise for me.

70
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:18,270
OK? But I mean, so you have a story to tell here.

71
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:23,169
I, I remember this has been like 100 years ago. I think you,

72
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,089
you I gave you my,

73
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,210
my, my B sides badge in Vegas one year and we had dinner together and

74
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,820
you're I I still I I must say, OK, so most people don't know this. So

75
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,929
uh this is like man, this 100 years ago, Larry basically puts on Twitter.

76
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,929
Hey does anyone have a Bides badge and I had an

77
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,479
one and I was like, I will give it to you but you have to come get it.

78
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,330
And I feel like a huge dirt bag because like,

79
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,899
you brought your whole family and you guys, like,

80
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,800
walked clear across Vegas and it's like, well, for, you know, FFS Larry,

81
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:53,960
I would have freaking brought it to you don't drag your whole family out.

82
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,710
But, but anyway,

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,190
we had a lovely evening because we went and had dinner and everything.

84
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,059
But you told me the story of kind of what you

85
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,229
did and how you found this and what all happened.

86
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,679
So recount that story for us because I think it's super interesting.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,899
Is this the SG story or is this,

88
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,139
I have a lot of stories.

89
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,110
-- So you have to,
-- well specifically how you,

90
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,789
how you found all these Ruby Gems because it's not like

91
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,820
it's not like you went in and did it all by hand.

92
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,420
You actually had some automation that helped you do all this.

93
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,820
Yeah, I was,

94
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,839
I was a dork and I downloaded all the Ruby Gems

95
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,910
which was probably what like 10 megabytes back then at least,

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,420
right?

97
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,459
I can't remember how much disk

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,839
space it took it, it, it didn't take as much as you think.

99
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:39,019
But, but I ended up downloading all of them.

100
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,970
I think I scraped the page,

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,119
the Ruby Gem page and then parsed the html data to spit out the download URL

102
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,230
S and then pump it into a shell script and then downloaded all the URL S

103
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,290
or all of the uh the Ruby Gems and

104
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:54,510
then another script went through and un decompressed them.

105
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,309
I think they were Targ

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,839
zips that converted over and, and then

107
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,929
I ran a bunch of

108
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,470
other shell scripts to go through the code and look for key phrases, you know, like,

109
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,910
like uh execution commands or shell out commands

110
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,549
and, and you know, and then that created files that I could look at, you know,

111
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,170
to target is this piece of user input

112
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,975
being sent to something that is being passed to the shell and can I

113
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:22,625
stick a semicolon in there and get, you know, to execute ID?

114
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,535
So it was, it was a lot of fun.

115
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,454
I had to stop after months of doing that

116
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:30,255
because I started to have dreams about Ruby Gems,

117
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,359
which is, it's going to lead you to a psychotic episode eventually. If you're,

118
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,339
if you're dreaming about command injection and Ruby Gems, and you're

119
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,820
dreaming about code and

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,339
assigning IP addresses to people

121
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:47,459
in your dreams and it's time to take a break and walk away from that.

122
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,015
So it, it was getting pretty and

123
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:53,595
then I moved on, I think to wordpress plugins. So

124
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,105
-- that's
-- a healthy choice.

125
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,954
Those are equally more,

126
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,355
they were more fun. So

127
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,714
that's awesome. OK. So I guess this is

128
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,714
super interesting to me is

129
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,730
so you had all these, I guess, maybe bugs.

130
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,750
And how did you make, like,

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,140
how did you verify you were actually dealing with something real?

132
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,950
Because I think one of the,

133
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,190
the enormous challenges when you're bug hunting is figuring out, you know,

134
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,290
kind of the ham from the spam of the things

135
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,929
that cannot be exploited versus the things that can.

136
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,869
Yeah, I like to do proof of concepts for everything. So I would,

137
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,869
it was a real pain to try and

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,779
verify these bugs because some of these gems were

139
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,119
sort of,

140
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,859
you know, there was like this very small gem that would,

141
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,769
it was a little library that somebody wrote

142
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:44,799
to download,

143
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:49,970
like using curl to download binary packages or websites that you pointed at.

144
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,769
So I had to

145
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,640
try and put that

146
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:52,880
in a,

147
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,630
in a ruby environment that I could actually get it to run and execute and it

148
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,119
was tedious and in some cases near impossible

149
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,029
and annoying to just do something quickly.

150
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,690
So I started to target stuff like someone had implemented an FTP Damon ruby gem,

151
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,519
which it was a, it was a project that you could launch

152
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,250
and it would, it would have an FTP server that would listen on port 21

153
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:19,140
and you could FTP to it and, and use it like a regular FTP server,

154
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:22,260
except all of the commands that you were sticking in

155
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,769
the FTP server side were being shelled out to EXEC.

156
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,679
So if you did an LS

157
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,690
semicolon, ID, semicolon.

158
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,170
You'd get a listing of files and you were running his route.

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,089
So.

160
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,380
Oh, my goodness. So that was one of one of the fun Ruby J

161
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,450
ones that I had found.

162
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,579
Well, I mean, I, I remember when I had to go through one code base and I,

163
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,029
to introduce myself, I just looked for their temp vulnerabilities

164
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,000
and they had about, they had 13

165
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,160
and one of them was, they'd actually written

166
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,489
a

167
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,980
function to exec

168
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,850
bash.

169
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,950
It was about seven or eight lines long and they almost got it right.

170
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,309
They were so close if they'd included, oh, exec,

171
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:02,910
they would have been OK.

172
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,170
But like, yeah, sometimes people have to accomplish something and I, they,

173
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,019
they choose these, like Rube Goldberg machines

174
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,119
because that's kind of what they know or I, I don't know,

175
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,769
like, what, what are your thoughts on this Larry?

176
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,799
Because I, I feel like a lot of software flaws,

177
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:22,720
especially in these gem sort of plug in ecosystems.

178
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,649
You get these developers who like, I know how to do this. So like

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,440
everything I accomplish is done via this method.

180
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,920
Oh II,

181
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,140
I know what it's like to be on the development end

182
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,969
of that as a researcher a couple of years ago,

183
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,640
I, I, well, maybe two or three years ago I, I wrote my own web server and see,

184
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,900
uh years ago.

185
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,450
Yeah, it runs my website right now. This is not RFC compliant.

186
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,030
It's it's, it's pretty crappy code. It works.

187
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,179
You heard it here if you want to P

188
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:52,099
Larry?

189
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:53,559
Oh, it is.

190
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,549
So, so I wrote this web server.

191
00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:00,940
I had fixed a bunch of bugs in it and I sent it to a friend of mine, his name is Vlad.

192
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,309
He's in France. He's my, one of my hacker friends.

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,799
He's really good with C and, and kernel development and things like that

194
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,809
and he's, you know, CTF

195
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,169
er

196
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,669
type guy. And I'm like, hey, why don't you look for V

197
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,609
abilities in this?

198
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,500
He's like, sure. And he compiles it on the system and he's running it and

199
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,469
he's like, hey, I have, I found a path transferal

200
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,820
bug and I'm like, what? He's like, oh yeah. And I got code execution.

201
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,130
I'm like, what the hell?

202
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:27,489
And I'm like, what the hell's going on? I'm like, all right. Hang on a second, man.

203
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,820
You're having a free for all on this. What, what did I do?

204
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,210
And I went through and I looked at my code and I realized that I had disabled

205
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:36,330
a function that I wrote to strip out any

206
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,559
malicious characters because I was doing some testing with

207
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,320
Aami network. What I, what I had done was I had put

208
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,270
my web server which, which was running off of a Raspberry Pi. I put it on

209
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:51,919
a network. So imagine a content delivery network that's got 150,000 servers

210
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:54,400
and they're using this little Raspberry Pi

211
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,400
uh as an origin server for my website,

212
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,950
vapid dot DH s.org.

213
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,830
So

214
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,799
which isn't on the CD N anymore? It's, it's Vapid

215
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,570
labs.com. It's on CD N now. So it was uh it was pointing at my web server and I had,

216
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,590
you know, all of

217
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,659
my like enterprise level solutions, like on my website, I have

218
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:14,994
w

219
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,015
you know, I had their DNS solution.

220
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,965
So my, my name servers like distributed or my DNS is distributed across

221
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:22,364
a

222
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,825
DNS clusters globally.

223
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:25,794
And

224
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,505
I had disabled the security features of my

225
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,484
web server because I was doing testing with

226
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:35,075
a WF because one of the things I did a lot of back then was attacking my own website

227
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,460
and um testing

228
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:36,929
my

229
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:37,070
uh

230
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,450
W

231
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,039
signatures and things.

232
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,960
So I had disabled this function

233
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,700
and then

234
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,719
stupidly sent it to my friend who,

235
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:45,719
you know, was

236
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:50,219
honing my, my software left and right because this, this was letting in every,

237
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,030
every character and field and thing that he uh

238
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
that he could throw at it.

239
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,799
And it was, I just felt like an idiot, you know, it's like, what were you?

240
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,320
I wasn't even thinking about

241
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,679
the security of it. I was just thinking about, you know, will a core dump on a system.

242
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,500
So I ended up, you know, it was, it was,

243
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,659
I knew what it was like to be a developer at that point.

244
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,700
And it's, it's, I've seen, you know, both sides of the coin where,

245
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,500
you know, you're,

246
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,179
you're looking for vulnerabilities and then you're writing software,

247
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,369
but not necessarily

248
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,179
thinking about security first.

249
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,859
And I, I being a researcher, I tripped over my own shoelaces there, you know,

250
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,820
so I kind of understand how developers can

251
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,789
make mistakes when they're doing the gold

252
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:27,280
borg

253
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,719
type implementations on their software.

254
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, and this goes back to

255
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,679
something Kurt and I have talked about

256
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,020
multiple times

257
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:38,450
is you literally know what you're looking for and you

258
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,729
know what you're doing and you still made mistakes.

259
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,739
So expecting anyone to write bug free code

260
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,200
is a ridiculous expectation.

261
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,450
And I think it's worse with security

262
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:50,224
bugs because they're not immediately apparent,

263
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:50,434
right?

264
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:51,635
Like they need to be triggered.

265
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,994
You know, it's not like, oh, the background is the wrong shade of blue.

266
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,965
Let's fix that or, oh, it doesn't work at all. It just core dumps.

267
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,775
You know, the security bug is,

268
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:00,474
well, you know,

269
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:04,275
we've had those bugs in bash and open cell that were there for decades before

270
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,075
somebody found them.

271
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:07,304
It could be something really nuanced.

272
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:11,914
I remember I was looking at a, uh, a wordpress plug in with, I had an intern

273
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:14,354
that we had taken in on the

274
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,934
A my cert team and uh she was an intern from MIT

275
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,940
and she was studying computer science and she was really interested in,

276
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,099
in security vulnerabilities.

277
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:22,909
And I'm like, you know what

278
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm like, let's find security holes together.

279
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,099
I said I'll download a random wordpress plug in.

280
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,619
So it's how cocky I was

281
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,539
back then and we'll look for holes in it.

282
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,559
And so we downloaded it. I set up a wordpress instance on our local machine

283
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,210
and sold the plug in. And so we started poking at it.

284
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,320
I realized,

285
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,520
or we soon realized that it had cross site scripting vulnerability which,

286
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,570
which was pretty easy to find and it was, you know, fun to exploit.

287
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,729
But I also found out in that same field, it had SQL injection.

288
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,840
So

289
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,929
we came up with two payloads, one to execute

290
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,250
the cross site scripting vulnerability and one to execute or,

291
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,760
or verify that there was SQL injection.

292
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,580
So it was kind of like a funny,

293
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,200
you know, the same

294
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:09,020
user input field on this was vulnerable to cross site scripting and SQL injection.

295
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,750
And we had to come up with two different payloads.

296
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,820
And um you know,

297
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,659
when she was all excited because she got to find a vulnerability with me and,

298
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,150
and, you know, actually see the process of looking for security holes. It was fun.

299
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,500
And now did that get one or two CV?

300
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:21,890
-- I,
-- I

301
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,349
think we ended up with four. I can't remember.

302
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,359
Nice because I think there was multiple

303
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:31,200
fields that also had other other vulnerabilities.

304
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,679
I don't remember what year that was was that 2017?

305
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:35,575
I don't know,

306
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,395
it was all hundreds of years ago.

307
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,625
-- This is
-- one thing I love when

308
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:43,284
people think that finding security vulnerabilities is hard

309
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,354
and it's,

310
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,715
I mean, it, it is,

311
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:48,515
there's a certain type of skill

312
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:49,554
and tooling to it.

313
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,114
But from what I've seen, you know,

314
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,604
just downloading literally like you downloading random code and looking at

315
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,315
it, it, it all has bugs and security flaws.

316
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,929
So, so back in the day before I was doing this in the

317
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,200
a of my

318
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,770
cert, I'd say like 2005, 2006,

319
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,719
I used to look at Trade Max

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,799
and look for software that they're advertising

321
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,770
like Linux

322
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,979
based software.

323
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,460
And then if they had a free demo, I would download it

324
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,409
and then I would just start poking at that

325
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,950
and I would find security bugs that way, you know,

326
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,700
bounce a couple of temp vulnerabilities that way. I think I found path

327
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,190
Veral in some software too.

328
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,239
So it was like, you know,

329
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,650
I was sort of shopping for something to attack by looking at a trade magazine.

330
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,210
Ok.

331
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:34,750
But now let me, let me ask you a follow up to that is so back in those days,

332
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,690
how often did you report an issue to a company?

333
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,750
And they basically said, go away nerd, we don't care.

334
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,250
You know, I actually lucked out pretty well. I,

335
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:47,349
all the companies that I had talked to were pretty receptive. So

336
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,109
I managed to, I mean, I've had, I have research friends who were sued

337
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,210
by, you know,

338
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,789
application developers because they

339
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:59,549
found a security hole in their I OS app, their, their mobile app and, you know,

340
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,030
they ended up having to deal with lawyers and court issues and I,

341
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,150
I lucked out maybe they just thought that

342
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,570
my name was fake and I'd be too hard to track down.

343
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,809
I, I love how that is a recurring theme with everybody.

344
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,010
You know, when I, when I talk about you, you know,

345
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,880
and when I know I've actually met him and that is his name.

346
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,789
Yes,

347
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
it's such a good name. You got to admit,

348
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:26,599
I do see people on some of the forums that defend my name, defend your name.

349
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:32,359
Yeah, saying it's real. I saw when I disclosed the Blue imp vulnerability that

350
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,090
Jquery file upload vulnerability. And I think that was 2018,

351
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,979
I was looking on a forum and I saw

352
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,489
one of my former Akamai

353
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,349
employees or employee or wasn't my employee, but he was an a

354
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,330
my employee uh

355
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,809
from the

356
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,719
Infosec group

357
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:51,330
and he was talking to people on Reddit saying no, Larry is his real name.

358
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,869
He's a nice guy and, and it's not made up and,

359
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,849
and that's because they were, they were having a debate on this Reddit,

360
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,190
you know that whether I was a real name or not. So it was a, it's pretty funny.

361
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,090
That's awesome.

362
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,650
Ok. OK.

363
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,510
So I guess 11 last question and then we'll move away from, from talking about the,

364
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,190
your, your ruby gem research.

365
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,190
So you found all these problems and then you got C VS for them,

366
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,429
which I think is amazing because I don't think

367
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,270
many researchers who find lots of problems do this.

368
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,750
So

369
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:24,109
how, I mean, how did that work? How was that painful? What did you have to do?

370
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:29,630
Because I know back then Miter was a lot harder to deal with than they are today for CV.

371
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,619
-- Si
-- remember folks were giving me ideas like

372
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,070
you should have a month of Ruby Jam vulnerabilities

373
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:40,159
and release a vulnerability once a day or you should release them all at once. And

374
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,729
I, I think I just pretty much would let me

375
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,159
know that I had, you know, a vulnerability and that I'd need a CV E

376
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,080
and they were,

377
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:51,989
I mean, they were pretty good, you know, they were pretty good to me.

378
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,039
Then they just would,

379
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,830
I think they had the cycles to process everything.

380
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,049
And then I think after that things just started to get overloaded and then

381
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,020
Kurt had to step in and start

382
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,199
create fork of his own

383
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,280
distributed weakness filing. So,

384
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,829
but I think that I think my,

385
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,469
I don't know if my thing broke it or not.

386
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,858
I know for sure. I skewed the stats for Ruby gem

387
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:20,010
vulnerabilities. I remember Steve Christie and Brian Martin

388
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,709
reaching out to me and saying,

389
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,829
hey, uh we're gonna make you famous and I'm like, what?

390
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,270
And they're like, yeah, we're,

391
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,390
we're doing a talk at black hat and we have a slide with you in it.

392
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:31,859
And I'm like, oh,

393
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,699
and I, you know, I don't really trust Steve or Brian too much. So, it's like, are they,

394
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,250
are they being

395
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,780
friendly, funny or they being malicious?

396
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,459
Like, I don't really know how to interpret these guys too much yet, you know.

397
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,579
So,

398
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,449
so I, I was talking about in my group, like, I just got a threat from,

399
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,329
from Steve

400
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,589
Steve

401
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:55,015
and uh

402
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:58,354
and Brian Martin and I, I'm not sure to be scared or happy.

403
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:01,234
So I reached out to like, I think it was Dave Lewis and I'm like, do you know

404
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:02,405
Brian Martin? Really?

405
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,354
Well, and he's like, yeah, he's a good guy and I'm like, why I'm like, well,

406
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:05,954
I'm scared.

407
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:08,064
He's like, no, don't be scared. He's like I talk to him.

408
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,275
He's like, it's gonna, it's gonna be good. And I'm like, ok,

409
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:11,515
so

410
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:14,155
my, I think the, the CSO

411
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:15,824
A Andy Ellis found out

412
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,060
and he's like, you have a slide deck,

413
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,089
they're doing the talk of black hat. There's a slide deck on you.

414
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,020
He's like, you need to be there.

415
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,959
He's like, you're going and I'm like, ok, he's like, we're gonna get you

416
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,089
tickets to Black Hat. And I'm like, oh, nice.

417
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,239
And you know, this was, I had just joined

418
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,479
Akamai

419
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,500
from, or I had just joined the Infosec group from the UNIX group

420
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,579
and the Infosec group was all about, you know, you could go to

421
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:41,880
all sorts of um conference and things. So it was, it was like,

422
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,910
it was sort of like being on the price is right?

423
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,579
And being showered with gifts, you know,

424
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,349
because you're not used to going to conferences when you're in UNIX administrator.

425
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,069
Are there any use?

426
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:52,250
N,

427
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,310
I don't know, I'm sure there is,

428
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,229
I'm sure there is VM Ware World or VM World or whatever they have. They,

429
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,550
they didn't send me to but um

430
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,630
but uh you know, but

431
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:07,339
infosec they just have the CSO like, yeah, you're gonna go,

432
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,310
we want you to go see what's on the slide and tell us about it and

433
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,839
it was really nice. So

434
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,140
it was good. It was just my, my skew on the ruby. They had a graph.

435
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:16,810
Well, I mean,

436
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:20,010
this isn't actually totally uncommon because if you look in CV database,

437
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,910
for example, there's

438
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,020
a company that did

439
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,675
a uh basically the mint token function of

440
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,025
a smart contract implementation for blank in Ethereum token

441
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:30,435
and there's like 380 of those.

442
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:31,785
Um And so a perfect example,

443
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,724
right is like CV has coverage of smart contracts to the tune of 500 CV S

444
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,594
all from 2018.

445
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:40,494
So the good news is that means that since 2018,

446
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,295
smart contracts have had no security flaws.

447
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,474
Right. Exactly.

448
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:45,234
Right.

449
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:48,290
Um So that's, that's what always frustrates me. I mean,

450
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,780
the whole CV database as a source of

451
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,170
data for making decisions about vulnerabilities globally is,

452
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,689
you know.

453
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:55,020
Yeah,

454
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,599
if once you learn how the sausage is made, you,

455
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,449
you understand that you can't use this as a reliable data source.

456
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,530
Right. Right.

457
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:07,119
OK. OK. Let's, let's, let's move on. We're, we're running ourselves out of time. And

458
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,439
I want to, I know and I feel like I could talk to you for days,

459
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,290
which we won't subject the audience to.

460
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,530
But

461
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,239
all right. So

462
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:20,180
before we hit record, you mentioned, I should ask you about your favorite CV E. So

463
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,290
what is your favorite CV E, Larry?

464
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,599
Oh, there's a, there's a few,

465
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:28,060
there's my first CV E and then one that I found shortly after that I,

466
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,609
I'll tell you about the first one because that one is probably the,

467
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:31,550
the most interesting.

468
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,979
And that's what people have been asking me about.

469
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,180
Back in 1998 1999.

470
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:40,619
I, uh I train, I moved from a small security company in Southern Maine

471
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,699
to Computer Sciences Corporation in Bath

472
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,150
Me, Computer Science Corporation, which, you know,

473
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,339
if you're not familiar with it is a pretty large, uh, like

474
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,719
company that was subcontracted by other companies

475
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,510
to sort of handle their it infrastructure

476
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,780
and Bath Ironworks had a contract to

477
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,869
have CS C manager their IT devices.

478
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:03,099
And I had gotten a job there and I went from

479
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:09,089
having access to, you know, maybe a couple dozen of machines to 3000. I mean, they had

480
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,729
3000 UNIX

481
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:11,109
A

482
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:16,670
UNIX systems ranging from uh Sgiirx machines to hphpu

483
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,959
machines to

484
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,579
so machines. Solaris

485
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:20,890
A IX

486
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,969
and

487
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,560
secure

488
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:23,489
wasn't

489
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,290
in the forefront of systems administration back then. It was

490
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:29,959
make sure this machine is running,

491
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:33,069
make sure the C AD D developers or C ad designers can use it.

492
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,650
Make sure that you know

493
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,569
when the desktop is imaged

494
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,209
or that the solar systems image that it, it's working,

495
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:40,689
you can run C AD on it and whatnot.

496
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,369
And um

497
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,349
it didn't matter if it was listening for every

498
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,750
service that son offered as long as it worked.

499
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,619
So

500
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,900
my first day

501
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:52,349
on the job I had, you know, my manager was showing me around

502
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:56,300
Biws campus because there's pretty big campus, there's multiple buildings

503
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,520
and we walk into this,

504
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,380
this new SG I lab that they just built and it's full of these SG I indie boxes,

505
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,369
indigo boxes.

506
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,520
And he says he sits down at one

507
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,125
and he says, you know, someday when you're, when you prove your worth,

508
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,444
I'll give you a log in on one of these systems.

509
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:15,234
And you know, me being from, coming from a security background, I knew that the LP

510
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,064
user on, on the IRA system had no

511
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:21,244
password. It had a valid shell and no password was blank.

512
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,905
So you could just walk up to an IR machine,

513
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:24,234
hit LP and hit enter.

514
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,405
So I walk up to an Ira machine.

515
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:29,364
I type in LP, I hit enter. I say thanks. I don't need one.

516
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,750
And my manager spins on his chair and he looks at me and he says,

517
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,430
how did you do that? And I'm like, I know

518
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,300
that these systems when they default don't have passwords assigned on LP.

519
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,880
And you could just log in.

520
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,619
And he looks at me and he says, will you do security for us?

521
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,630
And I said, I was hoping you'd say that

522
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,550
he pretty much let me

523
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,829
penetration test. Well, actually, I sort of

524
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,750
ran around the network breaking in the systems all over the place.

525
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,719
And

526
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,270
we had this one

527
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,000
machine room that had an SG I Onyx two in it.

528
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,939
Um If folks aren't familiar with an SG

529
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,880
Onyx two,

530
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:06,170
because it's, you know, a 25 year old computer,

531
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,359
it's about the size of a refrigerator. It was pretty much uh used for 3D modeling.

532
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,280
It had the reality creator or the reality 3d cards in them.

533
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,359
And,

534
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,959
you know, this system was anywhere from 250,000 to $500,000.

535
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,189
And now this thing is sitting in its own locked data center.

536
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:28,520
There's only a handful of assisted men who were allowed to go near it.

537
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,560
I was not one of them. I think there was only one or two guys that had access to that room

538
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,520
and these guys would taunt my friends and I my, my fellow coworkers. Hey,

539
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:37,959
you know,

540
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:41,900
we have access to the Onyx two and maybe someday you'll get access to the Onyx two.

541
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:44,290
And because, you know, I was assisted in level one,

542
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,900
they were like system in level three

543
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,619
and that, you know, kind of irked me. So I'm like, you know,

544
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,319
I want to get access to the Onyx and I want to get rude on it.

545
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:52,510
So

546
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,829
I'm like, how could I do that? So I started looking at um I had an SGI,

547
00:23:56,949 --> 00:24:00,550
I think it was an indie that I had access to probably through the LP account

548
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,290
if I remember correctly. And

549
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,410
I'm like, how can I get rude on this box?

550
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,829
And I thought to myself, I'll,

551
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,530
I'll just start looking at set U ID route binaries because

552
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,319
because there's a bunch of them on here

553
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,630
and those are usually what you try and target and leverage back then to,

554
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,130
to elevate your privileges from an ordinary user to route.

555
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:19,310
And I, I started looking at user Espin and I saw

556
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,150
uh midi keys and I'm like, what's this midi keys

557
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,709
that set U ID root?

558
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,729
Let's let's fire it up and see what it is.

559
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:28,650
So I, I launch Midi keys in my, in my X window and

560
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,660
up pops this little keyboard

561
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,119
and it's this little piano keyboard that you can type on

562
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,319
or click with your mouse and it'll make little sounds.

563
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,189
So I'm like, why would this thing need

564
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:40,719
root access? You know, I thought maybe perhaps to access the sound card.

565
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,130
I'm like, I don't know. That's kind of odd,

566
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:47,069
but I can say files with it, edit files with it. Open files with it. What can I open

567
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,199
password? So, yeah, II, I ended up opening up Etsy password,

568
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:56,119
changed my Larry user id from whatever it was to zero, saved it

569
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,069
and s sued and got to,

570
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,270
you know, root as Larry. And I'm like, oh, neat.

571
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,189
I'm like, I'm gonna go try this on the Onyx too.

572
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,420
So,

573
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,750
so

574
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,630
I log into the Onyx two with LP,

575
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,599
I fire back an X window command or an X windows to my back to my desktop.

576
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,920
Launch midi keys,

577
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:17,069
edit Etsy password, modify the Larry account

578
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:18,040
to have a U

579
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:21,310
of zero log into the Onyx two as Larry

580
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:24,599
getting a root prompt and saying, oh, wow, I have root on the Onyx.

581
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,030
So I thought to myself, you know,

582
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,280
I should probably assign a password to the Larry account

583
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,849
because I don't want to leave this open. It's an open root account with no password

584
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,959
and I'll just change the password.

585
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,920
So I changed the password or I go to change the password and I realize

586
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,810
my user id is zero.

587
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,989
I'm changing the root password.

588
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,199
So I hit control D, control D

589
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,859
Iris took the password as control D.

590
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,170
So

591
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:49,040
I,

592
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:53,760
yeah, I changed the password on the Onyx two to control D

593
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,150
and at this time, I'm like, oh crap, I'm like,

594
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:59,260
I'm in trouble now. I'm like, I'm gonna have to go tell

595
00:25:59,680 --> 00:25:59,900
the

596
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,479
Sidman guy that I just changed the password to control D

597
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:04,459
and he's gonna choke me because these guys didn't like me.

598
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:07,660
I was some 23 year old whippersnapper

599
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,619
who was running around blabbering about security.

600
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,099
So we already didn't have a good relationship.

601
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:13,770
So I asked my friend Donovan

602
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,609
who is much bigger than I am. He's like 6 ft three.

603
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:19,949
And I'm like, Donovan, can you go tell Dave that I,

604
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,599
I accidentally changed the Ro pastor on the Onyx two

605
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,839
to control D and he's like, sure

606
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:28,439
Donovan comes back about 15 minutes later or so, 20 minutes later.

607
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:31,579
And he's like, dude, he's like, they're so angry with you.

608
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,525
And I'm like, why, what happened? He's like

609
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,944
you changed the route password, right?

610
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:38,344
When they were about to give a demo to the US Navy.

611
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,484
And I'm like, oh my God, he's like,

612
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:45,145
there's an admiral in there with a bunch of senior management from our companies

613
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:48,064
and they're all standing around trying to log into the Onyx's route and,

614
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,444
and the password is not working.

615
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:53,425
And he's like, they had to scrub the demo and I'm like, oh my God, I'm like,

616
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:54,454
I'm getting fired.

617
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:56,635
That's it. I'm done. They're gonna kick me out.

618
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,079
So

619
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,209
Donovan is like, he's like, Dave came back,

620
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,560
he was able to change the room after because he had a show open on his desktop.

621
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
And I'm like, ok, and

622
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,010
So I'm like, all right, I got about a half an hour,

623
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,760
hour before my manager comes down here and throws me out.

624
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,579
And about an hour later my manager comes down, he goes, Larry.

625
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:18,599
He's like, I need you to come with me and we got to go talk to my manager in

626
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:18,910
a way.

627
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:20,359
Crap.

628
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,290
I'm like, here it is. I'm like, all right. So I don't have much stuff here.

629
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:27,709
You know, I'll be able to clear out my desk pretty quick and I just go home and,

630
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,979
you know, tell my wife, I just lost my job

631
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,989
and uh, I go into the,

632
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:33,829
into his manager's office

633
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:37,579
and I look on the wall and I see he's got a SANS security poster

634
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,489
and I'm like, wow, I'm like, this guy is actually,

635
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,869
you know, aware of

636
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:45,244
security, computer security, network security. So I'm like, cool

637
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:49,625
and I sit down and he goes all right, Larry, he's like I heard about the Onyx Two

638
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:50,594
and uh,

639
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:53,334
he's like, we're gonna need to change things and he's like,

640
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:55,444
before you do a penetration test,

641
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:56,035
he's like,

642
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,885
you have to tell the administrator that you're doing a penetration test and when,

643
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,285
and if it's ok because

644
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:04,604
things like the Onyx two incident today cannot happen.

645
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:05,765
He's like, you can't,

646
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:10,885
you can't make our systems unstable by testing their security and unavailable. So

647
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,589
he's like, you're gonna have to have, he's like, I want you to write up

648
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,280
an email to me and your boss to,

649
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,010
to tell us what machines you're planning on testing and when,

650
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,959
and then cc the administrators of those systems

651
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,989
and then get our, get everyone's approval before you go ahead.

652
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,380
And he's like, ok, he's like, you know, have a nice day and I'm like, great.

653
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,709
And I, I'm like, walked out, I'm like, elated, I'm like, I didn't get fired.

654
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,890
I got some legitimacy now that I can say, hey, my manager

655
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,430
and his manager are authorized me to ask to test your system.

656
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:43,810
Can you send me an email proving or, or give me a date when I can?

657
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,709
So

658
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,469
I, I lucked out again. I won. I kind of like,

659
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,150
you know, they,

660
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,760
they gave me some sort of some sort of framework

661
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,140
that I could work on in getting legitimized testing going.

662
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,550
It was, it was a good thing.

663
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,229
It actually helped me and I was all excited to,

664
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:02,579
to be able to post on bug track that I found this vulnerability in Iris

665
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,589
and then got my first CV ID.

666
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:05,910
That's awesome, man.

667
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:06,630
Curious,

668
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,819
how long did it take you to get all the systems like password on the LP account?

669
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,699
Uh I don't remember. Um I don't think we had ssh, then

670
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,119
I think they were still using Telnet.

671
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,650
So it wasn't something you could easily automate

672
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:24,739
they did have, I think they had open our remote R shell

673
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,969
where you could,

674
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,910
our shell into most machines just from, as root from almost any system

675
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:34,189
in the UNIX administrators network. So I think I might have,

676
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,260
I think I might have automated that. But you know what?

677
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,790
I think I automated it to where I had to keep typing in a new root password for, for,

678
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,329
or new LP password for all of the Ira systems.

679
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,000
I think I went back later and then just disabled the password

680
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:52,770
by putting an X where the, where the cipher text should be in the, in the

681
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,250
password violator. But

682
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,680
it was, I mean, I, I

683
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,329
had all sorts of fun with

684
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:02,010
a IX and stuff. I remember logging into an A IX machine

685
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:08,020
that was running the one team's um, local or infrastructure website.

686
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,459
One of the guys there was,

687
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:13,930
was savvy enough to have his own internal or internet website for their group.

688
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
And I logged into the machine by guessing

689
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,589
a password and then saw that they were writing

690
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,000
a file to temp

691
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,589
that they were executing that I had right access to.

692
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,109
So I ended up putting a Cron job in there to, to

693
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:29,540
set one of the shelves is set U ID root so I could get root on the thing. And then I

694
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,439
defaced their website with some hacker speak

695
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,130
and then sent it to my,

696
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,339
to my friend

697
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:36,689
and my manager

698
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,699
and

699
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,209
they were like, Larry, you can't do this, you can't do this hacker stuff.

700
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:44,489
He's like, you're going to scare the hell out of these guys,

701
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,790
you've got to just say, hey, you know,

702
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:50,140
I was able to get into your system. You can't deface their web page

703
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,270
in their infrastructure.

704
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,910
And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's probably, they don't know how to

705
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,412
speak either. So,

706
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:57,032
what are all these numbers?

707
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:58,052
So,

708
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,463
you know, I was in my twenties, I had a lot of learning to do.

709
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,402
-- Awesome.
-- All right, we are

710
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:07,672
100% out of time. I will give you the floor, take us home, Larry.

711
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,662
Yeah. So um it was great talking to everybody.

712
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:15,142
I just, you know, I enjoy doing these podcasts and, and talking to folks

713
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:16,895
and talking to you guys. I, I,

714
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:20,196
I've been talking to a lot of journalists and it's nice to talk to journalists and,

715
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,995
and then friends from the past, I haven't seen you guys in a while and

716
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,956
now being in isolation, it's, it's

717
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:29,995
nice to actually talk to other folks that are, you know, your friends.

718
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:31,505
Seriously, man.

719
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:32,916
Indeed, indeed.

720
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:36,505
Hopefully, hopefully in the not too distant future, we will see each other again,

721
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,586
summer camp.

722
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,530
I know I keep saying that. All right. Awesome.

723
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,699
