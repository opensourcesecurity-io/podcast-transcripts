Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 129 with myself,

1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,739
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,899
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,210
-- What's
-- new Man?

4
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:16,639
-- Uh
-- It's Christmas. It's the New Year.

5
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,329
It, it is the new year.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,190
But thanks to the magic of podcasting,

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,569
this is going to come out like in the middle of January.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,770
So that's fun.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,969
I thought you were gonna say the middle of the year.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,760
I could do that though. If you really wanted to,

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,529
we could just start releasing episodes in random order.

12
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,590
Like a,

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,439
I don't know,

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,549
I don't know that they really have an order per se.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,520
Uh They have numbers that have been increasing in value for the most part.

16
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:42,299
And then that's something I think about sometimes is like,

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,650
does this really have a purpose?

18
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,130
But I guess the one good thing I think of is

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,209
I have podcasts.

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,250
I listen to that don't have like numbers associated with the episodes and sometimes

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,970
I want to listen to like three or four at a time because like,

22
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,779
I've lost track or whatever.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,720
There's a million reasons

24
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:00,860
and putting them in the right order is a pain in my butt.

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,660
So, the numbers are helpful in that regard, which is why I've kept them to date.

26
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,000
Well,

27
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,370
I guess there's a reason ISBN barcodes and CV E numbers and

28
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,330
all those numbers exist because we humans do like sequential numbers.

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,889
Right.

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,940
Even, even, yeah, I mean, in the case of CV, E sequential,

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,209
-- sequential. Well, no,
-- it doesn't matter but having an identifying number.

32
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,720
Yeah. Totally. Absolutely. Yep. Yep.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,300
So, so anyway, the topic today is the EU bug bounty, which is,

34
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:29,900
I think a super interesting topic.

35
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,019
-- I, I wrote a blog post about it which I hope you've read if you haven't shame
-- on you.

36
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:34,699
No,

37
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,839
I was sleeping

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,620
shame on you. Uh, no, it's a great topic though.

39
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:41,379
So, why don't you give us the background and then we'll dive right here.

40
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:47,430
So, uh, the EU is a major government thing

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,459
and one of the

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,620
things,

43
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:49,860
-- yeah.
-- Uh,

44
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,069
one of the things they do is this free and open source software auditing

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,209
project

46
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,019
quite simply put,

47
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:00,069
it's an effort to audit free and open source

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,589
software for security flaws and get them fixed.

49
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,309
Um, and this is software

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,169
that the EU

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,389
government has decided that they essentially rely upon heavily.

52
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,130
And one thing that really impressed me is that they actually

53
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,550
managed to identify the open source projects that they care about.

54
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,990
And if you look at the list for the bug bounty, it's actually

55
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,679
like, it makes sense. It's, it's stuff that's like

56
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,330
public facing or that is accepting weird files from random people that you,

57
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,630
you kind of have to open as part of your job function.

58
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,000
Right.

59
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,899
Well, the list is a little weird but, I mean, fundamentally I think it's, it's over,

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,509
I think the list is entirely rational and,

61
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,789
and I was actually looking through it trying to figure out

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,169
what all these things are because half of these things,

63
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:44,550
I, well, not half a quarter of these things I'd never heard of.

64
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,229
But when I hunted them down, it was like, wow,

65
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,869
that actually really like having a bug bounty for this piece of software makes

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,309
a lot of sense.

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,869
Yeah. No, I won't disagree. It's

68
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,669
what, 14

69
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,619
project I believe

70
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,539
and funny story.

71
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,750
But I can't open the website that talks about it a lot

72
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,350
right now because it's not available today on I PV four.

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,699
And I guess I need to go set up I PV six. Finally.

74
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,059
Luckily I live in the future.

75
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,360
So I have the website and, and I'll quickly read the list that's, that's put here.

76
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,580
So there's file Zilla

77
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,919
Apache,

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,839
Kafka notepad plus plus, which made me laugh out loud.

79
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,570
I love that

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,369
on windows.

81
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,380
Uh

82
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,179
-- OK.
-- That's,

83
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,259
I kind of wish they would just buy it and integrate it.

84
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,509
So I didn't have to go install it. Uh

85
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,699
VLC media player, something called flux TL. I don't know what that is.

86
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,380
-- Flux
-- transport layer. It's for the fisheries data platform,

87
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,279
-- uh
-- fishery, like people fishing,

88
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,434
-- like literally boats catching fish,
-- giant boats going out in fishing.

89
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:47,315
We'll talk about that one a lot. Actually, that's one, that one is interesting.

90
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,774
Fishing means something else to us.

91
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,824
As I said, seven zip

92
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,485
digital signature services. I don't know that one.

93
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:56,994
Drupal

94
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:04,654
GC Library, Glips CPHP Symphony. I don't know that. Really. Apache tomcat wso two.

95
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:06,514
No idea what that is and midpoint

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,429
and that is the current list.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,220
So most of these, we've heard of like file Zilla Great FTP S FTP client, right?

98
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,669
I love it.

99
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,220
You know, same thing Apache

100
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:18,350
Kafka, you know,

101
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:23,200
it's uh message bus, message bus with transformations on the data,

102
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,829
-- right?
-- Yep. Yep. It's used heavily, especially like in the elastic universe

103
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:28,579
because

104
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,769
elastic search, I should say because obviously people bring data in,

105
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,720
they do stuff and they need to put it somewhere

106
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,679
and, and so it's a cool tool

107
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,399
and notepad plus plus.

108
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,480
I mean, if you don't,

109
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:41,670
if you use windows and you don't know what notepad plus plus is like,

110
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,040
go find out what it is. It's, it's a great little text editor.

111
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,170
Uh same thing for Putty, right? Well, uh

112
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,119
having you know a command line SSH S FTP

113
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,119
client on Windows who knew that could be useful.

114
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,459
I mean, VLC media player, if, if you don't know what VLC media player is,

115
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:58,640
how do you even compute?

116
00:04:58,649 --> 00:04:59,420
No, like seriously,

117
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:03,109
because that thing is installed on every single one of my Windows Macs,

118
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,839
it's even installed on my kids like ipads because

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,049
-- it's the only player that will play all the files.
-- Right. It's, it's on my fire TV.

120
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:11,239
Yeah,

121
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,359
you're right. It plays all the files

122
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,899
and nothing else will.

123
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,700
Uh, we'll skip Flux TL for a sec because we'll keep to the simple stuff.

124
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,589
So, key pass, key

125
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:23,649
-- pass is, um, it's a password keeper.
-- It's an offline password

126
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:24,299
essentially.

127
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,829
And it's not

128
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,720
sort of the best one,

129
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,720
but it's one of the most widely used ones and it sort of decides the format

130
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,269
of the file.

131
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:35,440
So it's kind of the parent password file program.

132
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,559
There's, there's a uh I guess clones maybe is the word I would use.

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,920
There's some clones of it that are actually a bit better,

134
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,079
but they're not as widely useful.

135
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:42,519
They,

136
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,200
they basically rely on key pass to define the password file format,

137
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,739
uh seven zip to put it bluntly if you need to open weirdly compressed files

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,679
and you don't know how to use the command line,

139
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,010
-- then probably seven zip is your best bet
-- even if you do actually.

140
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,510
So, so funny enough on, on Linux,

141
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:03,790
there is a seven zip command that I, I assume is related to this,

142
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,329
that's command line only.

143
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:08,309
And, and fun fact is the zip command

144
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,559
doesn't do the, the encryption.

145
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,359
It does sucks, but the seven zip one does proper zip encryption.

146
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,269
So if you actually need to like ever ever encrypt a zip file

147
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,920
to send it to someone use the seven zip command line tool.

148
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,329
Don't use the zip tool

149
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,160
because seven zip does it right.

150
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,239
So yeah, like seven zip, I can totally get behind and,

151
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,160
and the seven zip compression for like the seven zip format is freaking awesome.

152
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,839
Yeah,

153
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,049
see I'm just used to like beating myself with tools like be zip and XZ and GP G

154
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,929
which are,

155
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,720
which are fine for me to use.

156
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,839
But when I want to, yeah, then when I send the file to somebody,

157
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,519
it's kind of like uh how do you open it?

158
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,720
-- Great. I don't,
-- what is this thing?

159
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:44,760
Exactly.

160
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:45,570
Actually,

161
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,704
I remember we would do that when I was younger when

162
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,774
we wanted to troll someone who asked for a file,

163
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,774
we would send them a TGZ.

164
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,825
They're like, I don't know what to do with this.

165
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,454
We're like, oh, you just need to

166
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,184
G zip it and then un tar it. They're like, yeah, you didn't help me at all.

167
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,445
It's like we know by click

168
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:03,984
which not quite that anymore.

169
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,575
Well, you've, you've become a kinder person. Uh

170
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,704
No, I, I just don't send people things

171
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,239
and even if I did send them a tar ball, like everything can deal with them now,

172
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,700
it's nothing like it used to be and seven zip deals with them.

173
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,079
It's weird how the built in tools for Windows and Mac for so long languished

174
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:22,940
moving on

175
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:27,359
digital signature services is exactly what it sounds like. It is

176
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,619
a digital signature services, open source software library

177
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,480
uh for doing signature creation and validation.

178
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:35,399
But

179
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:35,679
that's,

180
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,950
that's pretty important.

181
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:40,179
Well, when you're, when you're doing electronic documents,

182
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,029
uh

183
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,059
knowing where it came from and so on, uh Drew Paul, Drew Paul is Drew Paul

184
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,829
the, the content management system

185
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,619
because it's,

186
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,269
everyone uses it.

187
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,160
-- A lot of stuff sits on top of it.
-- It's everywhere and

188
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,369
it's, like, always on fire.

189
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,010
Yeah.

190
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,250
Well, it's interesting if you look at it,

191
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,690
Putty and Drew Paul got the two highest bug bounty dollar amounts for this project.

192
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,570
Yeah, I was, I was just looking at that actually, but I would also, I have a suspicion.

193
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,950
-- They're probably the two riskiest of the whole list.
-- Putty shouldn't be that risky.

194
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,750
But Putty is one of those things where it's like a high value. If you compromise.

195
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,570
I'm just trying to think if you can somehow compromise Putty,

196
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,739
there's a lot of windows users using Putty to log into a lot of sensitive systems.

197
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,250
Well, and not only that, I also have a suspicion, Putty.

198
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,929
The finding the security issues in.

199
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,779
Putty is going to be, I guess Putty and Drupal have opposite problems.

200
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,210
Drupal is really easy to find security issues in but I bet Putty is really hard.

201
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,380
Well, Putty is also, it's a small command line client, like it's only several,

202
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,570
you know, it's a couple 100 K

203
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:38,409
it's,

204
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,770
yeah, it's not a monstrosity whereas Dr Paul. Yeah, it's the opposite or?

205
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,200
Well, it's like

206
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,809
Gipsy, like g lipsy is so big.

207
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,969
It's enormous. Yeah, like it, it is literally all the things

208
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,770
PHP Symphony. Similar problem. It's all the things. It's, it's basically

209
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:57,700
no Js type thing. It's, it's all your PHP libraries pulling them in automatically.

210
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:01,929
-- Got you. Yeah, that's pretty serious. So,
-- dependency management. Skipping

211
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,530
a well. Ok. A patchy Tomcat is Apache Tomcat, right? You run your Java

212
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,390
three

213
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,330
tier layer cake application,

214
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,640
right. Right. And I remember man, Tomcat was like the only game in town for a long time

215
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,520
when if you wanted to run Java on the web like

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
that was that or pay so

217
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,530
-- like a dump truck of money. Yeah,
-- for glass fish or whatever,

218
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:20,900
right?

219
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,690
I don't even remember the name of it. Exactly.

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,530
There's WSO two which is a API management when you deploy services and API S

221
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,190
obviously those API S are probably going to change a little bit over time.

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,570
So this is doing things, you know,

223
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,479
management of those API S inversion so that you

224
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,090
don't break all your clients or all your services

225
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,020
because you did an update.

226
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:42,719
Um and then midpoint, I forgot to look at midpoint.

227
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:43,250
That's what

228
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:43,650
I

229
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:47,479
funny enough for some reason I expected you to say that. So I looked it up.

230
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,640
It's an identity management platform.

231
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,159
Oh, interesting.

232
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,179
Yeah. And identity management, you know,

233
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,559
kind of a big deal.

234
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:55,750
So,

235
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
going up now here's what's the most interesting

236
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,700
to me because pretty much all of these,

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
all of these I knew except for Flux TL, the DS S and the WSO Two and midpoint.

238
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,409
But, you know, when you look up the digital signature service, it's like, well,

239
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,799
that's exactly what it is.

240
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:11,219
Ok.

241
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,179
Right. Easy WSO two API Management. Ok.

242
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,309
You know, it's a little esoteric but it's, it's like Red Hat bought that.

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,919
Uh what was it called three scale company that does API management.

244
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,020
-- So
-- yeah, API S are a big deal man.

245
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:23,580
Yeah.

246
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,130
Uh midpoint. OK. Identity management.

247
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,799
Yeah. Identity management, right?

248
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,619
Like again, lots of companies have identity management products kind of a common.

249
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,719
-- Everyone
-- has identity.

250
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:33,489
Yes. OK.

251
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,200
That's fair. But everyone needs it, right?

252
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,750
Like if you have more than two users, you probably need identity management.

253
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:43,369
So then that really that left us with like what the heck is Flux TL? And I'm like, OK.

254
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,539
Flux TL is the current transport layer of choice for a

255
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:49,390
family of applications under the integrated fisheries data management program.

256
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,030
And I'm like, wait, what, how did we end up in the fisheries?

257
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,929
Right?

258
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,219
Because all of a sudden we go from like

259
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,659
all of this stuff is normal desktop server type,

260
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,369
whatever to like fisheries.

261
00:10:58,549 --> 00:10:59,669
And so I did a bunch of digging,

262
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,059
read a bunch of interesting PDF S uh learned a lot about uh sustainable

263
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,390
fishing and the eu challenges with that and fish stock management and whatnot.

264
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,250
But basically the too long didn't read of it is

265
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:14,679
you're in Iceland, you're a fishing boat registered out of Holland,

266
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,340
going to a piece of ocean owned by some other country or not even owned by a country,

267
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:21,669
but, you know, controlled by

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,539
some international agreement.

269
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,020
And you want to go catch a bunch of herring.

270
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,580
Are you allowed to do that? What kind of permitting do you need and so on and so forth.

271
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,940
And this is an electronic system to handle all of that.

272
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,460
That's pretty cool.

273
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:39,619
And so thinking about this, number one, this is like all the countries, right,

274
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,719
all the countries with fishing boats, all the countries that control ocean,

275
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,130
all the countries that are part of

276
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,380
groups that control international parts of the ocean

277
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,320
that are, you know, covered by fishing treaties,

278
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,219
which is like all of it at this point because,

279
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,659
well, the tragedy of the commons literally, right,

280
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,979
we tend to over fish things because the fish are very tasty.

281
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,789
And so

282
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,020
this is things like the permitting reporting your catches,

283
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,469
you know,

284
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:06,440
because we can only allow people to haul so many thousands or millions of tons

285
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,630
of fish out of that part of the ocean before we have to like,

286
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
tell them to stop for the year.

287
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,119
And I was thinking about this, I've always kind of wondered with boats and well,

288
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,630
not submarines, but that, that's more of a military problem.

289
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,390
But with boats, you know, they typically don't have great internet connectivity.

290
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,429
Uh Right.

291
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,429
Also, let's say you do

292
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:24,809
great internet connectivity.

293
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,250
Let, let's assume for a moment, like let's, we'll do an episode on Spacex's,

294
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,570
you know, future internet satellite plans.

295
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,010
But let's assume for a moment, like every part of the planet is covered in,

296
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,619
what was it like?

297
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,320
10 megabit or gigabit internet

298
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,239
magic?

299
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:36,619
Well,

300
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,469
even then you still don't necessarily want like the mechanic on the

301
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,700
boat upgrading a computer system out in the middle of the ocean.

302
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,080
Because if it fails,

303
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:47,479
then like, how do you like get a tech out there to fix it?

304
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:48,950
You know, helicopter, some guy out

305
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,280
at a cost of

306
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,630
something in the four digits per hour.

307
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,289
So obviously with fishing boats,

308
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:58,450
I assume there's a lot of hesitancy to upgrade or

309
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,210
change systems at random in the middle of the ocean.

310
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,070
And this is, of course,

311
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,429
assuming everything is going well and you're not in

312
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,049
the middle of a storm trying to catch fish.

313
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:08,750
Do they catch fish during storms? That seems like a foolish thing to do.

314
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,409
I would assume that they work as much as they can because I mean, you,

315
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:19,364
you've seen a last, what was that fishing boat show out of Alaska? The crabbing one,

316
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:21,924
-- uh, dangerous catch,
-- maybe

317
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,205
dangerous. They were fishing in some pretty horrible weather because

318
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:28,924
they only had a certain, like, what one or two weeks for the season?

319
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:32,724
It always amazed me. Like, more people didn't fly off the boat and die. I

320
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:33,265
know

321
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,674
every time those guys were stepping in the

322
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,174
ropes when the traps were going overboard,

323
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,325
I was just like, like, you know,

324
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,114
that cartoon character thing where the rope titans around

325
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,674
their ankle and drapes them down and they're dead.

326
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,885
And it just always gave me the heebie Jeebies.

327
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,380
I, I agree.

328
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,469
I, I would make,

329
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,820
I am not a boat person and I would be a very

330
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,140
bad fisherman and I guarantee I would be dead on day three.

331
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,659
Like no questions asked.

332
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,820
Like I'm not even going to pretend I have the ability to, to work that job.

333
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,979
Yeah, I know.

334
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,770
I don't think physically we could do it let alone like

335
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,929
safety wise, not die.

336
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,869
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

337
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:11,479
This is, this is a great example of, not only is it a very complicated it system,

338
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:11,650
I mean,

339
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,489
we've got data flowing backwards and forwards

340
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,130
and being shared with multiple governments,

341
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:18,099
they've got these centralized data nodes, they've, you know,

342
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,739
there's stuff flowing in over satellite, over radio links over the internet.

343
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,109
You

344
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:25,179
have it platforms literally in the middle of the ocean,

345
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,460
possibly with no or very limited internet connectivity.

346
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:32,289
Definitely nobody with like computer certification aboard on a lot of these boats,

347
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,500
you know, some of these boats are only 12 m long or less, right.

348
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,080
Like they, they break up the fishing by, it was like 0 to 12 m 12 to 24 and 24 plus.

349
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,419
You know, and I'm guessing like a 24 m plus boat. Yeah, it'll,

350
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,390
that's a pretty big boat

351
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,140
but

352
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,469
some little crabbing boat,

353
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,330
you know, you're in the middle of fishing season.

354
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,440
Uh, let me just reboot this for an update and you're going to get smacked.

355
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,099
That, that does make sense.

356
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:00,159
And then, so this system is taking data in from the Lord only knows where. Right.

357
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,739
And it's taking in data that I'm with latencies.

358
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,719
So I there's just, it's a lot of complicated problems essentially.

359
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:11,500
Right. The, the, the use case is very complicated. It's not like,

360
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:11,909
you know,

361
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,369
my computer can just talk to everything

362
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,760
on the internet with 50 millisecond latency.

363
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,890
-- No problem.
-- Right. Right.

364
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,070
And, and that's, that's awesome. Right.

365
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,710
I love seeing open source projects that affect an entire industry because

366
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,190
obviously in an instance like this,

367
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,400
everyone can help and everyone can make it

368
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,750
better depending upon what they need to do.

369
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,859
Now, the, the place I want to talk about with this bug bounty though.

370
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,909
And this is this is where the conversation has kind of ended up a little bit is

371
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,559
the bug bounty is a great idea

372
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,590
and I'd love it.

373
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,960
But there are a nontrivial number of people who are saying,

374
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,919
but what about the projects? Why are we paying bug bounties to researchers?

375
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:55,340
Why aren't we paying the projects? And I actually know what the answer is.

376
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,020
And this is what my blog post is about.

377
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,359
But I would love to hear your thoughts before we kind of dive into what's going on.

378
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:05,710
So, my thoughts are two folds. Number one, I agree that in some ways the bug bounty

379
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,309
is sort of the crowning achievement for a software project, security

380
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,979
response

381
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,890
because quite frankly,

382
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,780
and especially a bug bounty with this, there's quite a bit of money involved in this.

383
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:22,989
-- It was, what was it? €851,000 in total in bounty
-- just under a million euros.

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,700
So probably a million dollars

385
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,099
or pretty close, we'll say, using

386
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,820
whatever sort of

387
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,869
American dollars

388
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,169
or some dollars from somewhere. Right.

389
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,349
So, so number one, I would say, you know, yeah,

390
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,690
bug bounty is definitely sort of the crowning achievement because essentially,

391
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,150
you know, if a tree falls in the forest and lands on your head,

392
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,239
that's not very helpful, you need to be able to dodge it.

393
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,950
So, you know, if these projects can't fix these security flaws,

394
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,890
then the bug bounty is literally wasted money

395
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,719
on the flip side. However,

396
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,539
bug bounties can sort of let you know how bad things are

397
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,630
and maybe you do

398
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,229
need to justify funding for that project because,

399
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,159
uh, ok,

400
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,660
I'm going to pick on Putty because it's pretty blameless

401
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,319
and it's actually got a pretty good track record.

402
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,329
But let's say, for the sake of argument, this bug bounty for Putty comes out

403
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,780
and some guy finds like 20 bugs in it, like really bad ones.

404
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,680
Well, then we know maybe, you know,

405
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:15,930
uh,

406
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,500
we need to invest some money in actually improving Putty and maybe funding

407
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,699
the developer or funding another developer to help that guy with it or,

408
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,380
or whatever.

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,599
So it kind of reminds me of, um, of penetration testing, right?

410
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,329
A lot of people like, oh, penetration testing is done.

411
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,709
They always get in and I'm like, yeah, exactly.

412
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,180
And then you use that to scare your executives into giving you more money.

413
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:39,189
So here's the, I, I agree with you, but here's the real problem.

414
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,530
The eu can't pay putty, they have no way to legally pay putty.

415
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,020
And here's so here's let me kind of let me set out the, the, the landscape here.

416
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,310
And this is something I wrote about.

417
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,069
In fact, someone from the EU replied to me basically saying, yes, you're right.

418
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:55,550
Good job.

419
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,510
This is the lady that,

420
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
whose website I couldn't load the talks about all

421
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,640
the stuff that we've been using as our resource.

422
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,589
Yes. Perfect. OK. Good. Yeah.

423
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:05,390
So, so anyway, here's basically the problem.

424
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,949
So the EU has money, that's their resource, right?

425
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,689
They don't have developers necessarily, they don't, you know, and, and

426
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:15,329
yes, I know there are developers.

427
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:19,219
Uh No, no, no, even worse, worse, they have government developers.

428
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,670
Right. Exactly.

429
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
And so like,

430
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,489
oftentimes like their ability to contribute to open source is going to be

431
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,000
limited fundamentally to money and I know there's some asterisks on that,

432
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,709
but we're going to ignore all the weird details for the moment.

433
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,050
So their resource is money,

434
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:34,050
right?

435
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,439
What is the only thing

436
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,630
they can do with that money today

437
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,670
that has the ability to directly affect a project?

438
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,439
And the answer is a bug bounty because these bug bounties exist and,

439
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:46,800
and like they're not paying the,

440
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,989
like the, the researchers, they're working with people like hacker one,

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,750
for example, for these bug bounties,

442
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,439
which is important because these bug bounty organizations,

443
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:58,319
they have the legal entities and the frameworks in

444
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,079
place to take money in and pay researchers.

445
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:01,469
Right?

446
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:04,239
So the eu can cut a check to hacker one and say,

447
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,260
here's a pile of money for bug bounties on these projects.

448
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,729
Like make it work,

449
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,430
right?

450
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
So the eu can do that.

451
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:14,589
The eu can't go to Putty and say, here's a bunch of money, like, make it better.

452
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,050
They're like, what the, what the f do I do with this?

453
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,839
You know, he, I'm assuming has a day job or something and he,

454
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,520
he may not even be able to take that money

455
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,469
even if they were able to give it to him.

456
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,650
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

457
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,989
And they probably can't because like, is this guy a European citizen?

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,060
-- Where does he live? Like, how does that work?
-- Well, he's in Cambridge.

459
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,040
He's a British guy.

460
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,089
Uh, ok, great. Well,

461
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,719
not an EU citizen for long

462
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,339
burn.

463
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,969
-- But anyway, anyway. Anyway, I can't, I can't wait. We finally
-- covered breast

464
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,810
and that's it, folks. That's

465
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,170
-- all you're getting.
-- We'll never talk about it again.

466
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,890
Uh But anyway, so here's the thing.

467
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:50,689
So

468
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,829
for now they're doing the only thing they can and if this is the only way it is,

469
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,640
if we never get past the ability to pay like projects and it's only ever bug mommies,

470
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:00,920
this is

471
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,869
going to fizzle out and die because eventually someone from the EU is going to

472
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,099
look at this and say like the return on this investment kind of sucks.

473
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,239
And the projects are getting mad at us because

474
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,969
we're just reporting bugs and not helping them.

475
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,109
Like what do we do next?

476
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,270
Right. So this is where there's an organization called Tide Lift that

477
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,219
I know I've tweeted about them a lot.

478
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:21,150
But basically, it's a bunch of ex red hat people started a company

479
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,449
that has the ability to basically pay open source projects is

480
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:27,300
what it fundamentally comes down to where companies pay Tide Lift,

481
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,489
tide Lift, pay some projects.

482
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:29,780
And, and this,

483
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,689
that's the sort of framework you need because the eu can't pay projects.

484
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,930
So you need like some sort of intermediary that the

485
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:38,719
Eu can give a bunch of money to and say,

486
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,189
I want you to fund these projects.

487
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,660
And now when I say fund, I don't just mean writing checks

488
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,040
because some projects want money

489
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,300
but not all of them, right?

490
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,609
You're going to have projects that want pizza,

491
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,410
you're going to have projects that will say like I need hosting in,

492
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,170
in this data center over whatever they're like a million things, right?

493
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:00,439
And that's the thing, the eu can't do that. Like the eu literally has a check

494
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:03,310
and they need to give a check to somebody and they have a whole

495
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,609
bunch of crazy rules that say how they can and can't spend money.

496
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,550
When I was thinking my partner works for the government and they were,

497
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,250
she was talking about, yeah, how they spend money and it's,

498
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,589
oh boy, the regulations. Wow.

499
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,949
Yeah. Right. Exactly.

500
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,829
It's like crazy town for these people.

501
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,670
Well, but it's, it's, you know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions,

502
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:22,869
right?

503
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,239
Because all of these regulations came from, well, somebody abused this.

504
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,500
Like I remember specifically to not to mention Red Hat yet again,

505
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,910
but I remember specifically at Red Hat, the travel,

506
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,819
uh the Red Hat travel guide specifically stated that I think it

507
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,390
was that anybody under director level cannot charter a helicopter or a boat

508
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
and that got added in at some point.

509
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,099
And it's like, well, pretty clearly somebody did that and so they went, nope,

510
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,199
we're not allowing that again.

511
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,880
And so they, they put in an explicit rule saying, you know,

512
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,640
unless you're a director or above or whatever,

513
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,599
you can't charter boats and helicopters.

514
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:57,959
That's fantastic in every possible way and, and right,

515
00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:00,239
the rule is there because someone did it.

516
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,869
Yeah. And got away with it.

517
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,849
No, you're right thinking about it.

518
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:06,719
Like, because I remember I worked for the government for six months once when I was,

519
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:07,189
like, 20

520
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,709
yeah. No, it's, um, a lot of people work for the government.

521
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,819
They have good intentions.

522
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,619
But, yeah, they're, they're literally

523
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,979
bureaucracy is holding

524
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,180
back what they want to do. So, what they do end up doing

525
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,589
from the outside looks insane.

526
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,119
But if you, if you look at the bureaucracy and what the rules are,

527
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:28,439
that's literally all they can do

528
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,949
and, and not just that.

529
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,839
So in, in this context, we're obviously talking about the eu as a government,

530
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,670
but even large companies have similar problems.

531
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,199
Well, and the EU is a government, but it's, it's like a meta government too.

532
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,270
So it's even messier

533
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,520
uh Right. That, that's a very good point.

534
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:43,780
So I,

535
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,839
I have a great story actually about this and I don't

536
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,239
feel bad because like most of the people involved are,

537
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,369
are long, the company is gone.

538
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,290
So a long time ago, I worked for a company called uh Progeny Linux Systems

539
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,439
and Red Hat

540
00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:00,199
stopped supporting Red Hat Linux 71728 and nine, I think,

541
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,359
way back in

542
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:01,699
the,

543
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,250
I remember those.

544
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,530
Yeah,

545
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,250
basically at the same time because they were

546
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,250
obviously focusing on Red Hat enterprise Linux.

547
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,800
And like I was at Progeny,

548
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,489
I was doing security updates for our Linux distribution that, like,

549
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,839
nobody bought at the time.

550
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:15,250
And I remember I went to my boss and I'm like, hey, Red Hats,

551
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,359
discontinuing this stuff.

552
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:19,810
Like I'm already doing this work. Why we could just start, you know,

553
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,689
selling updates for Red Hat Linux.

554
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,959
And they were like, well, that sounds neat. Right.

555
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,319
And we went from like very few customers to like a bazillion customers overnight.

556
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,849
Right.

557
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,050
And I remember we talked about

558
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:31,739
that

559
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,170
stuff.

560
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,319
Well, of course not. Then what happened was

561
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,589
we were like, well, well, how much are we charge for this?

562
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,250
And someone like said, 0 $5 a machine. We're like, great. That sounds neat.

563
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,560
It was super cheap, whatever. It doesn't matter. This is a million years ago.

564
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,380
Kurt, it's too late now.

565
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,305
Right. So it's very inexpensive.

566
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:51,135
And I remember we had like, some fortune 500 companies that were like, we have like,

567
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:51,964
you know, 100 machines.

568
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,704
We're like, oh, that's $500 a month.

569
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:54,405
They're like,

570
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:58,474
we can't pay you $500 like we need, it has to cost more.

571
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:01,125
We're like, well, it's $500. So, like,

572
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:04,969
here's my personal credit card. Like I'll figure it out. Right.

573
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,589
That happened more often than not because, like, these companies just,

574
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,280
they couldn't spend a small amount of money.

575
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,800
-- Right. They had, it had to be an enormous bill
-- or it looks like fraud. Right.

576
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,109
Right.

577
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,890
And, and this is the same problem with, like,

578
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,880
open source projects is a large company.

579
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,280
Can't say, like, here's 100 bucks putty, go fix my buck. Right.

580
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,650
They need some way to pay some, like, legitimate organization

581
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:32,199
-- and then that money has to go somewhere else.
-- Well, and it's even worse than that.

582
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,239
Right. For large companies, things

583
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,650
can't be one offs. They have to be part of a process. They have to be part of

584
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,439
an ongoing,

585
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,000
recurring, quarterly, yearly, whatever billing cycle.

586
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,229
Right. Right.

587
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:49,170
So these people who say, oh, just give some money to the project like it's hard,

588
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,319
it's not something you can do.

589
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,530
-- So
-- anyone, they're not legally allowed to in a lot of cases,

590
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,050
you can't just disperse money to an individual without the auditors going.

591
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,699
-- Like what
-- now?

592
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:00,119
Wink, wink in the memo. Right? Like

593
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,089
this is

594
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,369
so anyway.

595
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,089
Right.

596
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,699
But, but I guess here's the thing and,

597
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:08,579
and this is kind of the way I would sum all of this up is

598
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,099
I give the eu tons of credit for doing this.

599
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,760
And I think there's a lot of people that want to stand up and say, oh, no, no.

600
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,390
But what about the projects? What about the Children, blah, blah, blah, blah.

601
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,900
It's like no,

602
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,699
look,

603
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,380
the eu is taking the first step now, if, if we never take a second step, then yes,

604
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,859
your criticism is 100% valid.

605
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,530
But the,

606
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,349
the thing is instead of just whining and

607
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,849
complaining like an annoying internet gas bag,

608
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,719
which is of course, what a lot of people like to do,

609
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,310
but now we need to go to the next place and,

610
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,459
and the thing to think about is how do we make it?

611
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:41,119
So, in a large organization or a government or somebody

612
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:44,699
can somehow get money to a project

613
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,579
to make sure the thing they want done gets done.

614
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,550
Because like, obviously one of the things I think about in my head a lot

615
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,209
is think of like a reverse bug bounty

616
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,569
where instead of paying people for finding bugs,

617
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,800
you pay people for fixing bugs where you say like, hey,

618
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,369
I want this feature that's been tried.

619
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,010
It, it, it never worked.

620
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,319
And, but again, we didn't have like the frameworks to actually do this.

621
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,670
Well, there were a couple of companies that did build that, but it's just,

622
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,430
-- it, I suspect part of it is for a lot of,
-- I think it was premature. Right?

623
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:18,550
I mean, I think open source is way more popular, I think.

624
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,839
Yeah, I think part of it at the market wasn't ready

625
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:24,209
and I think part of it too is a lot of the people who can fix

626
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:27,760
these bugs are not doing it for the money and when you start paying them,

627
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,890
they, they go and they look at their time and they're like, well,

628
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,729
this actually isn't really worth my time,

629
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,260
you know, if you do something. Some of that is true.

630
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,619
Well, there's been multiple studies done where you know,

631
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,310
something was a volunteer action and then they

632
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,010
started paying the volunteers and it dried up.

633
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:45,739
Yes. Yes. And, and I'll post a link. Actually, there's a really nice video.

634
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,260
One of those animated videos, it might have been a TED talk. Even

635
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,020
where they talk about kind of rewards and money in

636
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,810
effect. Open source is a huge part of the talk.

637
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,550
-- And, and anyway, I, I'll link it in the show notes.
-- Well, I agree.

638
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,439
Like, if, if people paid me to do CV E, I'd be like, great.

639
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:01,689
My professional rate is this three digit number,

640
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,420
-- right? Like a gazillion dollars.
-- I'm not doing it for five bucks an hour.

641
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,489
-- And
-- that's fair.

642
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,280
I, I think that's,

643
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:11,680
but again, again, this is where I kind of come back to

644
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,280
resources don't have to be money, right?

645
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,030
It could be as simple as saying, you fix my bug,

646
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,119
here's a pizza

647
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,250
or you fix my bug, like here's a free ipad, whatever.

648
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,670
There's a million things you can do here and, and it, it, if,

649
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,099
if we just obsess over sending money to a project,

650
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:31,390
I think we end up in the exact trap you're talking about.

651
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,390
And so this is, this is, again, this is part of step two, is figuring out

652
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,920
how do we actually

653
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,910
fund these projects in ways that is acceptable and increases

654
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,780
the,

655
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,810
the output they have because a lot of

656
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,530
these projects like you mentioned earlier are like,

657
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,780
it's literally a guy

658
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,060
and they do it on the weekend for fun.

659
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,140
And what do you do with that person? Right.

660
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,089
How do we make sure they stay motivated and

661
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,170
they feel like what they're doing is worthwhile?

662
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,939
-- So,
-- one thing I was just thinking, well, two things.

663
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:00,060
Number one, you say, how do we fund these projects? I would say

664
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,329
more generally, how do we allocate resources to them that they need?

665
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:06,880
And number two

666
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:12,260
would be um the, the second thing that always drives me nuts is every time I run into,

667
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,520
well, this is not so much now, but back in the day, especially,

668
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,130
I'd run into people that, you know, were like, wow, I started using open source.

669
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,540
It's great,

670
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,109
you know, I'd love to give back. How can I get back?

671
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,869
And I'm like, have you ever encountered like a bug with it?

672
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,410
They're like, yeah, and I'm like, did you report it?

673
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,040
Right? Like seriously just reporting the bugs reporting them.

674
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,349
Well, would honestly,

675
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,109
that's what a lot of these developers do want is good bug reports.

676
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,310
Yeah,

677
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,189
I mean, again,

678
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,760
debt potentially is a resource

679
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,880
you can help fund these, these developers with or

680
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:44,079
I know there's a lot of projects that would like, they'd be in heaven

681
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,060
if someone just went through their bug trackers and was like, this is a valid bug.

682
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,800
This isn't a valid bug, right? Or, or fixing do, right?

683
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,479
Documentation is another big one like there's so much

684
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,880
that these projects need and every project's different.

685
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,339
And so you can't just say, like, throw money at them. It's not that easy.

686
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:01,979
Well, the problem here is then you have a company.

687
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,959
It's like, ok, we're going to pay an intern or we're gonna pay some guy to do this

688
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,939
unless you kind of like wink, wink, nudge, nudge, 10% of your time thing, you know,

689
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,099
and it, it just, again,

690
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:14,099
it gets very messy for these large companies that are driven by process and by

691
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,510
rules because

692
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:19,829
they're ultimately trying not to be driven by people who make mistakes and,

693
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,500
or if they do make mistakes, they want the mistakes catalog, you know,

694
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,760
the iso 9000 process where like everything is documented.

695
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,729
So if it goes wrong

696
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:31,680
while we in theory, can go update the documentation and stop doing it wrong. Sure.

697
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,699
So it's, but I agree it's a very complicated problem of, you know,

698
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,640
yeah, a fortune 500 company might be quite happy to,

699
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,550
you know,

700
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,469
allocate some sort of resources to some open source they're using.

701
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,089
But how do they actually do that?

702
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:48,199
Especially if they're financially or legally constrained

703
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:49,329
with what they're allowed to do.

704
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,010
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

705
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,119
So, I, yeah, I mean, I, I guess we'll see where we go next all in all.

706
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,239
Like I said, I think what the eu is doing is awesome.

707
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,489
Well,

708
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,119
this also presupposes that people are actually going

709
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,599
to look at this bug bounty and participate.

710
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:04,260
Right. Bug bounty is the demand side of. We want to pay for bugs.

711
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,800
You still need a supply of bugs. You need some,

712
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,984
you go find, you need to go

713
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:08,895
for the

714
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:09,295
supply

715
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:12,525
-- of bugs but
-- people willing to sell them. And I,

716
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,694
I, I think, I think it'll be ok.

717
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:19,525
There are a nontrivial number of people who basically are now making a living.

718
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,604
I mean, think of like the gig economy where they're,

719
00:30:21,614 --> 00:30:24,125
they're literally making their living on bug bunnies.

720
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,405
And if you're good at it,

721
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:30,444
-- you can do quite well. Well,
-- especially if you live in a cheaper part of the world.

722
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,984
Yeah. $10,000 payday.

723
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,805
That's a good chunk of money.

724
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,319
And computers and internet are not that expensive. And open source by definition is

725
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,819
well, and that's the beauty too, is like all the fuzzing tools and most of the pretty,

726
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,959
what I would say are the really good security tools for doing this

727
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,060
kind of bug bounty fuzzing and stuff. With one or two exceptions. They are all free.

728
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,319
-- Yeah,
-- for the most part. So I have a suspicion this is going to be successful.

729
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,260
The, the one worry I have

730
00:30:56,709 --> 00:31:01,709
that, that I think is a legitimate worry. That isn't step two is my concern.

731
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:06,300
Is some of these bug bounties might be too successful and overwhelm the projects

732
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,449
and that would be equally bad

733
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,979
because now you have projects that are like,

734
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:14,000
I have 1000 bugs and I don't have time to fix them.

735
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,109
I don't think they're going to end up with 1000 bugs.

736
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,500
Now. I don't think they will either. I'm just saying like it is conceivable.

737
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,890
Even a dozen bugs would be a pain in the. Right.

738
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:26,619
So, anyway, but again, this is where we need step two. Right. We need some way

739
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,930
to, to go to the next level and, and it doesn't even have to be security focused.

740
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,739
I know obviously bug bounties are very security focused, but

741
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,310
there's no reason

742
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,079
that you can't fund features that have nothing to do with security, right? It's just

743
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:42,229
again, bug bounties are the only mechanism they have like

744
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,339
the, the E U's hammer is money

745
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,510
and that's the only nail they could find

746
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,729
like for real.

747
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:48,869
-- Yeah.
-- No, that makes sense.

748
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,155
So, any closing thoughts on this one,

749
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:54,344
-- if
-- you do find security flaws, please,

750
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:56,084
and you're going through a bug bamy, please,

751
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:58,005
please please have them request a CV number.

752
00:31:58,214 --> 00:31:58,954
-- Yeah,
-- that's fair.

753
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,574
And I guess on that note also,

754
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:03,094
and I put this in my blog post and I'll reiterate it again.

755
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:04,925
Here is if you are a project

756
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,119
and whether you're part of this EU list or not,

757
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,349
and you need help with security things like dealing with security reports,

758
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,069
dealing with advisory CD ES whatever, like feel free to get in touch with me.

759
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,280
My Twitter D MS are open and I will help you because I know what this is like

760
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:23,739
and kind of the, the, the closing statement on my blog was something like, you know,

761
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,750
the only thing worse than,

762
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,459
than being part of running an open source

763
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:28,930
project is running security for an open source project

764
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:32,010
because it's like, it's, you think that's thankless, right?

765
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,589
Like come to my world sometime, but, but for real, it's tricky to do.

766
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,609
It's not simple and it's something like I,

767
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,930
I both of us have been doing longer than we can possibly remember.

768
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:43,369
So by all means, ask for help and, and

769
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,410
it's kind of like the, the Harry Potter thing, right?

770
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,359
Anyone who asked for help at Hogwarts would get it.

771
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,910
No, it's, it's definitely,

772
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:52,479
-- it's a nontrivial type of work.
-- Yep. Yep. Totally. All right, sweet.

773
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:54,089
So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

Bye bye

778
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:11,030
the
