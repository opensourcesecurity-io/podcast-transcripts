Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,670
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,750
What's not a lot?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,639
The weather's kind of crap this week, but it'll be nice on the weekend.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,059
So I'm ok with that.

5
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:22,079
Except people could be listening to this

6
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,370
in the post apocalyptic future

7
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,969
where the weather is always snowing because of the nuclear winter.

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,569
Uh

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,250
Well, but

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,189
I honestly

11
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,419
would that be

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,770
much worse than global warming?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,709
Maybe it's the, well, that's,

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,470
-- that's like global cooling,
-- right?

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,340
My worry always is that some bright spark is going to be like, hey,

16
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:46,040
we have this global climate change with a lot

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,759
of extra energy in the system and warming.

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,459
And, you know, people have proposed like the sun shades in, you know, Lagrange,

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,689
was it Lagrange five orbit right between the sun and the earth.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,810
And my worry is some bright spark will be like, hey, you know,

21
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,159
I was just checking the old literature.

22
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:59,900
What about this nuclear winter thing?

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,589
Do you ever see the Futurama episode where their

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,529
solution to global warming was to mine ice and then

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,250
when they ran out of ice, they, what made the,

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,980
they moved the earth farther from the sun and made every week or every year,

27
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,400
a week longer because of the robots

28
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,099
-- and the robots were the cause and solution to all our problems.
-- That's right.

29
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,989
-- As I think now it's just a, I and ML, it's the same idea. Right. Yeah. Pretty
-- much.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,709
-- Pretty
-- much.

31
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,290
All right. Anyway, anyway,

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,779
so we have a new executive order in the United States. That's exciting.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,910
Which one is it again? What's the number?

34
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,870
I don't know, it doesn't have a number. I don't even care if it does.

35
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:43,930
All executive orders have a number. Hang on a sec. Where is the bloody

36
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:48,769
Biden executive cybersecurity? Ok.

37
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,529
Biden's is, oh, come on, give me the,

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,470
because you need the number if you ever want to find anything because

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,900
like the previous one from the Trump administration is missing on White house.gov.

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,849
So you have to go look it up in the federal register.

41
00:01:58,989 --> 00:01:59,800
-- All right. That's
-- fair.

42
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,080
Ok. So the White House fact sheet president signs new executive order

43
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,779
and they don't give the order number.

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,279
I haven't seen any sort of identifying information

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,020
to accompany it. It doesn't matter.

46
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,520
This is Biden's cybersecurity executive order that we're all

47
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:15,009
going to forget about in like three months.

48
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,210
Anyway. So, what's the difference?

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,059
-- Well,
-- yeah, because there was 4636 and there was 1003,

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,839
800. That was Trump's

51
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,309
-- the earlier one was Obama's
-- and those all worked out marvelously, right?

52
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,110
Just trying to think if there was, I mean,

53
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,869
13 800 actually specifically mentions things

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,149
like supporting transparency in the marketplace,

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,990
which I mean, there is so much transparency in the software marketplace.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,750
Like it's just,

57
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:42,240
and I like that they actually explicitly call it

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,339
resilience against botnets and other automated distributed threats like,

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,820
oh, I don't know, ransomware

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,169
maybe against an oil pipeline

61
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,720
or you know, an assessment of electricity disruption,

62
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,320
incident response capabilities.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,229
Right. Anyway, anyway. Ok.

64
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,740
-- Well,
-- in fairness though Texas is not part of the federal grid, so it would not be,

65
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,220
would the Texas grid be beholden to this executive order?

66
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,619
No, they, they specifically wouldn't be because they,

67
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,919
they purposefully deregulated themselves.

68
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,600
So they wouldn't have to follow these federal guidelines.

69
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,419
So then it clearly worked because only Texas was affected.

70
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,360
I have a rock in my front yard. It keeps the tigers away.

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,130
Do

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,089
you? You should put that thing on ebay. I bet you could make a fortune selling it.

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,729
Well, apparently people in Houston need that.

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,199
And I love how the end of the story is like the tiger was found safe and returned. Ok.

75
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,520
And I'm like,

76
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,860
that's not at all how I thought this was going to play out for that poor tiger,

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,020
right. Yeah, I don't. Anyway. Anyway. All right. All right.

78
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:39,789
So I want to talk about this executive order and I want to take a unique spin on it,

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,509
I think as we often do anytime we talk about this stuff and I

80
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,960
want to lay the groundwork of this by saying I fully support any sort of

81
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,929
effort by any organization, be it the government, be it a company,

82
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,449
be it whatever to take an honest look at the cybersecurity we have

83
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,919
and try to, we say nudge us in the right direction.

84
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,580
So I don't think anyone would disagree with that statement.

85
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:11,929
Now, this executive order is something from the United States kind of, I,

86
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,630
I know about half of our, our

87
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:18,190
listeners do not live in North America. So I'll try to explain this as best as I can.

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,480
I am not a government expert by any stretch of the imagination.

89
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,179
But the United States has this kind of

90
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,519
bizarre government structure where you have the president,

91
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,959
which we call the executive branch and then you have Congress,

92
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,079
which is the House and Senate,

93
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,559
which are just like basically

94
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,380
completely dysfunctional organizations these days,

95
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,679
the legislative branch.

96
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,359
There you go.

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,440
See, I'm Canadian. So I have to know this.

98
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,940
I know which I chuckle at.

99
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,839
And as an American, I know nothing about your government, but that's not true.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,130
But most people don't.

101
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,230
Anyway, the House and Senate passed bills they sent to the president,

102
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,660
the president signs them, everyone goes on their Mary White,

103
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,440
but the president is in a position where

104
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,089
they can issue these executive orders which are,

105
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,410
we'll say quasi

106
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,910
questionable from a legal perspective.

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,589
There's been a lot of writing on them but they

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,309
had the ability to basically tell these federal agencies,

109
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,989
these are the rules I want you to follow.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,339
-- And as the president, they generally do
-- federal agencies, not state and local.

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,190
Right. Exactly.

112
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,829
So you can tell, for example, like the Department of Defense, like,

113
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,350
I want you to do these things, you can tell, you know, nist or whatever,

114
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,230
some of these groups.

115
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,779
But here's the thing, the president say these things,

116
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,609
but the president has no authority to control the funding.

117
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,589
The funding is specifically and this is even called out in the Constitution

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,410
of the United States that the funding is controlled by the Congress.

119
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,420
And so the president can say federal agencies, I want you all to start logging

120
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,420
all your data

121
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,329
and that's easy to say, but that costs money,

122
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,420
right? And so where does the money come from?

123
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,380
And that's kind of the question. And so these are what we call unfunded mandates

124
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,809
where the president says go and do this

125
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,989
except you don't have any money to do it.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,149
Now, here's a question because I'm not clear on this.

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,670
Can the president, so the president can't

128
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,899
specifically spend money in this situation?

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,640
But can he forbid the spending of money?

130
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,929
-- Can he block the spending of money?
-- Maybe?

131
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:14,203
Probably because the, the president has the ability to tell an agency

132
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,972
you can't do a thing.

133
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:19,752
And we actually had a lot of that in the last administration of a lot of don't do this.

134
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:23,162
Like, you can't help these people, you can't do that whatever. And so they can.

135
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:29,263
But at the same time, if, if spending the money is enshrined in law,

136
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,062
you end up in these weird situations.

137
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:33,763
And like my favorite example of this is in

138
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:34,852
the United States,

139
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:38,196
there's thing called the James Webb Space telescope that's being developed

140
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:42,316
and it's like years behind schedule and it's hilariously over budget.

141
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:42,906
And

142
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,585
the federal government

143
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:48,615
has like literally written into the law funding the James Webb Space

144
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:52,915
telescope that the James Webb will be launched on one of the,

145
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:56,555
one of the rockets NASA is building, I think it's a SLS the space launch system,

146
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:01,105
rockets which, and they think that we will build one of these rockets

147
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,720
to launch the James Webb and then probably never build them again because SpaceX

148
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:08,690
is like 1/10 the price, right? Like this is a hilarious example.

149
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,609
-- What's the other one? The Amazon
-- one blue origin.

150
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:13,269
Yeah, even they're making progress.

151
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:13,829
Yeah.

152
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,230
Yeah, they're, well, they're, they're,

153
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,549
they're making engines is my understanding.

154
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,989
I know they've launched certain things.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,350
I don't think they've made it into orbit yet, but, but whatever, it's,

156
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,109
it is obvious at this point

157
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,829
that

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,510
private industry

159
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,230
is bringing the cost of rockets down

160
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:33,630
at a hilarious pace. And so the, the SLS rockets are, they're a lost cause, right?

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,630
They're going to be 10 times times the price,

162
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,070
probably more than 10 times the price by the time they build it,

163
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,299
I actually can't even think of an analogy.

164
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,510
That's this bad.

165
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,829
It's, it's literally,

166
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,649
I literally can't think of an analogy where something

167
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,230
is so technologically and financially out of date and,

168
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,839
and

169
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,910
-- ineffective to boo. Right.
-- And, but because it's written in law,

170
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,589
they pretty much have to do it.

171
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:54,589
And

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,109
it's one of those things that

173
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,109
there's nothing stopping the government from, like,

174
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:01,410
basically rewriting this part and being like, uh,

175
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,799
instead of sls you can use any rocket you want.

176
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:04,730
Right. But, no, no,

177
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,630
it's in the law and of course,

178
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,329
someone's also building this and they're gonna flip out if whatever contractor is

179
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,559
building this rocket is suddenly not given their huge pile of money.

180
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,899
But you get the idea. Right. It

181
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:17,390
is. It is silly. So, anyway, anyway,

182
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,130
onto

183
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,149
the unfunded executive order there is, I'll put,

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,250
I'll put some links in the show notes.

185
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,769
There's a really, really nice, what do they call this thing?

186
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,670
A fact sheet from the White House that kind of breaks us down.

187
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,250
Because if you actually read the executive order it's very, very long and very,

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,049
very dry.

189
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,929
-- Yeah, I actually printed it and annotated it and it's,
-- did you really,

190
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,250
it's,

191
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,539
it's quite interesting.

192
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,929
-- I mean,
-- it is, I agree.

193
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,419
It has some interesting things in it but we will keep it a little more high level.

194
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,469
We'll say, than the,

195
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,039
and the long boring

196
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,250
executive order.

197
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,320
The first one is remove barriers to threat

198
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,200
information sharing between the government and private sector.

199
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,039
And

200
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,140
I don't think anyone would disagree with this. Right.

201
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,130
-- Well,
-- a lot of companies would because they don't want to, you know,

202
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,289
air their dirty laundry.

203
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,739
Even government let alone

204
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,270
even the government doesn't talk about this.

205
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,270
No, I think information sharing is critical because, well,

206
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,469
a perfect example is the not Pech

207
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,919
attack where certain companies

208
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,159
like Maersk got

209
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,599
almost destroyed.

210
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,780
Like they literally recovered their active directory infrastructure

211
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,469
because there was a server in Africa.

212
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,330
That was offline. That's right.

213
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,719
And had a clean copy, right? And had to like

214
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,659
they, they hand delivered, flew the hard drive up to London. You know,

215
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,799
like the whole story is just insane.

216
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,400
I think it's in another show note and then there's companies that had a,

217
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,109
they didn't even get the sniffles from it.

218
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,750
So it's clear that some degree of sharing and some degree of coordinations

219
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:44,669
is needed because we're having such widely different outcomes.

220
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,130
You know, what's going to happen here though is I bet the lawyers,

221
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,570
especially in the corporate world are going to be like no effing way.

222
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,530
Are you sharing this information?

223
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:53,849
Well,

224
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,409
one thing I've seen is with incident responses where they

225
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:59,200
immediately start c seeing their corporate counsel and stuff.

226
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,770
So it becomes a privileged communication.

227
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,390
That's right.

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,450
Boom, mic drop,

229
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,770
which is on purpose because you don't want this information getting out.

230
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,210
Let's take the colonial pipeline

231
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:11,143
is an example of this pipeline shut down for a week.

232
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,502
I can only imagine the lawsuits that are going to come from this.

233
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,093
-- Everyone and their mother are going to sue this company
-- for what you have.

234
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:21,403
-- No stand like
-- no, you can, you can definitely show financial.

235
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,062
I think of all the, all the gas stations, all the companies that couldn't get their,

236
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,742
I mean, there's, the supply chain is deep

237
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,302
and, but here's the thing

238
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:34,293
-- you don't technically need standing to file a lawsuit.
-- Well, yeah. No, I know you

239
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,556
standing to file a lawsuit,

240
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,995
but it's going to get chucked out and Colonial

241
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,765
pipelines has deep enough pockets to actually fight these,

242
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,395
you know, they're not some mom and pop shop.

243
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:42,786
No. No, I agree.

244
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:43,656
But at the same time,

245
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,156
if the lawsuit ever makes it to the point

246
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,526
of discovery now you can start requesting all these documents

247
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:53,966
and it'd be like, oh, crap, the intern downloaded porn, you know, or whatever.

248
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:56,195
Well, or that, you know, from what we,

249
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:59,185
what I've read is it looks like colonial just shut it all down

250
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,406
because they wouldn't be able to bill people for the product delivered.

251
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,429
But it, it, and it doesn't matter. Right.

252
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,690
The point is information sharing is a great idea in theory.

253
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,669
But I think from a liability perspective,

254
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,989
it's going to be a challenge and I think the government needs to put

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,190
basically protections in place for these companies

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,270
to say if you share this information,

257
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,669
you will not be held liable if

258
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,244
a third party tries to use it against you.

259
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:26,445
Ah, see, no, you can't, you can't do that because what if it's a criminal act?

260
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:31,155
-- And that's, of course, one of the difficulties there
-- is a simple solution to this.

261
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,755
And it's funny because you just brought up True Star before the show.

262
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:36,405
So True Star is an information sharing platform actually that, you know,

263
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:37,244
partnered with the

264
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,465
CSA the cloud security lines.

265
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,500
And for example, it has anonym organization stuff so that

266
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,369
you can

267
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,690
more safely upload and share like technical information,

268
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,609
like indicators of compromise like OK,

269
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:50,349
so we found this malware on our systems and

270
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,049
it was talking to this IP address in Russia.

271
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,190
So this IP address in Russia, if if your systems are talking to it,

272
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,390
well, they're probably compromised by this malware,

273
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,700
you know, or this host name being looked up or you know,

274
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,059
this file name or this file hash, you know, signature.

275
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,130
And so there are existing

276
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,780
systems and platforms to sort of anonymize this technical stuff.

277
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,419
And so that's basically not a problem. That's a solved issue.

278
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:16,590
I feel like this executive order though, Kurt it the text,

279
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:21,380
the wording they use makes it sound like they want more,

280
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,320
they want to go deeper than just that.

281
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,020
And they want like literal breach

282
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,848
information from a company, this one feels obvious to me though.

283
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:31,918
Like, sharing is good. I hope we find a way to do it.

284
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,918
That doesn't create a bunch of,

285
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,997
you know, legal liabilities. But,

286
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,578
yeah. Yeah, I don't, I don't think this one's exciting. All right, let's keep going.

287
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,638
The next one says modernize and implement

288
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:43,197
stronger cybersecurity standards in the federal government.

289
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,557
And this one basically boils down to use the

290
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,538
cloud more and single sign on which again,

291
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,598
like this kind of feels like duh,

292
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,437
-- it's
-- actually a bit more subtle than that.

293
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:56,216
And uh it's not use the cloud more, it's use the cloud first.

294
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:56,786
Well,

295
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:57,346
that's,

296
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,056
and that's a big difference.

297
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:03,435
They're pushing for a cloud first model which obviously I'm in favor of like,

298
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:05,635
I've been doing cloud security for over 10 years

299
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:09,695
and well, no, but, and the reality is it's better in most cases, right? Most people

300
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,455
just something quote unquote as simple as an email server.

301
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,935
And I don't mean like a proper email server,

302
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,995
like Google does with all your calendaring and docs

303
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,695
and everything I'm talking about just pure email.

304
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:20,046
Even just pure email nowadays is frightened

305
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,533
technical and sophisticated, right?

306
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,994
And most organizations unless providing email is like a core competency,

307
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,153
they should not be doing it.

308
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:31,023
And by most organizations I include not just like fortune 10,

309
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,833
but like governments that's becoming more and more apparent for everything from,

310
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,093
you know, expense reports,

311
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,674
time tracking, just everything, right.

312
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:42,914
-- The majority of organizations cannot run it that well.
-- Right.

313
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:49,091
And now I, I would say that lumping cloud and zero trust together make obvious sense.

314
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,132
I don't know if everyone always does it. But

315
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:53,651
no, if you don't have single sign on,

316
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:57,591
you basically can't exist in the cloud properly because you

317
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:01,822
-- don't want people with 700 log ins
-- zero trust architecture.

318
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,731
And the software defined perimeter is meant

319
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,731
more for it's essentially moving the security up

320
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:10,682
to the application level so that the application is aware of and can control it.

321
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:14,091
Because traditionally we split the data plane and the control plane.

322
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:15,012
And the problem is then

323
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,169
the data plane where stuff is actually happening.

324
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,479
Oh, you know, the VPN dropped and you were sending the data over clear text,

325
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,150
but the application doesn't know, right.

326
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,520
So we we do more and more stuff with TLS at the application level.

327
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,690
Well, this is moving that authentication and that authorization

328
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,340
again to the application level,

329
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,679
but more similar in style to like what firewalls have traditionally done

330
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,849
as opposed to, you know. Well, here's a login screen, good luck. So

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,890
that will happen. But it's going to be tough to forklift a lot of these applications.

332
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,090
And

333
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,659
the good news is is you can just,

334
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,760
you can basically wrap them and technology for

335
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,380
that art exists and it's getting better,

336
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,200
you know, cloud flare is doing this at a scale.

337
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,539
That's ridiculous. There are VPN tunneling and whatnot solutions.

338
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:57,869
What it boils down to is cloud first though, which is very different. Right.

339
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,630
It's, we're going to lose a lot of on premises stuff, which is good.

340
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,789
And what kills me is these, it,

341
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,539
people that fear for their jobs and the reality

342
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,700
is there's always infinite workload because you can always,

343
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,700
with white collar work,

344
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,500
there's always something you can do to add value to make it less painful,

345
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,340
to make it better.

346
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:15,700
Right.

347
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,349
Like, if you spent a billion dollars fixing all the it problems an organization had,

348
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:24,609
you would still have the opportunity to make stuff better and more efficient.

349
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,280
Right. So there's infinite work.

350
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,349
All right. Let's keep going because we're going to run out of

351
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,409
time otherwise. All right. Next one is improved software supply chain.

352
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,250
We've talked at length about software supply.

353
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,349
I don't think there's anything exciting to add at this point.

354
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,780
I think that the one thing that I, I

355
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,940
-- think is worth thinking about
-- what's,

356
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,489
there's timelines in this one and that's interesting.

357
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Well, there's timelines in all this stuff and of course,

358
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,140
the timelines are all going to get, you know,

359
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,729
not enforced and we're going to miss them all. But whatever, it doesn't matter.

360
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:57,659
I think I stressing that this isn't a, oh, let's just maybe do this someday.

361
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,140
It's good. Right.

362
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,859
Because then they can,

363
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:01,489
you can bring people in and yell at them if they're

364
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,059
not doing the work at a speed you approve of.

365
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,460
Well, or in theory, you can hold uh vendors feet to the fire and say

366
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,179
you're in violation of this order and we can't pay for this.

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,010
Uh

368
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,820
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

369
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,390
I just, I wonder how those software purchasing contracts are written?

370
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,580
Like does this executive order sort of count as an act of God and that

371
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,679
it can override the contract or is it essentially the contract is the contract?

372
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,830
There's text in the order that says you can get

373
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,250
waivers for all this stuff and that's what will happen.

374
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,580
Some of the suppliers can do this stuff. Some of them can't.

375
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,549
And at the end of the day,

376
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,349
what it really comes down to is you've got work

377
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,979
to do and you're going to get the work done

378
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,789
well and at least with the waivers though, you'll now know where the pain points are.

379
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,770
Yeah, that, I mean that and that's a good point is that,

380
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,969
that's an easy way to say these are the things we should work on first.

381
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:45,840
-- Well, no
-- more subtly,

382
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:49,250
it'll give you a hint of which suppliers are in compliance and

383
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,929
which are out of compliance consistently and that'll affect future purchasing.

384
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,450
Hopefully.

385
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,539
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, look at the backlog.

386
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,440
We talk about supply chain a lot and I'm not

387
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,900
going to talk about it today because we'll get,

388
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:00,820
we'll get in a rattle.

389
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,650
All right, the next one says establish a cybersecurity safety review board.

390
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:10,339
This one sounds really interesting to me because I feel like this is a good idea.

391
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:14,829
-- It sounds like they want to create a board.
-- Well, it's like the N TSB. Yeah.

392
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,130
Right.

393
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,739
Right. Yes, that's a great example.

394
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,824
Now, I like this in theory, but I think we kind of come back to some of that,

395
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:24,155
like information sharing liability problem at the beginning of,

396
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,795
is anyone going to want to work with them?

397
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,954
Because like you think things like the NTSB,

398
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,954
they companies work with them because the insurance

399
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,714
company said if you don't do this,

400
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,275
like we're not insuring your cars, you know, they've got like that, that,

401
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:39,275
that carrot dangling there of you have to do this.

402
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,314
So there's a really interesting series of youtube videos that I

403
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:44,675
binge watched a long time ago from the chemical safety board.

404
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,435
So, CS b.gov

405
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,229
and they have these youtube videos where, you know,

406
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:53,150
they forensically break down what happened at these chemical disasters

407
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,589
and some of them are horrifying and,

408
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,719
and really simple mistakes like a tanker truck

409
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:02,780
comes by to deliver some horrifying acidic compound

410
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,189
and they hook

411
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,270
it up to the outlet instead of the inlet valve.

412
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:11,469
And of course, when you put that into the system at the wrong place,

413
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,469
it goes boom, just all sorts of disasters.

414
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,729
And because when you have a chemical related incident, you tend,

415
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,969
it tends to be expensive

416
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,270
because stuff gets blown up and people get dead

417
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:24,589
and we're, we're getting there with the cyber incidents.

418
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,609
Uh as far as I know, nobody has directly been killed or died because of one of these.

419
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,449
But

420
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,540
for example,

421
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,839
the colonial pipeline incident was very disruptive

422
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,329
and had a lot of opportunity cost.

423
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,489
You know. So I think that this will

424
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,369
happen because it's just we're gonna,

425
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,292
the point where we're not learning anything from all these

426
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:44,213
incidents and they keep happening exactly the same way.

427
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,892
-- I'm
-- hopeful that this goes somewhere.

428
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:47,522
But again,

429
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:51,973
I feel like without an economic incentive behind it just saying we should do it,

430
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:53,172
I don't think is enough.

431
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,353
We need to either

432
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:57,483
have someone like the government say, if you're not part of this,

433
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,812
we're not buying your stuff or we need something like

434
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,633
insurance companies saying if you're not participating in this,

435
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,983
we're not insuring you or something.

436
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,473
Right? Because today

437
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,215
funding, absolutely.

438
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,426
Well, not just funding,

439
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:13,776
it needs incentive for the companies in the private sector to participate in this.

440
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,135
-- So
-- one sad thing is it could be privately funded,

441
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:17,526
which would be an incentive to do it because

442
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,605
then the companies kind of can control it more.

443
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,026
We have a thing here in Canada, for example, where there's a,

444
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,855
there's a banking regulations,

445
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:27,995
obviously and there's a government sort of ombudsman banking regulator

446
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,696
where you go if you have a problem.

447
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:31,095
But here's the best part, apparently,

448
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:34,806
the banks are able to opt out of it and go to a privately funded one that they pay for

449
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:40,479
and there was an article today because, like TD and Canada Trust before they merged,

450
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:44,359
basically, apparently lost a bunch of people's R SPS and they're like, well,

451
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,439
too bad it's gone.

452
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:48,530
And the agency that would actually investigate this

453
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,219
is funded by them and they of course,

454
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:51,599
found no real wrongdoing.

455
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:52,619
So there is actually a strong

456
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,959
incentive for, you know,

457
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,280
industry to fund this because then they can control it

458
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,000
and kind of make it go away a bit,

459
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,959
but that's not a win.

460
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:00,839
That's not good.

461
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:03,170
No, no, I agree. Like Esrb is another

462
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,520
one of my favorite examples, right?

463
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,800
The video game rating people where like the industry completely controls it. And

464
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:11,849
you can, I mean, honestly that one,

465
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:15,079
I feel like isn't a total train wreck but every now and then

466
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,040
it's like this is weird

467
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,530
anyway. Anyway. All right, let's keep going, let's keep going.

468
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,449
I do hope this one works out because I think it has potential.

469
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:26,260
The next one says create a standard playbook for responding to cyber incidents.

470
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,449
This one, I have a strong suspicion there is,

471
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,329
I think this is going to be less about doing the

472
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,619
work as it is about just collecting all the crap.

473
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:33,660
N

474
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,410
that's been writing over the last two decades.

475
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,329
I like putting it in a binder for people.

476
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:42,084
Well, and some of it is best practices because for example,

477
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:43,885
how do you do incident response with a cloud?

478
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,675
-- It's not like you can go image the systems. We'll get
-- to that.

479
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,364
-- That's where logging and other things come in. But,
-- well, no, no, no.

480
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,655
But what I mean is having a playbook and a checklist

481
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,645
would really help a lot of people because it would.

482
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:57,844
Yeah. Right. Right. Like an 80% solution is so much better than a 0% solution.

483
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:59,405
Especially when things are on fire.

484
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,109
Yeah. And,

485
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,630
and the on fire part is the most important is because,

486
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,410
especially when you're inexperienced when you're in the middle of an incident

487
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,569
and you've never really done this before.

488
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:13,400
It, you feel the pressure, like you feel the weight crushing you and you're like,

489
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,609
I have to do something now and sometimes

490
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,489
-- doing something is worse than doing nothing.
-- Perfect.

491
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,130
Example, colonial pipelines paid a $5 million ransom. They bargained it down

492
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,849
and apparently it wasn't effective because their actual

493
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,229
internal backup and resource systems were faster than the ransomware stuff.

494
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,489
That's what, that's what I heard,

495
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,369
which is,

496
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,619
yeah, they had so little faith in their, it or their,

497
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,540
it was not able or competent enough to say no, no, no.

498
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,630
We actually have all of this backed up properly. We can recover this.

499
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,109
Apparently it'll take X number of hours. So don't pay those Russian schmucks.

500
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,890
But again, I mean, I assume they weren't operating off a playbook either. Right.

501
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,550
This is probably pretty ad hoc is my suspicion.

502
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:57,339
Yeah. So again, I feel like this is, this is a good one. I have no complaints.

503
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,010
I think it's something we should totally do.

504
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,329
There's a reason people use recipes to cook food

505
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,020
and don't just free wheel it all the time.

506
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:07,510
Well, ok. No, that's, that's a really good example though because if you look at

507
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,140
the truly professional and gifted chefs of the world,

508
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,300
they don't use recipes.

509
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,979
But

510
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,660
-- we don't have truly gifted chefs at places like colonial pipelines.
-- That's right.

511
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,339
And, and nor am I right. Like I am not,

512
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:25,020
I have some things I could like to cook that I have written down on

513
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,359
my recipe cards and I follow them because if I try doing something different,

514
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:32,300
I'm going to end up with an inedible dish.

515
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,500
Yeah.

516
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,699
The reality is the majority of these companies don't have that level of,

517
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,510
they don't even have line cook competency in most cases.

518
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,050
That's right.

519
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:42,300
And if you do have that level of expertise, that's great.

520
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,800
Yeah. But you're not a private company, you're like a provider like

521
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,050
AW

522
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:50,469
s or Microsoft because somebody with that talent is not going to work at mcdonald's.

523
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,380
No, I agree. But also you can have one person with that level of talent.

524
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,920
-- You're not going to have a team with that level of talent.
-- This is all team sports.

525
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,010
-- Now, this is not one person.
-- Right. Right.

526
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,400
If you're a team of one, like your life is going to be terrible.

527
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,359
So you don't,

528
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,597
you don't need a playbook because you don't have time time to follow

529
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,467
a playbook because you're just busy putting out fires all the time.

530
00:23:09,477 --> 00:23:10,727
That's what, that's how it works anyway.

531
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:11,296
All right.

532
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,546
So the next two are the last two and I want

533
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:17,546
to clump them together because I think they're vaguely related.

534
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:21,587
First is improved detection of cybersecurity incidents on federal networks.

535
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:23,146
And this is things like, obviously

536
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,266
kind of having your,

537
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:29,307
your sim your security observable solutions and Endpoint and all that stuff.

538
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:34,593
But then the second one is improve investigative and remediation capabilities.

539
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:36,573
And this one is kind of like logging, right?

540
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,443
This is this is a big part of logging all your stuff.

541
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:42,014
And I I think these two things are com are squished into

542
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:45,973
one in my mind because obviously all of your detection capabilities,

543
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,374
feed your logs and your logs, feed your detection

544
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:53,020
-- solutions,
-- right? Investigative and remediation are operational, right?

545
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,360
You got to do something

546
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:58,360
you need people like boots on the ground, so to speak, doing stuff.

547
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:00,801
And remediation is interesting because remediation

548
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,360
has changed so much.

549
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,350
I mean, remember when it used to be basically OK,

550
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,140
we cloned the hard drive that's a backup except now it's like,

551
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:12,041
but the system is distributed across how many servers across how many time zones,

552
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,081
blah, blah, blah, you know, there's data on the fly,

553
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,201
we can't just freeze the disc and image it.

554
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:20,031
Um And now of course, it's moved to the cloud. So it's like, hey, Amazon can I get

555
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,711
all my data out well. And the answer is

556
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,150
-- sort of if you know what you're doing
-- well.

557
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,699
But now,

558
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:29,380
now here's the thing that makes cloud really cool though is when you're using, say,

559
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,420
you know, Google or Amazon or whatever,

560
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,430
they can give you extremely detailed logs of what's going on in your environment to a

561
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:41,359
degree that I would say the vast majority of on prem solutions just can't do.

562
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:41,680
Oh, yeah.

563
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:46,119
What I turned on cloud front and cloud trail or sorry, cloud trail, you know,

564
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,880
for logging every single thing.

565
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,780
-- It was just like, it's amazing. It was just this giant S3 bucket of stuff.
-- Right.

566
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,670
But now you have to do something with it and that's the challenge. Right.

567
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,760
-- Well, and the good news is there's automated solutions for that.
-- Yep. Absolutely.

568
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,400
There's tons of solutions. I mean,

569
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,869
I work at a company that does this kind of stuff right.

570
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,800
Where you take in like terabytes of stuff and then you

571
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,760
have to sift through it and figure out what matters.

572
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,119
-- Figure out when Bob got hacked.
-- That's right. Right.

573
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,069
And it's, it's hard to do and it's complicated and, I mean,

574
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,900
the tools are getting better every year.

575
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,550
I mean, if you look back a couple of years, the tools kind of suck,

576
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,250
they're pretty good now and they're just going to

577
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,900
-- keep getting better
-- and that speaks to the tools,

578
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,770
keep getting better.

579
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,770
The humans don't. No,

580
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:23,959
no, no

581
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:28,180
making a tool twice as good is possible because you do one tool,

582
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:31,579
you embed a whole bunch of people's knowledge and energy and effort into it.

583
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,719
But making a human being twice as good does not scale.

584
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,500
-- No,
-- humans are never humans have flat lined, right?

585
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,640
Like we are a flat line

586
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,119
of talent,

587
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,930
I would say, whereas all of our tooling, well,

588
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:46,550
it's probably only growing linearly in many instances.

589
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,790
At least it's growing.

590
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,569
It's, well,

591
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,339
the one thing I find interesting with tooling growing linearly is

592
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,239
that the whole ecosystem grows and then you gain new capability,

593
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:54,670
right?

594
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,989
It's like, for example,

595
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,750
it doesn't matter how good of a tire I could make for

596
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,939
a car in 1900 because the rest of the car was garbage,

597
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:02,390
right?

598
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,810
The transmission just couldn't put out enough power to make use of a modern tire.

599
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,530
You know, I'm always reminded of top gear when they, they raced, uh

600
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,329
like a 10 year old or 20 year old Porsche

601
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,150
against a minivan and the minivan just clobbered it.

602
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,540
A modern minivan.

603
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,170
Yeah.

604
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,329
Yeah, because a 20 year old Porsche at that time is, you know,

605
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:23,079
it's this temperamental piece of whatever.

606
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,239
When, when was this show? I mean, 20 years ago, it was 2000,

607
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:28,140
it was a long time ago. But the point is

608
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,849
like I bought a used car that's not high end and

609
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,170
its performance is quite good.

610
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:39,250
You know, compared to like it, it would have been a super car in the 19

611
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:42,255
-- up through the 19 fifties and sixties.
-- And that's fair.

612
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,406
I don't think anyone would argue with that.

613
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:48,076
We're seeing that with the security technology more and more where I, for example,

614
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,015
I, you know, we're in Google.

615
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,056
So we have single sign on through Google and a lot of our apps support that and

616
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:57,776
-- it just all magically
-- works even when we look at things like our endpoint tools now or

617
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:01,355
I mean, all these capabilities even, I would say a decade ago,

618
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,131
it was very much a

619
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:07,182
like AAA you had to do all this work, you had to,

620
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:08,362
you could do it,

621
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:12,212
but it was an enormous effort where you had to install lots of little agents.

622
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:14,732
You had to watch just the right files on the disk. You know what I mean?

623
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,692
You had to log them somewhere and it was, it was a nightmare.

624
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,202
And now like these are, these are pretty solved problems.

625
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:24,021
So I feel like this particular part of the executive order,

626
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:28,140
I don't think it's going to be exciting because I think the vast majority of

627
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,790
the federal government is already well on the way to doing all of this stuff,

628
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,599
I think standardizing it.

629
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:38,869
-- So
-- it's time to wrap this one up. But I feel like this gives me some hope.

630
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,040
I think the lack of funding is going to be a problem for parts of this.

631
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,630
But I think kind of like you said just

632
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,420
having some standardization and consistency with most of these topics

633
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:53,852
-- will probably go a pretty long way
-- well. So the bad news is this is all I mean,

634
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:59,602
Obama's executive order 13 636 specifically said

635
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,281
develop a technology neutral voluntary cybersecurity framework,

636
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,121
promote and incentivize the adoption of cybersecurity practices,

637
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,472
increase the volume timeliness and quality of cyber threat information sharing.

638
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:10,862
Incorporate strong privacy and civil liberties protections

639
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:13,041
into every initiative to secure critical infrastructure.

640
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,641
OK? That one was different and explore the

641
00:28:14,754 --> 00:28:17,583
of existing regulations to promote cybersecurity.

642
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:18,093
OK?

643
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:18,534
Look,

644
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:21,894
here's I think the big difference though is I I looked at that

645
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:25,693
executive order and I gave it a chuckle because it didn't happen.

646
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,473
I feel like the difference is this,

647
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:30,394
this Biden order has

648
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:31,563
dates

649
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:34,423
and they say who's going to do the work?

650
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:39,854
They say like this in the DH S is has 17 days to compile, you know what

651
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:40,586
I mean? And,

652
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,546
and I think in many instances like Nist

653
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,946
already has a lot of this documentation somewhere.

654
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:45,995
Oh,

655
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:48,105
there's probably people at Nist that were crying

656
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,536
with happiness when they read this thing and

657
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:52,666
they finally get to take it out of their filing cabinet and show it to somebody.

658
00:28:52,676 --> 00:28:55,686
It's not even in a filing cabinet. It's freaking published on their website.

659
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,826
It's just like someone needs to like go and take it

660
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:01,456
and say here we're going to put these two documents together

661
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,066
and this fulfill, you know what I mean? And so I feel like that

662
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,878
makes it slightly different. But again, the devil's in the details.

663
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,588
If there was, if there was a bag of money behind this,

664
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:15,797
I would be far more optimistic than I am, but I do think some of this is going to happen.

665
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,777
-- Some of it won't,
-- I'm not sure money will solve this problem.

666
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:19,427
To be honest,

667
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,578
I think there needs to be some fundamental changes

668
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:24,017
in how we view and treat these things because

669
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,988
back to money. Well,

670
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:29,598
we have money in the system and here we are with the security, we deserve to quote you.

671
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:30,147
I mean,

672
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,969
we totally do.

673
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,010
No, no, here's what I mean,

674
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,199
when I say money is so if the federal government goes to a vendor and says,

675
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,810
you have to give me an S bomb,

676
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:42,449
ignoring the fact that they probably can't process it in any usable way right now.

677
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,569
But they tell a vendor,

678
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:46,560
you have to give me an S bomb and the vendor doesn't have an S bomb.

679
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:50,369
They're going to say we need to raise your price $20,000

680
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,349
because we have to build the team to make S bombs,

681
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:52,770
right?

682
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,890
But you don't have $20,000 in your budget. So now what

683
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,050
you're going to say, well, I guess we don't need an S bomb.

684
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,449
We'll just waive this one if the federal government said, ok,

685
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:05,099
everyone gets 10% more in their budget because you need S bombs. Right now.

686
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,479
Now we're talking where you can say yes, vendor,

687
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:10,369
I will give you 10% more and you will give me an S bomb.

688
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,119
-- I seem
-- to remember we gave a whole bunch

689
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,560
of phone companies money for rural broadband too.

690
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:15,670
Yeah. How'd that work out?

691
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,060
So, that's why I say,

692
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,520
I'm not sure money giving money is the incentive or the solution here.

693
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,760
Not always. I agree with you and look like now we have magic Space Internet. So.

694
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,520
Right. No one's going to care. But pretty much again,

695
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:33,300
-- I don't, I don't have the answers.
-- Well, the good news is nobody has the answers.

696
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,099
-- That's the problem. And I don't think we're even agreed on the question.
-- That's,

697
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,500
and that's ok. Right.

698
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,939
That's,

699
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,900
that's how you have to start because I think

700
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,650
we often like to jump to solutions when we have

701
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,400
no idea what the problem we're trying to solve is

702
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,739
hopefully some of this helps us understand our problems.

703
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,140
So,

704
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,880
all right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening.
