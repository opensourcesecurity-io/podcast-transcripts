00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,329
I installed the Twitch app on the fire stick and watched a few minutes

1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,289
of Twitch streaming just to show Mel because she didn't quite believe me.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,570
And the top one was this guy unboxing yu

3
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:08,409
gi oh Cards.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,069
That's it. And Mel's like, but what else does he do? And I'm like, that's it.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,530
There's a guy on youtube who goes to the bank and gets coins and then he opens the coins

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,469
and I've watched hours of this guy and it is like, honestly, it's super boring,

7
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,569
but it's like, what's next?

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,709
What's next? It's, it's the perfect.

9
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,620
I am a stupid monkey

10
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,340
drug. It's lovely.

11
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:37,189
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
Kurt Siefried and my partner in thought crime, Josh Bresser.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,909
So I bought a track ball the other day because my,

14
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:47,310
my wrist was feeling the repetitive stress of using my mouse way too much.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,049
-- Did you get like a thumb, track ball or like a palm track ball? No,
-- a thumb.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,520
Actually, I didn't even think of the palm ones.

17
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:55,069
I just picked up a thumb one and it's not like super duper nice.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,189
It's just, I figured I'd get a reasonably priced track ball and see if I like

19
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,439
it and go from there.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,099
Yeah.

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,959
But you're, you're basically just transferring the problem from your,

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,080
from your wrist to your thumb.

23
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:05,800
-- So,
-- actually,

24
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:10,239
you know what I found is my forearm muscles are what are suffering at the moment,

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,080
but muscles I can deal with.

26
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,879
-- Whereas wrist joint pain is not enjoyable.
-- Well, yeah.

27
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,730
So my sister actually forced herself many,

28
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,040
many years ago to learn to mouse with her left hand.

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,400
-- I can
-- mouse with either hand.

30
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:23,419
Oh,

31
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:24,629
yeah, because you're a lefty

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,650
left handed. So I had to learn to use both.

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,209
-- Well, why not just have two mice and like, break it up.
-- I switch it every now and then.

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,370
I basically just decided, like,

35
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,930
I'm because the thing is I'd switch a mouse and then that,

36
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,139
-- that hand would start hurting in a couple of days and last
-- week.

37
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,440
-- So why not switch faster than a couple of days? Like, I don't know,
-- switch, I'm lazy

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,779
-- or
-- it starts hurting, like,

39
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,730
stop using logic against me. Won't that work?

40
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,169
It's like that time I exercise too much and then my body hurts.

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,089
-- So I never did that again.
-- Just exercises. What up with that?

42
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:50,370
Uh

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,839
No, no. And this is something I've wanted to do for a while anyway.

44
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,300
So I'm like, you know what, it's time and I've been doing

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,769
an unusually large amount of mouse work due to a project.

46
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:07,010
I wrote a Python script to read and edit Excel spreadsheets, which to let you know,

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,470
that's where I've ended up because I've grown

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,839
so sick of looking at these spreadsheet.

49
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,192
I'm like, I'm just building a robot to do my job because I hate it.

50
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,792
-- Which seems like a win to me.
-- Isn't that the whole point of it?

51
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:21,022
Is building a robot to do your job? I like. Isn't that the fundamental premise of it?

52
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,432
Yeah, pretty much so. Anyway.

53
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,472
All right, we're going to talk about old devices today. So set us up.

54
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,472
I have a theory actually that says there's basically, I think two,

55
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,352
maybe three kinds of compute devices.

56
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:36,936
So the first kind is the kind of compute device that is not necessarily locked down,

57
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:38,856
like, even like from a bootloader perspective,

58
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:42,016
but it's just something that has computer software in it.

59
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,376
And, oh, also we're only talking about stuff connected to the internet.

60
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:47,416
If it's not connected to the internet, it doesn't count. That's fair. Right?

61
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,376
Like, because to be blunt, like I'm pretty sure,

62
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,936
yeah, I have like this desk clock that has temperature and

63
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,455
humidity and stuff and there's,

64
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,945
there's got to be a micro controller in

65
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,365
there but there's like there's no network connectivity.

66
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:57,735
So,

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,259
yeah, no, it doesn't count. So I'm talking about stuff that is

68
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,330
actively connected to the internet, not stuff that can connect to the internet,

69
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:09,160
but stuff that is typically commonly connected to the internet, right?

70
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:12,250
So, like you know that guy that, like, hacked his game boy to go on the internet,

71
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,250
game boys don't count.

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,899
So the first set is those devices that kind of do a thing.

73
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,059
And, you know, even if you have like AJ TE port or whatever, you're not going to like,

74
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,160
monkey around with it and reprogram it or ever change the software on it.

75
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,020
You're basically going to get it from the manufacturer,

76
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,740
you're going to get the software updates,

77
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,199
maybe if ever from the manufacturer and install them and it's, you know,

78
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,559
I'm talking like IOT light bulbs, I'm talking like,

79
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,429
you know, just all that kind of small stuff.

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,139
And then the second category is stuff where it's like locked down,

81
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:44,179
but you can load software on it to do stuff of

82
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,447
used to you. So this is basically be like your smartphones and tablets,

83
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:52,277
right? Like I can't really jail, like I could jailbreak it in theory, but it's

84
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,938
-- a lot of hassle,
-- let's assume from the perspective of normal people.

85
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:59,307
But the biggest difference being for example, if one app stops working,

86
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,998
like say Google sheets stops working.

87
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,567
I can go to Excel or if you know what I mean, like the things I want this device to do,

88
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,037
I have some choice in the software to do that in theory,

89
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:09,677
right?

90
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,677
So like there's more than one drawing program, there's more than one web browser,

91
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:13,507
there's, you know what I mean?

92
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,865
And then the third one is what we all think of as classical computers, right? Where

93
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,575
you have a relatively open and, and I mean,

94
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,875
even Mac Os and Windows are relatively open by

95
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,175
the standards of like a mobile phone currently.

96
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:28,186
You know, you can, although Mac Os is going a different way, but, you know, like,

97
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:31,376
for example, with Windows, I can pretty much load whatever I want on it,

98
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,855
especially now at this point where it runs all the Linux software too.

99
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:35,216
And so

100
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:40,126
in case number one, what I want that device to do is very specific

101
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,985
and it's accomplished by the software on that device. And

102
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:45,364
quite commonly, that software also has like a mothership.

103
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,593
It connects to, to like log data or,

104
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,713
you know, provide control over the internet, whatever.

105
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:55,364
And so to put it bluntly, even if I can hack it or even if I can update it economically,

106
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:56,364
it's just not worth it.

107
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,084
It would take so much time and effort

108
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,783
to like hack my light bulbs and like build my own

109
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:04,144
firmware and load it on them that it's not gonna happen.

110
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:07,084
Contrast that to a use case like you where you're like, yeah,

111
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:09,444
I have to read all these stupid spreadsheets that are all mangled up.

112
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,334
I'm going to write a Python script to go through them, right?

113
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:12,403
You could write that in Python, you

114
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,522
write in VB script, you could write it in bash

115
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,411
whatever you, you have a lot of options because

116
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,742
kind of the problem that you want to solve is kind

117
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:24,011
of high level enough that there's a lot of options,

118
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:26,411
you know, and it's not tied to the hardware. Right.

119
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,101
Like you don't buy a laptop that comes with, like Excel preloaded.

120
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,462
And that's the only spreadsheet it'll ever be able to run. Now.

121
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:35,291
Microsoft sort of tried to do that with surface at one point.

122
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:39,171
-- But
-- for example, I could still go to the website on, for Google Sheets

123
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,492
and the,

124
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:41,832
the people revolted.

125
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:42,899
Yeah. Exactly.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,540
So, with these three classes of connected to the internet, because quite honestly,

127
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,089
if it's not connected to the internet, I don't care.

128
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,450
I don't have to worry about protecting it. Yeah. Right. Right.

129
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,529
Realistically, unless it's like some military installation or something crazy.

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,369
Let's

131
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,250
explain the story that is the inception

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,329
to this

133
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,410
conversation.

134
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:04,799
So, as, you know, I love Android phones because I think they're awesome because,

135
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,140
you know, you're, you're locked into carrier updates

136
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,239
and they never get software updates past six months.

137
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,380
So I think they're just the bee's knees and

138
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,619
this is all coming home to roost finally.

139
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,459
Well, no, traditionally this doesn't matter.

140
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,029
They, they're insecure and they're easy to hack.

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,899
They're, they're dirt freaking cheap. I mean, that's what it really comes down to.

142
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:26,100
Exactly. They're dirt cheap. They're accessible, they work, but now

143
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,920
they actually kind of might stop working a lot. Sort of, some of them.

144
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:34,059
The reason is the, lets encrypt is getting their own root certificate.

145
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,750
Right in past,

146
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,950
they had a certificate that is signed by another root authority

147
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,160
that then allows them to operate as a certificate authority.

148
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,480
And now they're getting up on their own 2 ft, which is awesome.

149
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,940
-- Well,
-- they've been up on their own 2 ft for a while.

150
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,700
It's just, what's happening is the original cross signed certificate is now

151
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,170
going away because obviously when

152
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,359
another C signs anything,

153
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:58,230
there's a lifespan on that.

154
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,670
-- Also,
-- more importantly, when the C A cross signed something that C is now

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,209
responsible for everything signed with that cross sign certificate,

156
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,049
-- which that's, it's a bit of liability
-- right there.

157
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:08,630
I mean, sure.

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,429
And now let's encrypt has become big enough that their route is included everywhere

159
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,829
except for old things because you can't go back in time.

160
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,579
Well, and also it's the way it's included because the old thing,

161
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:21,910
the way it used to work is you had this,

162
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,255
essentially Firefox had a root certificate store and everybody else was like,

163
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,274
yeah, they did a good enough job vetting these people.

164
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,614
Sure, let's use that.

165
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:30,554
And I mean, the, the,

166
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,904
the process back in the day was hilariously terrible and that it was fail open.

167
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:37,424
It was if you went with a root certificate to Firefox and said,

168
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,065
I want to be in the certificate store,

169
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:42,054
essentially, somebody had to prove that you shouldn't be in that store

170
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,434
otherwise you were let in.

171
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,894
And I mean, there were some people that were terrible enough that they were like,

172
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,015
yeah, we, we can't let you in.

173
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,834
But if you, if you actually look at your root certificate store,

174
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,894
there's hundreds of cas in there and I tried to

175
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,204
track them all down at one point and I couldn't.

176
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:54,834
Oh, yeah,

177
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,589
there's a sort of a hidden spreadsheet the Firefox

178
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,709
people have with the data on these CS.

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,859
And even that is, like,

180
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:04,649
awfully vague in some cases like who these CS are or what

181
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,910
they do is like some of these cas don't really have websites.

182
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,910
And I'm like, um, how, what, how does that work anyways?

183
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,399
So these older Android devices are, you know,

184
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,489
these old devices that cannot get software updates because, well,

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,940
the carriers just don't support it.

186
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:26,415
-- I
-- want to also clarify, we're talking about devices from 20 16 and before.

187
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,005
So it's more than three years, which is three years.

188
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:34,905
Is that magic number, especially in Android land that infuriated me so much.

189
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,705
I switched to an Apple device because I think three years

190
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,104
-- because we get 5 to 6 years.
-- Exactly.

191
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,955
Well, and that three years too isn't like three years from when you buy the device.

192
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,724
It's three years from when that device is released.

193
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:47,505
So if you buy that device like a year after it's released,

194
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,164
you're getting two years of support, right?

195
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,625
Which is insane.

196
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:53,104
You know, same thing with chromebooks, chromebooks get, what is it?

197
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:56,369
I want to say six years of support from like a certain date that they're released.

198
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,809
Yeah.

199
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,650
And I bought a chromebook like a year and a half after it was released,

200
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,869
only to realize I'm going to get like 4, 4.5 years tops out of this thing.

201
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,200
And then it's, and then what do I throw it away? Also? Frustrating.

202
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,460
-- Well, it's annoying because it works fine.
-- Yeah, I know. I know, man. I know.

203
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,729
-- You
-- know, but it's garbage because Google said so,

204
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:15,390
and that kind of ties into that classes of devices where with these phones,

205
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,690
in theory somebody could jailbreak the phone side, load a new Os blah, blah, blah,

206
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,330
bring it up to date, but like nobody's going to do that.

207
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,030
Like the economics of doing that are horrid.

208
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:26,775
This and the skill and the technology needed may not be available.

209
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:30,034
-- You live in a small town. It
-- doesn't matter where you live. I think about

210
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,395
like helping my parents with their computer and it's just

211
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:37,065
I told them to buy a chromebook because they can't screw it.

212
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,184
And since they've had it, they've never called me once

213
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:42,614
and it's basically like it's got training wheels on it and

214
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,174
they're taped into the seat and they can't mess it up.

215
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,325
-- It's lovely.
-- Yeah.

216
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,724
No, if I had to get a device for somebody, I would start,

217
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:52,304
I would say you're in order of preference, it would be tablet chromebook.

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,140
-- And God forbid if they need a quote unquote computer then get them a Mac.
-- Exactly.

219
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,359
-- Although the windows stuff is pretty good these days,
-- Windows is getting better,

220
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,750
but you kind of have to set it up.

221
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,299
Right.

222
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,200
Yeah, that's probably fair. That's probably ok.

223
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,539
So, anyway, anyway, I don't want us to rat hole on these specific details.

224
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:08,869
The thing with this is

225
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,859
normally again, here's the thing with security bugs,

226
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,500
security bugs don't matter until somebody exploits them.

227
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,700
Right. You can a perfect example. I have accidentally left my

228
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
door unlocked on my house.

229
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:21,815
I

230
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,385
actually one time left my garage door wide open until like,

231
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:27,905
uh, uh, in the evening, my neighbors like, um, your garage door is open.

232
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:28,525
Did you mean to do that?

233
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:31,924
-- And I'm like, uh, nope, kind of hope everything's still there.
-- I have a fun story.

234
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,804
I have a heated garage

235
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,315
and it's a detached from my house

236
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:40,205
and I left the door open. We'll say I, I'll blame myself.

237
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:42,645
We don't know exactly who it was, but it probably wasn't me.

238
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,114
Somebody left the door open all night long.

239
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:50,125
-- Oh, God, what was that heating bill?
-- It was an unpleasant bill to pay, we'll say

240
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,780
because the heater in the garage literally ran for eight hours,

241
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,450
but I had no snow left on the roof, um, outside the garage door.

242
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,299
So what you're saying is you're admitting that global warming is your,

243
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,500
it is almost definitely my fault. I am a significant contributor to that problem.

244
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:08,140
Yes.

245
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,510
So normally with these security flaws and what not, it doesn't matter,

246
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,359
but this is different in that websites will stop working and,

247
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:14,969
and not just a few websites, but like,

248
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:18,500
let's encrypt is now a significant portion of the internet

249
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,460
and, and honestly also a kind of, of what matters. And now,

250
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,270
and this is funny because everybody's always like,

251
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,630
why do companies pay so much money for these certificates?

252
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,580
Blah, blah, blah. Well, now, you know why? Because they want to get

253
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,979
a certificate that's signed by a route that's

254
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,789
like in these devices for like the next,

255
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,729
like some of these root cas don't expire.

256
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:38,929
I remember some of them had like 38 year life spans or something absurd.

257
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,479
It's completely ridiculous.

258
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,159
And this is why that, you know,

259
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,409
your bank and Facebook and those guys will pay horrendous amounts

260
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,390
of money to whoever has like the longest lasting lifetime cert

261
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,929
in the browser store because they don't even

262
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,059
want to drop of like 0.00001% of traffic.

263
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,440
Right?

264
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,359
Ok. I've been thinking about this a lot, a lot more than is probably healthy.

265
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,289
And

266
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,299
I think here's where the conversation is going to start, where,

267
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,539
where we're going to say,

268
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,900
it's easy to say old devices should die.

269
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,340
And that's the, the cop out I think,

270
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:13,179
especially when you have the privilege that we have, which is, oh,

271
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,580
my device stopped working.

272
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,690
-- I'm just going to go to the Apple store.
-- Exactly. Now, there's the argument of

273
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,809
so there are,

274
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,270
we'll say low income or disadvantaged people who can't necessarily upgrade.

275
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,369
There's people living on $2 a day that have

276
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,750
managed to get a smartphone and God bless it.

277
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,210
These things are helping them, you know, they're opening up markets and economies

278
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,440
-- that are helping gank people out of poverty.
-- Now, I agree with that.

279
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,150
And, but here's my thinking in that regard is

280
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,200
just because you are

281
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,210
disadvantaged in some way.

282
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,400
And I wouldn't even say it's only economics because like,

283
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,059
I know people that have ancient phones because they don't

284
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,679
see a reason to upgrade and they just don't understand.

285
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,140
-- And it's like, whatever I've given up in
-- general though,

286
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,359
-- for their use case that might be ok for them
-- and, and it might be, but,

287
00:12:56,369 --> 00:13:00,320
but here's the point is if you are disadvantaged in some way,

288
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,159
these companies are selling you unsafe products.

289
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,080
And unfortunately, the way the laws are written today,

290
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:14,677
old broken phone doesn't qualify as unsafe in the same way as let's

291
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:18,098
say I buy a product that kills me or burns down my house.

292
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:22,418
The liability is well defined there. And I think this is one of the big problems.

293
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,757
Two thoughts on this number one, how do you deal with secondary markets?

294
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:31,487
Like use stuff? And secondly, we have seen regulation around this.

295
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,088
So for example, where I live here in Canada

296
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:35,778
and I think it's Canada wide, it could be just provincial.

297
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:40,015
I cannot sell you or give you my used car seat.

298
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:43,176
It's just not allowed because it might have been in a crash, it might not be safe,

299
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:44,635
it might, you know, think of the Children.

300
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:48,375
And so even if I can guarantee, like, look, my car has no dents. This car seat's fine.

301
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:51,875
I can't legally sell it and I have to throw it out. And on the one hand

302
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:55,585
I get it and I like that because people should get new car seats that are like,

303
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:57,995
not all beat to crap and like art for their kids.

304
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,395
But on the second hand, this results in a huge amount of waste.

305
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,906
And there's a lot of people who can't afford a good car seat.

306
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:08,624
Here's my argument that is saying just because you can't afford

307
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,174
a good car seat doesn't mean you don't deserve one and

308
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,914
saying that disadvantaged people should be happy with the junk they

309
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:19,294
get is I think a twisted and demented view of society.

310
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,653
No, no, I'm saying the opposite of that. Well, yeah, society is saying that.

311
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,973
No, I understand you are. I'm not, I'm not. Society is saying it. Exactly.

312
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,633
I'm not, I'm not blaming you. Now, here's

313
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:32,573
kind of one of the ways I would look at this is if you have a small child,

314
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,174
a car seat is like legally required.

315
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:39,331
You can argue. It's kind of one of those like basic needs

316
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:41,452
and I don't know about Canada.

317
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,721
But I know like in the United States there are ways

318
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:48,111
to acquire high quality car seats if you are economically disadvantaged.

319
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,791
-- And
-- that's great for us.

320
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,932
But I feel like we're not going to see a, you know,

321
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,942
a mass cell phone subsidy program in poor

322
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,372
countries because they just can't afford it.

323
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:57,341
Well, we should though.

324
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,531
I mean, so in all seriousness, I mean, this is a society problem.

325
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,302
This is not a security problem because the reality

326
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:05,890
is if you to exist in the world today,

327
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,559
it doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter what you do,

328
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:12,109
you need access to the internet and the vast majority of people,

329
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,890
their access to the internet equals a cell phone.

330
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,330
Well, a smartphone smartphones took over cell phones.

331
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,309
-- Thank God finally from
-- this point forward for the rest of our

332
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,169
working relationship. Anytime I say cell phone, I mean, smartphone. Ok.

333
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,080
Fair enough

334
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,049
-- that goes for you too.
-- Listeners.

335
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm just, I'm old enough to have owned a couple of flip phones.

336
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,190
I think I might still have one in a box somewhere. But

337
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,169
anyway, anyway, you, you get the idea. So this is a basic human right at this point.

338
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,780
And I don't think we're, we're recognizing that.

339
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,380
And so basically these companies that are making

340
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:49,010
low quality smartphones and never updating them.

341
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,440
It is the same thing as being like, oh,

342
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,859
whatever those poor kids can play with my broken glass, it's fine

343
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,500
just because you don't have the money to buy the good one, doesn't mean

344
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,619
that you should be sold an unsafe one.

345
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,219
-- So,
-- the question is ultimately who pays for this?

346
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,500
Because if the people could pay for this,

347
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,520
they probably would get a slightly better phone or, you know,

348
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,419
upgrade their phone once every couple of years to get better camera,

349
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,059
better features, better screen, whatever.

350
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,820
Right. So, it's a product safety issue.

351
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,859
I mean, look, if, if Ford makes a car that blows up,

352
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,900
no one's going to say, oh who has to pay to fix the Ford cars?

353
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:25,049
-- Well, Ford freaking pays to fix it because they built a car that
-- blows up.

354
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,729
We have different standards of vehicle safety across the world.

355
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,710
Like if you look at the crash test of some of those people in

356
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,500
China,

357
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,780
-- if you look at the crash test of some of those Chinese cars, they're horrifying
-- and,

358
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,130
and in that context,

359
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,140
it is up to the Chinese government to set those standards.

360
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,679
I don't want to dwell too much on China.

361
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,739
This is what really grinds me with this issue is, you know,

362
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,710
what one solution here would be, is to have somebody like a public group fund,

363
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:51,469
a really good operating system for phones that was open sourced

364
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,150
and freely given out so that it would be cheaper and easier to do updates.

365
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,940
You know, something may be based on Linux anyway.

366
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,799
And that

367
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,460
happened and here's where we ended up

368
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:06,598
Yeah, it did because it turns out that rather than

369
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:08,890
treating it as something we can upgrade.

370
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,520
Everyone just tried to lock them down and sell garbage.

371
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,550
What's like the smart TV thing where smart TV,

372
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,560
manufacturers make most of their profit by putting adware junk on your TV.

373
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,910
Like the problem is the cost of TV. S is driven down

374
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,520
but

375
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,280
I, I cannot make money selling you a TV.

376
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,598
Like if I charge you enough money to make money selling

377
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:30,083
a TV, it's going to cost like 50% more than my competitors.

378
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:33,963
So, what I have to do is the same thing with the old laptops and crap Warre issue.

379
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,823
Right. I'm going to, like, load crap Warre on the TV.

380
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,443
And, you know,

381
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,244
some antivirus company is going to pay me 10 cents and install because, you know,

382
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:43,223
on average one in 1000 people are stupid enough to accidentally hit.

383
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:47,443
Yes, and plug in their credit card number to get antivirus on their TV or whatever.

384
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:49,793
-- But
-- here's, I think the big,

385
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:54,803
the big point we talk about all of these problems in the context of security

386
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:57,140
and it's not really a security problem.

387
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,780
Like the fact that a certificate is going to stop

388
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,890
working on older android devices isn't a security problem.

389
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:03,609
Right.

390
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,680
It's the fact is that these companies made garbage devices,

391
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,800
we're letting them make garbage devices and

392
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,790
there is essentially zero regulation or liability

393
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,010
-- in any of this.
-- I think one of the challenges is, is that we have to accept that there.

394
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,020
The, it's, the product is a product as a whole.

395
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,689
Whereas it used to be, you know, products didn't used to have software.

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,800
Like for the first, well, basically majority of my life, anything I bought,

397
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,869
there was no software on it.

398
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,270
With the exception of like my game boy, literally,

399
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,109
-- which still
-- works.

400
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,920
-- Yeah, it actually,
-- yeah.

401
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,930
So fun fact, I have an original Game Boy in a box in my basement.

402
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,239
Mint.

403
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:42,560
It's in acceptable shape. We'll say it's clearly been used but it's not like beat up.

404
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,589
00, ok. I thought you meant like you were one of those crazy people like, don't do

405
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,280
-- that.
-- No, man. If only I was that smart.

406
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,040
Oh, yeah, I could retire.

407
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,920
But the thing is people don't sort of see products in their entirety.

408
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,030
I, what I see with a lot of people is they see the hardware of the phone.

409
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,959
They're like, well that still works.

410
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,729
That's acceptable and I'm like great,

411
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,829
but that hardware doesn't do squat without good software.

412
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,069
Like the camera on my phone,

413
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,869
the camera on my phone is useless without a good camera app.

414
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,270
It is. It is completely true.

415
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,310
Now, now, maybe, maybe a different way to think about this

416
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,319
is,

417
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,099
let's say I buy medicine at the drugstore, right?

418
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:18,390
That medicine has a use by date on it.

419
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,520
And if I use old medicine and I get sick and die.

420
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,449
People are going to say you shouldn't have done that.

421
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:26,280
That's a terrible example because somebody did a study into those use by

422
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,589
dates and found out that essentially if it's a pill and it's,

423
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,729
it's stored in a cool dry place, it's probably good for a few decades.

424
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,209
It wouldn't surprise me.

425
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,729
There are some medicines that do degrade and obviously medical isotopes.

426
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:43,119
Vast majority of medicines, especially in pill form are stupidly shelf stable.

427
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,094
I mean, it could, I

428
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:44,464
mean,

429
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,604
that's like even I enjoy eating expired condiments in

430
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:49,375
my fridge just to see if I get sick.

431
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:52,795
Everybody in Antarctica is eating expired food because they get

432
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,275
one shipment of food on a boat every year,

433
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:56,145
plus a few flights.

434
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,635
I would just watch a documentary on it

435
00:19:57,805 --> 00:20:00,694
and the head of like, food services in Antarctica.

436
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,314
He's like, yeah, we don't really go by expiry dates.

437
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:06,425
He's like, look, see this stuff, this stuff was expired when it got here

438
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,265
because it came on a boat. That's hilarious. You know, like

439
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,890
there's just, I mean, there's like, I do buy canned beans and canned beans have,

440
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,560
you know, like a two year life expiry.

441
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,339
I'm pretty sure I can eat them in five or 10 years. And I mean, you know,

442
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:22,170
we'll put some show notes to Steve. What is it, MRE Info, Steve 1986 or whatever.

443
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,969
Yeah, that's awesome. And, um, watch him eat some 160 year old hard

444
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:26,380
p

445
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,819
or my favorite is like, he's like, oh, it smells rancid and he's like, oh,

446
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,819
and it tastes worse.

447
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,849
-- He's like, and then he tries it again and it's just like, oh, my
-- God.

448
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,609
Well, if you want a youtube channel you got to act like that.

449
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,949
No one wants to see the boring guy. He's like, well, I'm not eating

450
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,040
and it smells terrible. No, you eat it and you feel yourself eating it.

451
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,619
Dance, monkey dance.

452
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,479
That's how it works.

453
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,040
-- So,
-- back to our topic, I think the economics of it are, you know,

454
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,040
if I sell you a phone for 50 bucks and the hardware costs 48 bucks.

455
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:56,369
That gives me $2 a profit and that's not profit, profit.

456
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,800
Like, I still have to pay the rent and stuff.

457
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,300
So I'm going to maybe put some crap around there to make a few more bucks,

458
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,959
but I am sure as heck not going to spend any money maintaining that software.

459
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,079
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

460
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,540
I can't afford to.

461
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,479
And that's assuming the company is still in business.

462
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,349
Well, and this actually is an interesting thing.

463
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,229
I was thinking about this in the context of like,

464
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,479
computers because you think about so you buy a Mac

465
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,959
and obviously Apple is in control and they win.

466
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:21,150
But you buy a windows computer and

467
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,890
the vendor put windows on it generally.

468
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,310
But then Microsoft is where all your updates are coming from.

469
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,109
You rarely get any updates from the manufacturer.

470
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,189
My understanding is that was sort of the vision of

471
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,270
the Android O si would be comfortable with that.

472
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,390
See, and that would be a good thing. But the

473
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,016
problem is these carriers want to have their, like,

474
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,526
flavored version of Android Os with their own crap

475
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,536
warre and they want to lock you into stuff.

476
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:48,876
Like I bought a $99 unlocked Android phone, you know,

477
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,337
as a starter phone for one of my kids.

478
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,717
So it was a Verizon phone from the US and it

479
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,957
had like an NFL app on it that I cannot remove.

480
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,886
-- Yeah.
-- Unless you root it. It's, you're stuck with it.

481
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:58,107
Yeah.

482
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,116
And I'm not going to, I mean, I'm not even going to bother.

483
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:01,347
So I literally,

484
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,406
my son tried to use it for a month or two and

485
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,416
then I apologized to him and gave him an old iphone.

486
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:08,107
Yeah, I mean, this is why I only ever bought the Google

487
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:11,994
phones because they didn't come with garbage and the garbage is terrible.

488
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,384
Yeah. Well, it would be nice. But those aren't really available in Canada.

489
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:18,124
Seriously. That's embarrassing. Yeah, we've had this conversation, right.

490
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:18,744
This sounds

491
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,144
proper Google phones are really hard to find in Canada.

492
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:23,784
And if they break, I got to send them back to the US to be.

493
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,063
That's terrible. See, and that's the other thing, right?

494
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:30,723
Like if you get a phone and you can't get it fixed locally, normal people can't, like,

495
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,524
it's not even the cost of sending it away.

496
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:32,774
It's,

497
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,963
I can't, like, I can't live without my phone for two weeks or three weeks. It's true.

498
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:37,843
You know, and most people

499
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,671
aren't privileged enough to be like, oh, crap, my phone breaks.

500
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:44,931
I'm gonna just go buy an extra iphone to have as a spare. Right.

501
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:48,791
Or even an Android phone, I'll just drop 100 bucks on it, you know, and be done with it.

502
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,051
That's just not how this works.

503
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,890
I mean, something a question is,

504
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:58,811
is there any existing product space that's even remotely comparable to this?

505
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,850
I can't really think of anything good.

506
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,120
No, it's,

507
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,571
it's new and weird in the Microsoft and Apple have broken the update trap and like red

508
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:07,978
too.

509
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:12,897
For example, Red Hat broke the update trap by becoming not selling you a device,

510
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,817
but like Apple sells you a lifestyle.

511
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:20,537
Microsoft generally sells you a platform that you then spend more money on,

512
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,498
especially with Microsoft and like office uh

513
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:26,258
Red Hat. Straight up, you get a subscription, you pay

514
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:29,417
-- and you get all your updates for as long as you pay.
-- This is interesting.

515
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:29,637
I mean,

516
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:32,817
maybe this is the right answer is if you thinking of this

517
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:37,297
-- more as a subscription than as a I've acquired a device
-- challenges,

518
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:39,645
people are given a choice between a phone that

519
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:41,714
is a subscription and costs a little bit more

520
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,224
than a phone that is not a subscription and

521
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:46,104
appears to be exactly the same and it will be

522
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:47,064
the same

523
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,645
for the first six or 12 months and then it

524
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,824
will diverge and you will have that worst experience and that

525
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,604
worst experience won't necessarily be a problem because you may

526
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:58,994
never get a security issue that is exploited against you.

527
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,444
Well, and you probably won't. The reality is, I think from

528
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:06,364
the security update perspective, the vast majority of people are going to be ok.

529
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,025
The certificate

530
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,911
thing is different because everyone's going to be affected by that.

531
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:15,562
Who has an old device full stop? There's no, maybe, maybe not like, yes, definitely.

532
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:16,031
Yes.

533
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,112
So I don't know what the answer is because I want

534
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:24,031
there to be manufacturers and providers of like literally $10 smartphones.

535
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:28,991
Like I think that is the most bloody amazing thing we as mankind have come up with.

536
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:33,612
-- I agree it would be lovely if it existed. Oh, no,
-- $10 smartphones do exist.

537
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,751
And that's the problem is that at a $10 smartphone price point,

538
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,759
-- you can't maintain it.
-- Right.

539
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,838
Walmart is selling a $10 smartphone.

540
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:44,068
I need to look at this. I wonder if they're,

541
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:45,399
they're worth owning.

542
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:46,798
I'd be curious.

543
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,909
They're probably flaming garbage and terrible. But you know what?

544
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:52,269
They are a smartphone, generally running Android.

545
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,019
Os generally they can browse the web and they have a couple of apps, you know,

546
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:56,958
I say go for it.

547
00:24:57,178 --> 00:25:00,938
I mean, if, if you don't have internet, any internet is better than no internet.

548
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:01,479
Right.

549
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:02,828
Even on an old device,

550
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:04,798
-- a
-- hammer is better than a rock and a rock is

551
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,468
better than trying to drive a nail with your hand.

552
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:08,310
No,

553
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:12,319
-- I mean, yes, that is an accurate statement
-- and I think part of this will be,

554
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:14,030
is part of it would be driving down the cost.

555
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,229
Now, we tried that with Android Os and, you know, chrome and stuff

556
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,869
and clearly that's not going to work.

557
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,930
There's just all these weird market factors that make people

558
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,969
make phones that they then can't or don't support.

559
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,060
That's the other thing too is you got,

560
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,130
these people may not be able to technologically support these phones.

561
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,310
Like some of these phone manufacturers farm out their software dev.

562
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,452
-- And so they get like a software blob, drop it on the phone, ship it and that's
-- it.

563
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:38,692
That's not an acceptable argument if,

564
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:42,251
if a car manufacturer makes a car with faulty tires and this

565
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,932
literally happened and then the faulty tires fail and someone gets killed.

566
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:49,232
It is a car manufacturer's responsibility to deal with that.

567
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:52,871
-- Again, product laws don't force us to deal with this. Not
-- right now.

568
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:55,171
And they should though, they totally need to,

569
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:57,972
you're going to get the situation where if you have a country that enforces that

570
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,663
people are still going to the cheap phones from China and get them shipped,

571
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:02,254
that is a different problem.

572
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:05,843
I mean, we have that today where people will import unsafe products.

573
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:06,234
You know what,

574
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:09,313
this reminds me of people who don't have smoke alarms in their house

575
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:14,053
or co monitors in their house or my all time favorite people who rent

576
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:18,274
and don't have renters insurance because like apartments almost never burn down.

577
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,354
You know, except when they do,

578
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:22,913
-- which
-- is why renters' insurance is incredibly inexpensive.

579
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:26,755
But I know numerous people that have not had renters insurance,

580
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,036
their apartment burned down.

581
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:29,875
-- And
-- how do we deal with these people that

582
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,776
just fundamentally don't see the value in this.

583
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:36,406
-- But
-- there's a difference here. So if I don't get renters' insurance,

584
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,735
that is a conscious decision I made.

585
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:46,196
If I buy a product that I expect to function, there is a certain level of expected,

586
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:47,375
not harm.

587
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,776
I don't, I'm sure there's some legal term for that. But you know what I mean?

588
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,800
Well, not even not harm, but just that it still functions like that,

589
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,939
it still browses the web.

590
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:54,780
So I would say it's

591
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,619
no function function is different because like for example, I can buy a toaster

592
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,380
and in a year, my toaster might break.

593
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,479
And if I call the manufacturer to be like, it was a 30 day warranty stuff,

594
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,410
it you're out of luck.

595
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,619
But I I would say now if my toaster burns down my house,

596
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,849
that is a different situation, right?

597
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,290
And now these smartphones,

598
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,270
I think you could argue that the certificates not

599
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,076
working is closer to the phone just breaking.

600
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:21,696
However I think there's still some liability questions about this because let's

601
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:26,046
say there was a terrible security incident that happened against old phones.

602
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:27,696
-- Well, but
-- where do you draw the line? Right.

603
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:28,625
Like, I don't know,

604
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:32,125
what do you define as a commonly accepted root certificate store?

605
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:34,676
Because what if a vendor decides to,

606
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:38,666
because I've actually done this where I gutted my root certificate C A

607
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,261
to get rid of all the weird stuff from Turkey in China and Denmark.

608
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,531
And then nothing worked

609
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:43,991
well.

610
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,612
No, actually nothing, everything was fine because those,

611
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:47,991
there were like these government c

612
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:49,212
you know,

613
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:51,222
I actually got rid of like 70 or 80%

614
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,041
of them before I started to notice things breaking.

615
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:56,131
But the point is like, who defines, how do you define this?

616
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,332
It's, it's incredibly difficult.

617
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,541
You know, what about things like time zone updates?

618
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:02,491
What if your phone doesn't get time zone updates? Right.

619
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,962
We've talked about this before with the whole

620
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,608
time zone file that poor guy was maintaining.

621
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,978
-- It got sued by an astronomy company,
-- not an astronomy company.

622
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:14,807
-- It was a astrology company. Sorry,
-- I apologize. Yes, it wasn't a real thing. It was as

623
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:16,167
science.

624
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:16,968
-- Yeah.
-- Sorry,

625
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:19,137
because there's a million failure scenarios for where

626
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,368
the phone degrades because of a software issue.

627
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,427
And I guess here's where we,

628
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:26,728
we're basically out of time and here's the thing to think about at

629
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,988
the very end is that this whole digital universe we exist in now

630
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:32,274
has

631
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:37,343
terrible liability and, and prior art in terms of what's going on.

632
00:28:37,354 --> 00:28:42,004
So like an example is GDPR, GDPR is an incredibly flawed law,

633
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,963
but it is where we start law never starts out.

634
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,874
Correct law always has to evolve and change

635
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:48,644
with,

636
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:52,884
with how it's applied, with intent with the world we exist in.

637
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:57,099
And I think from the perspective of product liability against devices,

638
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:01,500
it kind of doesn't exist because basically, unless the thing somehow kills you,

639
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,560
our legal system isn't set up in a way to deal with those problems.

640
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:09,180
And so I think as a society like this is kind of,

641
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:12,380
we are on the precipice of the next great thing.

642
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,020
And if we do nothing, we fall to our death.

643
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:16,589
-- That's it. Like
-- that's

644
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:21,219
-- it.
-- My one thought is faster churn and I hate to say e waste.

645
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:21,500
But,

646
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,329
you know, if you can make phones that are 10 bucks or a dollar, yeah,

647
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,829
people will replace them every year or two and

648
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,050
they just become a disposable item like socks,

649
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,670
your socks get holes, you don't fix them, you buy new socks.

650
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,650
Not anymore. People used to. I haven't,

651
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,089
I don't, I throw them away. I mean, maybe that, that, that might be the solution.

652
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,189
We don't know today, I guess here's the thing is, let's say the phones are dirt cheap.

653
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,630
It's going to be imperative that they just brick themselves then.

654
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,170
So people can't continue using what

655
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,420
-- essentially an unsafe device.
-- But is it actually unsafe?

656
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,119
That is a great question.

657
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,050
And is it like, for example,

658
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,880
is it actually unusable to be cut off from the lets and crypt world?

659
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,709
-- Well,
-- maybe, I mean, I don't know.

660
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:03,020
-- It is
-- because if they're just using the phone to do Facebook,

661
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,099
it's still going to work it.

662
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:07,439
Maybe, I don't know, I don't know who signed Facebook certificates, but it might,

663
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:07,819
in fact,

664
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,780
the Facebook app probably uses its own pin

665
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,329
certificate internally or something instead of the as,

666
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:12,699
as

667
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,339
would if I, if I built that. But I, I don't know, I don't know the answer to any of this.

668
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,510
I think it's a super interesting thought experiment,

669
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,550
but I will say as a human society,

670
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,150
we are currently unprepared for the world as it exists today.

671
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,270
From a legal and a regulatory perspective,

672
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,339
I would say part of the challenge is this is an economic problem and also

673
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,569
a technology problem that like we can figure out an economic solution to this,

674
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,219
but the technology

675
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,560
may not exist to support that economic solution.

676
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,239
Maybe I'm,

677
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,250
I'm skeptical it's as much of a technology problem as it is a society problem.

678
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,619
Well, I mean, it's ok from an economic perspective.

679
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,119
What if we can drive the cost of updating down to almost zero?

680
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,770
Well,

681
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,060
doesn't matter if we can't accomplish

682
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:55,140
that technologically speaking and that's fair.

683
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:01,239
I suspect part of this is just it's going to be ugly and messy. And much like cars.

684
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,760
It's never going to be perfect, but it's hopefully going to get

685
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:04,780
a lot better.

686
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,369
And that's, that's kind of the goal and I guess

687
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,390
like we're at the end of the first batch of

688
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,209
smartphones and now we're seeing it's all aging like milk.

689
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,260
So

690
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,930
