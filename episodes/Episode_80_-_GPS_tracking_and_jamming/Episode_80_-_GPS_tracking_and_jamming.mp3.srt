Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,329
episode 80 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought crime. Josh Bresser

2
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,809
80 seems like a big number to me when I think about

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,780
-- it.
-- It's,

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,610
I'm very aware of that number because that's basically the age of my parents

5
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,459
and that I think 80 qualifies as old.

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,430
Uh, just like us. So

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,569
it, it's the new 60 or something. I don't know.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,270
Whatever

9
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:31,899
an is hard.

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:33,548
Cool.

11
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,069
Speaking of, speaking of hard things, do, do you by chance,

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,648
run or exercise outside at all?

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:39,098
Kurt,

14
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,000
uh, the skiing downhill count

15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,810
maybe. Do you, do you have one of those like GPS Fitbit tracker

16
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:46,599
Deos

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,479
downhill ski?

18
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,770
That would actually be interesting. I wonder what that does anyway.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,099
I

20
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:51,700
might get

21
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:52,700
a,

22
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,200
you'd be surprised actually. So I, I've seen them before.

23
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:58,790
Uh I've got someone I bike with.

24
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:03,310
They have, uh, I think Garin makes it and it has a gps in the watch

25
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,349
and like before we start a ride,

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,480
he hits a button and then it maps our

27
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,400
ride and it tells us like elevation and average speed

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,709
and you can look up like exactly how fast you were going on any part of the ride.

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,069
It's really cool actually.

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,430
But of course, this happens after it uploads the data into the cloud,

31
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,430
which I guess kind of brings us to the topic of the day,

32
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:22,779
which is, uh,

33
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,559
yeah. Did you hear about the fitness tracker that they used

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,029
to find army bases?

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,970
Well, and it's so,

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,129
I guess it's kind of two fold and I just checked and

37
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:36,269
there are a pile of fitness watches that track your skiing downhill.

38
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,110
I have no doubt.

39
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,319
-- And I bet they know when you're on the ski lift even, which is cool, of
-- course,

40
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,550
because you're going up very fast.

41
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,470
I mean, no offense if you can walk or run well,

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,599
run up a hill that quickly you wouldn't be

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,709
wearing a fitness tracker because you'd be like,

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,059
you'd make Dwayne the Rock Johnson look like a lazy

45
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,010
guy.

46
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,510
Yeah, that, that is true. That is true.

47
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,629
What gets me about this is,

48
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:58,690
it's kind of a two fold thing and number one is tracking the data is one thing,

49
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,230
but then sharing that data

50
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:06,099
with a company that then may or may not expose it in a quote

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,190
anonymized manner

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,029
which

53
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,389
could protect you directly.

54
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,449
Uh, but then could also put you at risk, for example.

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,009
Yeah, if you're on one of those secret military bases in the Middle East,

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,320
but I have no doubt people don't think about this kind of stuff very often.

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,279
So, you know what it reminds me of is, is the old argument of metadata doesn't matter.

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,889
And it's like

59
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,559
it kind of does and it's actually way more important than you think it is because,

60
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,080
because I guess, you know, you know what it is

61
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,139
is one singular piece of metadata is probably irrelevant by itself.

62
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:43,779
But when you have a treasure trove of metadata, it is incredibly valuable.

63
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:45,050
Well, from what I've read,

64
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:47,660
there's is quite often when you have about somewhere between

65
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,580
six and 10, either different pieces of metadata

66
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:56,320
or you have six or eight occurrences of a piece of metadata.

67
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,970
Um So for example,

68
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,440
if I could randomly select six or eight times during the week to

69
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,559
know kind of where you are to say within a 10 block radius,

70
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,710
I would basically know where you live.

71
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:13,710
Yes, especially as I work from home and I probably spend 90 plus percent of my time,

72
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,419
but also things like where you go, where your kids go to school,

73
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,429
you know.

74
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:21,789
Um

75
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:23,089
so it,

76
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,770
and, and well, this this sort of anonym

77
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,630
and sharing of data that you know, doesn't directly impact me is typically true. But

78
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,229
yeah,

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,199
apparently there's a lot of common edge cases like military bases that

80
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,050
people don't necessarily want everybody else to know exactly where they are.

81
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:39,089
But

82
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,179
we should, we should also explain

83
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,699
how they, how this was found, right?

84
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,270
I'll let you do the honors.

85
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,320
Well, so

86
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,440
there's a, well, there's about a million companies at this point selling, uh what

87
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,820
looks like a wristwatch and tracks your fitness activity, tracks your location,

88
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,119
elevation speed, heart rate, blah, blah, blah.

89
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,570
-- And
-- in this case, location is what

90
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:00,425
matters, right?

91
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,195
-- And
-- so what this company Strava did is they

92
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,434
released a global heat map of athletic activity,

93
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,304
-- which sounds really cool and, and it
-- does

94
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:12,425
sound really cool and, and I imagine like a city, like we'll say,

95
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,085
-- oh,
-- you can see Edmonton when you go to the

96
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:14,705
beach,

97
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:17,785
you can see Edmonton and Calgary because it's the two bright blobs in Alberta.

98
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:21,695
Nice. Well, and not only that, I bet you could reconstruct a city map really?

99
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:22,364
Well.

100
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:25,464
Yeah, they did that. The local military base shows up very beautifully.

101
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:26,325
Um

102
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:28,424
We'll get to that,

103
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,709
you know.

104
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,869
Um So basically, yeah, when, I mean,

105
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,320
when people typically go running or jogging,

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,829
uh quite often they, they jog on streets, especially on military bases, right?

107
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,510
Because you're probably not gonna want to run through the firing range,

108
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:46,140
you know, or the tank range or all the other ranges, right?

109
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,820
So, yeah, typically they, they,

110
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,200
you stick to the streets and so it's kind of like the um, oh,

111
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,450
what's that open map?

112
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,959
Is it open map, the project to, you know, create like a Google map of the world.

113
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,299
But using open source data,

114
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,459
that's open street maps. Open street maps. Yeah. And so

115
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:01,910
open street maps, you know,

116
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,500
originally had just like all the major highways and cities and, you know,

117
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,899
now it's getting to the point where they have footpaths and all the small stuff

118
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,859
and

119
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,829
having a heat map of where people were,

120
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,339
even if it's aggregate data and not identifying a specific user.

121
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:21,070
Yeah, you can basically map out streets and running trails very, very, very easily.

122
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:21,679
Right.

123
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,690
Well, and not only that,

124
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,100
I think one of the things that's interesting about

125
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,779
data like this also is what isn't there where,

126
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,000
you know, like there, let's say there's a building

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,660
nobody is going to or where building might be a bad

128
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,920
example because you can go through buildings in some cases.

129
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:35,399
But like

130
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,480
if they're say an impassable object,

131
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:42,179
you'll know because there will literally be zero, pass through it.

132
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,540
Right. There's no way to get through that.

133
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,329
And it would be nice if somebody told Uber that because I live next to

134
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,700
a major road and there's this giant sound wall that's like 10 ft high.

135
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,880
And Uber seems to think that the Uber drivers can just stop on

136
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,140
this major road and we go through our backyard and hop in their car

137
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,799
except there's this, well, number one, you're not allowed to stop on that road.

138
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,299
It's a major road. And number 2

139
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
10 ft wall.

140
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,380
So that's

141
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,850
the funny thing is Google knows about the wall,

142
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,350
right? They know about the foot.

143
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,690
So,

144
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,529
uh, when people use Google Maps, they get to our house, no problem.

145
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,769
But when every time we've ordered an Uber, now

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
we've had to wait an average of between five

147
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,459
and 15 minutes while they drive around lost,

148
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,730
trying to sort of get

149
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:25,649
there.

150
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,369
And then we have to call them and explain to them where we live and they usually flub

151
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,160
that up and go to an address about two or three blocks away to the point where it's like

152
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,049
they tell me, I'm in front of your house and I'm like, no, you're not.

153
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,380
I can see you, you're two blocks away, please turn to your left and proceed.

154
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,890
You know, so I've, I've learned now what it's like to be a GPS

155
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,410
and I can't even imagine how frustrating it would be for these.

156
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,989
This is why I don't think we'll ever have artificial intelligence, gps.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,809
S because they will just get pissed off and quit

158
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,529
because trying to direct humans is even when it's something as simple as like,

159
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,399
please turn left and proceed two blocks down

160
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,290
and you're headed straight for me, you know, keep going, keep going. You're good.

161
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,239
You're good. Ok, please stop. Why didn't you stop? Ok, I can see your tail. You know,

162
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,970
I can see the back of your car now going down the street. This is awesome,

163
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,760
right?

164
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,420
This is why we need self driving cars,

165
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,820
self driving cars with good maps though.

166
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,000
Right.

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,089
Right.

168
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,559
So anyways, but yeah, so you would definitely also you can infer a lot.

169
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,450
Um because I don't know if the heat map data has any time

170
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,829
data associated with it.

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,000
Like,

172
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,730
so if there's a slider where you could see like say 3 a.m. versus 6 a.m. versus 9 a.m.

173
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,000
but if they were to release that, you know,

174
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,519
you would have even more data to then infer what's going on around this place,

175
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:44,540
right. Oh, man.

176
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:48,720
Could you imagine with, well, in, in, I have a suspicion, normal people can't,

177
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,660
can't look this up.

178
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,299
But obviously if you could look up the heat maps for

179
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,209
say 2 a.m. or whatever time bars close where you're at

180
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:55,959
like,

181
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,309
yeah, you're going to know

182
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,720
and,

183
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,079
and I guess ironically you could then resell this

184
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,709
sort of data to advertisers and whatnot to be like

185
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,440
this is the popular bar in town, right? This is where everybody goes.

186
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,630
Where do you think the real time traffic data comes from?

187
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,480
That's on your Google maps, right? The cell providers resell bulk

188
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:14,839
movement data.

189
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,320
You don't say,

190
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,920
you know, this is a huge income stream for them.

191
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,109
-- Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Totally,
-- man.

192
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:23,470
And, and quite honestly,

193
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,130
I love it because it's allowed me at least once every month

194
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,790
to avoid some route that's all jammed up from an accident or

195
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,109
Lord knows what?

196
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,210
Oh, seriously, man.

197
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,190
I mean, anytime I go on a road trip, obviously you map out your route, right?

198
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,750
And you start driving it and then every hour or two,

199
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,219
I like update the route just because sometimes there will

200
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,210
be a traffic jam or a car accident on the,

201
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,590
on the interstate or whatever.

202
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,190
And it's huge when you can get around it. And, and again,

203
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,450
I mean, I just keep thinking about all this and it's like

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,400
there's the old mantra, you know, metadata doesn't matter. And

205
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,340
it totally does.

206
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,630
I would say metadata is almost more useful than regular

207
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,539
data because it's much easier to parse and extract from,

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,219
you know,

209
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,869
because you can do much more statistical analysis of it versus with real data,

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,059
you know, I'd have to comb through your actual content of your emails

211
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,299
-- to find my incriminating stuff.
-- Well, not only that, like

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,500
if you tell me, you have all my emails, I'm going to freak out.

213
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:20,299
But if you tell me you have my fitness tracker map data, I'd be like,

214
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,500
I probably don't care.

215
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,020
Right.

216
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,609
Well,

217
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:26,239
I I would care but most people probably don't care because

218
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,340
they're thinking who cares if someone knows where I've been.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,750
And it's like

220
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,460
-- people,
-- it reminds me of this a

221
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,340
few years ago, the the city deployed, well, not the city,

222
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,059
the companies that own the infrastructure deployed,

223
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,909
smart water meters that are wireless

224
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,950
and

225
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,869
uh smart power meters that are wireless,

226
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,669
which uh obviously saves them a ton of time when doing actual meter reading,

227
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,099
you know, because they drive around in a van now.

228
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,260
Um I literally remember as a kid, the Atco gas guy would be running around,

229
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,940
you know, in his shorts in summer,

230
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,460
he knock on your door and you'd like, let him in,

231
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,210
he would like run down to your basement,

232
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,940
look at the meter, scribble it down and like, say thanks and run out.

233
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,820
And that would happen at least once a summer.

234
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,489
See, I never, I never had that,

235
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:13,950
but we would have people come, there were,

236
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,900
there were meters outside and people would walk around.

237
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,520
In fact, I had a friend who did that.

238
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,409
Uh in one summer home from college is his

239
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,580
job was walking around reading meters and he,

240
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,799
he lost a lot of weight that year

241
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,340
just because it was, you know, he probably walked about 20 plus miles a day

242
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,059
and they did that here where they started installing

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,700
meters on the outside of houses. But let's face it, that's really expensive.

244
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,809
Like if you have to move a meter from the inside of a house to the outside,

245
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,659
that's a significant cost

246
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,760
and more to the point by just making these wireless ones boop problem solve.

247
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:50,729
You know, so for gas, for electric and for power now they're all, you know, wireless.

248
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,609
Obviously, they know when I'm showering, when I'm running the dishwasher,

249
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,159
when I'm washing my hands,

250
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,890
washing the toilet.

251
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,729
I wonder, I wonder what the granularity is on, on those things.

252
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,090
It's whatever they want it to be.

253
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,090
I suppose

254
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,890
that's the reality

255
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,669
and the beauty is there was that article where this guy was,

256
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,479
they did some research into the power meters,

257
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:13,330
how they monitor the power and they found out that they really don't work

258
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,320
with the new Led lighting and some of the CFC lighting and they totally

259
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,630
get very confused and will over bill.

260
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,440
And so of course, this is a known problem that nobody's fixing because, hey,

261
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,010
when you over bill a customer that's ok.

262
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:24,890
All right.

263
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,909
Under billing. No,

264
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,719
no, under billing is a problem. Right. But overbilling and we can live with that one.

265
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,000
-- Yes, exactly. Well, people aren't going to notice or care by and large.
-- It is true.

266
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:39,119
It is true. I wouldn't notice if they were overbilling me a couple of bucks.

267
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,280
And how do you prove it without buying a lot of expensive equipment?

268
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,159
Uh,

269
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,260
that's true.

270
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,859
Actually, I couldn't prove it if I wanted to,

271
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,190
but not only that if they're overbilling me, say a dollar or two a month

272
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:53,440
is buying $1000 worth of gear

273
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,349
to prove I'm paying $1 a month too much worth it. Like, no,

274
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:58,719
there isn't.

275
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:00,400
So this extra

276
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:04,250
thing goes back to, you know, there's a lot of open source data

277
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:08,380
and this is a really beautiful example of,

278
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,460
you know,

279
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,489
you can infer if there's like this one

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,270
little heat.in the middle of literally nowhere,

281
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,929
especially if it's in a,

282
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,890
in a Middle East country or a poor country

283
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,289
where people generally probably aren't buying $500 fitness trackers.

284
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:23,690
But, you know,

285
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,789
maybe that's a military base because military people do

286
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,440
tend to spend a lot of time running around.

287
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,010
I, I have a suspicion also. There's probably certain products that are, we say

288
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,969
more, more American, right?

289
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:39,070
Where you might not show up anywhere else in the country except in one place.

290
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,989
But I think even more than that is, I, I

291
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,049
bet some of these guys are wearing these things,

292
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,599
like, as they're doing, say mission type work. Right.

293
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,280
And, and so I imagine there's a certain amount of,

294
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,599
of metadata leakage in terms of just field operations these guys are going on,

295
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,099
which is

296
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:57,700
crazy.

297
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,010
I kind of wonder. I mean,

298
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,500
I, I would personally from an operational point of view, I would, you know,

299
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,929
force everybody to sort of strip down their electronics and only use approved stuff

300
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,940
and, and I don't know if they do that or not. That would be something.

301
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,419
Well, remember when they banned Furby from the NSA.

302
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,719
Yes.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,659
Right. So, ok, for those of you that don't know, Furby is this

304
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,140
cute little toy that if you take the uh the fur off of it?

305
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,700
-- Is this like robotic nightmare?
-- It's

306
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:23,630
a demon.

307
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,539
-- Yeah,
-- it's amazing. And you can hack into them and program them to say bad things.

308
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:28,590
But regardless

309
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:31,780
um part of the cuteness of what Furby did is Furby would

310
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:35,840
listen and then sort of recycle phonetically what it heard and essentially

311
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,400
speak gibberish that sounded cute and that counts as a recording device

312
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,400
for the purposes of what the NSA counts as a recording device.

313
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:46,309
So they banned these things from the NSA campus, you know,

314
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,960
and all facilities.

315
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,070
But now, I mean,

316
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,989
the amount of stuff that has a microphone in it or

317
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,739
an accelerometer and apparently some of these accelerometers

318
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,619
are sensitive enough to be a microphone.

319
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,270
I have seen that actually. Yes.

320
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:02,890
Uh yeah,

321
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,820
using MEMS accelerometers as acoustic pickups in well in musical devices easy.

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,969
Um

323
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,979
But yeah, in theory,

324
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,919
you know,

325
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:15,809
even your smart phone accelerometer is getting to a point

326
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,979
where it's sensitive enough to also be a microphone.

327
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:21,070
-- That's pretty cool, man. I'm not gonna lie.
-- I mean uh uh

328
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,599
yeah,

329
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:22,750
I

330
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,429
that's the thing, right? Well, it reminds me of the whole Tide pod thing.

331
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,380
You know, microphones used to be microphones,

332
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,000
but now microphones are well a great example is, you know,

333
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,799
these road podcasters that we're using,

334
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,549
they have a built in sound monitor, right?

335
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,599
And there's a little volume dial on the side.

336
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,119
And if I crank mine up like all the way to six, I can literally hear

337
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,679
like my heart beat from 10 ft away.

338
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,570
You know, these things are insanely sensitive. Yeah.

339
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,500
Yeah, I I know what you mean. Uh

340
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,169
We should, we should keep going.

341
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,109
The other story

342
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,030
I love that you posted it kind of related to, to warfare in the modern age

343
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,909
is in the Western United States

344
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,559
-- there's not going to be GPS for a little while. There will be
-- GPS. It's just

345
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:06,320
not

346
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:06,640
for

347
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,109
us.

348
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,909
And

349
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,489
GPS always amazing to me because

350
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:11,289
it,

351
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,590
the GPS signal is so weak, it is

352
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,210
barely above

353
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,030
the noise that you would just

354
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,169
like if you put an aerial out listening to, you know,

355
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,989
the random background radiation, noise, radio noise, whatever

356
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,450
the GPS signal is just barely above that.

357
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,510
And so the tricks that they do to interpret this signal,

358
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,599
especially when you're thinking about civilian gear that costs like 50 bucks

359
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,210
is pretty magic

360
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,250
in my mind.

361
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,890
I agree with that 100%. It's, it's crazy

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,510
how sensitive GPS is but, but I think not, not just that

363
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:47,250
the signal is incredibly weak and the clocks you

364
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,289
need to make it go are insanely accurate,

365
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,650
which is even

366
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:52,179
better than that.

367
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,080
They actively have to skew the signal to account for things like weather

368
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,799
relativity. Yo

369
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:02,940
they have to account for relativity because the clock is so sensitive

370
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,760
that that's wild.

371
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,140
But this really drives home that

372
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:11,190
sometimes the only way to test something is to actually test something.

373
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,919
-- And so
-- why don't you explain what's going on?

374
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,460
Because I imagine there's some people listening right now who are like,

375
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:18,140
what are they talking about?

376
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,719
So essentially the United States Air Force uh holds

377
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:25,580
a air war exercise called red flag where uh

378
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,919
it's the US and several other countries that

379
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,179
are invited to essentially have war games,

380
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,460
practice, tactics,

381
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,890
practice new things, you know, have maybe some experiments, see what works,

382
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,020
what doesn't work, new weapon systems, new doctrine,

383
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,000
all that stuff.

384
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,549
And as part of their testing now

385
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,890
they are jamming gps for quite a large area. Uh, like

386
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,630
it's a pretty powerful transmitter from what it looks like.

387
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,219
So,

388
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:52,340
I

389
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,979
jam it though.

390
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:58,219
I have a suspicion what's happening and, and this was tested some time ago.

391
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,950
So there's civilian gps

392
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,929
and there's military gps,

393
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,780
basically the same satellites and the military has the

394
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,890
ability to turn off civilian gps over select regions.

395
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:09,390
Yeah.

396
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,239
Well, the, the encrypt, the, the,

397
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,010
the military GPS was simply an encrypted signal

398
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,290
and that was the whole premise of like that James Bond film,

399
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,729
the one with Pierce Brosnan, you know,

400
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:22,410
with the GPS receiver thing that could have the encryption keys and

401
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,810
was all technically wrong. But regardless it was a fun movie.

402
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,040
Um,

403
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,400
well, so the deal is too though.

404
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,760
Jamming gps is not hard.

405
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,469
I mean, it's illegal as heck, but you can go to,

406
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:37,209
there's a bunch of Chinese websites where you can buy GPS.

407
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:37,869
Jammers.

408
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,449
Um I've

409
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,849
maybe played with one. Maybe not, I'm not gonna be specific, but if you do turn on a

410
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:50,290
low power gps jammer to see what happens to say your smartphone or whatever,

411
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,170
some really bizarre things can happen.

412
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,089
Um, like at the simplest level, it can just lose the GPS signal and be like,

413
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:56,599
I'm confused.

414
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,010
I don't know what's going on. I give up.

415
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,839
In other cases, there was a device that basically started drifting at about 6000

416
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,140
MPH westward

417
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,520
or something like it was just flying across the globe.

418
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,880
I, that failure case was very bizarre. But,

419
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,790
you know, and

420
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,459
for you and I,

421
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,819
our car gps doing something wonky like that doesn't really

422
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,329
matter that much because we're obviously going to be like,

423
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,349
well, that's not right,

424
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,510
you know,

425
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:23,300
but for something like a missile system

426
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,839
or a drone on approach,

427
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,680
there have been stories of people who listen to their

428
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:30,910
GPS and like drove off a cliff or something.

429
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:31,869
I mean,

430
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,089
-- we're not that stupid, hopefully. Well,
-- I

431
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,959
I'm not going to say that

432
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,619
I'm not willing to claim anything.

433
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,560
-- So
-- one aspect of this is that to test certain things,

434
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,280
you actually have to go test certain things.

435
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,760
So what is the effect if your enemy jams all the GPS,

436
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:51,489
right? Do your weapon systems crap out or decide not to work,

437
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:52,449
you know.

438
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:57,680
And so from that perspective, it makes really good sense to jam gps

439
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,359
all of it for quite a large area

440
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,530
and,

441
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,150
and literally see what happens.

442
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,180
Uh you know, this reminds me of Chaos Monkey and Chaos Gorilla by Netflix,

443
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:08,910
like Netflix,

444
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,640
right? Net like

445
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,880
Netflix runs in three Amazon regions.

446
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,550
Um They run those clusters at 60% use the theory being if one of the clusters dies,

447
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,719
the other two clusters go from 60 to 90% utilization

448
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,079
and nobody notices.

449
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,959
And how do you test that? Well, the answer

450
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:28,444
is you turn everything off in one region

451
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,025
and you hope it works

452
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,464
and if it doesn't, then you do a post mortem and fix it. Hopefully.

453
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,425
-- No.
-- II, I agree. I think that's amazing to test like that.

454
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:41,204
I think it also says something about the resiliency of the systems you're

455
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,494
building because if you're unwilling to do a live test like that,

456
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:47,145
you know what you've built probably sucks.

457
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,505
I mean, let's face it.

458
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,219
This always is what reminds me when people complain about reboots.

459
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:53,780
I'm like, if you are complaining about reboots,

460
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,400
you're doing it wrong because your system will either need a reboot at some point

461
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,880
or it will fail and reboot or die.

462
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,260
So if you can't even do a scheduled reboot,

463
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,920
you are so far up the creek without a paddle,

464
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:10,400
-- but I, I actually can't help you at this point.
-- No, I know, man.

465
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,699
-- I know.
-- And

466
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,859
I get that. It's tough but it's something that just happens.

467
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,760
So

468
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:16,640
what's

469
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,119
the good news is because of the way the US is laid out.

470
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,579
This is happening in the Western US where a lot of the land is federal land.

471
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,680
Like my understanding is Nevada is owned like

472
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,880
90 some percent by the federal government.

473
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,400
I can't answer that, but it is very,

474
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,819
somebody did a map of the US and it was the state and then the

475
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,890
states were shrunken to show how much of the land the federal government owned.

476
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,329
And of course, on the eastern coast,

477
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,140
it's like very little because that was settled first and it's privately owned.

478
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,739
But then when you get out west, states, like Nevada, New Mexico

479
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,979
are just

480
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:53,229
massively big chunks of it are just federal government land for parks

481
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,699
or for, you know, military bases or whatever.

482
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,780
And so that's kind of the good news is that

483
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,729
this is, you know, this isn't like jamming gps in New York City,

484
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,599
although that actually wouldn't be that bad because you have

485
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,410
enough wi fi signals to figure out where you are,

486
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,040
whatever gps is basically jammed in New York City.

487
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,040
I mean, the buildings,

488
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:15,109
um,

489
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,510
so in some ways,

490
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,199
this is happening in a good place because there's not that many people out there,

491
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:23,280
but it's also a place where people really do rely on gps because there's, you know,

492
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,020
you don't have dense wi FI data to figure out where you are, right?

493
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,670
So it'll be, I'd be curious to see what happens with this.

494
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,680
If there's any news reports of people doing stupid things or whatever,

495
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:33,800
it would not surprise me

496
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,969
if there are.

497
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,810
And, and unfortunately I'm sure we'll never know the outcome of the testing,

498
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,510
the military does if their, if their systems and processes stand up to no gps.

499
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,729
Because when you think about it, man, even what, probably 3040 years ago,

500
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,969
there was no gps. Right. It just, it didn't exist in many instances.

501
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,550
And so

502
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,930
the

503
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:52,750
biggest

504
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,939
reason it really took off is the US had,

505
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,410
had to switch.

506
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,469
Uh, so traditionally what happened is when they deployed GPS,

507
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,239
you have the civilian channel and the military

508
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,949
channel and the military channel was very,

509
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,050
very accurate.

510
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,849
Right? Because bombs and stuff

511
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,050
and the civilian channel, if my memory serves had something like 10 m resolution,

512
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,109
which ain't bad,

513
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,770
you know, if you're a cruise ship or something.

514
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:14,839
Um,

515
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,410
but during the first Iraq war, they didn't have enough military receivers.

516
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,709
So they literally had to make the civilian channel

517
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,209
accurate because they literally no,

518
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,989
there's pictures of people like driving an A 10, you know,

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,430
warthog with like a civilian GPS, duct tape to the front.

520
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:33,349
That's

521
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:34,469
hilarious.

522
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,479
You know, because you're flying over a desert, there's not a lot of landmarks.

523
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:37,930
Right.

524
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:38,589
Right.

525
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,739
Again, you know,

526
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,410
a lot of this doctrine was developed in western Europe where you had landmarks,

527
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,869
churches, you have stuff

528
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,800
when you're flying over a desert. It's,

529
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,790
oh, there's a, there's a straight road over there

530
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,939
like all the other roads or, you know,

531
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,209
-- sand dunes and some camels or whatever.
-- Well, not just saying

532
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:02,189
-- things like sand dunes move right. Sand dunes don't stay still.
-- Exactly.

533
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:03,439
Um,

534
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:08,180
so yeah, they ended up making the civilian channel accurate and of course, that

535
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,209
made

536
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,500
the economic benefit of having accurate GPS.

537
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,020
It's in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year easily.

538
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,270
Oh, my goodness.

539
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
I, there's so many things, I mean,

540
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,369
think about every construction project on the planet now.

541
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:24,410
They all use GPS.

542
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,680
-- Uh,
-- well,

543
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,079
we were talking before the show when I used

544
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,609
to work for the government for flood forecasting.

545
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,180
But that's how they measure dam movement.

546
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,109
They have these metal plates, you know,

547
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,040
built into the dam and they put the transit on differential GPS

548
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:41,560
and they can measure, you know, two millimeter and slightly better accuracy. Now.

549
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:42,829
And I imagine

550
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,420
in the day it was what surveys, right?

551
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,319
They had a guy with the little survey, what I don't even know what you call the thing.

552
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,209
Well, the challenge is the dam

553
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,859
might not have moved relative to your survey point.

554
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,459
That's true actually.

555
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,579
-- And
-- that the case,

556
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,959
that could be a problem, you know,

557
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,540
if a whole chunk of land is moved one or two millimet,

558
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,530
that's probably something you need to know.

559
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,089
So, anyways, so, yeah, we ended up with the benefit of now, you know, everything,

560
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:07,849
having

561
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,229
really high quality GPS and even better.

562
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:13,140
Now, we have the European system, Galileo and we have the Russian system, GLOS

563
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,430
and a lot of modern Android phones.

564
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:18,770
As I understand it have two or three of these systems.

565
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,479
One thing that's not mentioned, I just googled.

566
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,469
Nobody can say whether or not the US is also going to be jamming Glo

567
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,739
-- Naz and Galileo for their exercise.
-- It seems like it would be foolish not to.

568
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,689
Well, I'm also wondering at the same point,

569
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:36,290
I'm going to guess that most of the US military systems with GPS built into them.

570
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,489
I mean, I have no idea if they also support Glonass

571
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,619
or Galileo, I would assume they don't because most of these systems are, you know,

572
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,140
they take 1020 years to develop and deploy

573
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,119
and

574
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,589
Glonass. Is it even finished yet?

575
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,989
I think it's, the satellite coverage isn't complete yet, or is it? I can't remember.

576
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,630
I know, like five or 10 years ago it wasn't,

577
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:57,579
it is done now. Oh, there we go. Yeah, last launch was in 2016.

578
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,369
So, yeah, it is now finished.

579
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,189
But yeah, no, I, I would be curious to know what would happen if you

580
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:04,510
jammed all of these because right now, you know,

581
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,540
Android phone users with more recent phones will still have Glonass

582
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,109
or Galileo to, to rely on, you know,

583
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,989
-- when their GPS fails.
-- Right. Right. Right.

584
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,189
And I, yeah, I feel like to have an effective test. You'd have to block them all,

585
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:17,640
you know,

586
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,949
reminds me of is, is putting my security hat on

587
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:26,339
is imagine like the internet disappearing for a day or two, which,

588
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:30,050
which you could think of is in the denial of service aspect right there.

589
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,290
How many businesses could function with no internet?

590
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,589
Like I couldn't,

591
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,989
I couldn't do

592
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:35,869
a

593
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,180
vastly lowered rate.

594
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:42,359
I literally could not do my job without internet. I am comfortable.

595
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,680
Here's the

596
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:46,089
thing is it's not just the internet that would disappear, but for example,

597
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,079
so my local telephone company tell us

598
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,599
they don't have a phone network. They have a single data network. Right?

599
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:55,869
They were the first phone company to do this. They have a single IP network.

600
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,900
That's fax, phone internet.

601
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,689
So, and that's the thing, right? Is how many companies now have a phone system?

602
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,569
No trick question. How many companies have a sip phone system?

603
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:08,479
All of them, how many actually have an old timey mechanical pots, phone system

604
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,290
answer

605
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,959
none of them because they're just stupidly expensive to maintain an obsolete now.

606
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
-- Yeah,
-- I hope the answer is none.

607
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,609
Because if you're using a pot system, you're getting ripped off.

608
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,209
Don't use that.

609
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,010
Yeah.

610
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,439
So that's the thing, right?

611
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,430
Is the internet disappearing would also be, well,

612
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:26,959
remember when the denial service against DNS happened and like Slack went offline.

613
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,280
And so all these companies that were

614
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,900
essentially part of their implicit uh, plan was, you know, we,

615
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,229
we communicate via Slack and suddenly Slack has gone.

616
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,869
Well, how do I contact my ops or my engineers? Do I not

617
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,229
remember for these guys?

618
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,500
Right. No, I, I know, man. I know exactly what you mean. It was, it was crazy.

619
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,569
-- So
-- it's tough to build resiliency when

620
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:49,630
you don't know necessarily what your, your dependencies are.

621
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,699
Uh, I'm reminded of all those people that get like two internet connections.

622
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,969
And it turns out they go over the same physical fiber, you know,

623
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:58,260
and it gets dug up and all the internet dies.

624
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,489
Yeah, I love that.

625
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,170
But, you know what? So, so, here's the thing though,

626
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,189
is

627
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,959
in this, this kind of harkens back to the beginning of the conversation is

628
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:12,390
if you're not actually testing your resiliency, you don't have resiliency. Right.

629
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,030
-- If you can't shut off the internet,
-- well, it goes back to,

630
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,949
you don't have backups until you restore for them.

631
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,729
That is true.

632
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:19,489
Right.

633
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,280
Until you restore from your backups,

634
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,530
you don't know that those are actually backups.

635
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,430
It's like Schrodinger's backup. Right.

636
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,040
Yeah,

637
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,880
I've had that happen.

638
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,729
I had a tape drive that would write happily, but turns out it wouldn't read,

639
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:36,349
uh, that was really common with tape drives though.

640
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,910
And in fact, read and write heads were different on many of them and,

641
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,599
and even if they were the same,

642
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,339
you could have issues with alignments. It was, it was very strange.

643
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,359
And in fact, I remember back in the day

644
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:51,209
when I, for some reason there was a time I was doing a lot of backup work.

645
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,719
I think that this is one of those things like

646
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:56,290
people I became known as the backup guy.

647
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,750
And, yeah, you'd have two, basically two tape libraries

648
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,709
and

649
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,219
you'd,

650
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:04,660
you'd bring the tapes from one to the other and you'd back up on

651
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,660
one library and then you would verify on the other one because you can't,

652
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,829
you couldn't back up and verify with the same drive

653
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,729
you had to use different drives.

654
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,569
And there was a, an article written about this how, you know,

655
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,430
until you operationally test stuff, you don't know that it works or not.

656
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,349
And I think that's one of the issues that a lot of these companies have is

657
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:25,910
so Maersk, uh, you know, the shipping giant had this happen with, uh,

658
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,640
which cryptovirus was it?

659
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,119
Um,

660
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:30,189
I want to say wanna cry.

661
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:31,719
-- It
-- was

662
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:32,579
not

663
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,489
pia, right.

664
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,530
Oh, not Petya. Yeah, that's the one.

665
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:36,609
And they had to, like,

666
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,930
shut down all their systems and they had like a global

667
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:43,040
reinstall reboot effort that took something like 10 or more days

668
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,339
and they had to do everything via like paper

669
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,609
and fax and apparently it was just a nightmare

670
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,810
and,

671
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:52,810
but there's a lot of companies now that literally can't do that.

672
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:55,839
Like Amazon can't go to paper and pen

673
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,410
and I'm not even talking about their, their, their,

674
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,239
it services and their cloud stuff.

675
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,140
I'm talking about like, just shipping that stuff to you that,

676
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,920
that can't work without computers.

677
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,599
I know.

678
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,310
I know exactly what you mean. It's

679
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,939
think about this one. I think it's, this is a tough one just because

680
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,640
it's like the modern electrical grid we can't live without

681
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,140
-- it.
-- That's a fair point. If, if, if electricity is down.

682
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:19,380
And in fact, I've,

683
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,560
I remember working places where you lose power

684
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,349
and they basically just said go home with,

685
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,410
you can't work.

686
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,400
And that's internet now, right?

687
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,839
When internet goes down, like, go home you can't work.

688
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:30,209
Well, funny story.

689
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:30,739
That's, I,

690
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,390
I know a place where that happened and the supervisor made everybody stay because,

691
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,170
and, like, you know, we're all in this together and,

692
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,989
but it literally was like, yeah, nobody could do anything.

693
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,890
Why would you make people stay?

694
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:43,010
Like, what's the purpose of that?

695
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,349
-- Oh, my goodness.
-- But yeah,

696
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,300
well,

697
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,380
this happened in Canada a couple of decades

698
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,300
ago where a small town lost their water source

699
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:54,119
and it basically ended up killing the town because

700
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,630
the water source was gone for long enough,

701
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,520
you know, kind of like, well, I guess the modern one would be Flint,

702
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,540
Michigan with their lead tainted water, right?

703
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:04,510
And this MP member of parliament wrote an open letter talking about essentially,

704
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,099
how do you kill a town in Canada?

705
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,069
And one of the quickest easiest ways to do it

706
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,660
is not have a water source,

707
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,000
you know, especially when people we're used to having one, right?

708
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,500
Like it's one thing out of my parents' cabin, we don't have running water.

709
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,319
So we, you know, we bring in containers of water,

710
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,650
ok? It's a pain in the ass, but it works.

711
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:24,800
But like my home here if I didn't have running water all of a sudden, ok,

712
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,619
I can't use the toilets.

713
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,449
I can't wash my hands. I can't prepare for food. I,

714
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,359
you know, what do we do? Right.

715
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,930
Go to the cabin and rip out the waterless toilet and bring it home.

716
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:35,880
-- I guess
-- every, everyone gets cholera. That's what happens.

717
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,619
Typhoid and dysentery.

718
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:38,829
Interesting.

719
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:39,819
-- And that's the thing.
-- We,

720
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,780
we,

721
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,119
some things you just have to rely upon because to not rely

722
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,890
upon them and to build a system to not rely upon,

723
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,979
it is so expensive.

724
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:48,689
Like to build

725
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,280
a waterless house in the middle of the city could totally be done, you know,

726
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:52,969
water

727
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,800
on the roof.

728
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,339
It is actually illegal to not have the water hookups. No, that's actually a thing

729
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,579
where if you're not essentially hooking up to the local utilities,

730
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:04,680
your your domicile would not be, it wouldn't pass inspection,

731
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,880
right? The city would not pass it.

732
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,229
Alright. So

733
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:12,079
basically, it's just not economically feasible now,

734
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:13,689
at this point to live without internet,

735
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,119
right? So, so you,

736
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,020
you raise an interesting point. I think this is something for us to think about.

737
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,819
It may maybe talk about next week, but is the fact that

738
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:25,189
there are certain minimum expectations

739
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:28,420
in any system. And, and I have a suspicion at this point.

740
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,050
Internet is kind of one of them. But,

741
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,560
but

742
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,469
where do we draw some of our lines in saying

743
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,369
this is something we should care about and we

744
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,060
have to test for because like for example,

745
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:39,750
uh a data center might test a power outage, but like,

746
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,380
I don't test them at my house because that would be dumb.

747
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:42,819
Right.

748
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,390
Uh I did, uh, what I would do is actually

749
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:52,739
I would do it not to test, but to make sure I plugged everything into the right thing.

750
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:53,920
Right.

751
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,180
Because occasionally, for example, I had, when I, back when I had a workstation,

752
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,709
the workstation was plugged into the search or into the power,

753
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,609
uh providing like the power,

754
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,530
providing part of the UPS and my monitor was plugged into the surge.

755
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,199
Only part.

756
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,680
So, when I tested it,

757
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,650
I was like, oh,

758
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,599
I can't log into my computer and turn it off because the monitor doesn't work.

759
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,319
So, what I used to occasionally do is I would go down to the basement,

760
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,780
flip the main breaker and then wander around the house and

761
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,739
make sure I could actually turn off all my computers.

762
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,619
And I quickly discovered that I had a bad habit

763
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,780
of plugging the monitors into the surge only port,

764
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,849
not the battery protected port.

765
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:26,339
So,

766
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,839
testing it does make sense. But now I don't bother because they're all laptops.

767
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:33,280
-- It, it depends. Right. We'll just, we'll leave it there and it's
-- an easy enough test.

768
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,250
You go flip a main breaker five minutes later you turn it back on and

769
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,359
also, then you get to go reset clocks. Right. Because your stove, your microwave.

770
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,699
Yeah, I do hate resetting clocks. All right.

771
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:46,160
Anyway, I'm, I'm gonna call it and I think we should, we should maybe think about

772
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:51,880
some of this, what, what services and, and kind of things do we do we need

773
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,359
that we can test, or rather rather,

774
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,439
I would say let's reframe it from the security perspective

775
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:59,150
of what makes sense to test and what doesn't.

776
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,890
So, and, and maybe it's everything, I don't know. I don't know.

777
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,239
All right, I'm, I'm calling it. Uh Thank you, Kurt. Thank you

778
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,160
for listening.

779
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:06,160
It was fun.

780
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,989
If you want any of the show notes, you can go to open source security podcast.com.

781
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,199
Uh,

782
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,709
if you know the answer to any of the questions

783
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,680
we couldn't answer today about kind of some of the,

784
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,729
the things going on with the military, uh, by all means, you know, you know,

785
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:17,170
let us know.

786
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,750
Don't, don't get yourself in trouble, but,

787
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,640
uh, we, we'd love to know the answers.

788
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,319
So, so hit us up on Twitter maybe, or Facebook. There's a Facebook group.

789
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:28,400
You can use the Pound Os S Podcast hashtag to get our attention.

790
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,160
And yeah, if nothing else, I guess Kurt, you have a fabulous rest of your day.

791
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,430
You too. Thanks

792
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:38,270
the
