Hello and welcome to episode 36 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,310
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,170
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,439
-- How are you doing,
-- Kurt?

4
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm doing well. I'm enjoying some coffee.

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,950
Lucky you. I've caught some terrible plague probably for my Children and

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:21,950
yeah, for me,

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,629
-- everything tastes like potatoes.
-- Uh No, not yet, but I suspect that's coming.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,350
Uh So speaking of crime,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,619
which particular crime,

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,799
why are we speaking of crime? No, no one even mentioned crime.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,729
We talked about potatoes and being sick.

12
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:41,770
Uh So

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,130
those children's toys.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,689
Ok. So this is the iot teddy bear story, which is,

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,889
it should warm our hearts to know that there is a company

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,900
who cares enough to record everything you say around their toy.

17
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:55,889
Oh, it's actually worse than that.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,610
Um Apparently their actual security on the teddy bear.

19
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,200
This is the one where the guy had it like

20
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,970
lighting up its eyes red saying kill all humans.

21
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:04,360
That is

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,050
awesome.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,449
And also the mobile app is apparently a complete train wreck.

24
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,809
I would expect nothing less.

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,650
Yeah. And so then of course, for our listeners to top it off.

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:12,900
Um,

27
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,410
apparently they were they not only record all the conversations

28
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:18,559
and whatnot that the kid says to this teddy bear.

29
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,889
Um they store it on a Mongo DB instance with the default no authentication

30
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,449
and it was publicly accessible on the internet.

31
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,730
-- It's like
-- feature on top of future, man. It doesn't get any more exciting than that.

32
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:35,150
Well, and then my favorite part is not only did it get held to ransom,

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,639
but it had been held to ransom multiple times,

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,650
right? Because they never cleaned it up.

35
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:44,699
And so also multiple researchers had apparently tried to tell them. So,

36
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,050
yeah, this really underscores to me why we need the uh like cloud

37
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:52,440
and service based, you know, vulnerability identifier.

38
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:54,019
So we can talk about these things and, you know,

39
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,809
record them in a central database and, and essentially at least name and shame.

40
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,370
Do you honestly think

41
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,089
this company would have cared if they?

42
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,989
No, but hopefully, what can happen is, you know,

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,910
something along these lines and we can start maybe seeing class action lawsuits.

44
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,839
That could be. That's an interesting thing.

45
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,429
-- Well,
-- ok, but here's actually, so here's the trick is

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,949
I have talked to lawyers more than I would like about class action lawsuits and,

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,309
and things like this and the way the law currently works

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,309
is you have to show

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,479
generally physical harm, even just losing money isn't enough.

50
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,839
And so like in this case, nobody was actually hurt. So there's no lawsuit here.

51
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:40,119
I mean, I'll tell you that now

52
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,350
even your personal data being stolen

53
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,250
doesn't count.

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,070
-- Well,
-- one thing I've always wondered is, um, especially if these, I,

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,119
I don't remember if these things have a video camera or not,

56
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,630
I don't think they do but there are toys that do have video cameras

57
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,000
and if you start recording video of kids in their bedroom and stuff, I mean,

58
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,330
so that's a different law actually at that point

59
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:02,009
and it is conceivable

60
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,289
that recording audio from Children could fall

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,029
under some crazy child protection act.

62
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,169
But I'm, I'm not completely sure.

63
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,570
But, I mean, I'm more concerned about the fact that I just, as a consumer,

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,360
I want to be able to look these things up and, you know,

65
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,600
find out what the history of this company is and,

66
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:20,940
you know, have they been good and stand,

67
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,320
you know,

68
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,639
-- stood behind their products or have they just shipped garbage and then whatever,
-- I,

69
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,270
I think when it comes to toys,

70
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,449
it's generally ship it

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,320
right.

72
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,110
I mean, they're toys, this, this thing probably costs what, 100 bucks

73
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,589
and, and kids love this stuff.

74
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,869
It's again, but the problem is, you know, it's,

75
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,919
we're rapidly, I, I think this really harkens back to what Schneier

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,479
was talking about with the IOT security thing. It's, it's not a car anymore,

77
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,080
it's a computer but,

78
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,139
you know, with this huge machine it controls, you know,

79
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,300
part of it

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,770
and some of these kids toys, for example, can move around

81
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:56,869
or can,

82
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,750
you know, interact with their environment in various ways.

83
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,149
Right. Right. Some of them can,

84
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:02,559
it's,

85
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,339
you know, and the FTC,

86
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,380
I believe the FTC slapped a bunch of

87
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,220
those baby monitor makers that were totally insecure.

88
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:09,679
Oh,

89
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:09,869
yeah.

90
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:10,440
I

91
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,059
don't remember.

92
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,479
So, I'm wondering if that would maybe set a precedent.

93
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,660
It, it's conceivable. Well, it depends what kind of

94
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,570
rules they try to enforce with that, which always makes it interesting.

95
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,730
But I guess so, regardless of

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,220
the legal aspect,

97
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,260
you, you sound overjoyed.

98
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,899
Uh, yeah, because, uh, this is from January the fifth F DC.

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,549
Sus maker of routers baby monitors over security.

100
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:35,600
-- Uh,
-- yes,

101
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,529
but those were because the manufacturers were

102
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,369
claiming security as one of their features.

103
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,470
And so that was kind of false advertising.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,779
And if I was gonna guess nobody touts security

105
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,399
is one of the features of their teddy bears.

106
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,200
Although maybe, maybe there's a huge market for this.

107
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,920
Maybe we need to create the security bear.

108
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:57,309
Yeah,

109
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,429
-- the security bear. That cares.
-- The

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,100
-- security
-- bear. That cares.

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,359
Oh, man, I can see it now. We'll, we'll make millions.

112
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,350
Yeah, I'm not sure because I know like in the US,

113
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,970
at least there's a lot of places where, for example,

114
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,019
you can record video as much as you want,

115
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,279
but the minute you record audio it gets you into a whole different legal.

116
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:14,829
I

117
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,220
do not know anything about that.

118
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,119
I know the laws are bizarre and crazy and they differ greatly by jurisdiction.

119
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,170
Um I know Canada is a one party, consent state federally. So, you know, as long as

120
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,049
one party of the conversation consents,

121
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:34,640
but here's a question is the bear party to the conversation.

122
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,450
If I had to guess there was probably some phone book.

123
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,700
Eu L A you had to click, I accept the conditions of this. Eu L A

124
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,489
and it probably acknowledges that you accept,

125
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,079
it's going to record everything you say.

126
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, like those TV. S

127
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,329
-- Yes, that's right. So
-- that was,

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,070
and that got, I think slapped down too. So maybe there is some hope,

129
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:55,989
I don't know. We'll see. I mean,

130
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,890
here's, here's the problem though,

131
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,269
let's say there are laws that say you can't do this,

132
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,570
you know, all seriousness.

133
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,140
By the time you figure out it's a problem the horse has left the barn,

134
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:06,779
right?

135
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,170
Well,

136
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:10,220
the other problem too is there's devices that legitimately need to do

137
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,420
this to function like the um the one should we call it?

138
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:13,209
That Amazon Alexa

139
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:13,630
thing?

140
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,519
Like it needs to be listening to

141
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,220
like,

142
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,679
you know, you don't want to have to tap a button and then talk to it.

143
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:23,380
Well, and there's a court case going on right now actually because

144
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,820
the there, there was a murder, I guess, and they believe that the Alexa

145
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,049
recorded evidence and Amazon is

146
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,290
not willing to turn it over without basically a, a good reason.

147
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:37,309
-- And
-- so

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,220
aren't they asking for a warrant,

149
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,739
like which I mean,

150
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,619
I,

151
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,329
that was my understanding of the

152
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,059
case. Amazon is simply saying you need a warrant to get at this data which

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,859
right,

154
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,260
and, and obviously law enforcement wants it when they want it for any reason.

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,500
And, and so I kind of understand both sides of this, but even if you need a warrant,

156
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,420
that's borderline terrifying

157
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,940
that you have a device recording everything going on in your home.

158
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,700
Well, that's one of the reasons I will not get one of those devices or a smart TV.

159
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,019
Right.

160
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,709
These smart TV s just have a

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,380
horrendously terrible track record for security updates for

162
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:14,549
-- listening to everything you
-- say

163
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,920
they're so convenient.

164
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:19,100
-- I
-- I'd rather just stick a Mac mini or an Apple TV on it. It

165
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:19,760
has youtube

166
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,739
right there.

167
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,690
-- Yeah,
-- but I mean, so does

168
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,899
you know, and, and I get it because like the, you know,

169
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,820
the video conferencing features I've seen on some of them are quite nice,

170
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,170
you know, like the integrated Skype, it's done well is actually

171
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,970
-- it's kind of nice.
-- Yeah, I don't know if mine does that.

172
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,049
I don't think it has a microphone on it,

173
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,529
but I'll also admit I haven't put a ton of effort into finding out.

174
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,200
Oh, well, so anyway, anyway, here's

175
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,649
this, this bear is, is a crazy story.

176
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,140
So they're recording all of this data and they're dumping it in a mango DB

177
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,410
that was totally unprotected

178
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,619
and you said it was ransom multiple times.

179
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,980
And I guess here's the question,

180
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,660
is it an unreasonable expectation that a toy manufacturer

181
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,820
has security knowledge to ensure this doesn't happen?

182
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:11,940
And I know how we're gonna answer this. But I think it's an interesting question.

183
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,450
Well,

184
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,459
I would say there's an even a question that comes before that

185
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,769
is why were they recording all these conversations to a central database?

186
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,839
Because they can, I mean, that's usually how these things work is there.

187
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,320
-- Yeah,
-- see, that's more my concern is because from there then you start, like,

188
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,820
if you don't do that, you don't have security as many security issues.

189
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,179
I mean, that's

190
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,760
-- part of,
-- you know, it's

191
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:34,000
like,

192
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,780
well, it's like that we were just before the show we were talking about, there was

193
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,020
a, there's a local charity that sells lottery tickets for a house or whatever

194
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,058
and they got hacked twice, right?

195
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:45,838
And you know, the second time around they got hacked,

196
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,778
it was like all the credit card data as well.

197
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:50,739
And I'm like, aren't you not supposed to store that on your web server?

198
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:54,018
Like pretty sure that's like under PC I compliance somewhere.

199
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:55,758
It's pretty specifically states

200
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:59,539
thou shall not store this data on a web server,

201
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,268
right? The the rules are crazy to say the least.

202
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:04,658
And so I, I think with this, that's see,

203
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,758
this kind of comes back to that sort of nutritional label I want for my devices is like

204
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,630
you know, I know for a fact my ipad and my iphone o obviously they have a microphone,

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,679
they can record my voice, they can,

206
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,739
you know, I know um

207
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,830
Siri, for example, you know,

208
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,530
ships the data back to Apple sometimes for voice recognition,

209
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,760
right? It doesn't do it on my phone directly.

210
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:31,239
And uh my understanding is obviously they keep all of that stuff forever.

211
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,469
I would expect they

212
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,799
do,

213
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,309
you know, but, and so, but that's well understood,

214
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,619
like when I use Siri and so I have Siri set up to, you know,

215
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,070
I have to press the button for it.

216
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,719
I don't just say, hey Siri and then start talking, you know.

217
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,219
Um So in theory, I have that bit of control

218
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:45,619
and

219
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:46,820
as I say that

220
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:47,289
my

221
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,950
phone just

222
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,770
turn that off,

223
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,609
Siri

224
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,059
order

225
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:51,909
a,

226
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,219
ok, I'm gonna have to go reset my phone in a second here. I thought I'd turn that off.

227
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,039
You just proved

228
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,299
the whole point of this conversation. Kurt.

229
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,150
-- I thought I'd
-- turn that off

230
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,679
here,

231
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,919
but here's the thing I keep thinking of here.

232
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,340
I think people will make the argument that a toy manufacturer, it's just a toy

233
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,900
-- and we don't need to worry about security. What's, what's the big deal?
-- But

234
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,880
it's just kids talking to it, right? Like nothing that's not real data.

235
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,109
I suspect there were similar conversations about safety

236
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,289
at one point where it was like,

237
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,219
it's just a toy, it's fine, you know.

238
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,929
And then we found out that, like, you know,

239
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,359
child's first uranium kit is like a bad thing

240
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,330
and, and maybe we shouldn't be selling those,

241
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,590
which actually is a thing. I don't know if you knew that.

242
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,010
Oh, yeah.

243
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,270
No, I, I, I'm envious that I can't buy those, you know, make your own cloud chamber,

244
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,109
make your own cloud chamber

245
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,260
for uranium. Uh, so, you know what a cloud chamber, right?

246
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,659
You, it's basically a box filled with gas and you can see

247
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,469
as the uranium or whatever radioactive source decays

248
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,070
and sends particles through this chamber full of,

249
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,119
I forget which gas

250
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,179
-- it leaves like a little incandescent trail or whatever.
-- Ah, ok.

251
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,869
So you can actually see,

252
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:09,150
you can, like, see in real time radioactive decay.

253
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,799
Right. I'm, I'll be comfortable watching videos of that on youtube.

254
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,549
Yeah,

255
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,039
it's pretty, mostly harmless. I mean, if it's an

256
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:16,369
alpha

257
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:16,799
source, you

258
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:16,989
know,

259
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,630
mostly harmless then

260
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,710
that could be the motto of our security bear.

261
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,260
Oh, my goodness. I think you're proving the point here, Kurt.

262
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,940
Is that

263
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,960
so anyway, back to the conversation topic is the fact that

264
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,669
I think a lot of these toy manufacturers are going to try to blow this stuff off. But

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
at the end of the day

266
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,880
and this is true of safety,

267
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,719
you need regulation to make this happen

268
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,400
because let's face it if we just told

269
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,440
people

270
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,429
that here are a bunch of toys and

271
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,919
consumer reports released a safety rating of all the toys released this year.

272
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:01,599
Would anyone read that?

273
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,059
No. Yeah, exactly. And even what they understand it. Right.

274
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,190
-- And
-- they couldn't, there's probably what, 2000 toys released every year.

275
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,599
Well, even something simple, like,

276
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,109
what's the difference between a four star and a five star crash rating?

277
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,190
I know five is supposedly better.

278
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,109
But if you ask me, like, objectively, what does that mean? I, I have no idea.

279
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,030
I, I,

280
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,330
yeah, now that you say that, I'm wondering what that does mean, but I,

281
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,190
I couldn't tell you.

282
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,080
Yeah. Is it a statistical thing? Like,

283
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,789
is it,

284
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,229
I assume,

285
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,419
uh, five star is better?

286
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,059
-- Yes,
-- five star is the best. But, like, on what, like, are you less? I don't know.

287
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,659
Right. I literally don't know.

288
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,710
-- I'd have to look it up
-- and this is the exact same problem is,

289
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,609
let's say we have security ratings for products and let's say

290
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,570
your product has an 87 in mine has a 92.

291
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,440
What does that mean?

292
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:46,849
You know?

293
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,390
Who knows?

294
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:48,989
Yeah.

295
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,280
No, the thing that really reminds me of is, you know,

296
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,710
a lot of cities have tried to make

297
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,030
their health inspector reports more understandable to people.

298
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,289
Right. Because for example,

299
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,479
you know, you might have 10 infractions but maybe they're all really minor or,

300
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,090
versus a place with one infraction.

301
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,219
And it's like, yeah,

302
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,409
you know, the guy, like, did something terrible. Right.

303
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:10,630
In fact, I remember I was, I don't remember where I was now,

304
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,419
I was in a restaurant and they had their,

305
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,919
their health inspection report hanging on the wall and they had like a seat

306
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,690
and this was a fairly nice restaurant. And so I went to read it

307
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,869
and it was,

308
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,280
it was something absurd.

309
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,039
Like they had some improperly stored towels or something,

310
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,539
got them a seat and I'm thinking

311
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,250
that seems so minor. It shouldn't even be called out. Right.

312
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,130
But it apparently brought him from an A to ac and that got me thinking

313
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,890
like, what,

314
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,309
why do, why do I care? And how does that matter? And, you know, there's places doing

315
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:39,530
well,

316
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,349
there's probably some good reason for that though.

317
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,690
Where and, and, you know, maybe it doesn't matter or maybe it does matter. But,

318
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,880
I mean, I,

319
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,239
I was eating at that restaurant in San Francisco repeatedly

320
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,000
and I read they had their health inspector report,

321
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,059
you know, on the wall and it, it had two major failings.

322
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,469
One was, they were storing raw meat above the vegetables, you know,

323
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,369
so the drippings and whatnot could be a problem,

324
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,770
uh, for the salads and stuff especially.

325
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,650
And then number two is they were using raid

326
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,289
in the kitchen right around food prep areas.

327
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,039
And it's like, yeah, I don't want raid on my food.

328
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:05,750
That's

329
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,729
-- not good for me.
-- I bet bugs are safer than raid.

330
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,640
I don't know.

331
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,669
To be honest, I'd have to look into that,

332
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,679
but either way I don't want bugs or raid in my phone.

333
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,030
Ok. That's fair. Ok. We'll call it there right.

334
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:21,500
You know?

335
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,830
But fundamentally at the same time, I mean, I get that, you know,

336
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,929
food prep and the food industry is not gonna be always 100%

337
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:27,489
you know,

338
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,530
can't be super sanitary and clean. Well, it sort of can be, I mean, I've seen

339
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,010
you look at some fast food places and some of them,

340
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,229
the better ones are like really quite clean and well run or

341
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,320
more to the point. The automated ones.

342
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,419
Well, OK. Automation is special and I think this is

343
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,130
when security becomes more automated,

344
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,929
which I think is just a totally expected future point.

345
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,619
Yeah,

346
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:50,440
it will,

347
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,669
you won't have to worry about things like

348
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,210
this because the automation will do what's right,

349
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,549
you have like a sealed

350
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,900
system essentially that has known inputs and outputs and, you know,

351
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:02,039
hopefully doesn't have bugs crawling around it, both physical or virtual,

352
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:03,539
right? And I think

353
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,619
this is where it's going to end up is the fact that if you need

354
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,219
a, a database,

355
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,190
you know,

356
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,400
having the intern install something he downloaded off the internet

357
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,260
is less ideal than having some sort of system.

358
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,309
You click the I need a database button

359
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,299
and then it magically gets set up well, securely

360
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,869
and, and we will do what you need.

361
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,559
The problem though is you would,

362
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,340
you need integration between the end point device and the database like

363
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,979
do you, you know with, so

364
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,489
Mongo DB is a simple example, right?

365
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,989
You just have like a reader or a right only gateway

366
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,349
and you know, these devices can connect to it and just shove data.

367
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:43,739
I wonder if the devices had any sort of authentication back to the database or if

368
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,849
they talked to some other end point and that was shoveling data into the Mango DV.

369
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,299
I mean,

370
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,809
the right way is obviously to have some sort of other

371
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,409
end point that can do something like some sort of authentication.

372
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,849
And now we get into the crazy

373
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,390
of security of like, you know, each device, what you just have like a,

374
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,039
a certificate on each device.

375
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,830
But then somebody could like hack their device,

376
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,349
get the certificate off and use it to,

377
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:06,919
you know,

378
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,890
to shove in bad data and you can't revoke it because they're all the same.

379
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,630
So now you have to have each device with its own separate certificate,

380
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,940
which means that the manufacturing process, you have to, you know, just blah, blah,

381
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,299
blah.

382
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:17,640
Right?

383
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,960
And we just quickly go down that rabbit hole of like, well,

384
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:23,539
we've just reinvented online banking so that this kids toy can like

385
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,659
shove audio data into a database somewhere.

386
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,849
Right?

387
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,650
Oh, it makes me sad that everything you said is completely correct.

388
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,830
And so the reality is if they want to do this,

389
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,950
they're gonna do it poorly because here's the sad reality is Right.

390
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,580
There's no downside risk to this.

391
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,739
They already sold all the toys.

392
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:44,359
I,

393
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,409
I really would love to see what would happen if you went back to like Toys R Us

394
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:49,830
or something and tried to return this thing based

395
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,739
on the fact that it has like this horrendous,

396
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,929
-- you know, privacy breach.
-- Right.

397
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,059
So, I would bet you Toys R Us would take it because the large

398
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,359
big box, right.

399
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:02,299
They, they, they will take literally anything just to make you go away because

400
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,700
like refunding money

401
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,800
is less work than dealing with crazy people.

402
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,848
Exactly

403
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,880
with the online retailers and stuff.

404
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,390
So that's one of the reasons I buy from Amazon is their,

405
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
their return process is so painless if you don't return too much stuff,

406
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,358
you know, I've only ever returned

407
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,439
one thing to Amazon ever.

408
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,839
And it's because I accidentally ordered two of them instead of one

409
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,089
and they charged me for them by the time I

410
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:27,780
didn't even realize it till two things showed up.

411
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,489
And I'm like, oh, Amazon screwed up. And then I looked at my credit card statement.

412
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,880
I said no, I screwed up.

413
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,640
So,

414
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:38,630
ok. But so here's what I want to go back to though is you just rattled off

415
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,589
an insane laundry list of steps that need to be taken to

416
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,910
basically secure a system like this from an end device standpoint.

417
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,140
Well, not even secure, but just to make it more robust.

418
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,890
Well, I, I wouldn't even say it was secure.

419
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,680
At that point, there's still a lot more you need to do.

420
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:56,680
You're not wrong. But I guess here's the point is

421
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,239
how many people

422
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,439
can legitimately do this.

423
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,199
Right?

424
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:05,439
Like when you're talking about architecting a system for that level of security,

425
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,770
it's, it's not a skill, you're just gonna find, you know,

426
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,040
you're not gonna put an ad on a job site and have

427
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,520
a dude who knows how to do this kind of show up.

428
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:19,729
This is crazy, hard, insane stuff. And

429
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,250
if I was gonna guess

430
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,900
a toy manufacturer probably has a margin as close to zero as you can get.

431
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,290
And so over architecting something

432
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,050
adds cost, which means they're not gonna do it.

433
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,760
Yeah,

434
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,520
I mean, honestly, my only hope here is that we have a lot of major vendors,

435
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:41,199
Amazon Red Hat to name a few that are working on just kind of a vertical,

436
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,670
I like IOT stack,

437
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,729
you know,

438
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:47,439
in the sense of like these IOT devices that generate messages or need to get data,

439
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,300
you know, and then boom, you, you talk to the Aws or Red Hat system gateway thing,

440
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:52,729
you know,

441
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:54,630
that has back in data storage and back in data

442
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,150
mangling and back in data processing and you know,

443
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,949
all the, you know, integration with all the other shining dancing parts

444
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,650
and you know, you basically

445
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,130
just write the app,

446
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,410
right? You don't have to worry about the back end at all, right.

447
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,530
Kind of like, you know, app developers have,

448
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,609
you know, access to these back end services where it's just you like,

449
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,099
if you want to write a multi user game,

450
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,189
you don't have to write a multi user game server,

451
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,030
you just plug into one of the existing ones.

452
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,290
Well, right, but there's the back end,

453
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,250
which I think you could argue is easier because you only need to do it once.

454
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,619
But there's still all of the end points which

455
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,739
have huge problems.

456
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,390
Well, these guys now provide some development kit stuff for the end points to like,

457
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,579
you know, here's the library that you used to talk to it, right?

458
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,420
You want to send a message. Boom, here you go. You know,

459
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,500
your device will generate a certificate at boot time,

460
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,589
you know. Right.

461
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:43,020
Whatever

462
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:47,670
you iii I don't think you're wrong and I think

463
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,900
this is an interesting way to think about this.

464
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,229
But,

465
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,359
but here's so, here's where

466
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,839
my first thought is, is again, we're back to the concept of there's zero margin.

467
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,229
And so

468
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,760
you would need this to be so low cost, it's basically free because let's face it.

469
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,380
The alternative is these guys are just gonna roll

470
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,280
their own stuff that they download off the internet.

471
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:09,939
Yeah.

472
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,099
Well, and I think that's where something like, you know, like a busy box equivalent,

473
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:16,699
you know, the busy box, Linux that runs on like every single router on the, you know,

474
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,489
-- every single low end router on the planet,
-- it runs on almost everything.

475
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,939
And in most instances,

476
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:25,579
though these guys have basically downloaded it off the

477
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,959
internet and made it work on their device.

478
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,180
Right. They're not working with.

479
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,239
In fact, I don't even know, I,

480
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,979
I'm sure there is but I don't know of organizations that, like, sell

481
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,380
iot style development kits

482
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,449
-- that would solve some of these problems.
-- So there are, there are several.

483
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,589
Um, but yeah, again, it goes back to, you know, well,

484
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,930
do we do it properly and pay money for this or do we just have, you know, the intern,

485
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,050
go download Busy Box,

486
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,329
the intern is gonna go download Busy Box.

487
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,130
And there's, there's, well, there's two, there's two sides to that because I,

488
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,040
I, I've done this more times than I, I'm proud of. But

489
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,770
like when you're young, especially you wanna show you can do something.

490
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,819
And so I would, I would never buy things.

491
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,510
I would always, like, put it together using piles of random open source.

492
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,290
And of course,

493
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,125
the minute I left those companies, they were like,

494
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,805
what is this stuff? We don't even, you know, they didn't have, they had no clue.

495
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,064
-- They never
-- lost. See.

496
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:19,685
And that's one of my hopes is that as those companies,

497
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:24,015
the reality is virtually every company on the planet now is becoming to some degree,

498
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:24,895
a software company,

499
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:25,814
right? That's

500
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,324
everything that ships,

501
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,755
I was gonna say beyond a light bulb, but even light bulbs have software now, you know,

502
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,479
everything has software

503
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:35,680
spoons, spoon.

504
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,030
Well, no, there's those self leveling spoons that have like the anti

505
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,800
vibration stuff. So people with Parkinson's can eat cereal.

506
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:43,030
And

507
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,310
not only

508
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:43,439
that,

509
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,680
I mean, these chips are getting so

510
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,569
cheap.

511
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,729
I mean, like, let me give you an example is I took a ferry ride on a boat, uh,

512
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:52,839
about six months ago

513
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,369
and the tickets turned out to be RF ID.

514
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,390
They were little paper tickets that have an RF ID chip inside of them.

515
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,530
And there was like, there was literally no extra cost for this ticket

516
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,780
and it, the machine,

517
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,010
Raspberry

518
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,020
Pi Zero,

519
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,030
the new Raspberry Pi Zero just came out and

520
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,599
-- it's got wifi Bluetooth and it's $10
-- 10 bucks.

521
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,560
Right. Exactly. And that's the thing is the,

522
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:16,640
the cost of all this hardware is so close to zero now

523
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,439
that

524
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,520
like software is gonna be the difference, right?

525
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,500
And software is in some instances is zero.

526
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,469
So

527
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,780
security costs money. How do we get security into any of this stuff?

528
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,300
Well, my hope is like I said,

529
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,739
these companies start to mature their security process of it.

530
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,060
And,

531
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,180
you know, for example, at a minimum,

532
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,979
I would hope realized quickly that,

533
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:39,969
you know, it's better to

534
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,189
uh sort of outsource this, for example,

535
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:45,939
and get like uh an SDK from a major vendor than it is to like, you know,

536
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,010
make a random pile of stuff internally that sort of works.

537
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,349
But, I mean, in all seriousness,

538
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,060
I think without government regulation and I'm sure we're gonna have

539
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:56,449
plenty of people who totally disagree with this and that,

540
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,060
that's fine.

541
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,530
I'd love to hear what you think. But,

542
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:02,770
I mean, fundamentally if, if someone isn't telling them you have to do it this way,

543
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,640
they're always gonna pick the cheap, easy route

544
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:05,530
every time

545
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,300
and, and, I mean, I always think about

546
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,619
the, the self regulation,

547
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,310
like around environmental controls and things like that.

548
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,900
Right. I mean,

549
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,180
outside of APR disaster.

550
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:18,920
Yeah. Screw that stuff. That's pretty much

551
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,099
the

552
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,540
APR disaster. Like look at uh, I mean,

553
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,089
deep horizons like what are people gonna do? Stop buying gasoline?

554
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,369
Yeah, I mean, that,

555
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,300
that definitely had some issues but they also, they,

556
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,939
they took steps to mitigate some of the pr nightmare.

557
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,060
They were in the middle of

558
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,500
it as part of that

559
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,540
and

560
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:36,530
it's

561
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,900
right. I mean, and I guess here's, here's one of the questions is,

562
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:41,750
was it cheaper

563
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,520
to deal with the fallout of that accident than it was to do it? Right.

564
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,310
And that like, I don't know the answer to it. I suspect it wasn't.

565
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,530
But fundamentally that's what it has to come down to is

566
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,599
doing it wrong has to cost more than doing it.

567
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,949
Right. And today that is totally not the case.

568
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,630
Part of the challenge too is, I mean,

569
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,920
Deepwater horizons is an extreme example because you lost

570
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,589
that drilling platform that was worth several $100 million

571
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:04,400
if not over a billion.

572
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,239
And, but the problem is I'm guessing, you know,

573
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,640
the insurance company had a really bad day

574
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,109
probably. And

575
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,270
-- that's part of the challenge is
-- ignoring the oil

576
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,270
platform is let's shift it back to a toy

577
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:14,810
is

578
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:15,209
two

579
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:15,459
days

580
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,530
with the toy is there's no significant,

581
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,400
there's not going to be like a loss equivalent to that for the manufacturer.

582
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,540
Right. Exactly.

583
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,439
There's, you know, there almost a bunch of data, worst case scenario with this M

584
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,390
-- DB being encrypted and ransomed.
-- It's not their data. What do they care?

585
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,219
Right.

586
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,900
I mean, that's the reality of it.

587
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,290
Yeah. So,

588
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,959
no, it's, there has to be, yeah,

589
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:37,329
there has to be economic incentives to behave properly.

590
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,130
And I don't think,

591
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,949
you know, as much as I would love to see like CV E, you know,

592
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:45,099
common vulnerabilities and exposures database help with this and give,

593
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:48,670
you know, I would love to see a world of informed consumers, you know, like,

594
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,250
well, like consumer reports is done for cars to some degree, you know,

595
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,040
they've definitely made it a lot better but still people, you know,

596
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,109
there's lemon cars and, you know, brands and

597
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,589
cars with, you know, major defects and I mean, you know,

598
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:04,130
every time I hear of a safety recall, like what was

599
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:04,810
actually,

600
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,849
-- you know,
-- what you just reminded me of is,

601
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:09,849
so there's a company called JD Power and Associates that does

602
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,619
various, um,

603
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,459
Well, we'll say surveys of people who acquire automobiles

604
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,280
and they said that the,

605
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,619
the ratings of these cars and car manufacturers has

606
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,920
been going down for the last couple of years.

607
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,680
And so they did,

608
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:26,280
they did some research into being like, what's going on

609
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,609
and it turns out it's the entertainment systems. It's a software. Yeah.

610
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,589
Where people can't, they can't figure out their entertainment system.

611
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,439
So they're giving lower ratings on these cars.

612
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:38,760
Well, I've, I own a car that's old enough that it doesn't have that.

613
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,550
And honestly every time I interact with

614
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,050
one of these in vehicle entertainment slash,

615
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,530
well, especially better than navigation systems,

616
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:48,829
I never

617
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,209
use the

618
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:49,969
vehicle negotiation.

619
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,280
Yeah.

620
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:52,910
Well, and more to the point, like,

621
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,209
doesn't everybody have a cell phone now?

622
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,030
-- No, like, seriously.
-- Right.

623
00:25:58,449 --> 00:25:59,359
I, I agree.

624
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:04,000
And I love every time I go to rent a car and they try to get me to take a GPS and I just,

625
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,800
right, like who gets those

626
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,599
people who forgot to buy a data travel package?

627
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,800
-- Maybe. I don't know. But that's
-- the only thing I can think of is,

628
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:13,680
or,

629
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,069
or you're going somewhere so bizarrely out of the

630
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,670
way that they don't have cell phone service.

631
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,670
But there's offline maps, man.

632
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,310
Well, I was gonna say in that case, you're probably, you know, GPS, you,

633
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,540
you'd be packing a GPS in a rifle most likely.

634
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,969
-- Right. Right.
-- You know,

635
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,030
because I can't think of anywhere on the planet.

636
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,540
Really that I've been to, that doesn't have cell phone service

637
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,650
with the exception of like, oh, there's like a three mile stretch of road, uh,

638
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,729
a couple of miles away from my parents' cabin where it goes through a little valley

639
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,569
and there's real, like, there's no cell phone service for like a mile or two.

640
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,130
And that's it.

641
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,979
There is no cell phone service in the basement of the Marriott in San Francisco.

642
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:53,579
probably due to seismic reinforcing.

643
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,119
Actually, that, that could be,

644
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,369
-- that could be
-- because I noticed cell phone reception inside

645
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:01,589
a lot of the older San Francisco buildings

646
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:02,469
is terrible.

647
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,699
But then you look around you and you see all those like massive eye beams and all that,

648
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:08,369
they've added a whole bunch of steel and stuff to,

649
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,469
you know, prevent this thing from falling down during the next big one. Right.

650
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:11,770
Right.

651
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,479
You know, I gotta say I was really impressed actually with how well cell phone and,

652
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:18,869
um Wi Fi worked in the Moscone, you know, and it was packed

653
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,489
and there were people just, you know,

654
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,829
hammering on, you know, using data for demos

655
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,160
and

656
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,099
cell service that I couldn't get the Wi Fi in the Mosconi to work at all.

657
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,060
It worked for me, but like, my VPN would drop every two minutes,

658
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:33,979
but I could like surf the web and do youtube and stuff, no problem.

659
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:36,040
So as long as it was like something that didn't

660
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,930
mind its connection being thumped on the head every,

661
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,250
like 10 seconds.

662
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,290
Yeah. No, I, I agree. That's like 40,000 people. That's amazing.

663
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:44,569
Yeah.

664
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,959
And 40,000, like heavy data users. I'm guessing. You know,

665
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,530
I would assume so.

666
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,479
So.

667
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,719
All right. Anyway, we should, we should move on. We're kind of,

668
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,439
let's,

669
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:55,479
let's go on to more,

670
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,219
let's say interesting topics. Google's e to email.

671
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,020
Yeah. So,

672
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,619
email encryption. Oh boy.

673
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,400
Yeah. Where do you even start?

674
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,000
This is something that makes me sad because this is something I, I was,

675
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,339
I was a true believer for many years of email.

676
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:11,280
End to end encryption.

677
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:15,589
And I'm pleased to say that I was one of the straws that broke the camel's back.

678
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:16,689
The

679
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:17,959
GP G.

680
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,069
Oh, yeah.

681
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,719
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,439
No, it's, um,

683
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,410
it's sad because I mean,

684
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,160
fundamentally nobody cares about end to end email security really

685
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,189
outside of like people with H IP A requirements.

686
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:30,750
That's it.

687
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:31,339
Here's,

688
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:34,270
here's the deal and this kind of goes back to what we were talking

689
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,130
about just now is what's the incentive to encrypt your email end to end?

690
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,160
And what's the disincentive for not doing it?

691
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,060
Yeah.

692
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,219
Well, and, and what gets me is part of the challenge too now is I consume email

693
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,479
on sort of three, well, basically there's three ways to consume email in my opinion.

694
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,650
And that's number one is through like a classical email app, like,

695
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,939
say Outlook or Thunderbird or something, you know, like a big,

696
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:57,489
full heavy like 100 megabit client.

697
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,209
Second way is a mobile client like whatever,

698
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:03,329
basically the default mail client on your phone or tablet is sure.

699
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:04,640
And then the third way,

700
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,010
the web interface. Right. Right.

701
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,650
And,

702
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,410
and I access my email primarily through either my mobile or my web app and I only

703
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,180
use a full fat email client like Thunderbird when

704
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,410
I have to send and receive encrypted email.

705
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,859
And my solution to that is just to never send or see encrypted

706
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,150
email.

707
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:26,290
Yeah, I, I'm, unfortunately, I'm in a position where I have to do that once in a while.

708
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,489
And, uh, but otherwise, yeah, I mean,

709
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,869
and that's the problem, right? Is

710
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,300
most of these web interfaces and mobile clients don't

711
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,219
have a really good system for end to end encrypted email.

712
00:29:37,229 --> 00:29:40,229
Like, for example, you can use, um, X 509 certificates

713
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,619
on your mobile client pretty easily, especially on an iphone.

714
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,439
But, um, that

715
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,959
I, that doesn't really work all that well with the web interface ones,

716
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,729
you know. So essentially,

717
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,810
you know, I don't want to be, well,

718
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,869
we have these three different classes of email clients

719
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,229
with like three widely varying abilities to support encrypted

720
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:02,300
and signed email.

721
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,689
Right. There's no like plug in I can download for all three to just make it work.

722
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:10,400
That is true. And I suspect that's a huge part of the problem

723
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,959
in, in making encrypted email a thing.

724
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,089
Well, and then the other problem is, for example,

725
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,239
I know people who work at offices where they hot desk,

726
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,660
you know.

727
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,920
So uh hopefully they have something like maybe Microsoft

728
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,140
Windows with uh what is it active profiles?

729
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,170
I think is the name for it, you know, where your profile follows you around and stuff.

730
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,369
So. Ok, great. Now you can have your encryption keys but like how do we,

731
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,359
you know, now we need to set it up for the, bring your own device and now we, well,

732
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,900
but wait, now you can't check email remotely on a, on a web terminal.

733
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:38,640
Right?

734
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:38,859
Well,

735
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:45,369
and not only that if you don't have the key on some sort of like a card or a little UE

736
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,180
fob,

737
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:50,979
now you, if you have the key on your desktop and on your phone,

738
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:52,500
you've doubled

739
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,050
your attack surface against that key.

740
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:58,400
Yeah. Although realistically, I don't think anybody's gonna bother

741
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,239
unless you're like some crazy targeted attack like a bank or something.

742
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,140
Well, but here's the thing is nobody bothers because nobody does this.

743
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,489
If encrypted email was widely deployed and used,

744
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,939
I think you'd see a lot of attacks against it because those keys would have value.

745
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:14,689
Yeah.

746
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:18,099
And I think part of the problem too is encrypted email doesn't

747
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:21,739
really solve a lot of problems because in my experience,

748
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,099
the bigger problem with email

749
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,329
is validating the sender,

750
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,969
right.

751
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,680
Especially, you know, when you get business email,

752
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:33,329
like uh go pay this $20,000 wire transfer bill

753
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,959
-- to this weird account
-- in Russia and no questions.

754
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:37,410
Yeah. You know,

755
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,479
um, and, you know, make sure, like, and because, you know,

756
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:41,869
we see that kind of stuff all the time.

757
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,329
I mean, there's all those, what were they calling it,

758
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,050
spear fishing attacks against these, you know, companies?

759
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,310
I think that one company lost, like, $16 million or something ridiculous.

760
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,489
It was on the register.

761
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,170
I mean, that's, that's real money. Like,

762
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:56,819
no, it's true. But at the same time,

763
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:00,510
encrypted email won't solve that problem. That's my point. Right. That is all about

764
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,420
the sender validation

765
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,930
-- email problem, right?
-- You can sign the email. But even then is,

766
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,989
is this like e two email solution?

767
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,979
Google has,

768
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:13,760
is it actually gonna help with that because we still have

769
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,130
like key management is going to become the primary issue then?

770
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:18,280
And that's

771
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,839
honestly, key management is harder to solve than plugins for various apps.

772
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:26,939
Well, and, and that's sort of, I think why they basically, so there is a, um,

773
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:30,099
that Google, where the heck is it? What are they called?

774
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,420
They announced it like a month ago, right?

775
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,380
So it's,

776
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,550
it's encrypted email and it's, but it's all done on Google's end.

777
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,829
So they do all the key management, they do all of that

778
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,849
and they just display the email to you, right. And

779
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,000
so it's not

780
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,599
technically encrypted end to end,

781
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,489
it's encrypted like almost all the way to the end you know,

782
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,099
and just that final display

783
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:53,030
-- is clear texted,
-- we need to clarify this.

784
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,420
So the way it works and we'll find a link for the

785
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,489
show notes that that talk about kind of what Google has said.

786
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,410
But so fundamentally, the idea behind end to end encryption is I have a key.

787
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,569
Kurt has a key,

788
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:07,430
I send something to Kurt and only Kurt can view it

789
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,790
or verify it or whatever it is we're trying to do.

790
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,310
Ok.

791
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,459
Now what Google is doing is they're using something called S

792
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,209
Mime, which is a way to encrypt and validate emails.

793
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:18,979
-- But basically I
-- have some bad news for you.

794
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:19,979
They just,

795
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,329
-- they just abandoned it yesterday.
-- The S

796
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,790
-- mime thing did they really Google
-- abandons end to

797
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,550
end email encryption projects invites community to take over

798
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,310
that. No, no, that's e to email. That's not the S mime

799
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,010
thing.

800
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:37,089
-- Oh, no. Ok. Yeah, that's the end to end one.
-- Right. Right. It's so obvious. Right.

801
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,199
So, so we'll, we'll get the differences.

802
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:42,099
But so fundamentally and so Kurt having key, Josh hang

803
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,479
key, that's the e

804
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,089
email.

805
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,900
Well, to be more specific,

806
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,699
having a key on the end device that

807
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,939
you're actually reading and sending the email from.

808
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,569
Right. Ok.

809
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,939
So that in theory the only place that email is

810
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,640
encrypted is like on your device on the screen.

811
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,540
Right. Yes. Yes, exactly. And so what Google is doing though with their S mime

812
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:03,900
support and I suspect this is why they open source. The E email is because

813
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,459
they gave up and they,

814
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,790
yeah. Well, it's open P GP based,

815
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,360
giving it to the community and we'll see if the community can do anything with this.

816
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,478
But in all seriousness, I, I suspect they can't just because

817
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,418
we've known about this problem. For what, like 30 years,

818
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,810
how do I get the keys on everything?

819
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,639
Right. So, anyway, anyway,

820
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,399
uh, so Google service with S

821
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:26,300
Mime is basically you give Google the keys

822
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,909
and then Google does all the operations on their server.

823
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,850
Oh, I thought they actually generated the keys themselves.

824
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,129
So you just like clicked a button and turned it on.

825
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:35,495
That's what I

826
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:35,665
want.

827
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:35,853
I

828
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:36,103
don't

829
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:36,574
do.

830
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,675
OK. So let me, let me back that up even more. So S Mime

831
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:43,324
use certificates. So you have to hand Google

832
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:46,804
some sort of uh certificate in the chain

833
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:50,375
-- that they can use to. You can either I, my understanding and I
-- can go

834
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:52,465
has trusted roots now.

835
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,844
-- Uh
-- they have theirs but you still need and you can't just trust them.

836
00:34:56,853 --> 00:35:00,245
You should have your own root in your organization for the S mi

837
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,449
See. And my take on this is I would just outsource the whole dang thing to Google.

838
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,179
-- So,
-- so OK, so regardless, OK, the point is Google has the keys.

839
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,300
And so that means

840
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:14,419
from Google's server to where it's going,

841
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:18,820
there could be some level of trust that you wouldn't necessarily have

842
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,360
in other instances.

843
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,639
And like, so for example, a reason you might want this is people talk about

844
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:26,590
there's uh H TT not H TT

845
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,659
SMTP, you know, SSL SMTP,

846
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,010
SMTPS.

847
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,850
And

848
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,570
is it SSMTP? I forget it doesn't matter whatever.

849
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:35,909
So

850
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:37,959
SMTP.

851
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,929
And the thing is though, your email doesn't have to go to just one place.

852
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:45,050
It can hop around between multiple servers on its trip.

853
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,540
And so

854
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:51,419
if your email isn't encrypted for the trip, every server that touches it

855
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,199
can view what it is. And in some cases you could send

856
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:58,080
or you could have an encrypted SMTP session to one

857
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,040
server and then that server could relay over plaintext.

858
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:03,739
And so you can't guarantee

859
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:05,860
any sort of authenticity

860
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,780
or even just secrecy

861
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:11,729
as email traverses the internet. And so if you're using s

862
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,100
mime to encrypt, everything

863
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,199
that changes the rules because now the email can

864
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,669
be encrypted as it's traveling across the internet.

865
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,209
Right?

866
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,610
Well,

867
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,010
and this actually now creates a big pile of security problems because

868
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,360
you have an encrypted email and you can't scan it for viruses.

869
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,870
You can't scan it for content

870
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,370
outgoing or incoming, right? That's something to remember too is

871
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,620
a lot of places, for example, have a legal requirement to scan outgoing email.

872
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:38,060
Like there's those appliances that look for like social

873
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,929
security numbers and credit card numbers and you know,

874
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:42,570
-- personally identifiable information being accidentally included
-- in

875
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:43,760
the point of

876
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,889
mime though is

877
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:48,594
because you can have infrastructure in your organization that can

878
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:50,645
still look at this stuff and figure it out.

879
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:55,145
Well, just everything I've seen of end to end encrypted email, it doesn't,

880
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:58,435
outside of a very few specific, like, high security requirements.

881
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:00,774
It doesn't, most people don't have that problem.

882
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:04,185
And secondly, the downside of losing, like, no offense.

883
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,784
But if you don't scan your email for viruses,

884
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:08,514
I guarantee you somebody's going to get down to

885
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:11,104
-- hamster dot Dxe and click on it
-- without a doubt

886
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:11,764
without a doubt.

887
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,219
That's a given, right?

888
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:20,479
And, and so the tinfoil hat in me says giving Google the keys is a terrible idea.

889
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:24,479
But the realist in me says this makes way more sense.

890
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:27,870
-- What,
-- you know, it reminds me of cloud flare, like as bad as that cloud flare,

891
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,320
cloud bleed breach was

892
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:34,050
cloud flare has now done SSL TLS encryption for 4.3 million websites.

893
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,850
The majority of which wouldn't have had TLS or SSL encryption otherwise.

894
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,399
Right?

895
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:39,489
And, and it's kind of,

896
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,810
I guess this is all of security is there's always some sort of trade off and

897
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:48,409
the problem is, and I, I keep saying this over and over again is if there's,

898
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:52,530
if you have to choose between usability and security, security loses every time,

899
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:53,770
unquestionably,

900
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,530
well, you know, outside of, again, very limited things. I mean,

901
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,169
the system has to be usable or what's the point? I mean, a great example is the, uh

902
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,860
you want to talk an extreme example,

903
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,280
remember nuclear weapon safety in the US and nuclear weapon security, right?

904
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:10,260
And so they, they had the requirement back in the, you know,

905
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,870
fifties that we need to make these weapons.

906
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,209
So like the bad guys can't use them.

907
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,139
So they had this idea of a permissive action link which was essentially like,

908
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,040
uh, it was an eight digit code,

909
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,919
um,

910
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:21,580
you know,

911
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,260
on the nuclear weapon and if you entered it wrong

912
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,379
too many times the nuclear weapon would disable itself.

913
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,979
So you can, you know, just sit there trying codes and, you know,

914
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:28,919
then set the thing off.

915
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,919
Um, but, you know,

916
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:31,919
again,

917
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:34,090
key management is hard so they set all

918
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,290
the pal codes to 000000 for like several decades

919
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,969
and they probably still are.

920
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,979
Well, they've actually changed now.

921
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,409
But, but fundamentally, there's a great example of, I don't care,

922
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:48,159
like from their perspective, security of the system.

923
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, it would suck to have a nuclear weapon stolen

924
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,790
but to not have retaliate,

925
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,280
you know, retaliatory capability

926
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:57,100
and lose mad, like mutually assured destruction

927
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,330
-- would be far worse.
-- And

928
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,629
additionally, people

929
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,909
change jobs, paperwork gets lost.

930
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,550
Who's holding the codes and how do you ensure you

931
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,110
can get them quickly and easily if you need them?

932
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,750
Yeah,

933
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,860
I assume at that point you'd end up just stenciling them on the side of the weapon.

934
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,189
Right. And in this, I mean, this is basically the encrypted email problem of

935
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,350
when you have to maintain your own key.

936
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:25,739
It's terrible and hard to do. And so most people just,

937
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,689
they don't,

938
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:31,479
-- they, they take the easy.
-- I've outsourced as much all my tls and SSL. I mean,

939
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,639
I still buy certificates for my end systems just

940
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,510
in case I have to switch off cloud flare.

941
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,520
But fundamentally, I've, I've outsourced as much of it as I can.

942
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,489
-- Whatever, man, that's what let's encrypt is for
-- now.

943
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:42,889
They don't do wild cards.

944
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,209
And I use,

945
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:45,820
I

946
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:45,979
use

947
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:48,810
cards because that way I only have one certificate to manage.

948
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,199
Let's encrypt. Just get 37,000 certificates. It's fine.

949
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,330
It's, uh,

950
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,760
there's some use case issues in situations where

951
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,929
let's encrypt is actually kind of painful and

952
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,840
honestly, 70 bucks per year for a wild card is like, and we're done.

953
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,870
Yeah, that, that's fair. That's fair.

954
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:11,139
And you don't have the management nightmare of 37,000 certificates sitting

955
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:11,500
around

956
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,699
-- the
-- configuration issue. It's just,

957
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:18,679
it's a, you know, blank dot whatever website use the blank.

958
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:19,399
Right.

959
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:19,629
I

960
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,699
wonder if they have limits.

961
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:24,310
Like, if I had a server set up that was requesting, you know,

962
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,100
thousands of certificates a day.

963
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,370
I wonder if they would not do that.

964
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:29,560
I

965
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:31,780
would, I would hope they have some sort of limiting

966
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,169
something built in.

967
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,719
But, I mean, the thing is, you can legitimately have a web,

968
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:39,780
a single IP web server hosting thousands of websites,

969
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,459
you know, some of those hosting providers really pack them in.

970
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,379
Oh, they do. They do. I remember the days of running a web server with,

971
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:50,340
well, it was hundreds back then but it was very crappy sun gear and, yeah. Yeah.

972
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,639
Yeah, you just kept smashing them in there, man.

973
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,969
-- Yeah, I mean, most of those websites aren't seeing any traffic.
-- Right. Exactly.

974
00:40:56,979 --> 00:41:00,179
Yeah. The vast majority of them did nothing in effect. I even remember back then.

975
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:04,179
You needed a separate IP per virtual host in Apache.

976
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,790
We had a machine with 300 IP addresses.

977
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,389
It looks awesome.

978
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:15,050
Oh, I remember talking to my ISP and telling them that, you know, with, uh the um

979
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,929
virtual hosting coming in, you know, being able to do

980
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:20,360
more than one site off of a single IP,

981
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,610
a major part of their business was selling extra IP S to people.

982
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,449
Sure.

983
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,120
Right. Because you want to host more than one website. Well,

984
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,169
IP S are five bucks a month.

985
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,639
Yeah, back when there were plenty.

986
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:33,770
-- Yeah.
-- And I mean, that, that is a heck of a cash stream.

987
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,669
Oh, I believe it, man. I believe it.

988
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,729
So encrypted email.

989
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,100
Yeah, I think, and honestly, I think

990
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,040
the thing to remember too is, is it is still quasi

991
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,810
end to end encrypted. It's just unencrypted at various stages of it.

992
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,110
So, for example, it's unencrypted on Google's end,

993
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,639
but then it's still encrypted from Google to you over like a TLS encrypted channel.

994
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,310
Well, right.

995
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,370
But I mean, I think the, the issue becomes,

996
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:01,520
you have to put a significant amount of trust in Google, which I think

997
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:05,370
at this point in time I'm relatively comfortable doing,

998
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,989
but it's, it's always one of those things of

999
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:12,149
when you put a ton of trust in one organization,

1000
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,070
something is going to happen someday,

1001
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,510
that will be problematic.

1002
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,350
I don't know.

1003
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,850
I mean, we've, we've been outsourcing high trust to doctors,

1004
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,580
lawyers and accountants for literally centuries now.

1005
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,479
I mean,

1006
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,429
I'm always reminded, I was at my accountant,

1007
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:29,330
we had to phone revenue Canada to renew my agreement that basically

1008
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,030
my lawyer could like talk to revenue Canada on my behalf.

1009
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,969
And it's funny because revenue, the revenue Canada call center, you know, he,

1010
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,100
he like, he knows that the revenue Canada call center number by heart.

1011
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:38,850
He's like dip, dip, dip,

1012
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:39,080
dip

1013
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,419
and then he's like traversing the phone tree in like three seconds, you know,

1014
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,350
and it actually gets it to ring to a human quickly.

1015
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,290
And you know, it's like, hi Ron

1016
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,459
again, blah, blah, blah. And he's like,

1017
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,909
yeah, this is so and so accounting agency, I have my client here.

1018
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:50,540
We need to blah, blah, blah. And she's like, ok,

1019
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,510
uh I'll need to verify his identity.

1020
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,570
He's like, OK, the client's here and she's like, what's your uh full name?

1021
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,909
And I'm like, you know, Kurt say,

1022
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,629
and what's your social security number? And I'm like, uh

1023
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,060
and

1024
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,489
my s my

1025
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,260
slides some paperwork over to me with my social security number on it.

1026
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,649
Right. And I'm like, what's the point of this? Like this guy has all my data?

1027
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,270
It's, it's a big show,

1028
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,790
-- you know, it's
-- a big show.

1029
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,389
But ok, but here's the thing is your analogy is perfect because

1030
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,260
lawyers and doctors and accountants

1031
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,270
have certain professional requirements they must meet

1032
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:25,530
to be part of the profession,

1033
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:25,870
right?

1034
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:28,510
They are professionals, not because we just call them that,

1035
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,500
but because there are actually things they have to do to prove they are competent.

1036
00:43:34,149 --> 00:43:35,810
What is Google proving

1037
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:38,629
that says they are trustworthy and competent?

1038
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:39,830
They are,

1039
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,560
well,

1040
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,800
trust

1041
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:43,310
us.

1042
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,479
Wink. Wink.

1043
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:46,929
Right. But here's the thing,

1044
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,669
they're like socks, you know, I know Amazon, for example,

1045
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,949
has a web page basically listing like every single security control

1046
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,530
they've passed and it's basically all of them at this point.

1047
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:57,260
-- I know. Same for
-- Google. Right.

1048
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,290
I, I think that might be a start.

1049
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:03,250
I would also point out that, you know, even in the U with H

1050
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:06,689
A and stuff, Google, you know, health data breach

1051
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,610
and, you know, there's lots

1052
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,689
but, but here's the thing is

1053
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,229
all of those are specific in their own unique way,

1054
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:17,800
but fundamentally

1055
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,120
none of them really have hard requirements on say,

1056
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,439
customer privacy or in the case of Google,

1057
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:28,300
like we're not their customers if you're using a free Gmail account.

1058
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:29,679
And so

1059
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,199
there's a lot of squishy area here that

1060
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:36,399
you don't necessarily have in the other professions.

1061
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:40,439
And so II, I don't disagree with you that I think you can easily make an argument.

1062
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,679
Google is trustworthy.

1063
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,719
But I, I also wish there was more meat on these bones

1064
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,919
that said

1065
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,699
this is the way it has to be. These are the protections we have as consumers

1066
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,149
-- as
-- people

1067
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:55,469
with PC. I, and I mean, it's still less than I do,

1068
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,000
-- but here's the thing
-- PC isn't about protecting consumers though.

1069
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,540
PC I is about protecting banks.

1070
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:02,290
Oh, true. And I wish there was more of it because I

1071
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:04,770
trust the bank implicitly. It also helps.

1072
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:08,590
-- Well, it lowers the cost to me because there would be less incidents
-- in theory.

1073
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes, that, that is the basic idea. However, even then, even with PC I compliance,

1074
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:15,810
I get a new credit card at least once a year.

1075
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:16,590
I mean.

1076
00:45:16,729 --> 00:45:17,229
Right.

1077
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,110
I'm looking at getting a new credit card just for some online stuff I need to do.

1078
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,429
No, no, I mean, I have to get one because it was stolen, you know.

1079
00:45:25,919 --> 00:45:27,550
So it's, it's crazy man.

1080
00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:31,340
There aren't good answers to a lot of this today and

1081
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,889
my feeling on this and we can talk about this another day

1082
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,530
because I don't want to go down this rat hole too deep.

1083
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,120
But like security is a very immature industry still.

1084
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:43,750
We don't have a lot of this stuff figured out and we have a long way to go

1085
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:45,129
see part of my concern is,

1086
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:47,320
is I think the technical side of security will

1087
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,679
always be immature because it's always moving so fast.

1088
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:50,729
And that could be

1089
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,570
the business management side could definitely mature a bit with, you know,

1090
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,370
actually doing risk analysis or actually,

1091
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,989
you know, figuring out what, what are the risks,

1092
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,459
what risks are we willing to take and accept, you know,

1093
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,459
and pass on and then also maybe informing people of those risks, you know,

1094
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,129
appropriately, like in English,

1095
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:10,649
that is understandable.

1096
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:10,959
Yeah.

1097
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,330
No, I agree completely. You know, because like this, this

1098
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,929
end to end thing, well,

1099
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:15,639
sort of quasi

1100
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,860
technically speaking that that Google email is encrypted, end to end, just

1101
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:20,939
not

1102
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,439
completely end to end. You know what I mean?

1103
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:26,780
Like it's subtle but it's, it's from, uh, honestly, from my personal opinion,

1104
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,120
-- it's good enough to qualify as end to end and
-- that's the key.

1105
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:32,979
It's good enough, right. It's because here's the thing,

1106
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,179
-- a
-- lot more usable.

1107
00:46:34,189 --> 00:46:35,540
Perfect is impossible

1108
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,550
and perfectly nothing are basically the same functionally

1109
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,340
and so good enough

1110
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,500
is good enough,

1111
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:42,379
right?

1112
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,159
And I can think of no better way to end this.

1113
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,199
So,

1114
00:46:46,419 --> 00:46:47,639
with a good enough podcast.

1115
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,030
That's right. The good enough podcast.

1116
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,570
-- The security bear.
-- That's probably mostly safe.

1117
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,719
Oh, my goodness.

1118
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,350
Yes.

1119
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,330
Oh, it's time to go. All right.

1120
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,610
All right, everybody. Thank you for listening.

1121
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,040
I'm sorry,

1122
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:07,169
I

1123
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,830
can't stop thinking about that.

1124
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:09,770
All right. So,

1125
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,699
thank you for listening.

1126
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:15,729
If you want our show notes or any of the other silly things we've,

1127
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:19,370
we've cooked up today is go to open source security podcast.com.

1128
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,590
You can find links there to contacting Kurt and I on Twitter.

1129
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,889
We have a Facebook group. You're welcome to join, to interact

1130
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:25,770
and

1131
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,370
Kurt, you, you have a great day.

1132
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:28,840
Yeah.

1133
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:33,060
And I guess the moral of the story is everybody with an iphone should say, hey Siri

1134
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,520
and, and make sure that their phone does the appropriate thing.
