Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 55

1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,489
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,409
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,479
Oh, man, Kurt, I am so excited.

4
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,319
Let's encrypt finally is going to have wild card certificates.

5
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,969
Yeah, I'm actually really looking forward to that because

6
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:24,040
I, uh, Dirty Secret.

7
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:27,389
I actually started buying wild card certificates many years ago

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,680
because it was just simpler, right? You buy one certificate and you're done,

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,500
right? You don't have to get one per host or whatever.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,880
Um, and then of course,

11
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:37,610
I just outsourced the whole messed cloud floor and just walked away from it.

12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:38,939
It's like, it just works

13
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:40,770
like, and for five bucks a month. Right?

14
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,139
So, yeah, but I mean, yeah,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,009
I love the fact that we'll be able to get wild card certificates for free.

16
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:51,810
That's, uh, you know, man, I, I just, I think about this is, I remember certificates.

17
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,349
This was back in the day.

18
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:56,090
They were like hundreds of dollars.

19
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:56,529
I mean,

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,369
it was so expensive and so crazy even getting

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,130
a domain was really expensive and really hard.

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,040
I remember when getting a domain was free.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,680
Why? Because it was like in the, the hosts file, everyone was copying around.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:10,849
No, no, no.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,040
Like 20 years ago when you registered a DNS domain name, you didn't have to pay

26
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,580
for top

27
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,120
level domains. They were just free.

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,639
That predates me. Everything I've ever dealt with involved money.

29
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:23,669
Yeah.

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,440
Or like I knew a guy that got like,

31
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:28,040
two portable C class addresses back in the day and

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,050
then ended up selling them for some good money.

33
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,989
Well, he was running a quote unquote ISP.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,760
It was basically like an Isdn line, like a 128 Kisdn line for his internet feed.

35
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,260
And then like a

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,050
bank of, uh, I think it was 14 4 dial up modems, maybe 9600 bod, I forget.

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,650
But, um, yeah,

38
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,290
and the whole reason he did that is so that he could have free internet at home.

39
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:46,889
Right.

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,730
And basically, you know, he figured out if he had like, 12 or what was it, like,

41
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,290
12 or 15 customers,

42
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,239
uh, you know, he did the math and it's like he had like five or six dial in lines.

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,529
So seriously, like,

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,190
-- he was only double oversold which, you know, most I SPS are 10 to one.
-- Oh, man, it's,

45
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,279
yeah. II,

46
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:09,288
I worked at an ISP a long time ago and it was, it was bad. I, I remember that.

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,758
Well,

48
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,929
if you wanted to make money.

49
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,919
Yeah.

50
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,300
Yeah, that's, that's probably fair.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,169
That was part of the beauty of it though.

52
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:18,300
Too is when you work for the ISP, there's always a couple of secret phone numbers,

53
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,020
you know, that, that nobody knows.

54
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,899
And you can still use to dial up when, when things get rough.

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,820
But, yeah. Yeah, I remember those days, man.

56
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,869
Yeah. Good times. Yeah.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,740
So, yeah, this wild and, and what I really love too is that this, um, because lets,

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,919
and crypt does,

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,059
you know, they use the

60
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,570
ACME certificate protocol. Um

61
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,869
You can basically automate it and you,

62
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,600
you really will want to because I think their certificates are, I want to say 90 days,

63
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,839
I think it's 90 days.

64
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,080
I use one on my site

65
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,179
and

66
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,539
I, I've automated it so I don't remember, but

67
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,600
it's like I've automated it

68
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:56,309
right

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,039
now.

70
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,119
Now I will say though that it sounds like these wild

71
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,000
card certificates are certainly more work because for just one host,

72
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:08,529
you pretty much run a script on the host and,

73
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,490
and magic things happen and then you get a certificate

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,160
and that's

75
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:12,500
not

76
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:12,949
quite it.

77
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:13,970
-- Does,
-- it does

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,190
domain validation at the like web server level, right?

79
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,660
My understanding is right, because it basically talks to the web server gets

80
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,119
the little validation thing, right? And then you're done

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,690
and it's basically the same, they do validation at the root of the DNS.

82
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,029
So like, for example, for

83
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,830
creed.org,

84
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:34,679
uh I would run the client, it would connect to, lets encrypt gets a token, you know,

85
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,889
basically I say the less encrypt.

86
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,470
I want a wild card for secret.org.

87
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,539
They go, ok, here's your token, like your magic little value.

88
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,559
And I have to put that magic little value in a text file

89
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:46,110
-- in my DNS for secret.org.
-- A

90
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,250
-- text
-- record,

91
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:48,619
-- TX
-- T

92
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:49,960
A

93
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,419
TXT record, uh,

94
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,380
which is one of the most wonderfully overused and abused, uh,

95
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,910
DNS records because there's my SPF records and there's my, oh, all sorts of things.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,940
And, um, yeah, and then basically on their end, they

97
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,279
do a DNS query for your text records, your TXT records.

98
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,770
And uh obviously, if the token appears then,

99
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,839
well, basically you control that domain to a point where it,

100
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,649
nothing else they can really do to validate.

101
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,339
It won't matter,

102
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:19,380
right? And, and it sounds like you will need a new token for every renewal.

103
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,980
So this will definitely need some,

104
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,410
-- some automation with your, your register,
-- every

105
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,950
single major DNS provider now has an API

106
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,070
I, I would hope so

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,309
-- well.
-- No, like Amazon wrote 53 Cloud Flare, you know,

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,890
um D DNS, right?

109
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,910
These guys have all had API S for, well, since the beginning, basically,

110
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,630
probably,

111
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,750
-- well, you have to,
-- if you have like 100 domains to manage,

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,980
I have four, which is,

113
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,850
I won't lie. It's very manual still.

114
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,359
I need, I think they expire soon. I need to

115
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:52,679
look in and check that.

116
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,540
Yeah.

117
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,049
Well, no, I mean, I remember handcrafting hosts or uh DN ss uh bind you know,

118
00:04:59,059 --> 00:04:59,829
zone files.

119
00:04:59,839 --> 00:04:59,850
Oh,

120
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,890
man, those were the days and I still can, sadly,

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,230
but by and large I've, you know, again outsourced all of that to just, you know,

122
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,940
cloud flare or Amazon or whoever because quite frankly, like,

123
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,869
I don't wanna run multiple servers

124
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,290
just to have DNS.

125
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:17,410
Ok.

126
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,869
Well, and I used to cheat too.

127
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,589
Uh, in the past,

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,519
what I realized what I could do is I can actually get

129
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,329
away with um setting www.c.org is one of my DNS servers.

130
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:30,350
And that way that record with that IP address would be in the

131
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,239
root zone file.

132
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,399
Look

133
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:32,600
at

134
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,109
you.

135
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,029
And actually that just came up with dot IO.

136
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,279
Somebody realized they could register dot IO

137
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,089
domain

138
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,750
is madness.

139
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,709
-- Well, it's, it's just sloppy coding, right? Like I don't
-- know if it's even coding.

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,519
It's, it's poor.

141
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,910
They need to blacklist

142
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,779
they, right. They, you.

143
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,660
So, so the story is, let's explain it first for anyone who doesn't know

144
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,140
is there's the, the dot iotld

145
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,660
and apparently there were a handful of root

146
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,320
DNS servers for dot IO

147
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,579
that were unregistered domains

148
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,920
and somebody registered them.

149
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,290
And of course, that is uh very bad

150
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,000
in, in many, many ways.

151
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,470
And it sounds like once he reported it, people, they,

152
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,910
they kind of crack down a bit on him.

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,359
But

154
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:20,450
it's, I mean,

155
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,559
fundamentally,

156
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,170
if you have root name servers,

157
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:25,940
like nobody should be able to register those domains

158
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,609
nor should they be unregistered in all seriousness.

159
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,399
Like they should

160
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,605
belong to somebody and if they don't pull them out,

161
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,415
do not

162
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:33,614
move,

163
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:33,855
it's

164
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:35,415
gonna cause performance issues. Right.

165
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,404
Because you're gonna have a lot of clients timing out.

166
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:39,954
Yeah, that too, because I mean, essentially if you have, you know,

167
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,184
a dozen root domain servers, uh, the,

168
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:47,515
the other domain servers just, they try one at random and if it's not there, yeah,

169
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,265
they're gonna, they're gonna try somewhere else.

170
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,404
But no, I've also encountered DNS providers where you could specify

171
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,239
your DNS server and in some cases you could specify the IP address

172
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,829
it was and they would like add that glue record and obviously,

173
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,230
then you could potentially hijack somebody else's domain,

174
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,109
you know. Um, so all sorts of shenanigans. Um,

175
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,510
but yeah, back to like the whole lets encrypt thing, I mean, uh yeah,

176
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,769
fundamentally this is not hard to automate.

177
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,239
And,

178
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,350
well, basically if you've outsourced your DNS in any way, shape or form

179
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:21,089
and your provider doesn't give you an API to put a blunt lead that

180
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,350
you need a new provider.

181
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,619
-- Yeah, I think that's
-- just,

182
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,100
well, not, you know,

183
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,959
I can't think of a single cloud or even any

184
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,559
online service I use now that does not have an API

185
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,839
API S are king man, right?

186
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,570
It's, it's what everybody does,

187
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,470
right? Like, uh what's that famous question? You know, how many,

188
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,239
you know, you can control like one computer from a Gooey.

189
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,480
But if you have like an API, or a scripting language you can control all of them.

190
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,320
Yeah.

191
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,839
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

192
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:50,470
So,

193
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,290
yeah. No, I, I, what really gets me though about the whole lu

194
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,549
and crypt thing is that we're still going to have ac,

195
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,350
a market because people will just not use it or

196
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,470
they'll be like, oh, let's encrypt. It's all

197
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,279
-- whatever made up reason we're not going to use it. Right.
-- I know.

198
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,640
There's, I'm sure there's going to be various reasons and there's,

199
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,630
there's always going to be those old statue people that do things

200
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,359
the way they do things because that's the way they do things.

201
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:16,519
And I, I don't know about compliance

202
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,679
because

203
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,350
I, I don't, I, I need to, I should,

204
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,100
I guess

205
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,549
what happen

206
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,059
with, with some of these cas is they get audited by a third party to verify

207
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,020
that their infrastructure they're using like HS MS

208
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,270
and they're storing keys properly and they've got,

209
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,789
you know, all pi I is dealt with in this certain way and

210
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,880
it is conceivable. Let's encrypt.

211
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,280
-- Can't pass some of those controls, which who cares? Uh,
-- looks like.

212
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,429
Wow, if you go to, uh, let's encrypt.org/repository, uh,

213
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,640
there's a whole bunch of stuff.

214
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,510
They,

215
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,750
they've got ISRG certificate,

216
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,909
practice statements like every, looks like quarterly.

217
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:00,359
Ok.

218
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,260
So that might be good enough.

219
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:02,900
Yeah.

220
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,000
And more to the point that's,

221
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,239
that's just,

222
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,520
it's a problem you can solve with a bit of money.

223
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,619
It's not insurmountable and

224
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:14,630
like the number of, well, because there's two CS being, you know, put to,

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,109
put to sleep basically.

226
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,200
You know, we sign and Startcom.

227
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,070
What is it?

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,109
They got 23 more months before Chrome boots them,

229
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,229
they should have been booted years ago.

230
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,599
And in fairness it's not ok.

231
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,710
So in fairness, Startcom was not always terrible,

232
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:31,559
but then the problem is they got bought by wo signed W sign.

233
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:31,890
Who?

234
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,770
Yeah, they've been, well,

235
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,190
they've been caught doing all sorts of shenanigans repeatedly.

236
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,010
Right. That's the part that is a problem. Right.

237
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,630
It's not just that they did one mistake once

238
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,169
they've been caught multiple times, you know, backdating certificate, dates,

239
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,140
issuing certificates for like the wrong people or

240
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,390
pretty obviously like malicious certificates for various, you know,

241
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,750
large web properties.

242
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,010
Um,

243
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,489
and then they

244
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:56,909
start,

245
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,780
you know, the trust has eroded.

246
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:04,890
That's a really good point is one of the beauties of having a 90 day expiration time

247
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,369
is that even if somebody say gets a google.com wild card out of a decrypt, which

248
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,809
we assume they can't,

249
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,609
but let's say it does happen.

250
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,049
It's only good for 90 days, which, I mean,

251
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,770
by the time you mount your attack and actually get things underway,

252
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,690
you're probably gonna burn at least 30 of those 90 days,

253
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,309
you know, just getting ready.

254
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,479
Whereas when you're getting some of these other certificates

255
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:30,140
from these registrars that are good for years.

256
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,580
That's crazy.

257
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,419
Well, and there is that new, uh, we talked about it a few episodes ago and I just,

258
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:37,739
the name is escaping me, but it's a DNS record type.

259
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,859
Uh, C A cert,

260
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,729
I think is the record type where you can basically specify in your DNS zone file. What

261
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,349
is,

262
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
you know, you're sort of willing to allow,

263
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,559
which

264
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
in theory is great.

265
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,479
But, well, the thing is all the certificate, authorities have to check for that

266
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,020
before they issue a certificate. And

267
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,780
well, and well, you could simply make that a requirement.

268
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,679
Like chrome could say, look, if you don't do that,

269
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,700
we're booting you out and you'd have compliance,

270
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:02,979
you'd have to,

271
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,280
right. And that's kind of one of the things I like about

272
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,359
chrome.

273
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:09,090
And one of the things I also fear a little bit is, you know,

274
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:12,159
Google can use Chrome as a compliance hammer.

275
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,530
They, they can, that's a good point and they are right.

276
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,330
And the same thing with their search results, right?

277
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,989
They're going to be ranking http S higher than HTP now,

278
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,960
which I'm also,

279
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:27,719
well, when you consider all the shenanigans going on with, you know,

280
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,039
state level actors

281
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,760
intercepting and modifying web traffic, you know,

282
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,729
um Fin Fisher, you know,

283
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,200
modifying Binaries on the fly to attack human rights activists.

284
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,559
And Lord knows what else.

285
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:43,599
You know, the reality is you can't do encrypted network traffic anymore.

286
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,900
No, absolutely not. And, and this is one of the things that really just it

287
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,239
Google is doing this

288
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,070
and

289
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:58,710
III I hear various reasons why people think they're doing it from everything from,

290
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:03,510
they don't want their ads modified in flight to just, they're great guys to,

291
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,510
you know, they're concerned about the data. It, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I mean,

292
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,190
I guess at the end of the day this is going to be a good thing regardless of motives.

293
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,669
And so it's, it's probably one of those situations where, you know, maybe,

294
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,830
maybe the ends do justify the means, you know, who cares how we got here?

295
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,950
Well, for myself, it, it basically boils down to is I want a secure web browser,

296
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:27,780
right? I really need that.

297
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,349
And luckily for me, Google's

298
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,760
self interest, for example, in protecting their ad revenue

299
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,669
happens to align with my need for security.

300
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,429
So cool, you know,

301
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,380
I I don't,

302
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,390
in this case care so much why they're doing what they're doing.

303
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,090
I'm just very happy that we have that confluence of,

304
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,559
you know, needs and uh incentives,

305
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:52,909
you know. So I get my really great free secure web browser,

306
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,770
you know.

307
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,679
Um

308
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,849
Yeah, you know, I, I love the fact that they're driving http S,

309
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,619
you know,

310
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:06,140
that's a good thing because uh I, every time I browse the web on my phone, you know,

311
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,179
the ad experience.

312
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,710
Oh my God, it's freaking

313
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:09,940
man.

314
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,169
It's unbelievable

315
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:17,260
time. I use a web browser without an ad blocker. I, I just, I, how do people do that?

316
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,119
I cannot understand. I just, I cannot,

317
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,979
yeah, just the speed alone. Holy.

318
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,849
And just the load time is on the ads. All load.

319
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:27,320
You think,

320
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,820
if you're an ad provider you'd have a huge incentive to load the ads extremely fast.

321
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,330
Right.

322
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,989
Well, part of the problem is they have to go through a broker system to, like, line up,

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,119
you know.

324
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,729
Oh, it's Josh, looking at,

325
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,559
-- you know, pictures of kitty cats. So, we're going to advertise with a
-- puppy

326
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:46,320
wondering what was going to come out there, you know?

327
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,799
Yeah, I had to go to my rolodex of same things.

328
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:51,859
Kittens are safe.

329
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,190
-- Yeah, I forget. What is the rating on our show? Is it PG or just,
-- we

330
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,799
don't have

331
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:56,070
a rating.

332
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:56,989
We're not,

333
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,590
we're not, we're not marked explicit,

334
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,119
we're unrated. So

335
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,380
we'll keep it clean.

336
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,789
Yeah.

337
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,349
Yeah. So,

338
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,929
you know, and that, well, that's, and that kind of, well,

339
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,890
actually that kind of leads to another good

340
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,869
story this week is the whole Kaspersky thing.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
-- Oh, my
-- goodness. That's,

342
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,940
I don't even know what to think about this

343
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,869
because everything just keeps unraveling in bizarre new ways.

344
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,969
And, I mean, just,

345
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,700
-- well,
-- ok, so for those of you that somehow don't know

346
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,770
whatever future

347
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,039
civilization

348
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:33,049
listening to us as a way to determine what the,

349
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,309
-- apologize
-- to

350
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:34,469
them

351
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,479
anyway. So,

352
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,890
uh, Kaspersky Antivirus. Um,

353
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,239
well, two things were cropped up in the news recently.

354
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,169
Number one, the US government has gotten a little bit. Um,

355
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:46,679
how is it? Put

356
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,590
a senator asked a very pointed question that would tend to indicate

357
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,159
that they learned something in an intelligence briefing

358
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,330
that they're not actually allowed to talk about

359
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,250
openly.

360
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,289
And so kind of one of the ways to get around that is to ask a

361
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,820
pointed question that sort of like leads people down the path to like discovery of,

362
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,909
oh my God, you know, here's this horrible thing.

363
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:08,280
Um

364
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,190
And he basically asked an intelligence official, like,

365
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,510
would you allow Kaspersky products to be used on your network?

366
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,380
And the answer was like, no.

367
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,739
Um

368
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:19,270
Well, I guess the sort of second part of that was the whole US,

369
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,820
was it the FBI I think was uh basically went to a bunch of us employees for Kaspersky

370
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,330
uh to ask them questions about like,

371
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,679
how much direction do they get from the mothership and like, what are their,

372
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,719
you know, roles and responsibilities and whatnot?

373
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,700
And then the second big piece of news is sort of that. Well,

374
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:43,219
uh Kaspersky, you know, um works with the FSB, you know, the Russian, former K GB.

375
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,510
And um

376
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,690
the reality is ok.

377
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,890
Well, that, that's going to happen to some degree for all these providers because

378
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,070
Kaspersky doesn't just do a V, right?

379
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,869
They do also sort of security and threat intelligence.

380
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:54,690
Uh D do

381
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,099
s monitoring and mitigation.

382
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,669
Nobody just does A V anymore,

383
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:01,780
right? They all have this suite of

384
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,500
magical products

385
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,940
and I'm using air quotes if you can't tell.

386
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:08,469
Yeah.

387
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,450
And so, yeah, I mean, the reality is any,

388
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,700
you know, if, if you run that kind of threat,

389
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,559
intelligence service chances are you're either going to

390
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,650
be served with warrants for information or,

391
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,250
you know, they're going to be doing an investigation and they're gonna, you know,

392
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,929
want to work with you or vice versa.

393
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,640
You stumble onto something horrible

394
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,650
and you have a need for, you know,

395
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,570
the police to get involved or, well, whatever, you know, level of law enforcement.

396
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,419
But, you know, of course,

397
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,030
the way it's sort of coming out and the way it looks, it doesn't look that great

398
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,469
and, you know, there's just, there's a lot of mistrust right now, obviously.

399
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:46,320
And II, I have, I, I have no idea what the facts of the case are.

400
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,890
Um, it could be completely legit,

401
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,210
like they just work with these guys on those specific things

402
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,299
and it's not a case of like, you know,

403
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,590
Putin forcing them to put back doors in their

404
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,039
A V which are running on 400 million devices.

405
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,890
I have no

406
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:00,750
idea.

407
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,789
The way I look at this is

408
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,260
it is no secret

409
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,219
that the intelligence communities

410
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,839
pretty much around the world don't necessarily get along. Right. There's,

411
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,920
there are nods and handshakes with some groups and there

412
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,739
are other groups that pretend they like each other,

413
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,380
but fundamentally their job isn't to get along.

414
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,900
Right.

415
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:24,040
And

416
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,780
I would be very surprised

417
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,859
if the FSB has

418
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:33,020
Koperski putting in backdoors and things like that. However,

419
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,510
even if

420
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,650
Kaspersky isn't cooperating willfully,

421
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,540
they're in a jurisdiction that's going to

422
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,780
certain information will get to people who,

423
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,880
who want, it will say right

424
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,180
-- to the point their employees can be coerced
-- and

425
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,109
there's many ways. Exactly. There's, there's many ways.

426
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:53,780
And so, I mean,

427
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,550
fundamentally what I think what it comes down

428
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,619
to is if you're an intelligence organization,

429
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,270
regardless of where you are,

430
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,359
you should probably be sticking to security

431
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,339
type products that come from your home country

432
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,020
-- because,
-- or open source ones.

433
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,540
Well, yeah, that's fair. I mean,

434
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:16,869
you can inspect and understand and even, even if it's your home country,

435
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,280
there's nothing stopping other intelligence organizations from, you know,

436
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,349
going to your employees and saying, you know, here's 50 grand

437
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:26,489
Wink Wink, make this happen. It's,

438
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,410
-- it's,
-- it's,

439
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,859
I've kind of never really

440
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,750
having issued about, I think 6000 CV S now.

441
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,410
I, ok, backdoors definitely can be, you know, very, um, hard to find, you know,

442
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,020
and exploitable in a way that's, you know, even looks like normal network traffic.

443
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,729
Right. So that it really is hard to detect.

444
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,609
But the reality is, I mean, most of these products have,

445
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,530
like, they have security flaws.

446
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,170
Well, well,

447
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,260
they have security flaws or they have the equivalent of a back

448
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,369
door that's just like built into the thing as sort of,

449
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,219
you know, command and control or home phone,

450
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:05,160
-- home
-- and a V was pointed out as being particularly terrible for this for two reasons.

451
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,810
Number one, it has to touch all the files on your system

452
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,079
end of story. Otherwise it can't work, right?

453
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,250
And number two,

454
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,250
it gets updates constantly from whatever mothership,

455
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,089
including not just like uh data updates but actual.

456
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,540
Well, like as Tavis Ormandy pointed out, you know, you yeah,

457
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,969
these things stink for security and they need like lots of updates.

458
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:28,040
Um

459
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,839
you know, so new file types, new un packers, blah, blah, blah.

460
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:34,410
So like binary components as opposed to just like, you know,

461
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,319
if it was just some sort of, you know, data file format that could be, you know,

462
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,050
somewhat sort of safe if you have like a trusted binary.

463
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,680
But in this case,

464
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,640
you know, the binaries are like updating themselves all the time.

465
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,520
And uh yeah, so, I mean, if somebody, you know,

466
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,079
were to compromise an antivirus vendor or

467
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,719
coerce them,

468
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,430
uh yeah, I mean, they could, you know,

469
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,550
just literally add an update and be done with it.

470
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,530
I mean, well, and that's,

471
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,599
-- that's what
-- happened in the,

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,630
I don't think, yeah, we'll get to the Ukraine in just a second.

473
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,790
But I think more importantly is I don't think the threat

474
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,739
is necessarily backdoors and malicious updates directly to the organization.

475
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,390
Right? There's, there's ways to distribute backdoor applications,

476
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,630
but my suspicion is anytime an intelligence agency

477
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,699
has an interest in a certain product,

478
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:24,890
they just want data about customers

479
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,290
for, for their own reasons. And that is,

480
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,819
in many instances,

481
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,280
a lot of companies would probably just hand

482
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,609
that over thinking what's this gonna hurt.

483
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:34,150
Right.

484
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:37,369
Well, you legally would have to hand it over. In most cases.

485
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,750
It, it, you know,

486
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:39,260
you've gone,

487
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,400
well, even the US has, um,

488
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,459
uh, was it under the Patriot Act where they could basically serve notices that

489
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,989
you weren't allowed to talk about or even that you had been given one?

490
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:50,410
Right.

491
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,500
And so people started putting up those warrant canaries and blah, blah, blah.

492
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,380
-- And
-- even then I still don't know

493
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,530
many lawyers and other people, I've spoken with. It sounds like they,

494
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,180
as part of the Pfizer request, they can tell you keep updating the warrant canary.

495
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:05,869
Right?

496
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,589
-- And that
-- seems reasonable because honestly, as a judge, if, if I was a judge, I could,

497
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,020
an argument that's saying that, like, look,

498
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,849
we're going to serve this organization with a warrant and they're going to drop

499
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,219
their warrant canary and everybody's going to know we serve them with a warrant

500
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:21,719
and we can't have that happening because of these reasons or, you know,

501
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:24,000
we just can't tell you national security, whatever.

502
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,420
There's a valid argument to be made there in some cases right now,

503
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,520
whether or not it flies.

504
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,130
-- I have no idea.
-- I'm not going to touch that with a 10 ft pole.

505
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,119
Let's talk about the Ukraine.

506
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,089
Something

507
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:36,319
more exciting.

508
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,569
Yeah. Accounting software which, you know, everybody loves to hate,

509
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,459
-- um, I guess, except for accountants who just generally hate
-- it, but more,

510
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,439
more bizarrely is it sounds like what 80% of businesses

511
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:51,359
in the Ukraine use the same piece of software.

512
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,109
That makes sense because,

513
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,219
have you ever read the tax code?

514
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,339
-- Unfortunately,
-- my accountant once showed me,

515
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:03,119
my accountant once showed me the abridged yearly update of the Canadian tax code

516
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,479
-- and it was like a phone book.
-- It's, it's enormous

517
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:06,609
how

518
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,250
many things are

519
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,030
-- about
-- the size of a novel.

520
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,989
And that was the abridged kind of important changes. And

521
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:14,000
that's the thing with tax software, right?

522
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,260
Like nobody's ever going to make open

523
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,930
source tax software because nobody is ever going

524
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:22,390
to figure out all those business and tax rules and put them into a computer.

525
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,920
-- So
-- actually I had something interesting, I, I learned a long time ago is,

526
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,479
I guess in the U si, don't know if this is true everywhere,

527
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:34,739
but the IRS apparently has like a, a standardized data format

528
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,469
that they send to the accounting software companies.

529
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:41,270
And I don't, I don't know if it's free or you have to buy it from them. But,

530
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,900
but essentially they found a way to, like, programmatically

531
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,030
explain what the changes are in the tax code.

532
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,849
And then obviously

533
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:50,180
that makes

534
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,930
-- sense
-- because you'd have way less errors because probably,

535
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,410
I mean, part of it is, right? Is

536
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,969
there's always that, you know, well,

537
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:58,469
it's like generally accepted accounting principles

538
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,170
there's a lot of wiggle room

539
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,150
and like, you know, all of the companies that do Gap,

540
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,989
they're not generally doing anything even remotely illegal, but holy cow,

541
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,170
some of the wiggle room in there,

542
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,170
you know what some of these companies do is like, wow, you know,

543
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,339
I did not know you deduct pandas,

544
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,780
like, like, you know,

545
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,800
thing you do is right. The lunchroom is R and D, you know.

546
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,979
No, I'm familiar with these.

547
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,310
So, I mean,

548
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:24,869
but

549
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,530
fundamentally with software, like,

550
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,439
I'm not surprised at all in some countries that there's

551
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,839
only one or two software providers for this stuff because

552
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,550
there's really that,

553
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,349
I mean, to, to maintain this software, you know, it's, it's an,

554
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,020
I can't even imagine because there's, you know, yearly updates at a minimum or,

555
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,430
you know, whenever they pass a new law

556
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,089
that can affect the tax code

557
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,599
or the way taxes are held or,

558
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,050
you know, uh, wages, right?

559
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,680
Because the thing to remember too is accounting software is not just about taxes.

560
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:54,089
Typically this stuff is also doing your payroll,

561
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,500
your accounts receivable.

562
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,869
You think the Ukraine is not a giant market,

563
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,170
right? It's, it's not like the US where it, it's

564
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,689
huge. Right.

565
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:04,260
Yeah.

566
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,119
So there probably just isn't room for more than one company to be making the, like,

567
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,760
official tech software of the Ukraine.

568
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:12,810
Yeah.

569
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:17,150
Yeah. Well, and like, yeah, in general it doesn't really translate to

570
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,699
any other country because of course,

571
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,650
the tax code is going to be completely different.

572
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,729
Um, but yeah, so basically they me doc, the, the accounting

573
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,050
software firm got popped

574
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:31,800
and, you know, sent out a malicious update and apparently their whole

575
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:35,630
coding infrastructure and signing infrastructure was just in shambles.

576
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,359
And so, yeah, I mean,

577
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,699
when you think about it, right.

578
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:42,359
Uh, it reminds me of, um, did you ever hear about those Bloomberg terminals?

579
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,069
I do know about the Bloomberg terminals, which is actually how Bloomberg,

580
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:50,079
the company makes most of their money.

581
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:50,839
Yeah.

582
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,630
Well, how about you explain it then?

583
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,239
Ok.

584
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,079
So, uh,

585
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:57,819
the Bloomberg organization which obviously is involved in Wall

586
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,130
Street and there's what they have a TV station,

587
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,069
I think, and there's a magazine and,

588
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,489
and I think they do some investing.

589
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:11,329
II, I don't know exactly. Anyway, but the real thing they do is

590
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,770
if you are involved in Wall Street,

591
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,109
you get these terminals that kind of connect you to the

592
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,910
various brokerage houses and various information about what's going on.

593
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:25,229
And, yeah, they're just these, these wacky little boxes that you,

594
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:28,109
you pay and we say a lot of money for

595
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,709
and, and then you get the right to kind of use them for,

596
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,709
for various financial transactions and,

597
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,589
and news

598
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,540
and it's, it's like a huge deal, right?

599
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,060
If you do not have one of these, it either means you're small or dumb

600
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:44,280
-- and that's kind of the way you
-- basically don't get to play

601
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:47,439
playing fields. Everybody else.

602
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,229
-- So, good
-- luck. Right. Right. So, what about the Bloomberg terminals though?

603
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,280
What is your story?

604
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,699
Well, so basically the, somebody was pointing out that these things, you know,

605
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:59,920
they're plunked right into the center of every financial network on the planet.

606
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,250
Right. You can't,

607
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,339
you can't like firewall them up, you can't

608
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,979
restrict access to them

609
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,020
and they have this like connection back to the mothership,

610
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:11,270
you know, to get the data and what not?

611
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,469
Well, isn't that what happened to swift way back in the day?

612
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:18,010
Is there was a bank using like a netgear router or something?

613
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,060
It was, oh, no worse than that. It was the, it's even better.

614
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,930
They were buying second hand it, equipment. Oh, yes,

615
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,400
I would.

616
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,380
And

617
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,020
so,

618
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,209
yeah,

619
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,890
I think it was Netgear and some of

620
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,599
their printers got popped or were already infected.

621
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:32,839
Maybe I'm not, I don't remember entirely.

622
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,750
But, yeah, I guess the moral of the story is

623
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,770
regardless of if you buy first hand or second hand equipment,

624
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,530
but especially if you buy second hand equipment,

625
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,229
you really got to wipe that stuff before you use it.

626
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,800
No, don't buy second hand equipment

627
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,739
-- if you're comfortable saying that just kind of in general if, even if you're,
-- well,

628
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:54,609
I think the problem is people forget like, printers are not printers anymore.

629
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,800
-- Printers are computers with like a printer attached to them.
-- Right.

630
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,069
Don't, don't sell your gear and don't buy someone else's gear. I mean, for real.

631
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:02,939
Yeah.

632
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:04,270
I mean, if you're going to buy first hand,

633
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,939
you have a better chance of getting legitimate

634
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,449
stuff that doesn't have like wacky viruses or

635
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:12,839
we're talking about the Ukraine. So what happened with this account?

636
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,750
So, Me Doc, they were the, they were the spread of the PEO

637
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,560
virus

638
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,170
or not Petya

639
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,119
or whatever that's called,

640
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:19,619
called

641
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,319
ransomware,

642
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,989
whatever the ransomware thing that,

643
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:24,550
that's not ransomware.

644
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:26,199
You know, it was, it

645
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,410
between the me doc and what Petya did.

646
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,949
It really is beginning to look like, you know,

647
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,449
a nation state level attack on the Ukraine

648
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:35,410
probably.

649
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,650
And, and you know what I love though

650
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,449
is

651
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,099
there are tons of people who are talking about these,

652
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,050
this company didn't sign their software and they weren't distributed correctly.

653
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:46,280
We were

654
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,930
doing this and they weren't doing that and

655
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,619
it probably wouldn't have mattered. I, I won't disagree.

656
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,640
But then, you know, what really got me thinking is,

657
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:55,729
so let's say I'm a small company and I'm running

658
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,089
accounting software.

659
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,699
Where am I going to even go

660
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:04,219
to get advice about how to sign and distribute my software?

661
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,050
Um Microsoft actually has really good documentation on that

662
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,530
seriously because I was looking, I actually had that exact question.

663
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,829
I'm like, you know, I, I know

664
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,869
I know how uh R PM signing works because

665
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,709
I've had to do it uh

666
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,589
the pain, but it's not fun.

667
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:23,469
It works, but it's not fun getting it.

668
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,910
It's one of those classic clinic things where you get it set up and then, like,

669
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,890
don't touch it

670
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,189
because it will break horribly.

671
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:30,010
Um,

672
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:31,939
I'm

673
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,489
going with this though. Ok.

674
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,630
So Microsoft having good docs kind of ruins my story a little.

675
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,739
-- That's ok. That's
-- ok.

676
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:38,979
But

677
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,229
you have to know those docs are there and you have

678
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,500
more than that, you have to read them and then do it correctly.

679
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,069
But here's the thing is if you're working with an app store

680
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,939
solves these problems for you. Right.

681
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,380
Well, it depends where the signing happens because fundamentally

682
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,420
here's the thing signing doesn't really matter if you can just

683
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,949
like take over a workstation of a programmer and inject some code in there

684
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,430
and they have insufficient code reviews or

685
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:06,900
there's OK.

686
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,670
So a great example,

687
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,540
remember we had the core infrastructure guy on talking about

688
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,239
security and the best practices and that sort of whole,

689
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,099
you know, they've got that whole nice document with the maturity model.

690
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,300
David A Wheeler. Yeah. And

691
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,800
so what was the like, I think it was the first thing there was uses source control

692
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,109
because a lot of people still don't.

693
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:27,640
And I don't mean like,

694
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,900
I'm not talking like use a CV S or some like terrible source control.

695
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,599
We're talking like

696
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:35,579
no source control. Like there's a folder

697
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,630
shared over Samba or whatever. You know,

698
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,030
I I've actually seen that like where a place had a white board

699
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,969
to kind of control access or

700
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,310
essentially the white board was the locking mechanism

701
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,890
for the shared folder on the server.

702
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,770
Uh They went out of business about a year later. So, not super surprising.

703
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,560
Yeah, I'm, I'm shocked,

704
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,619
you know,

705
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:58,099
source control is tricky and I mean, it's not like there's a ton of free

706
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,579
services out there,

707
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,270
github. I'm

708
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,619
OK. Ok. I'm gonna say I'm like, it's so cheap at this point.

709
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:05,270
It's

710
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,130
what else actually comes up a fair bit is

711
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,910
hiding your source code I don't think is nearly

712
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,219
as exciting or interesting as people think it is

713
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,920
because, I mean, let's face it. No one's really going to steal your stuff.

714
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:20,439
If they did, they probably still can't build it anyway because, you know,

715
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,380
you build infrastructure is a disaster.

716
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,040
Yeah.

717
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,839
The one thing I've seen where people do consistently sort of

718
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,170
need to have their source code secret is all the DEV

719
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,459
-- ops people because they put all their tokens and passwords in there
-- that is wrong.

720
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:33,650
If they're doing that, there are

721
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,180
-- ways
-- to destroy

722
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:35,750
secrets

723
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:40,630
and, and if that's your excuse, that's, that's almost acceptable.

724
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,040
But yeah, whatever. I mean,

725
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:47,290
here's, here's my point though, back during a developer's workstation

726
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,209
is

727
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,170
it, it's not undoable, but it's difficult.

728
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,609
But if you look at the vast majority of attacks up to this point,

729
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,489
-- it has been during the distribution cycle against a lot of software because,
-- well,

730
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,469
because most of them have such a poor security,

731
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:05,130
-- right?
-- It's, it's not signed or there's mirrors. I mean, I remember,

732
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,199
oh, I forget,

733
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:10,800
I don't remember what the last last project was that this happened to. But

734
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,829
they, they basically go after mirrors and replace, you know, like the tar ball

735
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:15,410
-- and
-- hand on

736
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,119
that.

737
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,800
-- Right.
-- They just

738
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,630
like, yeah, if people check the check some, it wouldn't know,

739
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,260
checked out but nobody checks it.

740
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:23,010
So,

741
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,180
you know.

742
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:26,599
Well, it's like every time I get a doc file from somebody,

743
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:27,930
I run it through virus total.

744
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:32,439
And what really shocks me is when I get like a doc file from like, um

745
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,119
for example, on the CV side of things, you know, miter

746
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,609
sends out doc files

747
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:37,589
and you know,

748
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,810
I won't get around to reading them for three or four days and then

749
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll run it through virus total and I'm the first one to do it.

750
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,859
And that just horrifies me that, you know,

751
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,729
these people are opening up doc files and trusting the local antivirus

752
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,760
because, you know, this is like a mailing list you could, I mean, this isn't like

753
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,209
these are just doc files flying around, you know,

754
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:55,479
with Lord knows what in them because

755
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,150
you know, it's not like we use some super secure transport mechanism or anything,

756
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,420
right?

757
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,699
And

758
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,540
every time somebody mails me a PDF, right?

759
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,119
And I have to open it, you know, I grit my teeth,

760
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,619
run it through virus total and then open it in like Google docs.

761
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:08,969
No, man, I get it, uh,

762
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:13,109
Google docs is where all word files or presentations

763
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,969
or PDF S are literally anything I get go

764
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:16,959
because

765
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,849
I love it. It's their problem. I don't have to think about it.

766
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:23,969
It's like, got a virus, don't care. Google can deal with it. And

767
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,449
it, it, it's amazing. And

768
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,050
part of me wonders what kind of garbage they must see on a daily basis and I think

769
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:32,400
they bought

770
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,459
virus total. Remember they do own virus total. And it got to be just horrifying.

771
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:42,250
What, what goes through their systems on a daily basis. I mean, not even on purpose.

772
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,489
-- Right. Just people
-- doing

773
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,189
another argument I have against antivirus, which is

774
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,099
antivirus will definitely catch the older stuff and help you maybe with clean up,

775
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,449
but it won't

776
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,229
protect you from a targeted or other sort of zero

777
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,680
day attack until you have a signature for it.

778
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,969
And if it's a targeted attack you, you're not going to get a signature for it.

779
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:04,540
And if it's,

780
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,550
you know, if you're close to patient zero,

781
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,369
I hope those signatures come out in a few minutes or hours because

782
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,739
that's how long these viruses take to spread now,

783
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,959
you know? But here's the thing, even the old viruses, like,

784
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,180
no, it doesn't count.

785
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,449
I

786
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:20,550
mean, like two or three

787
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:20,829
days

788
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,459
old. And, well, yeah, and the detection rates for a lot of this stuff were like,

789
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:25,650
I

790
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,250
just, I remember some of them, I think it was like, 50% or 60.

791
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,770
It's like 20 or 30% I think.

792
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,130
Cases. And

793
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,060
you have to think at that point

794
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,699
you're probably wasting more money on this software and the lost

795
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,550
-- resources.
-- Just think of the electricity and CPU cycles.

796
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:44,589
I hate to see. That's why I got rid of antivirus on my laptop.

797
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,300
It just, I got back about a half hour battery life,

798
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,790
at least. Maybe more.

799
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,300
Yeah, it's,

800
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,219
yeah. II, I don't like antivirus. I'm, I'm not gonna even pretend,

801
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:57,619
I,

802
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:02,400
-- I think
-- antivirus makes sense on file and email servers

803
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,140
but on end points it's kind of too late.

804
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,020
Yes.

805
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,949
Yes, it is.

806
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:08,040
Anyway,

807
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
whatever Google Docs saves a day.

808
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,020
What were you talking about?

809
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,020
Ukraine?

810
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:13,958
Well, yeah.

811
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,379
So, yeah, I mean, fundamentally these, you know, well,

812
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,550
you talked about the App Store and that definitely will, you know,

813
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,219
once it gets into the App store

814
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,379
it's highly, you know, I really, um,

815
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,938
how do I phrase this correctly?

816
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,530
A

817
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,978
proper app store that does something like say Google or Apple

818
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,438
is probably very, very safe, you know,

819
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,070
I assume they're using HS MS hardware security modules and all that.

820
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,580
Jazz.

821
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,620
The, the my understanding is though in the Google Android app ecosystem,

822
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:44,270
-- there are those like not Google app stores,
-- man, Amazon has one of those.

823
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,510
It, it drives me crazy. It's, it's, yeah, don't, don't use alternative app stores.

824
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,810
They're just a bad idea.

825
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,139
Well,

826
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:54,129
sometimes you have to because my understanding is some of the phone manufacturers,

827
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:54,409
you know,

828
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,010
set it up so that you have to use their app store because they want

829
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,260
to monetize that stuff and get their cut of the money and all that.

830
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,439
And I don't know of any phones

831
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:00,560
on

832
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:01,860
that, but if they are,

833
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,129
that's a bad phone manufacturer and please don't buy their phones.

834
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,040
It's, it's just a bad idea. This is where I know Apple gets a lot of guff

835
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,000
because they have their, their devices so locked down. But you know what? It's,

836
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:20,070
I think it's the right thing to do and, and I used to not think that, but I totally do.

837
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:20,989
-- You
-- know,

838
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,030
honestly,

839
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,639
for non it people,

840
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:26,280
what else can we do

841
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:28,290
that? Like my,

842
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,100
like my six year old kids, what, what are, you know, you're gonna tell my,

843
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,060
you're gonna teach my six year old kids to, like,

844
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:37,600
choose the app store safely and somehow,

845
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,739
you know,

846
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,560
you can't teach a six year old to

847
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:40,879
safe

848
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,600
in this man

849
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:41,909
I

850
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,570
use,

851
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,639
you know.

852
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:47,070
Yeah, my kids are starting to try to, like,

853
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,639
find their own Minecraft mods and things on their own.

854
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,300
And I'm just thinking this is,

855
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,820
there's no end of this story that doesn't involve their computer getting a virus.

856
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,820
Like, that's just the way it's going to be.

857
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,439
And I know it is and I'm going to harp on them and I'm going to do everything.

858
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:03,939
But at the end of the day, like

859
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:06,060
that's just what's going to happen

860
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,750
and there's nothing I can do about it.

861
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:10,139
How do I,

862
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:14,300
uh because, yeah, my one son wants to play Minecraft with MODS on a PC.

863
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,850
So I'm thinking a virtual machine.

864
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,040
But then graphics performance and in general, like,

865
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,229
-- or do I just image the drive and wipe
-- it?

866
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,550
Suck it up and get the computer?

867
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:24,459
-- That's what you're
-- going to

868
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,080
-- do.
-- Well, yeah. But no, but I'll have to re

869
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,669
like, I'm,

870
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,479
-- I'm just going to reimage it. Maybe
-- you're gonna

871
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:28,620
have

872
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:28,949
to

873
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,290
every

874
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:29,570
now

875
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:29,899
and then

876
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,139
it,

877
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,040
that's all you can do

878
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,510
because just, I haven't used windows in so long and I bought those windows,

879
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,219
10 tablets.

880
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:38,010
Oh, lordy. I just, the,

881
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,090
the upgrades,

882
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,290
-- they're so painful and
-- slow,

883
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,739
-- but at least they get upgrades.
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

884
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,340
Well, to be blunt, that's why I will never buy an android device because again,

885
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,320
in Canada, you know, I can't get an unlocked,

886
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:51,169
proper android device

887
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,489
there is, you know, and so I just, I'll get, like, if I'm lucky, like, six months

888
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,989
a year of updates and then oops, like, too bad.

889
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,409
I know. And most people don't care.

890
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:00,610
You know,

891
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,120
here's the thing though too is there's all these unpatched android devices but

892
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,520
nothing's really on fire,

893
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,449
which I suspect has more to do with the App Store ecosystem than anything.

894
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,610
I suspect part of it is they don't,

895
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,260
most of them don't have enough upstream bandwidth to do.

896
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,070
Anything? Terribly terrible.

897
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,239
Well, not only that, the vast majority of people I know who use devices,

898
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,719
they aren't like browsing the web.

899
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:25,899
They're running crappy apps and,

900
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,689
and generally speaking in that environment it's a

901
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:31,610
lot harder to attack that system because,

902
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:35,520
you know, crappy apps aren't going to random websites in many instances.

903
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,479
So,

904
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,320
yeah.

905
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,379
Well, actually that's something Apple's locking down is, is apps that are self

906
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,689
modifying. Like they have their own, built an update mechanism.

907
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,489
Uh, they're, they're booting that, which I totally,

908
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,050
totally love because my kids wanted this one app

909
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,889
and it's a Russian cartoon character called Booba.

910
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:53,010
Remember the one you thought was Nightmare

911
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:53,739
Fuel is

912
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,060
Nightmare.

913
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,129
Anyways, the app is like,

914
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,610
it starts and it's like downloading 80 megabytes from some server in Russia.

915
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,520
And I'm like, you know,

916
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:06,979
please wait while we configure your accounting software.

917
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:07,790
Yeah.

918
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,520
So, I mean, I, again, you know,

919
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,139
with Apple totally locking down and owning the ecosystem

920
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:15,020
on the one hand as an open source guy,

921
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,550
I absolutely abhor and object to it.

922
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,389
But on the flip side, what else am I going to do with my six year olds?

923
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,129
I, I totally get it.

924
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,570
And this is the, yeah, the,

925
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,310
the open source zealot in me is walking a fine line today and,

926
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,229
and I don't know where it all ends

927
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,620
because

928
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,780
I love that aspect of freedom.

929
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,699
But like, I want freedom for me.

930
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,199
I don't want it for my Children who

931
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,260
are going to download viruses under their computer.

932
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,739
Right.

933
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,810
Give them a walled garden. Don't let them touch things.

934
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:44,739
Yeah.

935
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:45,639
Yeah, exactly.

936
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:46,120
You know, that's,

937
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:49,820
there's a reason we put fences around playgrounds when they're by a busy road,

938
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,379
kids are idiots.

939
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:56,409
It will be glorious when there are self driving cars

940
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,030
and,

941
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,449
and they just don't run over the Children

942
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,209
anymore.

943
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,129
But maybe the kangaroos

944
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:03,739
kangaroos.

945
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Yeah. Apparently Volvos don't know what to do with kangaroos.

946
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,090
The self driving Volvos. They're ok with like moose and deer and stuff.

947
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
But apparently kangaroos just confuse the, well,

948
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,699
think about it from a, from a,

949
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,110
it's like that. Well, ok. And,

950
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,169
uh,

951
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,540
what was it, those cameras that have the face detection

952
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,439
and they didn't work on

953
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,919
dark skinned people

954
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:27,800
because I guess in Asia, like when, yeah, when you test them it's,

955
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,510
or?

956
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah. Well, yeah, China, basically

957
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,560
because we also, you're going to go get electronics from anymore.

958
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:34,919
Um,

959
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,350
yeah, I, oh, man, what did I find the other day?

960
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,070
It was something electronic and it was old

961
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,620
enough that it was actually made in Canada.

962
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,510
I

963
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,780
-- was really old. It's amazing.
-- I forget what it was

964
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,389
something we were throwing out,

965
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,620
right?

966
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,229
E cycle. That stuff.

967
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,159
We, you and I live in northern

968
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,750
regions of the world

969
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,070
and obviously we get snow in the winter, which, which is terrible.

970
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:04,939
But, uh, Ford

971
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,090
is in Michigan, which is also northern, right?

972
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:12,820
And I, I remember I was reading some things and said a lot of these self driving cars,

973
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,149
they were

974
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,580
as soon as they got to kind of the north where, where we are

975
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,479
and it was winter time.

976
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:23,479
They started flipping out because they, you know,

977
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,790
like all of the testing was happening in

978
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,120
southern California where they don't get snow.

979
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,360
They, they don't like, apparently the,

980
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,439
there's that, well, not only that, I don't know,

981
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:38,560
do they spray the salt down on the road before it snows where you live?

982
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:40,300
Right? Or

983
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:41,250
you get

984
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:44,949
like white lines, if the road is dry, right?

985
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:48,750
Because they spray the salt and now you have like six white lines down the road.

986
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,020
Oh, they don't generally prep,

987
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:53,520
they, the strategy here generally is when it starts snowing,

988
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,209
then they start a little bit of salting and sanding.

989
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:58,169
So you get what we call oatmeal, right?

990
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:01,409
It's where the snow is kind of that mushy brown. It's kind of

991
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:05,530
smooshed up with the salt and it's a bit more liquidy and it's got the sand in it.

992
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,489
So you actually get somewhat decent traction.

993
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,889
The downside being, of course, if it like freezes to the road, you are of the creek.

994
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:14,469
Well, but the point is around here now

995
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,310
they spray this stuff on the road.

996
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,889
You end up with all these basically white lines

997
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,419
and, and the self driving car is like,

998
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,540
flipped out because they're like six white lines.

999
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,909
What do I do? You know?

1000
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,850
-- And it's
-- just really get over to the right,

1001
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,330
-- I pulled over, I can't pull over
-- anymore.

1002
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,649
Well, I mean, at least on the plus side, I believe many of these self driving cars,

1003
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,479
at least

1004
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,439
just don't they, they pull over when something crazy happens.

1005
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,760
-- But
-- here's something to remember. Right.

1006
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,419
The thing with the self driving cars and software is

1007
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:46,550
they're going to encounter problems

1008
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,209
and they're going to fix them

1009
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:50,459
and they will generally stay fixed.

1010
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,209
Today. I was driving, I was in the left hand lane.

1011
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,709
There was a left hand turn lane and another like a right hand lane.

1012
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,810
So essentially two lanes going straight and one lane for the left turners.

1013
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,770
This lady in a huge SUV was in the right hand lane,

1014
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:04,919
uh, as it turns out, she was on her phone,

1015
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:07,820
I guess getting directions because she was in the right hand lane at a

1016
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,860
red light started signaling to turn left

1017
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,610
and then started pulling into the intersection,

1018
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:14,870
right

1019
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,419
and then there was another car, uh, different light. About five minutes later, a

1020
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,110
car from out of province, uh, the advanced green, uh, left turn light came on.

1021
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:28,860
Uh, so basically you have a red light to go straight because

1022
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:32,770
both of the oncoming things are getting an advanced left turn,

1023
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,750
you know, so they can basically clear out the left turn lanes. Awesome.

1024
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,110
Uh, and I guess he kind of thought that flashing green arrow meant go.

1025
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:40,669
Um,

1026
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:44,340
so he got halfway into the intersection before everybody started honking at him.

1027
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,260
And luckily the oncoming traffic was, like, smart enough to be like, oh,

1028
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,850
-- there's a car coming through but, like,
-- he

1029
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:49,669
probably should turn

1030
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:50,010
left.

1031
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,340
He stopped and then he actually kind of backed up a bit.

1032
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:54,489
Um,

1033
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:56,260
-- yeah,
-- but I mean,

1034
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:57,100
yeah, it's just,

1035
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:00,760
if a self driving car does that, it will make the news

1036
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,399
and they will fix it.

1037
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:05,620
Yes. Right. That's the reality.

1038
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,860
That's the difference between self driving cars and people,

1039
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:11,020
you know, Volvo. Oh, they don't know how to deal with kangaroos personally.

1040
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,439
I'm ok with that. I live in Canada.

1041
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:15,159
If you ever end up having to deal with the kangaroo while driving,

1042
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,580
go buy a lottery ticket.

1043
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:19,469
Where did, where did that happen?

1044
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,909
It was Austria. I think so.

1045
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:27,100
Like the joke in Austria, because Austria and Australia are sort of similar looking

1046
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:27,449
the

1047
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,219
same. And so the joke in Austria is there are no kangaroos in Austria.

1048
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:32,739
Right.

1049
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,330
Because, well, it's a western northern European country

1050
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:42,110
and, uh, actually it turns out a kangaroo got loose once from the zoo.

1051
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:44,750
And so there was a kangaroo in Austria and of course,

1052
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,729
it was huge news as you can imagine as a kangaroo in Austria would be.

1053
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,729
But it's uh however, but so this is a really good point actually. And this is,

1054
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,050
this is probably a good topic for us to dwell on for a minute and,

1055
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,889
and end it because it's, it's

1056
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,610
a great one but it's,

1057
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,540
they're always going to be one of weird anomalies that happen in any environment.

1058
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:05,699
Right?

1059
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,340
Be it self driving cars, be it your, your local infrastructure,

1060
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,909
be it the software you're developing.

1061
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,689
We're like, you know, you've got that, that, that case statement with the, you know,

1062
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:16,000
if you ever reach here something terrible has happened, it's like, yeah,

1063
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,899
someday you're gonna get there.

1064
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:19,320
Right. It happens. It always

1065
00:44:19,544 --> 00:44:20,054
happens.

1066
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:21,485
-- You
-- have an exception handler

1067
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:22,864
and, and just like in

1068
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:23,195
software,

1069
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:23,794
right?

1070
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:27,054
Everything went horribly wrong and somehow your network stack disappeared,

1071
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:27,705
right?

1072
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:32,685
And, and that's the thing is you have to, I I'm not saying you have to necessarily

1073
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:35,594
gracefully handle those situations,

1074
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,735
but I think you need to be prepared for them

1075
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,485
and, and it's kind of one of those,

1076
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,600
this is a good question because what is a safe, fail safe?

1077
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,419
Right? Because for

1078
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:47,340
-- example, like the
-- situation, right.

1079
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:48,389
Exactly.

1080
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:52,159
You know, and, and what actually really got me as a good argument for A I was

1081
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,159
uh there's a really good TED talk on this that we add in the show notes.

1082
00:44:55,169 --> 00:44:58,760
But essentially they were talking about with A I like, how do you make the A A I

1083
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,199
sort of behave safely and rationally but not like too much.

1084
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:05,969
Because for example, in a self driving car, you probably want to be able to say like,

1085
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:07,239
stop, I need to get out.

1086
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,379
But do you want your like six year old to be able to do that on the highway.

1087
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:12,840
Right.

1088
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,989
So, you know, like the, the,

1089
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,050
the self driving car maybe needs to take into

1090
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,820
account things like who's giving me the order,

1091
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,459
kind of what's the context of this, you know, much like a human would.

1092
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:21,639
And,

1093
00:45:22,729 --> 00:45:23,510
um, anyway,

1094
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,510
the TED talk was talking about how the one of the solutions they were kind of

1095
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,610
working on and had found to this was to make the A I uncertain of the problem

1096
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,149
so that it kind of had to take a more fuzzy approach,

1097
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:38,439
kind of like, well humans.

1098
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,889
Um and that they'd actually had some really good success with this. And so

1099
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,040
again,

1100
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,050
you know,

1101
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,669
people are going to publish papers on this, this, you know,

1102
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,090
there's going to be questions on what self-driving

1103
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,889
dot stack overflow.com or whatever the site is,

1104
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:52,909
you know, like, oh,

1105
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,629
I'm working on a self driving car, but I'm having a lot of trouble with those like,

1106
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,340
you know, those random airline crashes or whatever bizarre media rights, you know,

1107
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,649
like, uh any recommendations, you know,

1108
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:05,080
and there'll be an answer

1109
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:13,020
that's horrifying to me to think that there, there's going to be self-driving

1110
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:15,159
forums where people

1111
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,149
-- help each other out
-- and

1112
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,020
everybody

1113
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,060
thinks, oh, those software programs,

1114
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,129
-- they're professionals and they don't cut and paste
-- code.

1115
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:24,959
Everybody cut and paste code doesn't matter who you are, everybody does it,

1116
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,520
everybody doesn't, I'm not gonna even pretend and, and I even

1117
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:30,350
man, I just, I did it this weekend.

1118
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,979
I was, I was working on something I was trying to,

1119
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,060
I was trying to prove that a certain thing could be done, right?

1120
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,679
And this is vaguely work related

1121
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:39,389
and I didn't know anything about what I was doing.

1122
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,149
And

1123
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,489
yeah, I like I hit a point where I needed PHP to print out the headers that,

1124
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,270
that it had received from the browser.

1125
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,030
You know what I did?

1126
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,020
I just went to snack over phone and type in PHP

1127
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,949
print headers and I literally copy and pasted the first answer.

1128
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:52,780
I found,

1129
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:52,959
I

1130
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,469
didn't even look at it. I thought this, this is fine.

1131
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,629
It's like knowing the capital of

1132
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,510
most countries now. I Wikipedia.

1133
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,100
Right. What's the, here's the question, what's the population of the Ukraine?

1134
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,969
I didn't know I looked it up. It's like, what, 43 million or something?

1135
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,100
Is it that I wouldn't have put it that high?

1136
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,899
It's a reasonably dense European country,

1137
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,219
I think for certain things, depending on what you do for a living.

1138
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,820
It's, it's good to have sort of some general knowledge.

1139
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,169
But yeah, like a lot of these specifics.

1140
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:21,659
Yeah, I,

1141
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:25,419
I actively try not to remember certain things now because I know how to look them up.

1142
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,209
-- So why would I try to shove that into my brain?
-- I have to try,

1143
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,739
I don't have to try anymore.

1144
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,060
I just don't.

1145
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,510
Oh man. Anyway, anyway, we were talking about,

1146
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:36,870
er, states

1147
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,409
and problems and, and this is,

1148
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:42,919
this is one of the places, hopefully a I can get it right.

1149
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:46,030
Because if you look at the vast majority of security issues,

1150
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,610
it's basically mishandled errors.

1151
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,239
Right.

1152
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,719
And, and more often than not,

1153
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:55,110
-- that is what happened
-- or it was uncertainty in what we sort of meant,

1154
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:59,469
you know, like a lot of encryption stuff, a lot of the flaws boil down to.

1155
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,889
Oh, well, now that we've actually built and deployed this and used it and poked at it.

1156
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:06,449
Now we've learned Xy and Z,

1157
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,870
you know, things like Poodle or Ghost where it's like, oh, there's these clever

1158
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,169
ish attacks, you know, like

1159
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,129
uh protocol downgrade, like, oh, you know, we want

1160
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:16,439
two devices

1161
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,370
to somehow find a compatible protocol to talk.

1162
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,449
Right. That's a good thing.

1163
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:22,370
Well,

1164
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:24,080
it turns out that's actually a really tricky

1165
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,129
-- problem to get right from a security
-- perspective

1166
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,250
idea.

1167
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,679
And I, I hate saying that but it, it, I

1168
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,689
tend to agree

1169
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,520
with stakes.

1170
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,040
I, yeah, I think we're too kind to old software.

1171
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,760
We, it's hopefully getting better.

1172
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,419
But again, this is, this is one of those places that I'm hopeful that that kind of,

1173
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:45,620
some of the A I type things will,

1174
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:50,679
will be able to deal with this whereas static software cannot.

1175
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,330
Yeah. No, I mean, it's,

1176
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,120
yeah, I suspect in 2030 years

1177
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,419
software that is not to some degree self

1178
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,080
modifying or self improving or better yet working as a collective. Like,

1179
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:03,570
you know,

1180
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,729
this web server over here saw this weird condition and figured out how to deal

1181
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:10,209
with it and then it kind of shared that with the rest of the ecosystem.

1182
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:12,870
Yeah, I suspect that's, well, it's like the open source world. Right?

1183
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:15,429
To me it's weird that all these poor close source guys have to, like,

1184
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,090
re invent the wheel in house all the time.

1185
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:21,520
Uh, nobody does it anymore because everybody just uses open source now.

1186
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,239
I mean,

1187
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:22,959
it's

1188
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,120
open source one. You're using it

1189
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,449
whether you know it or not.

1190
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,320
Uh, actually Black Duck, we should, we should go over that. Maybe, maybe next time.

1191
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:32,340
Uh,

1192
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,129
they just put a report out this week talking about

1193
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,219
just some of their findings on open source software use and

1194
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,780
it's basically what you'd expect. Everyone's using it.

1195
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,860
No one's updating it and, and everything's terrible.

1196
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:44,659
Which,

1197
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:45,459
ok.

1198
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,209
Well, I like this.

1199
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:50,280
I mean, software updating is, you know, that's never, uh, yeah,

1200
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,860
that's a problem that's never going to go away.

1201
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,590
It's just an economic issue. Right? People also don't update their hardware, their

1202
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,209
everything, right? Why spend money on stuff that's not broken.

1203
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:01,770
Yes.

1204
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,179
Why,

1205
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,300
why spend money on stuff that's not broken because we need jobs card. That's why

1206
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,649
I think we'll have jobs regardless.

1207
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:10,129
Oh,

1208
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,830
I know. I know.

1209
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:12,800
It's,
