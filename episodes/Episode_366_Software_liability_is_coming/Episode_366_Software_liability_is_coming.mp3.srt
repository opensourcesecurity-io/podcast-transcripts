Hello and welcome to the open source podcast

1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,300
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in the millennial Paz Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,710
You got it wrong. We're the open source security podcast. What did I say?

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,010
You said the open source podcast.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,020
I'm not going to let you redo it like that.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,469
It's

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,250
too late, it's too

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:22,579
-- late.
-- There still

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,719
be that pause there.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,770
-- What's the
-- millennial pause? I don't know what that is.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,129
I just learned about it yesterday from LT,

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,110
but the millennial pause is a barely perceptible pause that

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,250
is present at the start of some recorded videos.

13
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,189
And so basically they what

14
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:40,215
and uh Luke talked about was a combination of technology.

15
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:43,265
We come from an era where when you start recording

16
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,866
it doesn't start recording it.

17
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:48,506
It like the takes a second or two for the

18
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,465
computer to think about it and stuff to happen in the

19
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,265
-- little light
-- for the tape to move or

20
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:56,026
the light to go on or the app to start or whatever.

21
00:00:56,301 --> 00:01:00,602
So we basically start recording and wait for some sort of

22
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:04,111
signal or feedback from the device that it is indeed recording.

23
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,291
Then we start talking.

24
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:08,281
Whereas younger people just hit record and start talking.

25
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:11,251
Well, yeah, that's because they live in the magic world.

26
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:14,351
Well, and also time constraints like tiktok videos.

27
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,372
You don't have time for a one or two second pause,

28
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,332
like like Vine, remember Vine 15 2nd videos.

29
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:22,802
If you pause for one or two seconds, that's 10% of your content right there.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,459
-- I suppose that's fair.
-- So,

31
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,839
I am utterly guilty of this because I'm old and so is Josh,

32
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,480
I'm fine with that. I look, I'm comfortable with it.

33
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,000
So I, I have a funny old person story to tell you actually.

34
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,389
So I was surrounded by youth.

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,680
Yes, last night.

36
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,839
And there was an IP four networking problem. We had a Raspberry Pi with

37
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,160
the wifi was connected to the internet and

38
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,580
the Ethernet was connected to a local network

39
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,919
and the thing they plugged the Ethernet into

40
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,879
claimed it had a default route and you could, you could exit the network on it, right?

41
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,680
Obviously didn't go anywhere. That was a lie.

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,819
And the, the Raspberry Pi by default,

43
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,190
sets the metric on the Ethernet to a lower number than the metric on the Wi Fi.

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,639
Which means for anyone who doesn't know I PV four networking,

45
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,729
it means it will try the Ethernet first. But what happens?

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,369
It tried to get on to the internet. There was no internet and then it just,

47
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,289
there was never a response to packets. So nothing ever worked.

48
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,710
And I'm like, oh, we just have to change the metric and they're like, what? No.

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,300
And it's like, ah,

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,970
I know how to fix this. I will teach you all.

51
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,895
And then I started explaining, they're like, whatever. Just make it work old man.

52
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,714
-- It's like, fine, I'll make it work
-- well.

53
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,524
But every network device they own has, oh, I,

54
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,904
I was having network problems and I finally realized what it was

55
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:41,925
is around 11 o'clock. That's when the firmware updates for my wi fi happened.

56
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,125
And so basically my Wi

57
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:45,634
Fi network would like just poop the bed for 5 to 10 minutes

58
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,550
randomly once every couple of weeks.

59
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,839
And I wouldn't notice it always because sometimes I'm in bed by then,

60
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,059
but sometimes I'm up working.

61
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,580
So I turned off auto updates because it just gets too annoying.

62
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:56,020
Like, because when it does happen, it's horrendously annoying.

63
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:57,839
Don't turn off auto updates,

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,979
don't do that. Turn those back on.

65
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,779
Well, no,

66
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,009
what I'm doing is and now I have a calendar reminder to just do it on the weekends,

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,550
-- turn those back on Kurt, turn them
-- back on

68
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,139
because

69
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,080
change your time zone, change the router time zone to something

70
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,160
annoying

71
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,800
-- because it doesn't matter
-- why would they pick 11 o'clock at night? Because

72
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,759
-- like three in the morning I get,
-- I, I agree. I think 11 o'clock is too early.

73
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,520
In fact, the, I recently recorded the cybersecurity awareness training for,

74
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:26,039
for work because I hated all of the existing training.

75
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,830
So I made my own because I was just like it was a fit of rage

76
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,440
and basically II, I hand out a couple of pieces of advice.

77
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,779
One is use a password manager. The other one is auto updates

78
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,910
everything you own.

79
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,470
Like

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,020
I agree. But

81
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,130
the thing is I lose about half an hour of work every

82
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,070
2 to 3 weeks at 11 o'clock because I'm like fighting this thing

83
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:48,350
change the time zone. So it updates at 2 a.m.

84
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,220
or is your time zone set to something stupid?

85
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,020
Does it think you're like in eastern time?

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,639
No, it's set to my actual time zone.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Ok. I don't know. I don't know about this

88
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:57,850
time

89
00:03:59,899 --> 00:03:59,960
zone,

90
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,339
whatever. Put that away, put your phone away. We're recording a podcast right now.

91
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,649
Not,

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,360
not doing network maintenance on Kurt's wifi system.

93
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,449
We have a topic today and it is not your wi fi system.

94
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,220
So, what's the topic today?

95
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,330
So this was your idea?

96
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,940
And I'm going to explain it apparently. No, it's too late. It's too late.

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,980
You lost your chance.

98
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,589
So Kurt had an interesting suggestion.

99
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,570
He sent me in saying, stop looking at your phone. Kurt. I see you doing that.

100
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,320
We,

101
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,720
so

102
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,119
God bless the video. I wouldn't have known this in the olden days.

103
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,100
So Kurt sends me a signal and basically says we should talk about

104
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,880
the just scale of packages today when you're a consumer because

105
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,890
like back when Kurt and I started at Red Hat.

106
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,029
Red Hat had probably thousands of packages,

107
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,390
I would guess over the span of all of the various operating systems and products.

108
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,109
And that was like a huge deal.

109
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,315
I was about 5 to 8000 packages depending on what, like,

110
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,554
I actually have unpacked all of rel and looked through it and stuff and it was about

111
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:59,234
5 to 8000 sort of sources plus other products. So,

112
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:06,045
but it's in the scale of the 10 to 50,000 over the whole ecosystem for Rel and,

113
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,394
and, and that was a big deal, right? That was a huge deal back then.

114
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,545
But now if you're using

115
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,809
a, a node application,

116
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:19,320
you have thousands of packages. And why is it different? And what does it mean?

117
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,769
And I think there's some interesting things we can talk about.

118
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,600
I think part of this boils down to what prompted this was I

119
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,720
was talking to somebody and I realized I was saying things like,

120
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,260
you know, back at Red Hat, we use statistical,

121
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,679
we could use statistical models basically because we had enough stuff,

122
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,670
you know, we're not managing trees,

123
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:38,200
we were managing multiple forests and I realized that's,

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,600
but that's now the common case, right?

125
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,100
And part of it is a matter of scale, like I can take care of one cat. Sure, no problem.

126
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,200
I've done that. That's easy.

127
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,920
Two cats a little bit trickier but sure, three cats, I've done four cats even.

128
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:53,399
We had four cats at one point. And that was, that's a lot of litter boxes to,

129
00:05:53,829 --> 00:06:01,160
but like 40 cats or 400 cats, like going from 4 to 40 cats to 400 cats, like,

130
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,720
like most things in life now it becomes matters of like you have to have strategy,

131
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,040
you have to have logistics, you have to have supply chain management.

132
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:11,660
And that I think is the thing is there's this threshold

133
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,070
where you go from making dinner for your family to being a restaurant effectively.

134
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,589
I think it's different than that even because I think you

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,380
can argue that making dinner for your family is doable.

136
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,750
And then

137
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,140
running a restaurant is one thing. But now, I

138
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,165
mean, imagine the next leap when you go from feeding,

139
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:30,924
say hundreds of people a night to feeding thousands of people in an hour.

140
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,434
Well, and that's what I mean is there's these.

141
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:36,524
So I think there's a couple of jumps in scale where there's

142
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,625
like essentially where you can manage your vulnerabilities sort of manually.

143
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,325
One at a time when you have

144
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,450
like maybe one or two a month.

145
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,450
But I think the cut off is we're gonna go logarithmic because it's just simpler.

146
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,589
But like 10 to 100 very different and 100 to 1000

147
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,609
very different and 1000 and up

148
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,269
very different.

149
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,950
And at some point,

150
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,119
I think there's a cut off where it just

151
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,980
doesn't matter anymore because like once you're handling,

152
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,649
say 5000 vulnerabilities a year.

153
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,880
Sure. 5000, 10,000, whatever.

154
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,320
It's, it's mostly going to be heavily automated and you're gonna have process. And

155
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:10,089
like I said, statistical models,

156
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,980
it just doesn't really matter all that much.

157
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,859
But that's the thing is, I think a lot of people are make, they've,

158
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,420
they've made the jump into using

159
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,540
hundreds or even thousands of dependencies and packages.

160
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:26,160
But mentally they're still stuck in the model of, like,

161
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,100
I have a server that I maintain.

162
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,179
I agree with that.

163
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,140
And I think this, I don't remember if we talked about this on here or not,

164
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,980
but I wrote a piece on, on the blog called, what did I name it?

165
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,420
Like, perverse vulnerability, incentives or something like that.

166
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:42,059
And it was basically, I, I've been dealing with this for more than a decade now,

167
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,140
but I talked to people that are obsessed with having zero vulnerability

168
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:49,790
and this is where they'll, they'll send in a report and be like, hey,

169
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,089
I scanned your product and it has all these findings and I'm like,

170
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,000
I know it has those findings,

171
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,500
but like we've literally went through them and they don't matter.

172
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,660
I sent you the justification for these findings explaining why they don't matter.

173
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:04,309
And you're insisting I have zero vulnerabilities which is

174
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,570
not a target you want

175
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,230
because you'll get to zero if you want to.

176
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,420
But it isn't going to be the way it's, it's the cobra thing from,

177
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:13,519
from the cobra effect.

178
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,649
-- Right.
-- Well, here's the fascinating thing.

179
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,230
Number one that they're basically trying to do zero defects,

180
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,500
meaningful or otherwise.

181
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,510
But here's the other fascinating thing that, that whole argument bases itself on.

182
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,170
That isn't always true, which is the vendor had

183
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:28,299
a

184
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:29,065
vulnerability.

185
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:32,825
The vendor shipped an update that they claim fixes the vulnerability,

186
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,625
updating, fixes the vulnerability.

187
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,025
And that is not always true.

188
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:40,794
For example, like, remember the cluster that was shell shock.

189
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,825
Like there's been lots of these where, you know,

190
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:45,984
one of my favorite is always was the I want to say was it

191
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:49,825
was the qual stack guard stuff where they did some really good research.

192
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,065
And they're like, you know,

193
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:55,784
they came out the nice like couple of page emails to the distro list and like,

194
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,099
you know, so we'll need like one megabyte stack

195
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,789
pages which well, it's not great but it, it'll work.

196
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,770
And then, you know, Florian looks at this and he's like,

197
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,309
I'm gonna go check and he comes back like a week later.

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,210
He's like, so good news, bad news stack guard pages will fix the problem.

199
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,000
But they need to be a gigabyte in size,

200
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,760
which means you can now have three processes running on a 32 bit system.

201
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,809
I think that might count as a regression.

202
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,169
Uh I

203
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,979
-- think we would frown on that.
-- Yes.

204
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:26,039
And you know, it, luckily it actually got proper fixed before like

205
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,390
we released it.

206
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,229
So we didn't like release the fix and then find out it was broken and redo it.

207
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,289
But this, this idea that you get to zero defects by just upgrading your software.

208
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:35,690
And,

209
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,500
well,

210
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,270
here's the thing that I see everybody ignore and it,

211
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:41,609
I don't understand is

212
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:45,349
you upgraded all your software so you have zero defects. Correct? Sure.

213
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,729
Let's pretend we can do that.

214
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,599
But all those defects that were lurking in the software,

215
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,460
we're looking in upgraded software,

216
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,859
there's more defects lurking that you just don't know about.

217
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,739
Well, but we'll fix those obviously when they're discovered.

218
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,780
-- Well, it's
-- now zero known defects and by known, I mean, publicly known to them.

219
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,099
And so this whole thing,

220
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:06,299
basically what it boils down to is you can never have zero defects.

221
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,609
It's, it's a fool's errand for sure.

222
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:12,530
But people pretend that you can achieve that somehow by just upgrading.

223
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,250
Well, because it makes sense.

224
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,669
Look, I think this is related to your topic of kind of just packages at scale

225
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:20,489
is

226
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,599
we are humans which are squishy bags of meat.

227
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:27,859
And we make bad choices, generally speaking. And I think we look at a lot of problems

228
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,349
and we try to simplify them into one

229
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,960
easy thing we can do to solve it. It's,

230
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,000
I mean, if you look at human history,

231
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,159
we're riddled with this where if we do this one thing,

232
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,640
it'll be fine.

233
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,130
And I think when we look at

234
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:45,770
all the packages we use, we'll say things like

235
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,460
we shouldn't have any vulnerabilities in our packages that will reduce our risk.

236
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:52,059
It probably won't, it will probably actually make your risk go up.

237
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,960
But to ex I mean, it takes a half hour podcast to explain why that is versus saying

238
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,849
zero vulnerabilities equal zero risk. Like have you got a sound bite?

239
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:01,859
Now, let's go with that.

240
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,380
And I think that you see this as well in package use where

241
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,489
remember a decade ago when all the source composition analysis

242
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,190
vendors came out like your Black ducks and so forth.

243
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:15,700
And they were saying we will find open source in your stuff.

244
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,979
And people would be like, oh, we don't have open source and they're like,

245
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,570
let's scan your product and see

246
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,090
because what happened was these companies were telling,

247
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,469
you know,

248
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,700
you, you know,

249
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,520
I know, but

250
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,489
companies would tell them

251
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,974
developers you're not allowed to use open source.

252
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:30,395
And so the developers instead of like

253
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,895
properly installing and using open source packages,

254
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,994
they were copying and pasting open source and things like that.

255
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:40,974
-- And so it was hiding
-- every single windows app I've ever seen that implements

256
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,315
any web service

257
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,755
cuts and pastes G zip because G

258
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,515
encoding

259
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:46,955
or compression

260
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:47,755
in the web

261
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,315
is special. But I'm saying like, but also XML hash do

262
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,594
s same thing.

263
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,890
They cut and paste that one little bit of XML parson code

264
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,429
and now boom, you can parse XML.

265
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,599
So there's a lot of these little things floating around that are widely widely used.

266
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,169
Plus then of course, you know, I need to library to do acts.

267
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,750
Do I write one or do I cut and paste one in,

268
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,289
-- I cut and paste one in,
-- you're going to cut and paste it,

269
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,700
you're gonna go to stack overflow and look at what they

270
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,669
say you should do and then you're gonna do that.

271
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:20,260
The challenge is, is to even just have a mature view of the problem.

272
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,450
You need to have a very sophisticated

273
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,330
understanding of the components and the problem.

274
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:26,260
And

275
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,719
I think one of the challenges, for example, is most people have never built software

276
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,900
and I don't actually, and what I say and that's

277
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:33,070
a

278
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,119
and for example, the word build has a very specific context here which is,

279
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,309
I don't mean write software, I mean build it like download bind

280
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,659
and do the dot slash dance to get it up and running

281
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,059
manually. Like not using a package manager.

282
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:50,869
It's funny you say this because this is a conversation I had a couple of weeks ago.

283
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,150
The word build to people like us is not what build means to most people today.

284
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,659
Because when we think of build, we think of compiling code into something

285
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,070
and build for a lot of people

286
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:08,010
means running some amorphous thing that puts another thing and

287
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,799
then I can use the other thing and they're,

288
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,419
they're technically the same thing.

289
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,549
But in our minds that is not the same thing.

290
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,099
-- So,
-- and even just to understand, well, like, for example,

291
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,940
every time I have to explain the difference

292
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,739
between a compiled and an interpreted language,

293
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,309
I'm just like, uh,

294
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:22,280
you know,

295
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,539
it's different.

296
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,140
Some of it matters. Some of it doesn't, there's trade offs, blah, blah, blah.

297
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,169
Anyways point is it's hard to understand this stuff, especially if you don't

298
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:33,369
-- do it at least once or twice. I
-- mean, I think that's part of it.

299
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,020
Look, I think there's a bunch of pieces.

300
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,640
Well, I would challenge anybody here to measure something,

301
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,809
measure a gap in your house and then cut a piece of wood

302
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,119
to fill that gap and get it right on the first try.

303
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,179
Less than 1% of the of humanity can do that.

304
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,719
Why, why would they need to,

305
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:51,400
I mean, that's why you hire professionals to do that, but this is why.

306
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,190
OK. No, no, you've, you've actually hit on an important point.

307
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,280
I think that open source is like any other resource, right?

308
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:58,119
And

309
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,880
you need people to manage that resource for you who understand what it is like?

310
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,260
You can't take a bunch of developers that don't know

311
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,640
anything about open source and say I want you to use

312
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,580
these packages

313
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,849
to make the application work better

314
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,469
and then expect them to understand what the like deep

315
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,770
implications are of that on your overall business risk.

316
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,099
They don't, they only know I'm doing an N PM install of this stuff.

317
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:24,929
And that's all I know. And that's, that, that's ok.

318
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,729
Why would they know more than that? Right.

319
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,400
-- Well,
-- and it's, it's thinking of, are they thinking a

320
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,900
perfect example? Are they thinking about scalability?

321
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,780
Well, no, the question first is,

322
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,619
do we need to think about scalability? Right.

323
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,130
And you and I again have the maturity to, to know to back up a step and say,

324
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,840
do we even need to think about mature like scalability as an issue here?

325
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:48,159
-- And if we do, then how do we do scalability?
-- What do you mean by scalability?

326
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:51,710
-- I think that's a meaningless term.
-- Well, so for example, I'm building something

327
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,919
and for example, there are things.

328
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,119
Oh perfect example, when I worked at Isight partners, we had data

329
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,359
that would be used to generate a web page and it made all the calls sequentially.

330
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,750
So if you're on the local area network and

331
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,010
100 calls happen with one or two millisecond latency,

332
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,700
that is fine

333
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,049
when you're up in Canada working remotely with 50 to 100 millisecond latency times,

334
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,109
100 round trips.

335
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,539
It takes 5 to 10 seconds for the web page to load.

336
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,820
And for example,

337
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,849
the developer kept arguing with me that it worked and it was

338
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,590
fine and it was not slow and it was my fault.

339
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,770
And then he tried it

340
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:25,500
and then he tried it from his house and he was like, he apologized to me the next day,

341
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,570
-- which was nice
-- Well, it was your fault because you live in Canada,

342
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,059
it was, it was like literally a simple tweak to make the sequential stuff parallel.

343
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,640
And it so it actually sped it up on the land for everybody.

344
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,539
But the thing is like,

345
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:41,859
he never thought about the performance aspects of what he was doing,

346
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:45,760
which a lot of developers don't like does performance really matter?

347
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,500
Like I know a lot of people work for

348
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,919
the government and everything happens on local area networks,

349
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:53,190
which was super great until COVID hit and then they all had to go home.

350
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,700
And for example, the government discovered a lot of their

351
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,380
data center sites didn't have enough upload

352
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,650
bandwidth to support people working from home.

353
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,320
You know, they had to move to the cloud. So

354
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:05,140
what I'm saying is it takes a huge degree of maturity,

355
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,340
not just to answer the questions

356
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:11,530
-- but to know which questions to ask. So
-- it's, it's not maturity, it's just

357
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:12,445
being old.

358
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,344
So what you're talking about is there's, there's what, what is the old saying?

359
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,705
There's the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns sort of thing.

360
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:23,195
Well, there's no knowns, known, unknowns, unknown, knowns and unknown unknowns.

361
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,705
I forgot that already. But you get the idea,

362
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,145
the the point is

363
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,830
there are things you don't know, you don't know.

364
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:36,109
And I think especially in the context of like using a, a lot of open source,

365
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,909
how would you even know

366
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,219
that there's dependencies of dependencies and

367
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:44,549
that there's different communities for every package

368
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,320
because you've built the software by hand 30 years ago and you,

369
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,349
and you experienced manually importing dependencies and tweaking LD

370
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:58,760
-- big and doing horrible things.
-- You can't expect people to know this automatically.

371
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,150
They have to, they don't even know, they don't know this.

372
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,890
And this is where if you know a couple of geezers like us, then yeah,

373
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,699
you can ask questions and we won't shut up about whatever it is.

374
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,560
You've asked us to tell you, everyone can't do that.

375
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,358
They can.

376
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:15,239
Because for example, my cousin in Germany is a carpenter and a carpenter in Germany,

377
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,280
that's like a protected term like doctor.

378
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,260
So he did an apprenticeship,

379
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,368
local carpenter workshop

380
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:24,519
using, you know, traditional tools. Then he had to do his one year v

381
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,688
where he travels for a year and works and he's only allowed to carry

382
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,168
what he can in the naps and he's not allowed to pay for transit.

383
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,208
So he has to like hitchhike and big rides.

384
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,318
And the stonemasons also do this.

385
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:37,048
And it's like a 500 year old tradition and it's kind of hard core and they're like,

386
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:38,968
well, we've been doing it for 500 years and it works.

387
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,038
But the point is

388
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:44,928
if you hire a carpenter in Germany, so a guy shows up wearing a black suede pants,

389
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,409
the white,

390
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:45,989
you know,

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
white dress shirt and the black kind of matador style

392
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,939
jacket with the mother of pearl button sewn with a Z

393
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,729
and the big floppy black hat.

394
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,390
Like basically, if you hand him a rock and a chisel, he can build you a house

395
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,640
that was part of his apprenticeship and his training and his von

396
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,709
-- and
-- understand the point of this. So

397
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,569
the point is

398
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:05,709
a carpenter in Germany. They are,

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,069
they are taught the old methods, they are taught from the ground up.

400
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,589
They're not like a modern computer programmer. It's like I do uiux development.

401
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,510
I have no idea what ac pu is now.

402
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,560
That kind of works maybe a bit better for

403
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,030
carpentry because certain things like wood is wood,

404
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,589
there's been advancements in engineered products, but, you know,

405
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,989
fundamentally we have the same techniques.

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,079
Whereas in computers, like we've,

407
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,680
everything that's more than 10 years old is

408
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,400
considered garbage and thrown out the challenge is,

409
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,439
is how do you find that balance of we need smart people to make the power tools

410
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,410
and what is the appropriate level of training

411
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,060
to use the power tools correctly and safely?

412
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,500
-- Ok.
-- So this is teetering on the old man, yells at cloud territory right now, but

413
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,030
let me ask you a different question. Ok.

414
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,949
So I have a guy who comes out to fix my refrigerator.

415
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,989
Do you think he can tell me how the motor works?

416
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,550
No,

417
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,569
but does he need to know how the motor works

418
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:59,030
-- or does he just have to need to know
-- exactly?

419
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,920
-- He does. It's a modular component that he replaces it
-- is. Yes.

420
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:04,339
In fact, this actually just happened to me.

421
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,530
I had a problem with my air conditioner and

422
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,810
the person came out and they had to fix it.

423
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,650
And my son's power supply in his computer died a few months ago. Remember?

424
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,829
And Felix was like, oh, should we find it figure out why it broke?

425
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,469
And I'm like, no, we just replaced the module.

426
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,579
But OK, but here's the point, there's two sides to your argument.

427
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,599
There's the, you should know everything about everything,

428
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,550
which is apparently what carpenters in Germany do.

429
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,839
-- If
-- you want to be a no, no.

430
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,640
If you want to be a master carpenter, if you want to be a master carpenter,

431
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,920
you need to know from the ground up.

432
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,880
If you want to be a day laborer and just frame walls, you don't need to know much.

433
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,199
But the thing is

434
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,349
what happens is the framer is working under

435
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,359
somebody that actually does know what they're doing.

436
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:42,560
I would agree with that. And I think

437
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,250
that is the crux of it is when you look at

438
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,849
any, I should say any many

439
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,300
software houses,

440
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,020
they do not have scary deep knowledge because, well, quite frankly,

441
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,290
there just isn't a lot of it out there and it's really expensive if you want it.

442
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,680
So, but what do they need it?

443
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:01,890
I mean,

444
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,780
things are working like I can go to my

445
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,010
bank's website and transfer money like it it works.

446
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,380
What's more interesting to me is that virtually every single one

447
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,930
of them is structured to pretend like they have it.

448
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,750
Oh, we have senior developers and junior developers.

449
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,459
We have code reviews.

450
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,069
Yeah, those code reviews are like, yeah, whatever.

451
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,930
Yes,

452
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,000
I love, I wish I could find it.

453
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,829
There's a comic I saw one time that talked about code reviews

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,349
and it was like, if a code review is like like 10 lines or less,

455
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,189
it will have pages and pages of like questions and descriptions.

456
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:35,229
And if the, if the code is like 50 lines or more in the diff, it just looks good to me.

457
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,050
So the thing is traditional, but here's the part of the problem is,

458
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,689
is kind of like building a house,

459
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,920
you can make fundamental mistakes in software or in building

460
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,780
a house that may not show up for a long time

461
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,329
or and are very expensive to fix.

462
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,770
And that's true that does happen like asbestos remediation.

463
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:54,530
Like

464
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,609
that's expensive.

465
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,510
I'm familiar with that because the house I own

466
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,959
my house was built 100 years ago

467
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:01,959
and

468
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,839
all of the pipes in the basement had asbestos on them,

469
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,709
which they don't anymore and their basements are placed as well.

470
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,650
But that's another story.

471
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:09,290
But

472
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:09,729
I

473
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,290
like just we replaced the basement.

474
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,140
I did, I have a funny story about that. So January is Radon

475
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,239
Awareness Month.

476
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,189
I found out and I thought, well,

477
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:22,050
I haven't ever tested my basement for Radon and I had it redone like a year ago.

478
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,709
So I thought I should check my basement for Radon.

479
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,109
Now that we're actually down there,

480
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:28,530
I tested it for Radon. It's a little bit, a little high, like nothing crazy.

481
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,430
And so I called the Radon guy

482
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,420
and he's like, ok, what year was your house built in? I'm like, 1919.

483
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,630
I could hear him go. Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait, oh, hang on, hang on.

484
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,900
I was like, I had the, I had the foundation replaced. He's like, you what?

485
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,670
Like, yeah, the foundation is only 10 years old. He's like, wait, what?

486
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,829
I'm like, it's fine. Just come to my house and I'll show you

487
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,569
and yeah, it was like, it was dirt cheap because he's like,

488
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:49,932
this is like a new house.

489
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:54,022
It, it's very easy for me to abate your radon and you installed all this stuff and,

490
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:54,772
and it's great now.

491
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:58,012
But I'm like, yeah, it's fine because usually I, I asked him,

492
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:00,522
I said when you have 100 year old house, what's it usually like?

493
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,892
He's like, honestly, I just don't do them.

494
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:07,633
-- It's so much work
-- well. And, and that's a perfect example of expertise in mastery.

495
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,703
He knows which job

496
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:10,875
to walk away from.

497
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:11,836
Right.

498
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:15,235
-- That's an important skill, especially if you're a contractor.
-- Really.

499
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:19,475
It really is saying no to things is hard to do. But holy cow, I get it.

500
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:22,556
And that's a perfect example. In the software world saying no to things.

501
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:26,635
How many times do developers actually get to say no to things,

502
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,156
feature requests or adding this thing or whatever?

503
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,459
You know? And I've seen it phrased differently.

504
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:35,010
Like I think Squarespace had a really big blog entry about this

505
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,979
of they don't say no,

506
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,140
they say it was some version of like what would be required to achieve this.

507
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:41,770
Ah

508
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,439
interesting.

509
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:45,880
And so then you can have a real and honest conversation like a perfect example,

510
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:46,704
CS A I was like, oh,

511
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:48,604
we should do like end to end sort of email testing

512
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:51,704
and monitoring to make sure our email providers aren't pooping out

513
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:52,484
funnily enough.

514
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:55,984
Cloud FFL just published a blog entry on this like today or yesterday about how they

515
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,584
use cloud FFL workers to balance their outgoing email and stuff like that and blah,

516
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:58,905
blah, blah,

517
00:22:59,265 --> 00:22:59,734
and I realize

518
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:00,944
what the CS A does.

519
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,234
It's just too much. It's, it's not worth it to even do it.

520
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,535
So it's just on the back burner. It'll maybe happen someday. Maybe not

521
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:08,785
until then, you know,

522
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,444
if mail gunner Sendgrid go down email breaks for a little while.

523
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:15,425
Ok. So in the, in the time we have left, then I want you to

524
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,170
answer me. This

525
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,310
is having like a,

526
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,270
a disturbingly deep understanding of your open source dependency tree.

527
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,410
-- Is that worth it?
-- It depends on the use case.

528
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,359
If you're building a web front end that does something

529
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:32,010
like

530
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,310
I built web finger dot IO.

531
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't need to worry too much about the dependency tree. But if I'm building a bank,

532
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,339
I would like to know what's

533
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,816
in there. I would agree with that.

534
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:44,296
You know, if I'm building a mission critical system

535
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,395
that affects people,

536
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,355
if I'm building something that runs a chemical power

537
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,946
plant or a chemical plant or a power plant.

538
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,316
Sure. So, actually good example.

539
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:56,656
So the FDA in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration in the latest,

540
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,645
I forget which bill it is.

541
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:59,586
One of the bills I've read so many lately.

542
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:04,462
One of the bills tells the FDA that medical devices need to produce S bombs now.

543
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:06,411
Like that's a great example. Right?

544
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:09,732
Like if I have a thing inside of me that's keeping me alive,

545
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,891
I want someone to know what's going on and, and the thing is like,

546
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,822
there's nothing you can do with the S bombs.

547
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:18,171
Technically right now, it's more a matter of, if you can make one of these,

548
00:24:18,182 --> 00:24:22,131
you're showing you have a certain level of expertise versus someone who can't.

549
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,640
And I think that's part of the story is just being able

550
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,520
to do a thing shows you have a certain level of maturity.

551
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:30,439
Yeah, I mean,

552
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,959
one of the houses I bought,

553
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,000
we had it inspected and literally the house inspector was like, oh,

554
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,859
did you know the garage burned down a little bit at some point? I'm like, what?

555
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,829
He's like, yeah, just a little bit. Like, not much. I'm like,

556
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,790
ok. Pause. What, what exactly does it burnt down? A little bit mean?

557
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,329
He's like, oh, well,

558
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:50,790
there's obviously a fire in there because there's

559
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,650
like alligator charring on all the rafters.

560
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,310
But they're mostly

561
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,750
solid and it seems good.

562
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:57,130
And I'm like, oh, ok then, and I,

563
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,849
I asked the neighbor I'm like, did this garage ever catch on fire?

564
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,310
And she's like, oh, yeah. Yeah.

565
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,709
Like he used to do, I have a workshop in there and he did a lot of woodworking and, yeah,

566
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,810
one time, apparently he smoked as well.

567
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,150
And so, you know, yeah, it burned down a little bit one time.

568
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,619
-- Those
-- oily rags in the corner, right.

569
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,150
So you just,

570
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:14,420
and,

571
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,020
and it's one of those things where I like and then

572
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,729
I poked my head through the inspection part and I'm like,

573
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:20,449
oh, like, like you can see all the wood is charred, but it's

574
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,859
generally like 80% there.

575
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,180
It's probably, I mean, it hasn't fallen down with snow load in over a decade. So,

576
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,719
ok, like,

577
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,979
it's a defect probably.

578
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,569
I think you would classify the garage, burning down a little bit as a defect, but

579
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,380
it actually didn't matter. And it's still standing there, like, 20 years later.

580
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,819
I mean, but you can,

581
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,540
you can make the same claim against open source packages in your product

582
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,910
because you could have like, a very old package.

583
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,109
-- But if it's not doing anything interesting. Who cares?
-- Exactly.

584
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,780
And that's part of knowing which defects matter.

585
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,589
And don't, so remember when, um, when Red Hat bought, manage

586
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:58,510
Iqem, I looked the ruby rail, uh, the ruby Gems dependencies

587
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,489
and I found a bunch that hadn't been updated,

588
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,579
like one had not been updated in four years.

589
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:03,459
And I'm like, oh my God,

590
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,050
-- what,
-- four years? That's it. That's nothing.

591
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,660
And it was called American Date and it just converted

592
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,180
dates into month, day year, the American format

593
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,089
and I took

594
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:16,640
a quick look through it and it was reasonably sane. I'm like, ok, cool, who cares?

595
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,579
And I did the like a quick audit of

596
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:22,800
basically by age of lack of update to see if they mattered and

597
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,900
none of them were front face and none of them were like really touching

598
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,770
user controlled data.

599
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,489
So I'm like, yeah, ok, like it should be updated,

600
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,410
but I'm confident to put my engineers, you know,

601
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,089
approval stamp on it saying these building plans are ok.

602
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:38,410
It probably won't catch fire and fall over right away.

603
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,300
And maybe that's part of what we need is

604
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:42,079
sort of that high level

605
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,930
approval by somebody who

606
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,439
is then liable

607
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,270
and thus carries insurance.

608
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,300
So then then that enters into the whole aspect of the insurance industry,

609
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,069
make sure that these people are qualified, hopefully and they do good work,

610
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,239
you know,

611
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,170
accepting where you have identity theft and

612
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,459
buildings falling down like that Italian guy who

613
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:02,510
-- pretended to be an engineer or
-- I don't know if this will ever happen.

614
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,420
I mean, so like

615
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,344
for, for anyone who doesn't know, like, for example,

616
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:08,864
in the world of civil engineering, you have to have a licensed civil engineer,

617
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:12,964
like stamp your plans and things to show that like the building

618
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,584
you're going to build is sound and it won't fall down.

619
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,984
There was that building in Las Vegas that they had to tear down, they built like

620
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,584
two or three stories and then had to take it down like oops.

621
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:23,545
Yeah. But I mean,

622
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:26,145
I don't know if software is ever going to be there.

623
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:29,334
You can make the argument that things like critical systems.

624
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:30,984
You could potentially say like

625
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,130
you should have some sort of

626
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,599
software engineer and I don't, I use the word engineer like biggie engineer,

627
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:40,130
-- proper engineer, not sanitation engineer
-- like well,

628
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,250
and we all call ourselves engineer but an engineer like there are professional

629
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,510
engineers where you have to take this horrible test and you have to

630
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,489
prove you're competent and then they give you a license and you have

631
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,780
to do things to keep the license and it's all very complicated.

632
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:53,849
I think part of it

633
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,609
is

634
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:55,609
-- you're using the
-- word,

635
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:55,920
you know,

636
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,829
OK, hold on. I want, I want to reframe this because you know what I just realized

637
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:05,520
last week, I think it was on Thursday or Friday, the United States released the,

638
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,760
the Biden administration, whether they're like cybersecurity,

639
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,520
whatever, I forget the full name of it. But I think one of the things

640
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,030
in that policy document

641
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:21,319
is it has become clear that the free ride software has

642
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:25,520
had from liability and accountability is coming to a close.

643
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:29,209
And so while part of me says Kurt is a lunatic for

644
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:33,619
suggesting like there's a licensed software engineer signing off on projects.

645
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:37,650
It might not be that ridiculous. Just given the current situation,

646
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,339
we must hold the stewards of our

647
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:41,599
data accountable for the protection of personal data

648
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:42,199
drive.

649
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,380
The development of more secure connected devices and reshape laws that

650
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,709
govern liability for data losses and harm caused by cybersecurity,

651
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,099
errors,

652
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:51,239
software vulnerabilities and other risks created

653
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,959
by software and digital technologies.

654
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,010
That's from the

655
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,670
the cybersecurity strategy.

656
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,489
-- Yeah,
-- it's got some good stuff in it.

657
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,030
But the thing to remember is you're using the word software to

658
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,839
encompass everything and there's a huge difference between a nuclear power plant,

659
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,300
a

660
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,189
hospital.

661
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,430
You know, my my American date

662
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,790
-- that converts dates into that stupid
-- American.

663
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,270
One of my favorites is, is like video games, right?

664
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,709
When I'm playing Mario 64 in my switch,

665
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,910
I would say I'm much less concerned about the licensure

666
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,349
of software developers on that versus the person who built,

667
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:27,189
you know, the implanted pacemaker or whatever, you know, something like that.

668
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,420
Those are very different situations.

669
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,630
And the flip side too is a great example like the whole

670
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:31,890
Tarkoff

671
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,790
controversy right now. TV

672
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,520
is really apparently terrible for not having any anti cheat system,

673
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,000
no replay system.

674
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,359
-- And so
-- no one knows what Tko

675
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,579
-- is. You have to explain this better
-- TV

676
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,339
is a video game. It's a multiplayer video game.

677
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,619
And long story short,

678
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,229
you can spend hundreds of dollars buying in game items to have a good loadout to,

679
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,020
you know, have a better chance of winning and stuff.

680
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,890
So there's real money involved for these things.

681
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,920
And when you die, whoever killed you typically gets all your gear.

682
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,430
So, like if you have $100 loadout and you die

683
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:03,569
well, too bad. And cheating is rampant in Tarko,

684
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,020
there's no anti cheat system really.

685
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,719
That's, uh, well, there is an anti cheat system but it's not great.

686
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,949
Uh, they just banned a whole bunch of people recently on last weekend, but

687
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,349
there's no replay system. They, they lack a lot of fundamentals. And so

688
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:20,050
even video games now have Real World Financial,

689
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,040
like financially measurable consequences for having these security problems.

690
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,280
And I think that's

691
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,209
sort of what's changed is

692
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,780
we've gone from

693
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,800
software is not like software

694
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:33,680
is no longer a nice to have or an optional thing. It's,

695
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,530
it's life

696
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,310
and this free ride, you know, it's like, look at the mining industry,

697
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,729
we used to just dig holes, send people down the holes.

698
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,989
Hopefully they came out with rocks that were valuable and shiny. That's true

699
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:50,310
to the point where it got so bad that every American company in their sec.

700
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,189
10-K has to make a statement about their mine safety,

701
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,589
like red hats.

702
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,300
10-K has a thing. We don't own any mines. We don't plant on any mines.

703
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,510
Blah, blah, blah. You know, same thing with building houses.

704
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,589
Now we have building codes out the wazoo

705
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,729
because people used to just slap houses together

706
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,760
and then horrible things would happen. They would burn down, fall down,

707
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,010
whatever.

708
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,739
Yeah. Well, that's like, I mean, my house is 100 years old

709
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,400
and it's funny because

710
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,430
I was talking to a contractor one time at the house

711
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,630
and I pointed out like this insane beam we have.

712
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,250
And he's like, yeah,

713
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,829
they just did that because they figured it was probably good enough.

714
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,949
Like they had no math,

715
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:29,390
they just put a giant beam in because they're like this, they should hold it all,

716
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,810
-- all
-- that stuff in Germany, like 16 inch,

717
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:35,250
I've seen 16 inch oak beams in a house and it's like

718
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:36,119
that

719
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,339
will like, it's 500 years old.

720
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:39,880
There's your proof.

721
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,239
You know, it's funny because the,

722
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,750
but so what I think will happen is we'll see a sort of a

723
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,020
top down approach, like with more

724
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:47,650
like

725
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,160
get the real safety critical stuff first, like the power grid, ho

726
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:52,800
you know, all this kind of stuff.

727
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,800
And one thing,

728
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,959
the cybersecurity strategy talks about is

729
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:58,300
further these and other critical sectors

730
00:31:58,969 --> 00:31:59,439
rely on,

731
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,260
upon the cybersecurity and resilience of their third party service providers,

732
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:05,729
cloud based services enable better and

733
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:08,810
more economical cybersecurity practices at scale.

734
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:11,109
But they are also essential to operational

735
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,680
resilience across many critical infrastructure sectors.

736
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:16,290
And I think that's the next thing that's gonna happen is we've already

737
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,280
seen the industrialization of it through cloud in the last 10 years.

738
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,510
But I think we're going to see like the six sigma like like

739
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,369
99.4 nines reliability approach to cloud computing now

740
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,650
because we have to like again, it's not nice to have. It's

741
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,430
like if Amazon goes down,

742
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm going immediately to the nearest food store to buy all the canned food.

743
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,060
Because if Amazon goes down and stays down,

744
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,300
there's gonna be hell to pay,

745
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,739
that'll never stay down. I'm, I'm comfortable with their ability.

746
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,819
But if look, here's the thing, if Amazon goes down, it doesn't come back up,

747
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:53,280
society collapses, it's fine.

748
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,540
Like you don't need canned food, just hope you're killed first. That's

749
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:58,849
anyway. All right, I'm gonna,

750
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:03,020
I'm gonna tie this one up because I, I love that. We started out talking about

751
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:07,930
managing lots of open source dependencies and we land ourselves into the

752
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:11,739
-- fact that I think regulation is coming for the entire industry
-- because

753
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,459
everybody is managing open source dependencies.

754
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:18,140
-- Now at scale, whether you like it or not look well,
-- but here's OK.

755
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,219
Here's the one thing I want to end with is if you read

756
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,829
all of the, the document, the Biden administration published,

757
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:27,869
they're very clear that like, this is not open sources problem.

758
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,969
This is the problem of the vendors. And I love that.

759
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:34,319
Well, I think they're smart enough to realize, to quote like Thomas De

760
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:34,959
Pierre,

761
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:36,719
what is actually

762
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:38,140
possible.

763
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,359
-- Right.
-- And, and we could write like

764
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:44,900
we could, well, we do write laws that saying you can't run red lights,

765
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,060
right?

766
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,359
Whatever. I'm a sovereign citizen. I don't have to follow your laws. Kurt?

767
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,619
All right.

768
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:55,579
All right.

769
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:59,180
I'm gonna call this one before we get too silly and probably get in trouble.

770
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,780
