Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 38 with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,810
Siefried and my partner in crime. Josh

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,470
Reser.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,409
Oh, Kurt,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,649
it feels like I haven't talked to you in a month and it's been one whole week only.

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,059
I know what you mean. I've been sick for

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,309
like the last two weeks. I just can't stop blowing my nose.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,370
That sounds great. Thanks for sharing that.

8
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,309
I guess we'll start this week off with a little bit of I told you. So,

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,589
what have I done this time?

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,699
What did I do? I didn't do it

11
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:39,438
well, not you. No, no, no, but everybody in general. So this whole,

12
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:39,879
you know,

13
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:42,098
there's this constant argue about crypto and how

14
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,159
crypto will make you secure and safe and,

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,039
you know, like XK CD, I think said it best. It's like, oh, you know, we,

16
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,719
we, we'll have to hack this 4096 bit encryption key and factor the,

17
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,999
we'll have to factor the Gibson and all that and

18
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,469
you know, the correct response is no,

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,859
just go get a lead pipe and beat his

20
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:01,758
kneecaps until he tells us the password pretty much.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,680
And uh, so in the US, somebody is apparently refusing to give up their password and,

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,250
or claiming that they forgot.

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:14,860
And so the law in its, you know, slightly we're not going to play games with you.

24
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,819
Fashion has, uh, stuck them in jail

25
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,440
for contempt of court.

26
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,010
It's, yeah. Which,

27
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,819
you know,

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,650
and I love because Contempt of Court is one

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,569
of those wonderfully old things that we have,

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,440
you know, that just,

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,169
it covers a multitude of sins.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
Well, it's because you didn't listen, I mean,

33
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,739
if the judge tells you to sit down and you don't,

34
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,949
you go to jail for contempt of court and in the case of something like this,

35
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:43,180
the problem is if the judge thinks you have the password

36
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:45,419
and you refuse to give it to him,

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,819
then he can put you in jail for contempt of court until you give him the password,

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,639
which means you could literally sit in jail forever

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,260
for contempt of court in an instance like this.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah. What's interesting to me is in the US or sorry? In the UK.

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,889
They actually explicitly passed a law covering, you know, the so called,

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,129
like I don't have my password.

43
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,339
You can't get my data ha ha ha situation,

44
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,290
you know the UK Rip Act, right?

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,479
And it kind of,

46
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,259
and I'm kind of wondering now why they just simply didn't use Contempt of Court.

47
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,339
Although obviously having a law on the books that specifically covers something

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,139
makes it easier to apply.

49
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,850
Well, I mean,

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,619
this is almost certainly going to be appealed and

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,259
I'm sure it will make it to the Supreme Court

52
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,889
and in something along the lines of 1/5 amendment. Right?

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,009
And

54
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,570
just for those of us that aren't American,

55
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,619
what is the

56
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,080
fifth amendment?

57
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:34,759
Right. That's right.

58
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:41,050
So, in America there's certain, uh we'll say undeniable rights you get

59
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:45,589
and one of them is you do not have to incriminate yourself,

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,080
which is called the fifth amendment.

61
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:48,009
There's a constitution,

62
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,690
they've added some amendments to it to fix things that were missing.

63
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,309
And the fifth amendment basically says when you're in court,

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,750
you don't have to testify against yourself.

65
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,539
And historically,

66
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,750
passwords have been viewed as 1/5 amendment issue of

67
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,240
giving up your password is seen as essentially,

68
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,259
you know, taking the stand against yourself in court.

69
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,339
Now, in this case, it's, it's a, a

70
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:18,059
contempt of court that they put the person in jail for and

71
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,509
I don't know how this is going to work out.

72
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:23,800
We'll see, we'll put the story in the show notes for this.

73
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:27,990
And of course, I'm not a lawyer as, as any real lawyers know from all the weeping,

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,330
they do when they hear me speak.

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,080
But

76
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:34,369
it should be interesting to see how this one plays itself out over time because I,

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,690
I have no doubt we're gonna see this at the Supreme Court.

78
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,270
Well, see what's interesting to me. So, historically speaking, you know, a

79
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,020
bad analogy of safes, right?

80
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,389
You give us the combination to the safe so we can get in there and look

81
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,960
at the evidence and if you refuse to give up the password to the safe.

82
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,160
Well, that's unfortunate, but fundamentally,

83
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,970
you can physically cut a safe open given enough time and patience.

84
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,490
And it's actually not that,

85
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,970
you know, it's not that hard actually given like,

86
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,779
you know, physical access in a few days to monkey around with it.

87
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:05,389
It's even trickier than that because now if, if you're safe has a key,

88
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,220
they can make you give them the key

89
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,240
-- and if you
-- don't know

90
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:09,690
that,

91
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,520
so we're talking a physical key like a mechanical,

92
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,130
-- like
-- an actual key.

93
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,928
And if you don't give it to them, that's contempt of court

94
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,100
or if you have a fingerprint reader on your phone,

95
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,899
they can touch the phone to your finger

96
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,910
and that's not protected by the fifth amendment.

97
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,390
Well, you know what it reminds me of is like the old banking secrecy where, you know,

98
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,529
essentially, hey, my money's in Switzerland most likely.

99
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,070
So the authorities are like, hey, Switzerland,

100
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,359
what's the deal with this guy's money?

101
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:38,230
And the Swiss authorities at least back in the day were like, yeah, no,

102
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,350
you know what I mean?

103
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,309
And it's kind of like,

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,230
similar to encryption in that way and that there's no

105
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,670
way around that sort of like launching a war on,

106
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,670
you know, Switzerland.

107
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,290
Um Although the Swiss banking laws have now significantly changed and, you know,

108
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,929
that's not a problem anymore.

109
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,170
But,

110
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,149
and that's the thing with encryption, right is given, say a strong,

111
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,269
you know, 4096 bit key with a good pass phrase, protecting it.

112
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,760
Like in theory it,

113
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,579
you, you can't,

114
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,670
you can't get around it without, you know, getting it out of the suspect.

115
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,470
Like you just can't,

116
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,660
you know,

117
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:12,809
uh I remember there was one famous case many years ago where the guy

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,700
used his prison ID number as his password.

119
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,089
It was a mob case. We'll look that up and put it in the show notes.

120
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,470
But, you know, it's a classic case of like,

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,470
don't use your birthday or your pet's name or, you know,

122
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,429
your prison ID number is your password,

123
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,510
right?

124
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,890
So, yeah, I mean, I guess this is, well, it, it had to happen eventually, right?

125
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,769
Because the law, you know, if there's how many cases are there where, you know,

126
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,000
they want access to somebody's cell phone or their Facebook postings or, you know,

127
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,459
whatever.

128
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,730
Right.

129
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,829
Yeah, it, it comes up quite a lot.

130
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,859
Well, when you,

131
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,850
when I think about how much of my life is not

132
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,170
just like I carry my cell phone all the time,

133
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,970
but how much of my life I transact on my cell phone, you know, email, calendaring,

134
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,369
online banking,

135
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,739
you know, booking trips, buying things from Amazon, you know,

136
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,640
I actually finally folded and set up my phone to, you know,

137
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,820
actually logged into the Amazon app so I can buy things on my phone.

138
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:01,019
And

139
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,660
because no, what I found happening is I, you know, I go to stores,

140
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,850
I check the price and I'm like, oh, you know, Amazon's like 50% cheaper and, you know,

141
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:09,320
prime will have it out in two days,

142
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,959
but someday the stores are going to disappear because of people like you,

143
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:13,329
that

144
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,480
you have to buy it at the store after you look at it because that's terrible.

145
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:18,970
Otherwise

146
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:19,600
it,

147
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,239
I feel like that I do and I know

148
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:27,196
I know not everyone shares my, we'll say a false sense of morality here,

149
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,476
-- but
-- it's tough because like for example,

150
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:32,246
like we were looking at some board games over the weekend, right?

151
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,096
Um Shout out by the way to Rhino Hero.

152
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:36,066
Awesome board game takes 30 seconds to learn

153
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:39,276
board games are so expensive in the stores,

154
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:43,286
but I, I buy them there because I do not want my local game store to go out a bit.

155
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:43,832
And

156
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:44,582
I know

157
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,351
they're, they're raking me over the cold.

158
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:49,432
You have game stores but not so a big thing here

159
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,552
locally in Edmonton now is we have about six or seven

160
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:54,082
tabletop cafes where essentially it's like a cafe

161
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,611
and they have like 1000 board games.

162
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:56,861
And for example,

163
00:06:56,872 --> 00:07:00,641
the one you pay five bucks to sit down and play as many games for as long as you want.

164
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,432
And then they also sell, you know, coffee and beer and snacks and food.

165
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,052
That's pretty sweet,

166
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:08,690
you know, and the beauty is, of course, you know, they have like 1000 house games.

167
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,350
So you can try all these different games that

168
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,350
are, you know, some of them are not cheap.

169
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,480
Um, more the point also you don't have to clean your house to have people over.

170
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:17,820
Right.

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,149
And so anyways, they, most of them also sell more popular games and

172
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,339
in some cases like this, the, the one place we went, had Rhino Hero for like within,

173
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,399
like it was like 16 bucks and it was within five cents of what Amazon could get it for.

174
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,279
And that was without shipping and handling. So, of course, I bought it in the store.

175
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,709
But, you know, then I'm looking at these other games and they're like,

176
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,410
you know, 100 and 5200 bucks in the store and like 100 bucks on Amazon. And,

177
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,320
you know, I feel for these stores because, yeah, they want to sell stuff. But like,

178
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:47,760
if you are like 50 or 100% more than an online store, like, uh,

179
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,399
sorry,

180
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,279
I just,

181
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,179
it's hard to justify dropping an extra 100 bucks.

182
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,779
So I can just support my local business.

183
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,500
I've never dropped 100 bucks, but I, I bet I've spent more than 30

184
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,540
to buy things in person just so I can

185
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,179
again have that, uh, moral superiority over you online game shoppers.

186
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,209
Well, I'm just searching for the best price, you know.

187
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:13,429
No, I, I know what you mean. I know what you mean.

188
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,869
But, uh,

189
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,399
so for what it's worth my local game store does similar

190
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,929
things where they have kind of a room and back and,

191
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,730
you know, you can go play games or, or Pokemon or whatever it is you want to play

192
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,910
and they have a wall of games that you can try out and use and,

193
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,470
and it's fantastic and I love it and,

194
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,959
and because of that I probably bought more games than not.

195
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,510
But again,

196
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,609
I kind of feel like now on the other side, though, they don't charge you to hang out,

197
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,830
you can just go because obviously I assume they,

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,669
they figure rightly so that you're gonna buy a bunch of crap while you're there.

199
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,150
Which

200
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,308
I,

201
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,409
I don't think I've ever left the game store

202
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,789
without giving them money in some manner for something.

203
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,299
No, these ones are more first and foremost, like a cafe slash,

204
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,030
you know.

205
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,799
Yeah, they don't have

206
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,580
that at my game store. And man, if I could drink beer while,

207
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,650
I don't know,

208
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,679
beer while playing board games could go hardly wrong.

209
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,150
It's awesome. I mean,

210
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,530
it's, you know, and, and the thing, I like

211
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:07,700
a

212
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:07,989
lot of

213
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,609
the people I do.

214
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,130
Yeah.

215
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,159
But, uh, and the nice thing is too, a lot of these places will have, like,

216
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,489
I know the one place they have, um,

217
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,289
like these kind of nice private rooms that

218
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,450
will seat about eight or nine people comfortably.

219
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,330
And it's just,

220
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,250
and it's literally just $100 minimum and it's $100 minimum

221
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,799
in the sense of you have to spend $100 minimum,

222
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:25,270
which, I mean,

223
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,890
if you're there with eight or nine people that's gonna happen in the 1st 15 minutes

224
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,289
each maybe.

225
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,270
Yeah. Well, drinks, snacks, you know,

226
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,669
and then, I mean, and it's, you know,

227
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,460
the thing I was is I was working it out on in my head

228
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,309
and it's like if I spend more than 15 minutes cleaning my house,

229
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,349
it's actually cheaper to take everybody out to the board games place.

230
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,450
That's the spirit. All right.

231
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,450
So anyway, while we were, uh, rambling on about games,

232
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,729
I looked up the Fifth Amendment

233
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,179
and passwords

234
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,450
and so what it basically says here is that

235
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,330
the lower courts have given conflicting decisions about if

236
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,869
password disclosure is a violation of the fifth Amendment.

237
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,770
So, in this case,

238
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,729
the, the issue we're talking about, the judge obviously believes that

239
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:11,890
you can compel someone to give up their password. However, it also says that

240
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,119
no case has made it to the Supreme

241
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,489
Court specifically about passwords and the Fifth Amendment.

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,659
But it sounds like the general opinion of the court kind of the view.

243
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,130
Now, granted this is the

244
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:27,250
in the past the, the court is changing as we speak, but

245
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,270
it sounds like the,

246
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,020
the court generally believes that you cannot compel someone to give up a password.

247
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:32,859
But again,

248
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,820
that could be different

249
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:38,940
when this, because again, this case will probably make it to the Supreme Court

250
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,130
if I guess.

251
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,679
-- And, and we will finally
-- have

252
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:42,630
a

253
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,770
right because you have to.

254
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,929
Well, no, but I mean, with,

255
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,200
with the amount of people's lives being transacted on phones and more importantly,

256
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,169
the fact that I know Apple, for example, is really starting to, you know,

257
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,530
they've already got like the secure chip and, you know,

258
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,590
hooked in with the biometrics and the, you know,

259
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:01,570
all that stuff like this is going to become more and more of a like you,

260
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,890
you just can't get into somebody's phone without their fingerprint or

261
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,929
a zero day exploit, you know, of some sort to, to break in. Right.

262
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,489
And I think that's quite reasonable.

263
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:13,070
Yeah.

264
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:17,200
So which kind of leads then to the second interesting court related thing?

265
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,630
So apparently um

266
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:27,320
there's a small town in the uh just outside Minneapolis, Minnesota, so called Edina

267
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,760
Minneapolis. Uh Minnesota. Sorry.

268
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,570
And there's a, it's a,

269
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,510
it's a pretty standard wire fraud case

270
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
where somebody basically stole somebody else's identity,

271
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,520
you know, ginned up a fake passport

272
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,690
and used it to uh to get a credit union to transfer uh what was it? Oh, wow.

273
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,489
$28,500 out of the account,

274
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,880
get that stuff out of your bank account, man.

275
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,989
That should be in a stock market brokerage account

276
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,520
-- or
-- under your,

277
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,679
you know, sock drawer

278
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,429
buried in the yard. That's totally, totally.

279
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:59,419
Yeah. Print out Bitcoins, laminate them and bury them in New York.

280
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,619
You can buy like, physical Bitcoins that apparently have.

281
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,059
That's so weird.

282
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:05,989
Anyway.

283
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:11,020
Um, but anyway, so, you know, pretty standard wire fraud case, you know.

284
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,000
Um, but what's interesting is where is it?

285
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,229
Do, do,

286
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,359
do investigators are focusing their probe on an online photo of

287
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,200
someone with the same name of a local financial fraud victim?

288
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,750
The image turned up on a fake passport used

289
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,489
to trick the credit union fraud to fraudulent,

290
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,890
fraudulently transfer 28,500 out of an Adina man's account.

291
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,690
Police said the bogus passport was faxed to the credit union

292
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,770
using a spoof phone number obviously to mimic the victim's phone do

293
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,159
according to the warrant application. So basically the deal is

294
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:40,989
they found

295
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:45,289
there's this password or a passport photo, sorry that um

296
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,429
doesn't show up in Bing or Yahoo

297
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,539
only shows up in Google.

298
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,239
And so what they're asking Google for is

299
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,000
essentially searches of this name that would then,

300
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,780
you know, result in that photo coming up.

301
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,900
So they can see basically, you know, who um

302
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,190
ideally, you know,

303
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,400
took that photo and used it on a fake passport.

304
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:07,979
Sure.

305
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,309
Uh and the trick being though that of course, you know,

306
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,030
this warrant applies to global

307
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:13,049
uh

308
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,919
internet use, right? It's uh was it the warrant demands.

309
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,969
Google helped police determine who searched for variations of the victim's

310
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,479
name between December 1st of last year through January 7th,

311
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,369
2017.

312
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,909
So basically, they're asking Google globally,

313
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,340
every

314
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:30,179
single person who searched for this name.

315
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,140
We want all the records like and, and it's, you know,

316
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,369
standard warrant information language.

317
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,179
So it's like things like social security numbers and stuff,

318
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,960
which obviously you don't really apply here.

319
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:39,250
But

320
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,989
they basically want like as much information as Google can

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,489
give them about every single search for that name.

322
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,169
I can understand why Google is hesitant to do this.

323
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:51,489
-- Well,
-- just the cost of fulfilling this request.

324
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,739
Yeah, I'm sure it's not cheap

325
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:54,539
and

326
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:59,539
that's a pretty wide net they're tossing into the ocean here.

327
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,710
Yeah.

328
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,750
Um, I mean, because I, I believe,

329
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,299
remember the same thing sort of happened with Hans Reiser

330
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,010
going back in history.

331
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,950
Uh, so th those of you don't know, is apparently, was it,

332
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,679
was he the one that was doing Google searches on,

333
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,080
like how to dispose of a dead body like a week before

334
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,400
-- or
-- was that the case?

335
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,659
And there was a case in Florida? I think that also this happened,

336
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,150
there have been a handful of them

337
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,150
and, but, but so in, in an instance like that

338
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,840
you could even make the argument

339
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,330
this person

340
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,130
doing these searches. That's the information I want. And that's a lot tamer

341
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:35,979
than saying

342
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,090
everyone who's ever

343
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:38,859
logged into

344
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,130
Google,

345
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,770
Kurt, they know who you are. Don't even pretend they don't,

346
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,530
you can go to the freaking library and not log into anything and they know it's, you,

347
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,729
I guarantee it,

348
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,650
they know.

349
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:53,969
Right.

350
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,979
And so that's, that's different. This is really,

351
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:58,070
uh,

352
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,960
I mean, this is one of the problems with the way the world works now, is it,

353
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,989
I think in some ways it's getting worse because

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,909
they're talking about repealing net neutrality in the US.

355
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:11,109
That's right. The, the least crazy problem we have. Right.

356
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,320
Well, no, but, but they're talking about, you know,

357
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,919
and so for those of you who don't know, don't know,

358
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,039
the idea of net neutrality is this idea that essentially the,

359
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,760
the people providing the pipes.

360
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,820
So the I SPS

361
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,880
can't monkey with the traffic. Really?

362
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,440
Right. They can't be like, oh, you want access to Netflix? That'll cost you $5 right.

363
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,429
They either sell you internet access or they don't,

364
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,479
you know, kind of like the phone system. I give you

365
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:33,559
access to the phone system. You can dial any number you want. Right.

366
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,270
I can't like, oh, you know,

367
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,570
you wanted to actually be able to call Sweden. Yeah, that's an extra 20 bucks. Right.

368
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,789
Um,

369
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,000
and so with Net and tr they're talking about repealing

370
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,440
it and also allowing I SPS then to do things,

371
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,489
like, collect a lot more information on your,

372
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,190
on what you're doing online

373
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,429
and to sell that information

374
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,070
-- to third parties.
-- Well, they can do that already. I believe

375
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:56,840
it

376
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,630
-- varies.
-- I don't know, it's

377
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:00,630
whatever,

378
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:01,469
but

379
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,349
my head hurt.

380
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:02,890
Yeah.

381
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,239
But I mean, what, what it really boils down to is I'm really beginning to think that,

382
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,419
you know,

383
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:11,270
basically everybody needs to use a VPN for five or 10 bucks a month or something.

384
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,080
I don't know. Like,

385
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,780
yeah,

386
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,679
it, it's not even just VPN.

387
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:15,880
I mean,

388
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,409
this is part of the reason everyone wants everything encrypted and this

389
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,719
is very much in line with that whole Google beyond CORP strategy of

390
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:28,090
just assume every network you touch is compromised in some way.

391
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:31,510
And so you have to ensure, right, you have to ensure

392
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:36,010
essentially data integrity between the end points because everything in between,

393
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,419
you totally can't trust it.

394
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,820
And, and that's exactly the right way to look at everything.

395
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:40,359
Well,

396
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,210
the problem there though is that so I can have

397
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:45,000
completely encrypted network traffic to Google and I do.

398
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:48,169
But then Google keeps a copy of all that traffic forever,

399
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,690
right?

400
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:49,940
And

401
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:55,039
then quit using Google, I mean, right. Quit using Google is your, is

402
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,940
your search engine keeps, you know,

403
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,650
quit, quit using search engines.

404
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:03,739
I mean, this is, this is just how right. It's totally prac

405
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,949
but here's the deal is

406
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,449
I use Google, I understand

407
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,209
the amount of information Google has about me.

408
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:15,569
And I, I accept that I, I may not like it necessarily, but I have to accept it

409
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,868
when I'm

410
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,729
traversing the internet to get to Google.

411
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,339
I do not want anyone in between to know what I'm doing because I don't trust

412
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:29,239
them and I don't want them to have access to this and this is the same deal

413
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,040
dealing with your ISP.

414
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,530
I do not trust my ISP. I don't want them to know everything I do.

415
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,229
So, I mean, I, I go out of my way to make sure as much of the stuff I'm doing is encrypted.

416
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:43,290
Well, that brings up a problem in that.

417
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,089
Um, your DN Ss lookups can reveal every web page you visit.

418
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,489
They certainly can.

419
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,489
I do run my own DNS servers but they can still, no doubt,

420
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,750
pay attention to the DNS traffic coming in and out

421
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,689
and

422
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,449
I'm, I'm not a huge fan of that, but I can

423
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,010
accept that

424
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,089
as

425
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:03,250
well. You could

426
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,530
VP in your, your gu

427
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:08,119
that's a huge pain in the neck and part of every now and then I

428
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,849
get tempted to just start putting together

429
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,920
some nice infrastructure internally to do that.

430
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,180
But

431
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,329
fundamentally,

432
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,459
I, I'm not a huge fan of it but I will deal with it is kind of the way I look at it.

433
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,959
Well, I'm actually wondering so, like, I mean,

434
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:23,890
I'm assuming there's a lot of web pages that have very specific fingerprints

435
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,430
of DNS lookups.

436
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,810
Like not just what is being looked up but the order, you know,

437
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,189
the order that the javascript loads the ads

438
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,229
or, you know, the various other tokens and stuff. Right.

439
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,790
And I'm assuming, because I'm that kind of guy,

440
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,510
I'm assuming that a lot of these places maybe do that

441
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,270
intentionally change the order and loading and stuff so

442
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,109
that they can essentially fingerprint traffic by your DNS lookups

443
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,030
because

444
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,380
it would be actually relatively easy to do,

445
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,380
you know, conceptually, it's not that hard.

446
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,880
Um,

447
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,150
and I mean, I've, yeah,

448
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,959
I've looked at like what happens DNS request wise when you load

449
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:05,119
like the front page of cnn.com and it's like 200 lookups,

450
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,449
at least, maybe more

451
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,260
whatever. Um You're depressing me with this conversation.

452
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,290
Let's move on to something more fun like pa

453
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:14,979
to own.

454
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,839
Oh Yeah, that went well. This week

455
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,439
it went really well. I'm,

456
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,040
it was awesome,

457
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,119
right?

458
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:23,949
So why don't, what's, what's P

459
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,489
to own for those people who don't know

460
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:25,680
P

461
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,109
to

462
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,760
is um So

463
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,160
there's this nice guy called

464
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,609
Dragos Rui

465
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,810
who started a security convention.

466
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,410
It's gotta be like, it's more than 10 years ago, I

467
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,040
-- think
-- forever. At this point,

468
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,239
it

469
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:38,819
started,

470
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,530
it started in Vancouver, Canuck

471
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,079
West. And then I know he does one in Japan uh and one in Europe, I believe.

472
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:49,569
And essentially he had the bright idea for like, you know, um well, capture the flag.

473
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,949
Everybody loves, capture the flag.

474
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,449
But why not have like capture the flag with like real money prizes and like real,

475
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,390
capture the flag.

476
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,150
And so simply put

477
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,589
people show up, you know, prone to own, essentially large companies, um,

478
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,910
put up some cash and in this case, one of the major sponsors, uh, is

479
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,949
I, I think it's still tipping point. Right.

480
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,510
Oh, goodness, I couldn't, I,

481
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,790
-- there's so many now, honestly.
-- Yeah. Well, so

482
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,880
I think it was originally,

483
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,099
it was tipping point was one of the major

484
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:19,010
sponsors and basically the deal was they wanted zero days

485
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,670
because then they could write, you know, essentially, um,

486
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,489
protection things for their network product to block them and then, you know,

487
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,089
report it to the vendor like Microsoft or whatever and they would fix it

488
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,859
and they would be able to go to their customers and say,

489
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,880
look like Microsoft fixed this horrible, horrible flaw.

490
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,599
But had you purchased our product,

491
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,079
you would have been protected for like three or four months, you know,

492
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,910
before the patch actually came out.

493
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,130
Um So the whole thing always reminds me of this weird, you know, like, hey, that's a,

494
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,280
that's a nice story you got there.

495
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,859
I'd be ashamed if it burns down,

496
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,949
you know, it, it's really, to me there's this, like, weirdly fine line between like,

497
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,180
yeah,

498
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,380
that and like all these contests and stuff and

499
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,760
-- bounties, I feel like
-- this is protection money.

500
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,989
Maybe, maybe the Wikileaks story is, but that's another

501
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,209
issue.

502
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,349
So anyway,

503
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:00,849
so

504
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,150
traditionally, you know, they had the, the good targets, you know,

505
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,020
like Microsoft uh like the, you know, like the um

506
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,910
the chrome web browser, the Microsoft web browser,

507
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,079
which is what is it called edge now or something?

508
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:17,099
Um You know, and a couple other, you know, like Adobe Flash Java because, you know,

509
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,099
everybody loves beating all those poor things.

510
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,920
Um

511
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:23,890
And anyway, so yeah, this year, apparently somebody managed to,

512
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:24,729
you know,

513
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:27,829
do enough zero day exploits to what was it

514
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,000
break like to basically compromise a Microsoft edge browser

515
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,719
-- and break out of the VM ware virtual machine. It was running
-- within. OK.

516
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:39,310
It's crazier than that because here's what has to happen is it come,

517
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,689
you started a website,

518
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,489
the website exploits the browser,

519
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,290
then you exploit the the machine the browser is running on

520
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:52,319
and then they exploited the the was it running in VM Ware? Yeah, the VM Ware uh

521
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,530
guest essentially to break into the host.

522
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,640
And then they, yeah, they had a host level access from a web page.

523
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:05,890
You think about that a web page made it all the way to the VM host

524
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:06,530
well

525
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:07,540
execution

526
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,770
within the web browser.

527
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,020
Chances are, you know, there's always going to be flaws in the sand boxing.

528
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,920
But I mean, yeah, no, this is like a multiple,

529
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,800
like this is a multi-layered hack with probably what a dozen exploits.

530
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:20,670
I

531
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,319
don't know how many they used. But if I had to guess it was probably at least a dozen,

532
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,520
just because

533
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,010
it, it's not enough. It's not like the good old days where you just wrote an exploit.

534
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,150
Now you have to, you know,

535
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,680
you need information disclosure so you can figure out

536
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,420
what the addresses are you need to carry.

537
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:36,760
I mean,

538
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,160
it's conceivable you could do it with as few as four,

539
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,469
but I would be very surprised if it was only four.

540
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:44,520
Yeah.

541
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,270
So, I mean, this really makes me wonder about the whole, you know,

542
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,479
all these places that are, um,

543
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,650
I've been dealing with more and more places that

544
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,550
their security strategy essentially is we assume things are compromised

545
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,660
and assuming things are compromised, what can we do

546
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,319
to make it less? Terrible?

547
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:04,359
You know, for example, with logging and auditing or other, you know,

548
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,290
network protections or

549
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:07,640
whatever.

550
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,390
That's absolutely the right way to think about it because

551
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:14,160
I mean,

552
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,880
now an attack like this mind you is not something you're going to see every day,

553
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,579
-- but
-- what is the price for pool?

554
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,920
It was like 100 grand,

555
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,719
100 and five grand, something like that.

556
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,630
It was 100 and five grand. It was a weird number

557
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:31,119
for the big break out. I don't know if they, if all these chained together

558
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,380
to give them more than the 100 grand,

559
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:34,930
it

560
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,729
half a million

561
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,020
or

562
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,670
even, let's just say a million dollars,

563
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,000
right? Nice big round number. But a million dollars to say,

564
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:47,250
you know, be able to like, have some bank administrator just visit a web page and bam,

565
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:48,359
you know what I mean?

566
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,410
That's,

567
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:50,170
well,

568
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,329
so

569
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,599
in that context,

570
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:58,189
the correct solution is to make sure your bank administrator

571
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,770
can't do anything valuable.

572
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:03,510
Right.

573
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:03,890
The

574
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,310
problem is though, is that all these places, you know, they want to be able to like,

575
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,459
do their job and browse the web once in a while to look for tech documentation.

576
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:10,829
They

577
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,770
do. But, ok, let's back this up. There's,

578
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:16,030
there's two views I have here. View number one

579
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,310
is that

580
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,939
uh we're all doomed

581
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:19,609
and

582
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,790
we can't fix this.

583
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,380
This is if somebody wants to target you for some reason

584
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,199
they can and will be successful.

585
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,219
Ok?

586
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,180
Period,

587
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,680
there is nothing you can do

588
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,260
that will keep you safe if someone wants to get you.

589
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,079
That is the reality

590
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,609
of this. Now, moving past that though, let's use your example of a bank executive.

591
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,020
If, if one bank executive can be attacked

592
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:49,400
and money can be

593
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,849
infiltrated from the bank based off of this one executive,

594
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,910
you have banned security.

595
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:55,729
-- You
-- should need at

596
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:56,329
least

597
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:56,949
two

598
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,569
people.

599
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,430
It has because they had terrible security.

600
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,790
But also they have like the second person didn't

601
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,489
do their job properly and was just like,

602
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,000
oh, you know, Bob said transfer the money.

603
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,959
-- Okey doke.
-- Ok. And if that happens, that is a breakdown of your internal processes.

604
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,459
-- That
-- is

605
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,459
reminds me of all this code reviews.

606
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:15,520
Everybody's like, oh, we have code reviews, you know,

607
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,939
every single bit of code has to be like a two man commit.

608
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,430
And I'm like,

609
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,670
do these people actually read all these changes because they've also got like

610
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,469
their boss yelling at them to commit code and get stuff done.

611
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:24,900
I mean,

612
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,099
you know, to properly review code is a nontrivial exercise.

613
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,650
Cause like, look at all the, you know, uh,

614
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,349
every single time there's a Linux kernel flaw, it's like,

615
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,400
invariably like we added a feature

616
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,719
and whoops,

617
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,920
we added a feature 12 years ago.

618
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,160
Somebody just found the bug today.

619
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,209
Yeah. So,

620
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,449
you know, it's, it's,

621
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,420
well, ok, here's the deal.

622
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,420
If code commits, well, humans aren't lazy, humans suck at doing this kind of stuff.

623
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,020
Here's the way I would see code commits is

624
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,650
what is the job of a code commit?

625
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,750
Is it to catch security issues from getting in or

626
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,459
is it to catch egregious mistakes in obvious attacks?

627
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,260
I would say ideally it's to ensure the code commit is correct,

628
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,329
which would also

629
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,089
cover security.

630
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:12,589
That's like saying

631
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,640
no, ideally, no one's going to

632
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,000
security issues.

633
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,459
Ideally, you

634
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,030
know,

635
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,260
cows.

636
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,880
Uh, yeah. No, I would say with code commits.

637
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah, I mean, you're, you're trying to like, you know, insert function back door,

638
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,540
blah, blah, blah.

639
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:26,900
Right.

640
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:33,040
Exactly. Exactly. And, and so I think the right attitude to have

641
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,239
around that is to say

642
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,180
you need to be able to move fast.

643
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:40,790
Like, so for example, actually speaking of fast isn't the p to own

644
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,469
Mozilla got pawed and they fixed the issue in 22 hours.

645
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:47,280
That's awesome. Right.

646
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,349
Like that's the way it has to work is you have to be able to move quickly.

647
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,770
If you, if it's gonna take you 30 days to fix a critical issue,

648
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:55,800
you're doomed.

649
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,439
I mean,

650
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:57,790
and, and additionally,

651
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,770
if you're the consumer of this software and it's

652
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,819
gonna take you 30 days to install the issue,

653
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,170
you're not 60 days out.

654
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,890
That's terrible.

655
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,280
Well, especially your, your 30 days.

656
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,439
Like, because I remember, you know,

657
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:10,930
back in the day when Microsoft drew their patch Tuesday and we had a,

658
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:13,079
like I worked for a different company that had a smart guy

659
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,540
that would, you know, take bin

660
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,589
diff and all the DB G and one or two other

661
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,319
tools and usually within 12 hours he'd have a working exploit.

662
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,040
Yeah. Right.

663
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,099
You know,

664
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,979
and he's not the only guy in the world that can do that.

665
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:32,119
Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and again, this comes back to move fast

666
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,680
and then that's really the only answer but

667
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,250
not only move fast is you have to remember if someone wants to get you, they will.

668
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:40,770
So what does that mean

669
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,020
around how you're designing your systems and processes?

670
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,030
Because

671
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,760
it basically, if you have single points of failure,

672
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,130
someone's just gonna attack your single point of failure.

673
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,609
They, they know it's what is it, is it, is it the CIA or the NSA who said

674
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,819
basically when they break into a network,

675
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,239
they just understand how it works better than you do. And that's how they win.

676
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,119
I mean, that,

677
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,040
that's exactly how it works.

678
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,630
Anytime you have an attacker that wants to

679
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,810
come after you is they're going to understand

680
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,579
what's going on better than you do. In fact, funny, funny we bring this up is

681
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:15,060
I had someone ask me, I think it was last week or the week before. Basically. Like,

682
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,010
what the hell do you, security guys do? I mean, how do you find these problems?

683
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,180
Like what's going on here?

684
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,530
And, and I started explaining about the fact that,

685
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,829
you know, there, there's a bunch of things to do and of course, I,

686
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,170
I lost them and I had to keep kind of backing up and making things more exciting.

687
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,469
But, you know, fundamentally it's

688
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,150
at the end of the day,

689
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,319
a security researcher is going to understand how an application

690
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:38,109
works better than the developers do in many instances.

691
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,660
And that's how they find the problems because they have this stuff in their head and

692
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,849
they can see the problems and they know how to think about it in that.

693
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,130
Let's do things the wrong way

694
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:49,150
because that's what we do.

695
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:49,790
Right.

696
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,750
Well, you know, that classic, uh, you know,

697
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,469
uh a security engineer walks into the bar and orders a beer

698
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:59,949
orders, negative one beers, orders, zero beers orders 7000,

699
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,140
492 billion beers orders, a

700
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,380
cri orders, a smiley emoji.

701
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:06,969
Yeah.

702
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:10,709
And I, I literally, I've stumbled onto bugs like, literally like that where, I mean,

703
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,130
well, that's my favorite was like, cross site scripting bugs where people just,

704
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,770
like, put,

705
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:15,890
you know, script alert, blah, blah,

706
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,609
blah into like all the text fields and eventually one of them like,

707
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,619
oh, pops an alert box.

708
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,550
Right. Right.

709
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,829
Honestly, almost every time I see a new website,

710
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,310
that's what I do is I just start pasting script things into various tech

711
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,109
because why not? It's something fun to do

712
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,540
and I can't help myself. It's well. And so, I mean, on that note

713
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,339
is I remember a million years ago,

714
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,229
I was working for a small company

715
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,060
and they were uh web washing. I don't even know you not cloud washing, you know, back.

716
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,599
But, but essentially they had this

717
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,489
application

718
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,170
adding a web like a website to it.

719
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,709
So you could use it as kind of a thin client sort of thing. And anyway,

720
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,510
I, they, they had

721
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,180
like the login box

722
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,069
and I just typed in SQL injection into the user name.

723
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,829
And of course it, it, you know, II, I got it all

724
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,069
and II I said you can't do this, don't

725
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:08,469
you?

726
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:08,829
You,

727
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,880
you cannot allow these characters and we need to filter it

728
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,699
and when you escape all this stuff and you know,

729
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,030
let's use prepared statements and all whatever, blah, blah, blah.

730
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,390
And I remember a developer looked at me and was like, why would anyone do this?

731
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,339
I had that exact same with my first

732
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,310
time explaining cross site scripting to a developer.

733
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,839
And I was like, he was like, why would anybody do this?

734
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,979
And I'm like, well, what if somebody links to the website with that stuff?

735
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:32,010
And I did this, I just did it like,

736
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:34,550
I am not even that smart, you know.

737
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,750
Yeah. Well, you know, it's like physical security, right?

738
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,829
You know, looking around the world and it's like, you know. Yeah.

739
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,030
Why would somebody throw a brick through that window? Well, why not?

740
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,459
No.

741
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,030
You know?

742
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:47,949
Oh, I know.

743
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:48,469
I

744
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:48,760
know.

745
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:49,979
The world is terrible.

746
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:53,459
It is. We ruin everything. Security people are the worst.

747
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,540
Speaking of terrible security people. Should we talk about wikileaks?

748
00:30:58,949 --> 00:30:59,719
Yeah, I

749
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:00,930
see that.

750
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:01,530
I,

751
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,380
so I know they mean, well,

752
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,640
I think, I hope, I really hope they know.

753
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:06,479
I used to,

754
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,030
I,

755
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,020
if that's true.

756
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:13,670
Well, I, I think they're so far into their own little version of the world but maybe,

757
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,599
-- you know,
-- that, that could

758
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:14,859
be,

759
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:17,420
I don't quite understand their version of the world anymore.

760
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,569
Um,

761
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,300
and part of this too is like this whole thing.

762
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,979
I've actually somewhat recused myself from because I,

763
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:26,219
I'm not an American and I have traveled to the US.

764
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:31,390
And so, yeah, so the deal is this Vault Seven CIA Wikileaks thing where, you know,

765
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,459
supposedly all these

766
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,739
zero days slash, well, they're actually, apparently,

767
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,520
maybe not zero days and they're just known security flaws or blah, blah, blah.

768
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:40,160
But,

769
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,979
yeah, basically, as I understand it.

770
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:45,819
Wikileaks has put, uh, was, was supposedly going to tell all the, uh,

771
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:46,920
the vendors affected,

772
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,680
-- you know, so they could make sure they fix the stuff,
-- which is a good idea.

773
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,199
Yeah.

774
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,500
But then apparently they came up, they required some sort of like

775
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,819
-- terms of use essentially
-- it. Right.

776
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,579
And it sounds like their conditions are bizarre.

777
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:03,199
That seems to be

778
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,900
the theme that keeps coming up here is.

779
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:09,040
And these, and they're talking to people like Apple and Google and Microsoft.

780
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,050
This isn't like

781
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:13,064
Joe Bob's consultation and see that doesn't have a security team.

782
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:17,324
Like these guys wrote the book, they know what they're doing,

783
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,925
-- their
-- first rodeo for sure.

784
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:19,494
You know,

785
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,285
you remember. Oh jeez, what was it?

786
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:22,094
Uh back in the day,

787
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:24,854
the guys that wanted a monster truck and a million dollars for their exploit.

788
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:25,785
-- Oh jeez,
-- what was

789
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:25,935
it?

790
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:27,214
I don't remember that.

791
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:29,829
A

792
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,040
monster truck. That's fantastic.

793
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,119
A million dollars in a monster truck

794
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,380
for early notification to Microsoft and Microsoft,

795
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,229
of course, was like, yeah.

796
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:37,660
No.

797
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:44,089
Well, in so, in a case like that though, they obviously made it easy to say no. Right?

798
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,310
When you ask for a million dollars in a monster truck, you're clearly not serious,

799
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:48,829
right?

800
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,329
So, well, I mean, you know,

801
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,260
is that

802
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:52,699
different than a

803
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,329
-- bug bounty? What is back
-- orifice?

804
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,650
Kurt, we should explain this for the people who aren't old.

805
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,359
I'm actually gonna have to look it up.

806
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,069
I'll do

807
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:01,239
it.

808
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm just trying to remember if it

809
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,380
was part of the problem is everything gets mixed up in my head.

810
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:08,260
I know. I know. So back orifice was put together.

811
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,780
It was the cult of the dead cow guys, I think, and,

812
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,619
and cult of dead cow.

813
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,069
That's a whole another topic for any of you who aren't, aren't as old as us.

814
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,459
I just look them up. They, they were a hacking group from back in the day and they were,

815
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,140
they were like my heroes way back when I was a kid. I love those guys.

816
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,760
They were,

817
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,050
it

818
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,020
wasn't even an exploit. It was just,

819
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:32,660
it was just, it was essentially a bit like I wouldn't even, I,

820
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,930
they call it ransomware. It was like spyware essentially.

821
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:36,839
-- No, it was
-- just like a metas

822
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:37,689
module.

823
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,930
That's it, it was just a, it was like any normal modern day, you know,

824
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,560
-- shell code you uh back door, you would insert,
-- right.

825
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:45,609
Yeah, it was a back door.

826
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:49,849
-- Although back in the day, these things were really rare and who fancy
-- they were.

827
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,704
And these guys basically made it consumable and

828
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,694
of course they called it back orifice and part

829
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,564
of the fun there was all these like legitimate

830
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:59,574
news sites were showing pictures of a back orifice

831
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,135
as their logo, which made it extra fun.

832
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:09,225
But yeah, it was, it was essentially these guys had found a nice way to take over and,

833
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:12,264
and kind of control a window system, which

834
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:15,304
wasn't something that was easy to do back then

835
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,438
and then.

836
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,000
Right.

837
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,310
Yeah, this is from,

838
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,399
so this is going back a long ways,

839
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,478
20 years.

840
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,719
That's like almost 20 years. Holy geez.

841
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,179
Yeah,

842
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,030
I got a lot

843
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,330
and, and now it was too

844
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,790
long.

845
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,989
I know. I know.

846
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,570
So, yeah, I mean, you know, it reminds me a lot of things essentially.

847
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,688
I think the big deal is, it was one of the, it was, like you said, it was the first one

848
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,850
-- to do this in a way that was easily, sort of consumable and usable and they
-- gave it away

849
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,070
for

850
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,750
free charge money for this. It was awesome.

851
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,938
So, it freaked everybody out, right, because everybody would now have this.

852
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,668
But, yeah, going back to the vault seven stuff. I mean, that's

853
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:53,879
the,

854
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,399
I mean, if we think Wikileaks, well, by definition,

855
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:01,510
supposedly the CIA has access to this and also, apparently Wikileaks has,

856
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,300
has access to this.

857
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,320
So, like,

858
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,760
you know, who else has access to this?

859
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:11,489
-- Right. I'm, I'm guessing any competent nation state could also have access
-- to this.

860
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,129
Yeah, maybe, I mean, it wouldn't surprise me and, and I think

861
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,489
here's whatever that doesn't matter

862
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,010
because first of all this is what the CIA does.

863
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,679
So, whatever, that's their job good for them.

864
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:27,179
Uh, Wikileaks got a hold of this somehow, which is of questionable value, whatever.

865
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,159
But now

866
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,949
they're trying to pretend they're the good guys who are you know,

867
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,679
sprinkling information

868
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:37,169
from down on high, from up on high, down on high, whatever.

869
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:37,959
And

870
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,780
they're making it difficult to work with them though.

871
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,959
And I, I don't know what the angle is to that. I, I don't

872
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:44,360
understand

873
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:44,830
also,

874
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:45,909
there's,

875
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,649
there's a couple of things I know about this that I can't talk about publicly.

876
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:49,530
But I'm also

877
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,100
the, the, the vendors they're actually talking to.

878
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:54,459
I,

879
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,320
I think I can state basically that those are probably not the only vendors

880
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,820
that are affected and it's interesting that they're not talking to all the vendors.

881
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,929
So I, yeah, I,

882
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,129
again, you know, I, I love that,

883
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,050
I hope that they have good intentions but

884
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,530
just the way they're executing this is like,

885
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,860
it leaves a lot to be desired.

886
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,479
I mean, the reality is a place like Google Apple or Microsoft. You just,

887
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,120
you know, you can email them the world's most horrible,

888
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,199
terrible security flaw.

889
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,199
And like, that's a normal Tuesday.

890
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,510
It's like,

891
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:32,649
you know,

892
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,449
like, like, you know, I, I've assigned 5000 CV S so people come to me with like,

893
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:40,610
what they think is a horrible security flaw and I'm like, eh, it's like a three,

894
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,969
maybe a four on a scale of 1 to 10

895
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:45,679
and even the stuff that's a 10.

896
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,729
It's like, yeah, you know, we should probably fix that.

897
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,469
I, I sadly know exactly what you mean.

898
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah.

899
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,000
So, you know, it's just like a part of it is just, you know, it's like house fires,

900
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,709
I'm sure if I ever experienced house fire,

901
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,610
I'll be terrified and I'm sure the fireman will be like.

902
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:58,750
Yeah.

903
00:36:59,239 --> 00:36:59,790
Uh huh.

904
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:02,000
You know, cause it's what they do every day.

905
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,629
It's true.

906
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,620
It's funny how that is that when you have a job like that,

907
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:10,739
it totally changes your perspective where, what should be like a horrific event,

908
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,729
you're just totally desensitized to it.

909
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:12,939
I mean,

910
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,139
it's gonna be like when you're an, er,

911
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:20,260
room doctor in the inner city you probably see some of the most horrific things ever.

912
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:22,280
You want to see some of that. Um,

913
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:27,189
-- don't, you don't need, no, no, no, no,
-- no. Uh, the, so it's, it's, it's well done.

914
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,860
It's, um, it's a British series on the British Rail Cops

915
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,659
and of course,

916
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:34,570
one of the recurring themes is removing dead bodies from the

917
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,010
tracks because people commit suicide by jumping onto train tracks.

918
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:39,929
Right.

919
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:42,510
And so, you know, these, these rail people,

920
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,429
the deal is they have two hours to deal with this and get the body off the,

921
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:47,310
off the tracks and get the trains moving again.

922
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,560
Right.

923
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,169
And to determine if it's a suicide or if it's murder or an accident or whatever,

924
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:52,340
right.

925
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,429
They have like, basically two hours is their goal

926
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,860
because, you know, literally they have to get the trains moving again. Right.

927
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,629
You can't just like,

928
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,120
not have the trains going, you know, for a major commuter area

929
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,810
and just, and obviously they don't show the dead bodies and stuff, but, you know,

930
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,350
these people's reaction to it, of course, is, like,

931
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,340
you know, this one episode, they had to deal with it twice in one day,

932
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:12,560
you know.

933
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,169
And so obviously they have all sorts of, you know,

934
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:17,629
they like black humor and stuff to kind of, you know, try and deal with this without,

935
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,030
you know, breaking down and,

936
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:22,530
yeah, I mean, you know, like, I'm staring at this and I'm like, oh my God,

937
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,129
that's horrible.

938
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,159
And these poor people are like, yeah, they do this, like,

939
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,729
at least once a week kind of deal,

940
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:30,270
you know, that could be an interesting topic is

941
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,969
to talk to security people about how they kind of deal with the,

942
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,439
just the constant horrors of this work of every, everything's always hacked,

943
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,800
everything's always broken.

944
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,129
I mean,

945
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,030
let's face it.

946
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,969
If, if you're working on an infosec team of even a moderately sized company,

947
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,830
you probably have double digit machines that have been compromised, you know,

948
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,810
about and, and

949
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,629
you know, what,

950
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,850
what do you decide this one I'll really investigate and this one's like, yeah,

951
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,239
whatever.

952
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,149
Just wipe it reinstall. That's how it is.

953
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,989
Well, like the, you know, like the whole Yahoo thing where they, it was so bad that,

954
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,129
you know, when the,

955
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,310
when the chief security officer found out about what was going on,

956
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,169
-- you know, stuff was being kept from him right about the
-- uh

957
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:16,389
that's because they had a back door from the government. I mean,

958
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:17,790
it's totally different

959
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:18,310
man.

960
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,399
Like, I mean, what, what I'm saying though is like, is things, you know,

961
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,540
it's not just you gotta worry about these outside Attackers as a security person.

962
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,590
You also have to worry about like

963
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:26,639
potentially.

964
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:27,610
Now you have to worry about like,

965
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,929
your CEO doing a deal with the government behind your back.

966
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,810
-- Like,
-- yes, you

967
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:33,989
said,

968
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,909
you know, this is one of the reasons I decided early on in my career, I would never do

969
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,489
real operational security because it's just, it's,

970
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,570
it's just this constant train wreck.

971
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:48,669
It's really hard, man. When we say that it's, we, we have a constant train wreck too.

972
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,090
I mean,

973
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,929
product security is not a whole lot better, man.

974
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:56,729
It's just slightly less emergency on fire typically

975
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,360
usually. Yeah.

976
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,639
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's, I mean, it's a tough one.

977
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:04,439
I mean, and II, I do know, for example, in the industry, like there's a lot of burnout.

978
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah. Yeah. I know. And I, I totally get it. And it, I don't know.

979
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:11,790
There's, there's days I wonder like, what, what have I done?

980
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,229
But it's all I know at this point and I've invested so much of my life into this.

981
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:15,659
It's like

982
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,070
this is, this is the train I'm on in

983
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,459
the end.

984
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:23,909
Well, and see, that's one thing that gets me is like developers,

985
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,110
at least when they ship a new product.

986
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,560
It's like, wow,

987
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,100
you shipped a new product that actually works and does something useful haza,

988
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,590
you know, with the security thing, it's like, I'm not even always 100% clear.

989
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,760
-- I'm like, what is our goal? Like,
-- obviously,

990
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,320
you know,

991
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,360
of life,

992
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,320
you know,

993
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,360
like, I mean, we can't, uh,

994
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,149
obviously a goal like having no hacks or no security issues.

995
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,560
Obviously that's, that's just not realistic.

996
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:48,360
So, actually this is something was I talking to you about this?

997
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,969
I forget who I was talking to about this. But

998
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:52,270
oh, no, it was you, we were, we were chatting on signal

999
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,429
and you, you mentioned that

1000
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,659
small incremental changes add up over time.

1001
00:40:57,669 --> 00:41:00,959
And if let's say you have 5% improvement every year in 14 years,

1002
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:04,389
you've essentially doubled whatever it is you're trying to improve.

1003
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:04,790
Right.

1004
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,629
And

1005
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,879
because, oh, we were talking about

1006
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,110
old desktops and there's people sitting at

1007
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,879
desks with probably five year old desktops,

1008
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:15,120
apologies to you listener if you're one of them.

1009
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,850
But you know, for like literally what a couple of 100 bucks you could buy a

1010
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,560
new desktop and, and maybe

1011
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,760
double their productivity in some cases,

1012
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,159
-- even
-- improve their productivity by 10 or 20%.

1013
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,840
Right. Right.

1014
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,100
So,

1015
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:29,560
unless you're paying this person absolute minimum wage with

1016
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,060
no overhead that'll pay for itself in one year.

1017
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,679
Right. Right. And, and so anyway,

1018
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:34,659
then

1019
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,899
the question becomes, well, what about security?

1020
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:40,030
How does security fit into a world view like this and

1021
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,649
I don't think we're there yet.

1022
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,939
I don't think we

1023
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,020
have the tools or the know how in our industry

1024
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,879
to be able to have even five or 10% improvement

1025
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:54,929
per year because we don't even know what that means.

1026
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:55,959
In some cases.

1027
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,969
I, I would generally agree with you, but I would also caveat, for example,

1028
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,270
uh we now have languages like that are not C and C++ when it comes to memory management

1029
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:09,479
and, you know, it is a great first step.

1030
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,959
And also we have things like,

1031
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:17,760
you know, import of libraries that, you know, can very easily be updated,

1032
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,989
you know, like no Js or, you know, NCM or Ruby Gems, right?

1033
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:25,620
I don't know if those are the best examples,

1034
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,729
-- but
-- at least you can get something up to date

1035
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,810
pretty much the second,

1036
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,219
-- you know, the, the library vendor or maintainer updates it.
-- I understand,

1037
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,909
-- I know what you're talking about, but
-- when you consider like 20 years ago,

1038
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:39,879
what it took to get up

1039
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,030
to like, remember DLL Hell on Windows

1040
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:43,159
and how like,

1041
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:43,919
you know,

1042
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:48,290
applications would ship their own old versions of DLL S and scatter them among,

1043
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,310
you know, around the system.

1044
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,540
They just don't put them in your system folder anymore.

1045
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,830
I guess that's an improvement.

1046
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Seriously. It's, it's totally how it works.

1047
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,540
Containers, man,

1048
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:01,310
that's how containers work

1049
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,560
well. Or the,

1050
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,669
the existing fuff kerfuffle about Apple actually,

1051
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,629
apparently now enforcing some of their sandbox and security

1052
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,429
on various mobile apps and stuff.

1053
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,770
And so there's that, what is it roll out dot IO,

1054
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,800
which is this like framework for mobile apps to like

1055
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,379
ship updates to them,

1056
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:19,360
you know,

1057
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:22,800
essentially outside of the operating system and outside of the Apple Store.

1058
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,090
So that or you know, whatever Android store

1059
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,479
so that the app itself can internally update.

1060
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,149
And you know, Apple is basically saying, no, you can't do that.

1061
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,489
Like you, you can't have self

1062
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,139
modifying code that can do God knows what?

1063
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:34,679
Because then obviously, you know, we can't

1064
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:38,600
like even remotely begin to certify this code and say it's safe or not, right?

1065
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,030
You know,

1066
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,350
and so uh you know, because I know I've had kids,

1067
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,229
my kids have a couple apps where like the first time I started them up,

1068
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:47,790
it's like downloading like 89 megs of data.

1069
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,729
And I'm like, what?

1070
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,030
You know,

1071
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:54,649
and um wasn't clear on what that was, was it images? Was it like the applications?

1072
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:55,070
And so,

1073
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,540
you know, these people are losing their minds because

1074
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,929
uh Apple is essentially enforcing, you know,

1075
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:03,239
you can't use these really unsafe library calls that can like self modify

1076
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,629
the code and you have to use our sandbox and technologies and stuff.

1077
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:05,899
So,

1078
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:06,330
you know,

1079
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,080
if Apple were to actually enforce that and then start kicking stuff out of the store,

1080
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,590
we would have measurable progress

1081
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:18,409
in that space, you know, that one specific instance, right?

1082
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:20,419
Yeah,

1083
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:23,350
I, you're not wrong and I think,

1084
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,679
I guess you're right.

1085
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:28,790
This is part of our incremental change is doing these little things.

1086
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,629
But I think this is where security fails a lot is

1087
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,709
we love to look for the perfect solution

1088
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,070
instead of this one thing will make things a little better.

1089
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,370
And if we keep making things a little better

1090
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,550
1000 times now things are a lot better instead of looking for that one,

1091
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,949
a lot better event.

1092
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:50,790
Yeah.

1093
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,100
Well,

1094
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,489
and part of it too is we security traditionally

1095
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,229
wants to fix things and fix it permanently somehow.

1096
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,149
You know, and that's kind of not how the real world works in that. You know,

1097
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,280
people have reinvented the wheel badly. A million times

1098
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,219
and people will continue to do so with code. Right.

1099
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,169
And I think that's where part of the whole Dev

1100
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,840
ops security agile thing comes in where, you know, at

1101
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,129
least now, you know,

1102
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,699
in theory a shop doing like agile dev

1103
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,169
ops

1104
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,879
can fix bugs quickly, do a build quickly, test it or smoke, test it, test it and get

1105
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,830
it out the door, you know, within

1106
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,110
maybe days,

1107
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,729
you know, whereas the old model, like,

1108
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:28,090
say the waterfall model of software development would be like, yeah,

1109
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,770
we'll schedule that in for like, you know, Tuesday in January of like 2055.

1110
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:35,010
Yes.

1111
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:35,919
Or,

1112
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,129
or you treat security as a snowflake and

1113
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:42,850
it's like you're constantly throwing the emergency stop switch

1114
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,649
and, you know, the train is like piling up and back because

1115
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,209
no one knows what's going on and, and it's,

1116
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:52,149
you're not wrong.

1117
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:55,310
I think that's a really good point. And I,

1118
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:56,449
yeah,

1119
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,050
-- it, it's,
-- I mean, I think part of it too is just these link.

1120
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,199
Like here's the reality, being able to ship code faster and update code faster,

1121
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:05,169
ignoring the security implications of that.

1122
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,969
It gives you a competitive advantage

1123
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:09,469
end of story.

1124
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,649
So there's, there's an incentive to do that now, which is good,

1125
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:13,550
you know,

1126
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:17,750
um, things like encryption, you know, you kind of have to encrypt everything now,

1127
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,550
otherwise I SPS will start monkeying with

1128
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,389
traffic and inserting ads into your website.

1129
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:23,429
They aren't generating revenue for you.

1130
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:26,120
So the websites will want to start encrypting everything

1131
00:46:26,129 --> 00:46:27,820
because they want to protect their ad revenue.

1132
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:29,139
Yeah.

1133
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,040
Yeah. Right.

1134
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:35,600
Well, and it, it affects the user experience if you have people kind of monkey.

1135
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:39,699
Oh, and you remind me, you know, adding things in between is uh cert

1136
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:40,989
just a note.

1137
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,979
Was it last week a couple days ago? Maybe that uh

1138
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:49,199
they believe that the like corporate uh TLS man in the middle devices,

1139
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,899
the things that basically decrypt web traffic, inspect it,

1140
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,800
re encrypt it and then ship it back to whoever's requesting it.

1141
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:55,300
Uh

1142
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,560
They may be

1143
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,580
unsafe.

1144
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,370
Well, and, and it's funny because I've been saying for a long time, you know,

1145
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:05,330
if your security posture depends on you behaving like a hostile nation state,

1146
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,810
which is essentially, you know, http s decryption and interception.

1147
00:47:09,129 --> 00:47:12,689
People like Google are like out to prevent that period

1148
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,250
and even better, you know, TLS version 1.3 it's still in draft,

1149
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,209
but fundamentally TLS 1.3 does perfect forward secrecy,

1150
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,199
full stop.

1151
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,969
So doing interception and decryption of

1152
00:47:22,979 --> 00:47:26,080
that traffic will become incredibly difficult,

1153
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,219
-- if not
-- impossible, become impossible at all.

1154
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:29,159
Because I mean,

1155
00:47:29,169 --> 00:47:31,860
we're talking about like corporate man in the middle

1156
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,590
firewalls that have installed their cert on your system.

1157
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,489
It's essentially

1158
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:38,000
trust star.

1159
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,350
So literally, any website

1160
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:40,679
can

1161
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,840
show

1162
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:40,979
the

1163
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:41,270
thing

1164
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:41,560
is

1165
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,479
like, for example, you know,

1166
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,790
Google Chrome and stuff are doing certificate pinning.

1167
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,330
-- Uh
-- they are, which is really good. And that,

1168
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:48,649
of

1169
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,629
course, and that's what I mean is essentially

1170
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:53,449
for some subset of traffic, you know, for example,

1171
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:56,389
if the website is doing certificate pinning and the web browser isn't,

1172
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:56,979
you know,

1173
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:01,189
um I know currently, for example, like web browsers are explicitly, you know,

1174
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,800
being said to, you know, if you have a manually installed Shain

1175
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,820
certificate, you know, it's OK to trust,

1176
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:08,770
you know, but if it's like from the default trust store don't,

1177
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,169
-- right?
-- But except

1178
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,409
if you're in a corporate environment, you have to remember. I mean,

1179
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:17,340
you and I have what, what do we call it? Like self service

1180
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,610
workstations where we basically get to do whatever we want.

1181
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,169
Like there are a lot of people that are literally handed a computer that is,

1182
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:29,409
every bit of it has been configured by their IT department and in many instances, it,

1183
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:30,889
it's not good.

1184
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,770
They've made terrible mistakes like some of these.

1185
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:35,330
Well, I shouldn't even say terrible.

1186
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:38,719
I, I had a discussion with like an actual security guy.

1187
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,300
It was an infosec person where they were very much operational focused

1188
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,260
and

1189
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,179
we were,

1190
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:48,919
he thought that these HTTP S interceptors in a corporate environment

1191
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,110
are a good thing because you can view the traffic.

1192
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,750
And I'm like, this is a terrible thing.

1193
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,459
Like, can you even tell me how your key is protected? And of course, he couldn't

1194
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:59,899
and well, it creates a really massive single point of failure.

1195
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:03,120
But here's the thing, right?

1196
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,659
At some point, the web browsers,

1197
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,879
you know, and by web browsers, I mean, like Chrome Firefox and

1198
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,719
you know, whatever internet explorer is being called now

1199
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:15,399
because really those, you know, and, and then the, you know,

1200
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:18,489
and uh what is it Safari on the Apple devices?

1201
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,280
And uh what the heck do Android devices run? I don't even know anyways.

1202
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,320
OK. So Chrome,

1203
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:24,580
so

1204
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,080
we were down to four browsers.

1205
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,179
Yeah.

1206
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:27,469
Well,

1207
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,590
basically we're down to four main browsers and at

1208
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,449
some point these guys are gonna be like,

1209
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:35,419
yeah, you know what we this this whole SSL interception thing,

1210
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:36,699
it's more bad than good.

1211
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:39,889
And they're gonna, you know, for example, maybe, you know,

1212
00:49:39,899 --> 00:49:42,540
have certificate pinning that doesn't allow you to

1213
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:44,530
-- bypass it with this, you know, custom
-- cert,

1214
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,239
there's gonna be ways around it.

1215
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:47,780
And these,

1216
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,669
these man in the middle vendors are

1217
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,219
gonna have plugins that disable certificate pinning and

1218
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,800
there's always gonna be something you can do. And it kind of reminds me of antivirus.

1219
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:58,510
And in fact,

1220
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,850
I antivirus, these, this stuff is,

1221
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,399
is terribly written software and Tavis has just been ripping it up

1222
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,429
and there's still tons of people who think, oh,

1223
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:13,370
you need antivirus and it's like you're probably more at risk with it than without at

1224
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:13,949
this.

1225
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:14,729
Well, actually that,

1226
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,070
that came up too with was how these antivirus vendors

1227
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,199
are tying into the web browsers to do http S

1228
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:23,070
traffic inspection and stuff.

1229
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,590
And uh because there were some bugs in the Mozilla, you know,

1230
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,719
uh in the like Firefox bug tracker talking

1231
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,270
about what these vendors were doing and it,

1232
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,879
it's horrifying like they basically like Rube Goldberg

1233
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,070
the worst possible way they could

1234
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:39,310
traffic. And

1235
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:40,629
I mean,

1236
00:50:40,979 --> 00:50:44,239
this is not dissimilar, in my opinion of,

1237
00:50:44,399 --> 00:50:44,919
you know,

1238
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,949
these systems are probably cobbled together with various

1239
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,070
bits of pieces of string and sticks they found

1240
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:52,949
and

1241
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:56,790
just given the nature of this and the way you're talking these,

1242
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,659
these large enterprises and it costs piles of money to

1243
00:50:59,669 --> 00:51:03,120
get this stuff that security researchers aren't looking at these.

1244
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:04,250
Yeah,

1245
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,550
it's,

1246
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,239
it's horrifying man.

1247
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:10,280
Um If you, you know,

1248
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,229
so one of the classic metrics of how secure is this

1249
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,600
code is how much are people willing to pay for,

1250
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,479
you know, security, like vulnerabilities in the code?

1251
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,120
Right.

1252
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:23,219
And honestly, like for some security firms that buy vulnerabilities,

1253
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,669
they just won't even bother buying flaws in certain, you know,

1254
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:29,100
products because there's just so many flaws.

1255
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,219
And I do, I do remember there was a couple of antivirus,

1256
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:34,939
uh corporate solutions where they were just like, yeah, no, we,

1257
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:36,020
we just don't care anymore.

1258
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,379
Like

1259
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:37,620
some I remember

1260
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,530
or there was like that backup solution where the

1261
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,399
guy went through and found like 100 vulnerabilities.

1262
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:42,020
And then the,

1263
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,689
you know, the company buying these flaws was just like,

1264
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,010
OK, we're done like,

1265
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,889
yeah, that's it. We, we don't care about this product anymore.

1266
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:51,149
It's just so terrible. All we can say is don't use it,

1267
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,389
right. You know,

1268
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,280
and that's,

1269
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:55,520
I

1270
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:55,939
mean,

1271
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,060
but it's tough because apparently there are in some,

1272
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:00,199
in some industries,

1273
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,199
there's regulations that they have to be able

1274
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:03,949
to inspect the traffic on their network.

1275
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,419
So you, it's like the whole PC I compliance thing where it's like,

1276
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,260
you know, PC I compliance says we have to have an antivirus scanner on every server.

1277
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,919
Well, but you know, this is a database server running UNIX,

1278
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:16,760
what

1279
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,889
C

1280
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:17,760
A

1281
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,320
V

1282
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:18,889
solves

1283
00:52:20,629 --> 00:52:21,570
it does.

1284
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:22,159
But

1285
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:22,969
I

1286
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:23,389
mean,

1287
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,780
you know, with these cases where like to be

1288
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:29,600
essentially to obey the law, I have to do something stupid

1289
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:30,310
or,

1290
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,620
you know, I get the spirit of the law was one thing, but unfortunately, you know,

1291
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:34,760
the auditors aren't going to,

1292
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,010
you know, they're not going to go with the spirit of the law.

1293
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,060
They're gonna go with like what it says,

1294
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:40,550
you know.

1295
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,959
Yes,

1296
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,189
it

1297
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,320
like to get an exception is gonna be

1298
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,100
-- a lot harder than just buying an antivirus
-- program

1299
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,709
on this. And, well, and this is gonna be one of the challenges is,

1300
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:55,600
there's a lot of infosec people who think

1301
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,649
they need antivirus for a variety of reasons.

1302
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:01,300
And in fact, one of the people I, I brought this up with someone and like,

1303
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,719
they didn't know who Tavis was or what he was doing,

1304
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,729
-- which is why,
-- why would you, was he an antivirus guy or a

1305
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:07,399
security guy? Infosec

1306
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:08,500
just random

1307
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:09,139
infosec and he

1308
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,320
doesn't know who Tavis is,

1309
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,580
but here's the deal, man. I mean, not everyone does. Sorry Tavis,

1310
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,649
but it, I get it,

1311
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,189
there's so much going on in the universe.

1312
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,750
And in fact, I, I had someone asked me at one point, you know,

1313
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,949
do you know this security guy?

1314
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:26,790
And I'm like, I don't know if you heard of this person and like, oh, I really like him.

1315
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,449
I'm like, great, you know, there's like

1316
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,889
thousands of them. I wish I knew them all.

1317
00:53:30,899 --> 00:53:32,989
-- But I don't,
-- the thing I always keep in mind is, you know,

1318
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,429
the majority of these people have like a solid,

1319
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,590
more than 40 hours a week of just putting out forest fires.

1320
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,780
Yeah. Right. They don't have time to necessarily

1321
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,750
deal with or just to learn in many cases to

1322
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:47,419
read Twitter for an hour

1323
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:50,820
and see what Tavis is up to. You know. Like,

1324
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,979
that's my sad excuse of an evening.

1325
00:53:54,479 --> 00:53:54,689
Yeah.

1326
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,139
So, no, it's, I get it, but at the same time, yeah, it, it's,

1327
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,370
that's one thing that's always gotten me about infosec is, you know, we,

1328
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:06,889
we are actually quite terrible at disseminating information internally.

1329
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,379
Like, how many web developers have you run into that? Have never heard of? Oap.

1330
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:14,260
-- I bet there's probably
-- 90%

1331
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:14,500
I

1332
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:16,169
would say, probably 90%.

1333
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:17,290
Yeah. And they should

1334
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:20,919
know the open web application security project, I think is what that stands for.

1335
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:21,159
I don't even

1336
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,350
know

1337
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,149
they've been around for like, 10 years at this

1338
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,610
more than that. I bet more than that.

1339
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,100
So,

1340
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,699
I mean, yeah, it's, I, you know, that's the thing, like, it's

1341
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:36,919
things like uh new languages have definitely, you know, gotten out.

1342
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:37,419
I mean, and I,

1343
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:40,729
you look at some of these uh language communities and they do an amazing

1344
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:44,659
job of educating people about their languages and what they can and cannot do.

1345
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:47,449
You know, and, and then these languages rise, you know,

1346
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:49,379
up for a variety of re like javascript.

1347
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:51,310
Right? Clearly that thing is, you know,

1348
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,020
it's, it's doing well, you know,

1349
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,060
um,

1350
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,540
you know, and they've got amazing resources, amazing,

1351
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,290
teaching amazing code libraries, right.

1352
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,760
But then you start looking at the security side of it and it's like,

1353
00:55:04,459 --> 00:55:04,469
uh,

1354
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:07,409
you know,

1355
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:08,909
yes.

1356
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,669
Anyway, anyway, we're,

1357
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,020
uh,

1358
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:12,510
we're not gonna solve this today.

1359
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,530
This is, this is one of the problems though, is how do you decide what is,

1360
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,709
or isn't correct?

1361
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,879
And even things like antivirus don't have obvious answers necessarily. Like,

1362
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,110
in my instance,

1363
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,820
I know Tavis, I know how smart he is.

1364
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,750
So I'm inclined to trust him, but there's a lot of people who don't.

1365
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,590
And so why should they listen to this guy?

1366
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:34,189
It's, it's tough, man. I mean,

1367
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:36,959
there aren't always good answers and I guess this is kind of

1368
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:41,120
where things like regulation and compliance are meant to be the leveler,

1369
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,560
but even those are, are so far behind in some cases

1370
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,580
it, it's,

1371
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,459
and they're not universal, right? I mean,

1372
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,080
so what if one company has great, you know, regulation and compliance,

1373
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,699
if the companies don't like it,

1374
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:56,500
they'll just move operations offshore or outsource them

1375
00:55:57,129 --> 00:56:00,510
if, you know, it becomes too costly or too much of a pain. Right. Exactly.

1376
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:01,959
You know,

1377
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,159
um,

1378
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:07,040
the one thing I'm hoping to do is, you know, add transparency and data so that,

1379
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,699
you know, you can make an informed decision.

1380
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:10,429
Like, so that, for example, with CV ES,

1381
00:56:10,439 --> 00:56:12,639
we'll have more information about who found this, who

1382
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,270
helped patch it, who helped whatever, right?

1383
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,540
And thus you'll be able to be like, you know,

1384
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,469
you'll look up Tavis arm and then you'll be like, oh, wow.

1385
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:24,040
You know, this guy's got a big pile of high quality CV S and products I care about.

1386
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,820
Therefore, you know, maybe I should listen to him.

1387
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,120
Yeah. You know,

1388
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,860
maybe we recently had a case where this guy posted some, you know, it was a colonel CV.

1389
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:34,590
And it was like,

1390
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:38,719
who is this guy? Right. And, like, his information doesn't seem quite right.

1391
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,739
And I, I, you know, Google stalked him a bit and I'm like, well, he

1392
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,070
sort of seems legit, but I've never really heard of this person or their work.

1393
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,570
So, and I don't know.

1394
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,050
Yeah,

1395
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:52,500
I don't know, man. I don't know. All right. Anyway, let's, let's bring it home.

1396
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,919
We're not gonna solve this today.

1397
00:56:55,709 --> 00:57:00,689
Anyway. Thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt for the conversation.

1398
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:03,560
If you want to see any of the show notes or any

1399
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,689
of the links to any of the crazy things we talk about.

1400
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:08,409
You can go to open source security podcast.com.

1401
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,179
We have links there to Twitter and a Facebook group.

1402
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:13,439
You are welcome to join and chat with us

1403
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:18,040
if you are horrified by any of the legal advice we did not give today.

1404
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,830
Uh Please, by all means, let me know.

1405
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,489
I'm happy to correct myself in future episodes because I am not a lawyer

1406
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:27,429
and please for the love of God, don't take anything. We talk about

1407
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,159
legal advice under any circumstances.

1408
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,350
Uh Well, of course, keep an eye on this, this, uh, case though,

1409
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,770
with the contempt of court to see what happens and if anything exciting goes on,

1410
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,909
we'll, we'll surely speak of it.

1411
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:38,229
But,

1412
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:41,489
yeah, I guess if nothing else, Kurt, you have a fabulous day.

1413
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,909
Thank you for listening. Everybody.

1414
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:44,590
And until next time, folks,

1415
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,959
yeah, I guess, uh, I guess the,

1416
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:49,350
the important note is write your passwords down somewhere safe,

1417
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,840
so you don't end up in jail forever.

1418
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,659
-- That's right.
-- Keep them under your keyboard. I take a note.

1419
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:53,510
All right.

1420
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,389
We'll get to probably password managers next week because

1421
00:57:57,399 --> 00:57:59,310
Tavis is tearing those up right now too.

1422
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,860
So

1423
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,530
he just ripped a big hole in the last time.

1424
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,149
It's only

1425
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,239
code execution.

1426
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,030
We're all doomed. Kurt, we're all doomed.

1427
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:10,020
All right. Thanks, folks. Have a good one. Bye bye.
