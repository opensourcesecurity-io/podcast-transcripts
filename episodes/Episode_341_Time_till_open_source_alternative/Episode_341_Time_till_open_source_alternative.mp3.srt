Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:12,210
and my partner are avoiding advertising, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,560
Oh, I know.

3
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,239
I know we were just complaining about

4
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:19,000
chrome we'll say is starting shenanigans with,

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,950
with ad blockers.

6
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,430
-- Yeah,
-- we're making it better. So you can't block ads. It'll be better.

7
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:25,059
That's right. Well, it's better not for us.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,739
There was like some very convoluted Google statement

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,250
about why this is better for us.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,290
And I'm like, I don't think that's the case.

11
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:36,250
-- Yeah,
-- we all, we all know, we all know and, and look, they're a company,

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,450
they need to make money.

13
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:41,150
-- I'm not going to knock them, but I'm going to continue running
-- Firefox.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,099
I feel so bad for them because they've desperately tried to diversify to

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,490
the point of like forming the alphabet thing to hold all the companies.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,189
But it's like,

17
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,479
no, it's still like 90 what is it? Five or 98% of their

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,560
profits come from advertising revenue through Google.

19
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,700
I mean, you know, this is maybe a topic for another day,

20
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,060
but if you look at the history of the vast majority of companies,

21
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:03,849
there are

22
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:08,429
an exceedingly small number of large corporations that have managed to

23
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,429
radically change direction

24
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,708
in a meaningful way.

25
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,988
It is. It is very, very rare.

26
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,988
Like nokia started out making toilet paper and

27
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,988
somehow ended up making cell phones and,

28
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,588
and how's that going now?

29
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,289
-- Like,
-- well, I, I,

30
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:23,988
but they managed the transition and for a while they were amazing.

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,870
Yeah.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,720
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. 100%.

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,040
I mean,

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,970
Nintendo is probably a good study for that too

35
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,029
because they started making playing cards and that's games

36
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:32,550
and,

37
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,000
yeah, I, I guess, I guess,

38
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,500
but there's even some funny stories in that of how they

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,559
kind of went from cards to where they are today.

40
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,540
And that's a whole another story.

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,239
Anyway, I have a hilarious thing to tell you about my internal network problems.

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,569
Right.

43
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:51,620
-- With the, the disastrous laptop.
-- Yes. Right. That's right. My laptop.

44
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:55,172
So, so the laptop, the, the network would go down with Linux

45
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:57,542
and Windows. So, obviously I know it's not Linux.

46
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:58,703
I know it's Windows,

47
00:01:58,712 --> 00:02:01,983
which I didn't know when we told the story a couple of episodes ago.

48
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:05,362
And I've done an enormous amount of testing trying to

49
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:08,301
figure this out and I literally cannot figure it out.

50
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:08,912
Ok.

51
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:14,783
Now I had a friend visit me literally just yesterday and, uh, he, his,

52
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:18,852
his name is Joe and he's an old, old friend of mine from, from like, pre college days

53
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,826
and he listens to the show

54
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,985
and I said, did you listen to the episode because he's a networking guy.

55
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:26,675
I'm like, did you listen to the episode about my, my networking problem?

56
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,406
He's like, no, not yet. I said sorry. Ok.

57
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,666
So I explained it to him and everything and he goes, did you check the cable?

58
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:35,145
I'm like, no, it's in the wall. He's like, not the cable in the wall. You idiot.

59
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,835
The patch cable between the wall and your computer. I'm like,

60
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,425
no, he's like, I bet you it's a bad patch cable.

61
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,796
Yeah, you wouldn't think to because it's a patch cable.

62
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,966
Like, how does it get damaged to go bad? So,

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,600
it, I'm pretty sure it's a patch cable.

64
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:53,350
See, and that's what frustrates me is unless you buy like a $10,000 fluke meter.

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,550
Like, yeah, pin one is pin, one, pin two is pin two. Sure. It's a good cable.

66
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah. Yeah. And, and

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,160
he said it's, it's probably something wrong with the patch cable,

68
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,490
something wrong with one of the ends

69
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,800
and when it was going to sleep it was

70
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:09,039
like ARP nonsense into the network for whatever reason.

71
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,520
And you had some weird

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,940
crossover something. I don't, I don't, I'm not a network person. I don't get it.

73
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,369
But anyway, I did a bunch of testing. In fact, I can't even reproduce it.

74
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,160
Now, with the original cable

75
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,082
cut that cable in half with scissors and put in the garbage.

76
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:25,832
-- No, I've not cut it in half yet. But the point
-- is that's a rule.

77
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,983
I have the minute I suspect a cable of being evil,

78
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,572
especially because lighting cables especially,

79
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,442
I don't know what it is about lightning cables.

80
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,432
But after like 3 to 6 months they just,

81
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,283
they only work, put one way into the phone or like half my phone.

82
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,123
And so the minute that starts happening,

83
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,123
I take a scissor, cut them in, half, throw them in the garbage because I'm, I'm,

84
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,703
I'm done fighting bad cables

85
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,246
honestly though, like in hindsight,

86
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:49,686
-- why I didn't replace the patch cable immediately
-- because it's a patch cable.

87
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:54,576
It worked, I guess. I, you know. Right. Like I have a bunch of patch cables.

88
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,026
I would never think that

89
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:59,656
they're, how do they go bad? Like, do they rot? Do they go stale?

90
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,865
Do, do you need to put them in a Ziploc?

91
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:06,085
I can't even reproduce it now with the same patch cable. But I, I have unplugged it

92
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,279
since

93
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,199
in all my testing,

94
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,839
but I haven't plugged it back in and then reproduced it and now I can't reproduce it.

95
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,500
So I wonder if it was even just plugged

96
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,960
in cockeyed because it's been plugged in for months.

97
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,160
Like, anyway, whatever it is.

98
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,089
I mean, well, this is the number one rule of network cabling management is like,

99
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,130
the first thing you do is unplug and plug it back in

100
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,970
-- to make sure it goes in smooth. And like I didn't do that.
-- I bought a new switch

101
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:30,649
mostly

102
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,269
unplug and plug

103
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:31,869
everything.

104
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:32,769
Yeah,

105
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,049
it was a patch cable

106
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,690
or whatever. I have no regrets. My switches were old.

107
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,489
They probably needed to be replaced anyway.

108
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,720
But just like

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,679
whatever, whatever.

110
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,850
That's the thing I like about my new old switches.

111
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,450
So it turns out I bought switches that were like, last supported in 2018.

112
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,920
Well, no one knows this. So I, I, Kurt and I have been

113
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,040
discussing my saga

114
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,179
and when I told Kurt, I bought all new switches.

115
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,399
He was like, oh, I should probably buy new switches too.

116
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,920
So, but you bought newer switches that are end of life, right.

117
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:04,000
-- Well,
-- they were end of life like in 2018.

118
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,320
Right?

119
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:08,825
But basically I just wanted like a low end smart switch for, well, if I do need V

120
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,515
lands or quality service, I can turn it on.

121
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,744
But more to the point I've got error reporting, like broke.

122
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,204
No, no, no, like broken frames and stuff. Right. Like, um

123
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:20,625
-- it probably would have been handy if I had that just saying.
-- Yeah, exactly. Right.

124
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:22,755
And that's, and that's what I realized is I want to switch.

125
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:25,385
That is just smart enough to basically say like, yeah,

126
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,864
I'm seeing a ton of garbage frames from this port.

127
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,940
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, anyway. All right, that's enough.

128
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,500
And I want a spanning tree because my, my existing,

129
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,179
apparently most modern cheapo unmanaged switches don't even do STP anymore,

130
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,250
which, ok, fair enough.

131
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,720
They're like

132
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,100
30 bucks,

133
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,339
like, you know, that silicon costs five bucks, I guess. I don't know.

134
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,320
But, yeah, I wanted, I wanted air management primarily.

135
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,130
Like, that's the reason I loved smart on the old hard drives is like,

136
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:52,040
oh,

137
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:53,760
I've got a few errors on this hard drive and then

138
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,700
I remember checking one drive in my pool and it had,

139
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,790
like, 27,000 errors.

140
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,399
So I'm like, oh, time to buy a new one

141
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,609
-- drives still do
-- smart. Yeah, but on S sds, it doesn't really matter.

142
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:05,609
Like mechanical hard drives can sort of start to slowly fail

143
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:08,250
and you get a bit of a warning. Whereas with an SSD, it's like,

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,809
-- you know, I've never had an SSD go bad on me.
-- I think I had one early one die.

145
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,329
But like we're talking like this is from like in the,

146
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:16,440
like this

147
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,420
literally like two years after they were available for laptops.

148
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:22,855
Uh See, I actually, I don't know if you remember this,

149
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:26,035
but you and I used to argue incessantly over S sds where I was

150
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,445
just trolling you and saying they're unnecessary and dumb way back in those days.

151
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,625
That was a, that amuses me to no end anyway.

152
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,845
All right, we have a real topic today that isn't just us

153
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:34,345
cet

154
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,635
about hardware

155
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,454
time t open source.

156
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,454
I'm excited for this one. So

157
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,904
for anyone who doesn't know, I'll put a link in the show notes,

158
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,625
but there is a blog post that

159
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,614
Andre Stoltz.

160
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,565
I apologize. Andre for

161
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:48,739
pronouncing your name,

162
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:52,869
wrote a blog post called Time to Open Source Alternative. And this is from

163
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,619
-- August 27th. I thought, I feel like this is older than that.
-- It's pretty recent,

164
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,209
14 days ago.

165
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,000
What? No,

166
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,190
-- what?
-- It's September the 11th

167
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,130
Kurt.

168
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,410
If you would have asked me how long ago this story came out,

169
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,549
I would have told you a minimum of six months

170
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,709
that sums up my September

171
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,589
in the modern timeline. That sounds about right.

172
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:11,880
Uh

173
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:12,940
Anyway,

174
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,000
so what happens here is

175
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:15,679
Andrew

176
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:21,334
kind of laid down a bunch of technologies like the UNIX Autocad, MATLAB, Winzip,

177
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,704
youtube, Twitter and then has

178
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:26,024
the publish on like kind of the date this

179
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:28,614
this product will say our technology was released.

180
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,484
And then he has another column that says open source alternative and obviously,

181
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,584
like UNIX has an alternative of Linux,

182
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,364
right?

183
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,105
And then he's got the number that is time to open source alternative,

184
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:41,744
like in the case of UNIX to Linux at 6560 days.

185
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,744
But anyway, and I think the

186
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,209
I feel like the intent of this maybe was to try

187
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,119
to justify that the time to open source alternative is maybe

188
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:56,220
becoming faster because if you look way back in the nineties versus

189
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,290
more recent things, the time is, you know,

190
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:01,079
thousands and thousands of days and it's much less now,

191
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,440
the velocity of software in general has

192
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,119
it's

193
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,589
you and I literally bought Linux in a box on a CD.

194
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:13,600
-- I bought a book that had a CD in the back and I threw the book away.
-- Yeah, exactly.

195
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,660
Like I remember getting, you know, Wordperfect and,

196
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,140
and then two or three years later I would buy the new version of wordperfect.

197
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,600
Like there was no concept of downloading an update.

198
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,980
Like we hadn't, we barely had the wet back then,

199
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,399
-- you
-- know.

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,489
-- Yeah. And you paid for upgrades
-- like Windows 3.11

201
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,210
was an upgrade from Windows 3.1. And it's like,

202
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,489
it's not like I was downloading patches every other Tuesday.

203
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,070
Was that a free upgrade or did you have to buy the new? I don't, I don't remember.

204
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,729
Well, in hindsight now,

205
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,659
I understand that Windows cost money but like the computer we bought,

206
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,289
came with Windows 3.11 for work preloaded.

207
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,979
And like, again, in hindsight, we didn't pay for it. So,

208
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:53,070
-- I mean,
-- I guess I, I remember

209
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,429
what was it was?

210
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,700
Well,

211
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,119
I remember I bought a computer at Windows 95 and then I feel

212
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,030
like I might have hired an NT for it way back in the day

213
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,830
when I was uh like a high school kid.

214
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,739
I used to have a Windows 95 license key

215
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,349
memorized the uh the local University of Alberta one.

216
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,869
-- Anyway.
-- Anyway. Ok.

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,419
So here's the actual direction I want to take is we could

218
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,270
go through this list and talk about time to open social alternatives.

219
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,880
And I think in some instances

220
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,830
the examples found are good in some instances I don't necessarily agree with them.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,109
I want to say there's one big problem with his list,

222
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,869
which is he conflates services and software.

223
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,369
Ok. Yes, that's part of it.

224
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,609
But I'm more interested in fact in,

225
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,590
in talking about security things

226
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,080
-- because there aren't, are there any real security items on
-- this list?

227
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,369
One password?

228
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,299
Yeah, there's,

229
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:40,219
there's, but

230
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,849
ok, yes, one password was one of the ones I wanted to actually discuss, I think,

231
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:48,770
well, bit keeper sort of security. That the Bit Keeper story a whole another.

232
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,539
That's something

233
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,580
when I said bite,

234
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:52,400
I was thinking of bit warden. Never

235
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,010
mind. Yeah.

236
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,690
Yeah. Right. Bit keeper and git. Whoops. Sorry.

237
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,080
-- No, no, that's fine.
-- I'm literally having my coffee right now.

238
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:00,929
It's, it's like

239
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,510
what, two, it's three

240
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:03,880
this morning,

241
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,599
which explains like why my brain has just not been firing on all cylinders

242
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,890
I could if II I,

243
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,109
I'm super addicted to caffeine at this point.

244
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,599
If I don't drink coffee probably by eight or nine in the morning,

245
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:15,880
I will have a raging headache.

246
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,429
So that's just out of the question.

247
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,630
And it's funny because I go to the doctor and they're like,

248
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,590
you should cut back. I'm like, don't even bother. There's,

249
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,460
you're wasting your time. I'm not gonna quit drinking coffee.

250
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,179
I don't care like, whatever it's my life now

251
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,039
I give up.

252
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,179
Uh, ok. Ok. So anyway,

253
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,929
so here's what I think we should frame this as is

254
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:37,530
the, there,

255
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,369
there's not a lot of security stuff in here but I feel like

256
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,229
there's a reason there's not a lot of security stuff in here because

257
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:45,479
how many security products

258
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:46,710
can you name

259
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,239
that have a truly open

260
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,630
source alternative?

261
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,440
I think if anything, many of them started open source and unopen

262
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:57,229
-- source.
-- Yeah, I was gonna say like the only ones that kind of

263
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,289
uh commercial and then, well,

264
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,309
but the thing is like uh key pass X or whatever has been around for so long.

265
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,570
I suspect it kind of came out about the same time as closed source password managers,

266
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:08,820
right?

267
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,580
Um I mean, and yeah, famously like um well,

268
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,859
the good examples would be N map was open source still is open source

269
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,520
but their sort of data set of

270
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,979
identifying network devices based on their TCP fingerprints

271
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:20,789
is

272
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,840
no longer as open source as it was or same thing with tenable, sorry with

273
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,179
-- NSA, which turned into tenable.
-- Oh, dude.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,729
Keep

275
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,229
pa

276
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,450
is dead.

277
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,539
What?

278
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,669
Yeah. Ok. Ok. So I just looked uh key

279
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,489
pass X came out in 2005 but on the Wikipedia page,

280
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,000
it says as of December 2021 key pass X is no longer actively maintained.

281
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,109
There's a fork called key

282
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,429
pass

283
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,849
-- XC. Now the first one came out in 2005, sorry
-- key

284
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,219
pass

285
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,330
XC

286
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,650
-- XC is the new fork the community fork.
-- Oh, ok.

287
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,599
Because yeah, the last release of Key pass X was in 2016.

288
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:56,380
-- So that's definitely,
-- but I mean, so this is,

289
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,450
I think this is one of the interesting stories

290
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,969
though is if you look at the security products and

291
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:07,789
it it like one password versus Bit Warden is the example we'll pick on right now.

292
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,169
So bit

293
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,150
worden is

294
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,169
we'll say bit Warden's code is open source, right?

295
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,369
But I would hesitate to necessarily say bit Warden is

296
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,809
truly open source from the context of it's a service,

297
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,320
right?

298
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,989
You can run your own bit

299
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,729
Warden.

300
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:26,479
But I think this is where in my mind and this is,

301
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,690
this is what I want us to talk about and this is what I was hoping

302
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,679
we could untangle because I actually don't know

303
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,330
what your opinion is on this necessarily.

304
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,950
But something like like bit

305
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,530
Warden or or we can pick on git lab

306
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,039
is another good example of there are the they are they are open source.

307
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,109
So there's the operational aspect,

308
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,590
it's really hard to run this stuff, right?

309
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,270
Well, let's just go with simply something very simple with operational aspects.

310
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,520
So from an operational aspect, there's a lot of applications now

311
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,969
that I want to have

312
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,890
either collaborative editing or

313
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,409
the synchronization of data to some degree.

314
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,690
So like as a very simplistic example, you know, I use omni

315
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:04,330
focus

316
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,150
and my to do list better be the same on my phone is on my ipad is on my desktop

317
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,929
because otherwise I'm gonna have a bad time. So that means synchronization.

318
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,099
Well,

319
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:14,200
that means having something to synchronize to and you can run

320
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,770
your own web DEV server and I have in the past.

321
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,510
But then they added encryption of the data using your own encryption key.

322
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,489
And I'm like, oh, I'm just going to pay them to do it because

323
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:26,020
-- again, operationally, this means now I have to care and feed a server
-- bit bit

324
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,880
warden has a service you can pay them for.

325
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,049
And bit warden also has all of their stuff like open source.

326
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,080
In fact, you can literally just run your own bit warden infrastructure,

327
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,719
they have instructions to deploy it.

328
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,270
But at the same time,

329
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:38,909
like if

330
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,770
in the company goes away,

331
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,559
bit ward in the open source, I think is functionally dead

332
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,619
unless somebody decides to take on it and wrap a company around it.

333
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,679
Yeah, because the the amount of work and effort and there's a lot of

334
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,809
like there's a lot of boring work and boring effort

335
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,200
needed for these things that are not super awesome.

336
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,530
Yeah, I mean, Git lab, I think is the same story.

337
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,500
If git lab, the corporation disappeared.

338
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,280
I don't think Git lab, the the product would continue to exist.

339
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,880
And I think this is true of an enormous amount of open source, especially security,

340
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,820
open source stuff because I think a lot of this work sucks

341
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,309
and no one wants to do it unless they're literally paid to do it.

342
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, I think it's actually worse than that in that if, for example,

343
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,349
a company like git lab or whatever goes away, their stuff doesn't die.

344
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,059
It's sort of just

345
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,929
zombies along

346
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,000
if it died,

347
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,369
that would actually almost be better because it would force people to deal with it or

348
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,530
to come up with a new solution or to actually properly fund it or whatever.

349
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,099
But instead you get this situation where they kind of keep you.

350
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,530
It's like all the people still using Windows 95 because

351
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,729
they have to for some piece of hardware or something

352
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,869
and they're just sort of zombie along with this like stale out of date software.

353
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,190
That's

354
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,359
-- one day is just gonna fail.
-- OK? Hold on, hold on

355
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,950
you. You may have brought up a really good point accidentally.

356
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,210
So if I'm running Windows 95 today,

357
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:55,130
I am sol like I am. There's absolutely nothing I can do

358
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,950
if I'm running

359
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,489
some product

360
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:01,820
and I have the source code to that

361
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,159
-- I could theoretically do stuff
-- theoretically. Right. And that's the thing, like

362
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,380
how many people on this planet have the expertise to go into the,

363
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,349
let's say anything with crypto

364
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:16,419
-- code base and fix it properly.
-- Oh, barely anyone. I agree.

365
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:19,619
And I think that's where the theoretical part comes into play because

366
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,260
the Linux,

367
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:24,575
oh, here's the source code. Sure, you can just fix your device driver.

368
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:25,544
No,

369
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,424
-- no, you really can't.
-- No, no. Hang on, hang on, hang on you.

370
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:29,765
I think you're missing the point.

371
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:35,445
So if, if you and I are running the Linux kernel and we encounter a bug,

372
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,145
we can file the bug

373
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,364
and pray someone takes pity on us and does something about it.

374
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,844
And, and at the same time,

375
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:46,299
I would bet you 80 or 90% of Linux kernel development is

376
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,520
by people who are paid to work on the Linux kernel,

377
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:48,710
right?

378
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,900
Like these are not volunteers.

379
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:53,940
It my guess is it's probably like 95 to 99% but we'll be generous.

380
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,760
You and I are at the mercy of everyone. Now,

381
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,099
there is a size though, if I am a corporation.

382
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,375
Uh and if, and if there is a financial benefit to me, say building Linux patches

383
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,405
and, and including them in Linux,

384
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,275
there's a line somewhere.

385
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:13,125
And I think when you look at security products though,

386
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:17,554
I have a strong suspicion that the line of when is it

387
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:21,044
worth it for me to say fork something and keep it alive

388
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,065
is well past

389
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,250
any amount of money any company is willing to spend.

390
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,369
That is my suspicion for security products.

391
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:33,059
I think one of the dimensions here is it speaks to package and software complexity.

392
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,450
So a great example is the Linux,

393
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,039
the Linux kernel is, it's complicated

394
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,440
like it, it just is, I mean,

395
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,419
you can, but there's, for example,

396
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,320
there are PHP libraries that are not as complicated.

397
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,349
And so a great example of this is I needed. What was it, the PHP open ID plug in

398
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,890
to work so that I could have media wiki authenticate via open ID.

399
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,080
And the

400
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,760
software itself

401
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:57,799
was still being supported. But the Fedora package

402
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,570
wasn't the the developer just ned

403
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,119
out of her and never tried an update in ages and it was broken

404
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:07,260
in. And so I actually took ownership of it, did like the two line fix, got it working

405
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:08,920
and then I abandoned it

406
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,199
right

407
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,199
because I fixed it for myself,

408
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,719
you know,

409
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,979
I

410
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,400
I don't want to own a puppy.

411
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:15,308
Um

412
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,558
But so there's that aspect of sort of the complexity piece.

413
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,188
So for example,

414
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:22,468
taking a simple piece of software and fixing the packaged version of it,

415
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,628
like bringing it up to date

416
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,148
that is pretty doable, you know,

417
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:30,788
fixing a PHP library or something that's probably doable ish.

418
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:33,509
But like fixing the Linux kernel, like no,

419
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:37,048
like you're going to need so much knowledge and expertise that's domain specific.

420
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:40,208
Like I don't care how good of a programmer you are.

421
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:43,218
If you don't have at least 6 to 12 months of experience with the LINX kernel,

422
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,939
you're going to need that.

423
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,699
Sure.

424
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:46,890
Now, now, OK,

425
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,780
so here's the second part of this conversation now

426
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,910
and you actually like you introduce us perfectly.

427
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,459
If there is something I need to do,

428
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:57,770
I can go to a company like red hat or canonical or so

429
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,189
and say,

430
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to be your customer

431
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,010
and I need this thing fixed in the kernel

432
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,900
and they're going to ask for extra money obviously,

433
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,869
but like they are in a position to do that.

434
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,219
And so now

435
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,709
if you think about like this time to open source,

436
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,339
a lot of these open source services and, and in fact,

437
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,709
a lot of the things on the list of time to open source have,

438
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,050
have companies behind them.

439
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,349
And I think that's,

440
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,680
that's kind of part of that incentive is if we look at

441
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,540
something like bit warden or we look at something like git lab,

442
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,489
like you have a company behind that you can become their customer,

443
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,729
you can fund the development,

444
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:33,439
you don't have to go and find like some open source nerd who can create

445
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:36,989
patches and work with upstream because now you have a company to work with.

446
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,949
So here's the interesting thing when you look at this list, OK,

447
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,300
if you look at the top of the list, at the old stuff,

448
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,189
the open source alternatives are products,

449
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,819
which kind of makes sense because like services

450
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,430
just didn't exist back in those days.

451
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,020
And as we move down,

452
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:52,810
the services being replaced,

453
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:53,219
the

454
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,750
open source alternatives are not like community open

455
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,650
source projects.

456
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,619
They are corporate funded open

457
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
source projects.

458
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,729
-- I think the term generally is open core.
-- Uh No, no, no, no, not necessarily.

459
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:06,030
I mean, like git lab and matter,

460
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:06,640
not matter

461
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,680
most well matter most as well, but like git lab matter

462
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,329
most and,

463
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,719
and, uh, bit warden are like completely open source.

464
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,969
It's just, they're so complicated. No

465
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,959
human can run them

466
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,089
without.

467
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:22,729
I could give you all the schematics to a modern vehicle and you can't build it.

468
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:24,170
Aws is a better example.

469
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,930
If Amazon said here is all the source code to Aws Cart,

470
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,489
then there's nothing you could do with it.

471
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,319
Nothing

472
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,270
I'm gonna grip for, I'm gonna grip for rude words.

473
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,060
That's it

474
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,170
just to amuse myself.

475
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,650
And, and that's the thing though.

476
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:39,250
If you look at any modern service,

477
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,849
one human cannot

478
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:47,109
work with modern services because they're just so complicated and difficult.

479
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,329
The thing I'm realizing and this is I'm doing what I'm doing

480
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:52,160
with a lot of my work now with threat modeling and stuff is

481
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,449
writing it down because holding these mental models in my head,

482
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:59,000
even if I can hold a mental model in my head of what this thing is.

483
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,589
The model I'm holding in my head is different than the model you are holding in

484
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,910
your head and we're trying to discuss it

485
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,689
and we're both holding different models and,

486
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:06,790
and both are wrong.

487
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,050
Yeah. Oh Absolutely. Yeah, 100%.

488
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,790
And

489
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,660
yeah, the the other thing is operationally

490
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:15,589
like what people expect is the bare minimum nowadays.

491
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,229
Like I expect collaborative editing.

492
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,150
Like

493
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:21,020
this is why I I'm finding

494
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,869
git and github

495
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,060
very frustrating because I want to have like a text document with three people

496
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,670
editing and commenting

497
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,239
and you can't,

498
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,479
that sucks for that, man.

499
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:31,130
So we

500
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,380
use Google Docs which drives me nuts because then I can't index the text and blah,

501
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,760
blah, blah.

502
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,359
You know what I mean?

503
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,719
So you know what, what,

504
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:39,050
what I'm seeing is relatively successful use Google

505
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,520
Docs for like the first cut and then

506
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:41,910
get

507
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,319
and that's actually probably what I'm gonna end up doing.

508
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,000
Like here's a great example, right?

509
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,030
I was at elastic elastic is one of the examples of

510
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,719
something that was Apache to in change of license because in,

511
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,640
in the elastic instance, Amazon

512
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,729
took the elastic search,

513
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:59,969
just suite of stuff because it's, it's a huge amount of stuff

514
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:01,089
and they were

515
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,569
deploying it and,

516
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:04,849
and violating the trademark and all that stuff and like there were

517
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,250
a bunch of court cases that all kind of sorted itself out.

518
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,599
Well,

519
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,329
I'm going to interrupt because I think that's one aspect where

520
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,910
people got a lot of this wrong too is they,

521
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,439
they hear something like elastic and they just think elastic search,

522
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,489
they don't realize there's 20 things behind it or add it

523
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,199
on to it to actually really like dashboard stuff like can,

524
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:21,150
what is it? The one that starts with a KKK?

525
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,069
-- Sorry.
-- Yeah. But, and here's part of that story though, is

526
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,170
Amazon is one of the few organizations that could actually

527
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,810
run that stack in a manageable way for customers.

528
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:35,550
But fun fact, if you look at what Amazon actually did with it,

529
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,680
they sort of did the bare minimum and, and they forked it since.

530
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,630
And that's something I've noticed with a lot of these large companies,

531
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,869
it's not like they're devoting a team of 50 people to it.

532
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:47,989
They're like getting it stood up just enough so customers can run it and use it.

533
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,790
Because, for example, Amazon used to have their,

534
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,510
an actual Blockchain as a service thing

535
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,890
and they've abandoned it like, it's, it's a dead end.

536
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,910
They've got like, version 1.4 and that's it.

537
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,880
It never went past that. It's a quota

538
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,219
if memory serves.

539
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,390
And like, I guess they just didn't get enough customers or whatever.

540
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,069
And so it's just, it's a dead end and that's something like,

541
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,780
unless this thing is a success, the company is not gonna put

542
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,400
any resources into it more than they have to because, like,

543
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,689
that's how companies work,

544
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:17,449
you know?

545
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:18,969
Exactly.

546
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:24,180
But then the problem is that steals so much time and kind of market and effort from

547
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,250
sort of the, the, I hate to say the real one, but from the real one basically,

548
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:29,469
and then you get the, the,

549
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:32,920
the true open source one kind of atrophies and dies and then, well, it

550
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,670
-- just sort of goes away. Right, blows up and dries up.
-- Now,

551
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,430
here's, here's the last bit of this conversation for today and that is Sig Star,

552
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,380
right?

553
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,589
I think Sigs Star is, I think one of the most interesting projects today

554
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,839
because if you look at the history of

555
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:50,510
like encryption and key management and all that,

556
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,510
there's like tons of super overpriced terrible products

557
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,380
and, and

558
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:58,349
no one will disagree with me when I just literally call them all terrible. Right.

559
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,010
That is, that is not a point of contention.

560
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:03,650
It's the same sort of market as the certificate market was

561
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,290
it? It's they're literally, they're a circle

562
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,280
with be

563
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:07,510
die.

564
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,530
But here's the thing.

565
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,849
So Sig Store has

566
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,040
a ton of work coming into it.

567
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,880
Like obviously, like Google and Redhead, I believe, were the founders

568
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,719
and you've got

569
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,640
an open source community doing a certain amount of work.

570
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,880
And I'm curious to see if Sig Store maintains

571
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,469
its success as an open project because like Cooper

572
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,560
Neti is maybe an example of something that's managed to do this.

573
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,199
But I don't think Kubernetes is as niche as Sig Store is.

574
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:35,359
And that's what I find the most interesting.

575
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,400
Most security things are actually remarkably niche

576
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,089
when it really comes down to it.

577
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,280
So what I've kind of noticed and this is one of the reasons I actually

578
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,339
chose to work at the cloud security lines is

579
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,380
the cloud security Alliance has

580
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,880
hundreds of corporate members.

581
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,410
And so they kind of cancel each other out,

582
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,650
like there's no one big member that kind of can throw their weight around

583
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,699
and So

584
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,390
if you look at something like Kubernetes kind of

585
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,160
or the Linux kernel is even a better example,

586
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,099
like, yes, Red Hat is like, what was it?

587
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,939
8% or 13% of the Linux kernel.

588
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:06,280
But there's also other huge companies in there and it's,

589
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,439
and it's not like Red Hat can ever, even with IBM acquiring them,

590
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,589
can ever be big enough and rich enough to like, hijack the lens kernel.

591
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,030
It's just,

592
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,880
it's like trying to hijack the silver market, like it's just too big.

593
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,640
And Cooper Netti has escaped that and gotten to that

594
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,780
size where they have lots and lots of players.

595
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,060
But if you look at sig store,

596
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,550
they only list four

597
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,459
entities on their community page.

598
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,900
It's Google the links Foundation, Red Hat and Purdue University

599
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,739
and I hope they

600
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,060
escape that kind of having because like of those four organizations, clearly,

601
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,560
one of them is bigger than the rest.

602
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,869
Like really like, like on a, on a, on a, on a,

603
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,170
like if we did a graph of revenue,

604
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:47,339
you wouldn't be able to see three of them

605
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,119
without a logarithmic chart.

606
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,920
It's like, no, we didn't forget to print those three bars.

607
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,359
They're just very close to the,

608
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,199
it's down there. OK.

609
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,599
So this is an interesting point actually and this is

610
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,760
not something I had in my mental model of all.

611
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,750
This is you are correct when you have

612
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,160
a plurality of contributions coming from one organization.

613
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,300
If that organization has any problems,

614
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,079
they, weird things start to happen and it could be, the project dies.

615
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:17,060
It could be the project. It's taking close source. It, it, who knows? Right.

616
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,640
But when you have a truly community project like Kubernetes or the Linux Kernel,

617
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,890
there's nothing that can stop it at this point. Right. It's just, it

618
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,060
is a, it is a truck speeding down the highway.

619
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,060
Well, and that's the thing, it's like a truck's being down the highway.

620
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,069
You've got Google in there, you know, uh,

621
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,270
semi truck with like towing a pile of dump trucks

622
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,069
and it's not that they like, wanted to run over you. It's just that

623
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:40,750
like,

624
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,510
it's like a

625
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,819
200,000 pounds of moving mass

626
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,489
doesn't turn on a dime.

627
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,189
And so, for example, if I look at the sig store thing,

628
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:52,040
my perception is right now is like, oh man, like if I want to get my way, I have to like,

629
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,380
kind of

630
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:55,449
like, if my way doesn't agree with what Google and Red Hat want, I am

631
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,540
like, good luck,

632
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:58,050
you know what I mean?

633
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,979
And so even if they're totally willing to be nice and reasonable,

634
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,520
but I'm looking at this saying basically I have to like, deal with Google and Red Hat,

635
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,699
not a community.

636
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,500
I have to deal with those two specifically.

637
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,280
I mean, that's the problem is,

638
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,069
I don't know if they're going to be good and reasonable or nice or mean or,

639
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:12,739
and they're not

640
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,560
going to probably be very mean.

641
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:17,680
It's just, again, part of it is like there's the Google view of the world

642
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,969
and it probably is not my view of the world. Like a great example.

643
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,609
I was talking with an airline and they're

644
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,229
talking about how they're moving into the cloud

645
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,270
and that they have a rule that says they have

646
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,300
to have visibility of all the incoming and outgoing traffic.

647
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,420
And I'm like, oh, that's really not going to work so well with a lot of these, you know,

648
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,650
blank as a service,

649
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,369
you know, like, I don't think Google's gonna let you do that.

650
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,410
And he's like, oh, we'll get exceptions. And I'm like,

651
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,560
you're gonna have to get exceptions for everything.

652
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,609
Like it's, it's gonna become meaningless and he's like,

653
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,160
we might have to rethink that.

654
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,280
-- And I'm like, your
-- exception diagram is a circle of the planet Earth.

655
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,760
Exactly.

656
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,760
Well, except those three things still in a data center,

657
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,000
you know,

658
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:51,640
and

659
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,089
like they have to rethink their corporate it security culture because it's just

660
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,319
incompatible with the modern world if they want to use the modern world.

661
00:26:59,329 --> 00:26:59,540
And,

662
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,859
and that's kind of where this is going with these big things. It's like,

663
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:07,800
again, it's not that they're bad or evil or opposite to me. It's just

664
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,459
like Google has their view of the world.

665
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,910
Yeah.

666
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,250
And

667
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,239
it's different than I

668
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:13,420
am.

669
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,579
And, and look, I think that is part of the story is if you want to

670
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:21,489
have any sort of sway over an open source project,

671
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,709
you either have to pay a company working on it a bunch of money or

672
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,709
you have to get involved yourself. Right.

673
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:32,119
And I think that then creates the conversation of, OK, so if, if an open

674
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,319
source, the project is owned by one company, is it open source?

675
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,920
It has an open source license.

676
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:40,349
It, it, well, it's open source, it's not community, I guess,

677
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,589
would be maybe a more accurate.

678
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,439
The frustrating thing to me is we've all

679
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,859
agreed that open source means o si approved open source licenses. OK.

680
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,270
Let's just stick with that to simplify things greatly.

681
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,140
But the promise that doesn't say that they're going to take good patches.

682
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,890
No. Right. Absolutely.

683
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:55,949
And I mean,

684
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,339
how many,

685
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,150
how many times have it?

686
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,589
I mean, we've been in the open source world forever,

687
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,189
like you can suggest something to a project and the project can be like,

688
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,910
-- we don't care, go away or they'll
-- just ignore it.

689
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:08,530
Yeah,

690
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,189
I would almost rather than tell me to go away than just ignore it.

691
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,719
No, I, I agree. And that's

692
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:16,130
so that is one of the things like, so obviously at

693
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:19,349
Acor, we have sifting gripe which are open source projects and that's something we,

694
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,469
we really started putting an effort into.

695
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:21,790
Like

696
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,680
if someone sends us something,

697
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:28,439
we cannot let it sit like we need to at least say we like this.

698
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,839
But we're gonna get to it later or we don't like this.

699
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:34,319
-- Like this is why we don't like it or whatever.
-- A perfect github

700
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:35,640
desktop is open source.

701
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,150
Issue number 78.

702
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,319
Yes. You said that to me yesterday

703
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:45,239
is GP G signing doesn't work. That's issue 78. That's, it's like from 2016,

704
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:45,819
it's very

705
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,880
old. It's six years old.

706
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,250
It's clearly not going to happen and then sign off doesn't work.

707
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,349
That's issue 5000 and something. And it's like four years old

708
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:52,890
and

709
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,560
-- because of the stupid DC O stuff
-- and it's like, it's four years old at this point

710
00:28:57,729 --> 00:28:58,280
and github

711
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,530
hasn't even really replied to it other than to say, it's not on the road map. Well,

712
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:04,479
yeah, we figured that out

713
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:05,449
and

714
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:06,520
like so github

715
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,400
desktop is open source but

716
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,479
it is, it's not a OK. It has an O SI license.

717
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:12,770
I mean,

718
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,650
so this is probably a conversation for another day

719
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,569
that we're because we're basically out of time.

720
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:18,680
Here's the thing is

721
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:20,739
I think historically,

722
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,530
if something had open source code, it was open source.

723
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,449
And I think in, in many instances,

724
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,609
communities would just organically form around it.

725
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:33,060
Like Gimp is a great example of open office, whatever.

726
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,890
There were all these technologies that I think

727
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,989
just naturally were magnetic to the community because we needed these solutions,

728
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,119
right?

729
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,290
Like we had no option.

730
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:46,390
Whereas now I think when we look at some of these products and services that are,

731
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,969
they're technically open source because let's face it at this point.

732
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,449
If you're basically not open source, I think you're,

733
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:55,050
you're just not going to exist in a lot of instances, for many reasons,

734
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,219
-- you
-- have to spend a lot of money reinventing the wheel.

735
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,290
And I think it's, it's a good marketing ploy to be like, look, here's all of our code.

736
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,939
And honestly, when you're doing like a lot,

737
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,114
a lot of sales motions,

738
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:06,614
having your source code in github

739
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:09,114
solves a lot of problems

740
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:12,505
people will be like, have you, have you scanned your source code? No, but it's here.

741
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:12,814
Oh,

742
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,494
that's good enough. Like I know you're never gonna scan it.

743
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,114
You're never gonna read the report. I'd send you either.

744
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,895
But like at least we can pretend that this matters.

745
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,734
Would you buy a house with a locked door that they won't

746
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:24,314
let you look behind until you pay for it and it closes?

747
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:24,790
Of

748
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:25,439
-- course,
-- I

749
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,050
would, I, I don't, I, I part of me would want to buy it just to look behind the door. Like

750
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,930
what's in there? I must know it's like, remember the Reddit safe where the guy was?

751
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,869
Like, what's in the safe? There's nothing in the safe. But

752
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,589
like

753
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,890
anyway, anyway,

754
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,910
so I, I don't know.

755
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,359
II I was hoping discussing this with you would bring

756
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,520
me to some sort of like internal mental resolution.

757
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,500
And I feel

758
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,180
just as confused before I started as I am now and I think the thing

759
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,280
I am now going to think about

760
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,150
is

761
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,219
I think what we called open source in the past

762
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,339
was really

763
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,540
a community.

764
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,040
And now

765
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,839
we, they are very separate.

766
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,729
I think they were, they were naturally the same historically.

767
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:12,000
But now I think like you can be open source and not have a community.

768
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,859
Well, can I, maybe here's something that's adding confusion to it is

769
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,800
the distinction between open source as a software, as

770
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:17,930
a,

771
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:20,704
as a piece of code and open source as something

772
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:24,574
that's also a service and primarily useful as a service

773
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,165
because there's like back in the day, we didn't have internet connectivity.

774
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,854
So all of our software sort of ran locally and

775
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:32,935
was useful without a software or without an internet connection.

776
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,170
But nowadays,

777
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,650
I have almost no software that is actually useful without an internet connection.

778
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:42,050
Like apart from Notepad where I shove notes occasionally,

779
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,310
I'm just looking at my menu bar.

780
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,420
Yeah, there's not a

781
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,890
single thing in there. Yeah. Notepad.

782
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,839
Notepad is literally the only app I use on

783
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:51,089
my desktop that would be useful without internet.

784
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,219
Uh You should get there, there's a note taking app called Obsidian

785
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,400
and you can check it in github.

786
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:56,939
Very

787
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,180
nice

788
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,510
-- anyway,
-- but like

789
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,239
it's the world has changed.

790
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,099
So I think that's part of the challenge is what does open source mean now. Well,

791
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:06,369
the pure definition of it's this open source with this license

792
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,369
no longer works because for example, will they take reasonable patches?

793
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,089
Will they do reasonable extensions? Like to me, it is unreasonable that github

794
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:18,589
-- desktop will not add support for GP G signing and signature or sign offs
-- well.

795
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:18,790
OK.

796
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,030
No, no, no, no, no, no. Has someone offered a patch to do this?

797
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,739
Yes.

798
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:27,560
OK. If the patch has been offered and they won't take it, that's inexcusable.

799
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,930
Not a patch patch per like it wasn't, I didn't check too much,

800
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:35,369
but for example github desktop just needs to support the G pre commit hooks

801
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,550
because I set up pre commit hooks in my personal directory and it ignored them.

802
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,560
-- But
-- no, no, no. OK. OK. So here's how I want it. We're, we're,

803
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,050
we're way over time,

804
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,890
but here's how I want you to think about this and we can talk about

805
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,449
this some more later because I think there's more to this than what we've got.

806
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,800
So asking github to add a feature, they don't have to.

807
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,969
Now, granted, they should just say we don't care, go away.

808
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,489
But

809
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,239
I think the way open source works is you don't show

810
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,569
up and ask you show up with a patch right now.

811
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,630
If you show up with a patch and they don't take your patch,

812
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,219
that's kind of weaselly.

813
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:10,310
But I think we've also conflated now in our minds,

814
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,939
this idea of I can go to the community

815
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:17,359
and I can ask them to do things and they'll do it for me

816
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,630
and no, they won't like that.

817
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,099
No, they won't. In the past,

818
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,640
there might have been some of that where people could say something like, oh,

819
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,829
this is a novel feature for this open source project

820
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,459
and sometimes they'd come with patches, sometimes they wouldn't.

821
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:33,500
But if it was clever enough people would be like, oh, yes, that's a great idea

822
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,979
because they were doing it for fun and it might have been fun.

823
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:38,260
Something like GP G signing and github desktop.

824
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,339
That's not really fun.

825
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:39,939
You know,

826
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,859
I think the problem is open source.

827
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:46,420
Like I said, it's no longer just about the software. It's also a lot about services.

828
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:51,339
It's a lot about will they take updates, improvements, code patches. It's,

829
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:56,170
it's all about the community and a company is not a community by and large.

830
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:58,589
No, I, I agree. I agree 100%.

831
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:02,170
And I think historically community and code were the same thing

832
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,489
and now they're not

833
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,810
and a company with open source code doesn't make a community. And I think that is,

834
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,648
that is going to be the next mental gymnastic.

835
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:17,989
The open source universe has to figure out is open source as we define it today.

836
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:19,809
Is licenses from the O SI

837
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:21,529
but open source.

838
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:24,579
The idea is the community.

839
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,398
And I think unfortunately

840
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:29,998
the term open source has been hijacked by a lot of people. And so

841
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,899
there will be many years of untangling that.

842
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,168
-- Well, they are technically open source. Just
-- that's true.

843
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,090
They are

844
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,540
tech

845
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,129
technically correct is the best kind of correct. Right.

846
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,110
The problem is the definition of open source. Well, the world changed

847
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,250
and I agree, I agree 100%.

848
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,168
-- 100 percent.
-- Look, I'm just looking at these, uh github

849
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,639
desktop contributors.

850
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,070
12,000. It's like a long tail of,

851
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,310
yeah, they always are.

852
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,790
I, I would expect in github desktop that 99% of commits are from github

853
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:00,689
employees

854
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,550
and maybe a couple of random contributors.

855
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:03,820
Oh,

856
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,760
man, it's a sharp tail. Like the top 10 contributors are

857
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:08,020
the,

858
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,750
I believe it.

859
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,419
I mean, that's how,

860
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:11,260
that's how most open source works where if you

861
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,790
have a company paying someone to work on it,

862
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,189
that's what you get anyway.

863
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,219
All right, man, I think,

864
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:16,649
I think we got a lot to chew out on this one

865
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,389
and I want to call it because we've been dragging it on.

866
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,100
So, thank you.

867
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,270
Thank you, everyone for listening.

868
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,649
Got up with our security podcast.com. Head up the show, not

869
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,209
use a Pound Os S podcast. Hashtag to hit us up on social media.

870
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:29,379
-- Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.
-- You too. Thanks everybody.

871
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,010
Thanks everyone. Bye bye.

872
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:35,820
The.
