00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,279
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,119
Josh Bresser. Hey, Kurt, how are you doing?

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,270
I'm doing well.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,869
It's getting warmer here

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,549
-- and by warmer, I mean, slightly less cold,
-- minus 10 Â°C,

6
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,000
-- something like that.
-- Yeah.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,020
Right. The ball me get out the shorts.

8
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:27,649
Yeah. Baby steps.

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,299
It's winter. I get it.

10
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:31,569
Yeah.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,970
Yeah. So I, so some really,

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,150
we finally,

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,849
the industry has crossed a bridge that I don't think has ever been crossed before.

14
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,159
Which bridge might that be

15
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,200
the remote bricking of cell phones for your own safety?

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,169
Yeah, that's the Samsung. Was it the Galaxy Note Seven or something or other?

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,169
I,

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,500
-- I don't know,
-- just for some context for our viewers because

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,529
they

20
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:03,259
probably heard about the, sorry. Yeah. Whoops.

21
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,989
Uh, they've probably heard about the Samsung seven, although, you know,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,300
maybe they're listening to these five years in the future.

23
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:12,139
So this phone very nice phone, very thin phone,

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,419
very thin battery. The battery apparently doesn't have enough, um,

25
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:18,300
material between the layers.

26
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,389
Uh, so if you bend it even slightly the,

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,120
the various layers of uh electrolytic and capacitors and whatnot.

28
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:28,639
Touch each other and, well, they get excited and catch fire.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,029
Um,

30
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,080
so Samsung did a recall.

31
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:32,199
Uh,

32
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,209
the carriers have done a recall and apparently some

33
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,599
people just are refusing to return their phones.

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,000
Right.

35
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,690
Uh, some people apparently really love these phones.

36
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,370
Uh, some people don't want to deal with their carriers or, you know,

37
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,569
they're out in a remote place and don't really, well, there's a good point.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,680
Right. What if you're out in the remote

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,239
outback of Australia,

40
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,730
you know, the nearest phone store might be like a four day drive.

41
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:54,150
Do you have a cell phone if you live there? Is there cell service there

42
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,830
probably. But regardless,

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,910
you know, or, or you have an American phone carrier? Right.

44
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:02,839
Right. So,

45
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,980
anyway, so,

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,669
uh they've, I think they've basically gotten to the point where they, you know,

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,119
obviously they've recalled as many phones as they can.

48
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,649
So now the solution is

49
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,149
they're going to remotely, uh upgrade the firmware. Um,

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,270
and obviously there weren't a ton of details,

51
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,669
but it sounds like they're essentially

52
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,789
breaking the phones, um,

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,580
to the point of also the firmware.

54
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:26,759
Uh, the new firmware from what I read won't let the phone charge.

55
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:29,750
-- So, like once you run the battery out, it's done.
-- Exactly.

56
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,639
Which is really clever because once the battery is dead,

57
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:37,360
it is considerably less dangerous than when it is full of electrons.

58
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,479
Exactly.

59
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:42,190
But this also then does raise the interesting point of, you know,

60
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,389
typically cell phones are required to be able to make 911 calls no matter what.

61
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,000
Even if they're like off contract,

62
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,630
obviously, you can't make a 911 call with a dead cell phone battery.

63
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,710
That's true. But you, i,

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,490
if it lights on fire and maims, you, you also can't call 911 to tell them you need help.

65
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,130
True. So, I guess what we really need are two statistics.

66
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,929
How often do these phones catch fire?

67
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,309
And secondly, how often, you know, say,

68
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,509
uh per hour of carrying a cell phone, how often do people actually call 911,

69
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,649
you know, in a meaningful way?

70
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,429
Right.

71
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,429
Uh And of course, we don't have that data.

72
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,429
So we're gonna make some stuff up.

73
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:23,970
Why

74
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:24,470
not?

75
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,059
I,

76
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:26,869
I would,

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,820
I would pause it that

78
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,529
like many things.

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,369
This is a good intention.

80
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:40,250
II, I do, I, I think it's a good intention and this is kind of, you know, this is unlike

81
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,699
or rather not unlike,

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,729
this is similar to your typical

83
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,490
enterprise risk scenario where everything carries risk

84
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,449
if you do or don't do something.

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,410
And is the risk of these phones injuring people

86
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,970
greater than

87
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,929
the risk of them not being able to dial 911?

88
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:00,910
Yeah.

89
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,339
Well,

90
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,050
and there's a second thing here that really

91
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,630
makes me quite curious because this scenario,

92
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,910
typically the scenario

93
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,710
with a software problem is that there's no more manufacturer

94
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,119
to update it or the manufacturer just doesn't care.

95
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,470
In this case, it's an actual hardware problem

96
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,040
and we have a manufacturer who does do well,

97
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,760
is updating the software and has a mechanism in place

98
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,760
to shove that software update out, right?

99
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,380
Like these, these are literally connected devices, they are cell phones, right?

100
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,070
Like a lot of

101
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,559
-- IOT devices may not have that connectivity.
-- That that part is true.

102
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,140
But however, even with the phones,

103
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,690
they still need to work with the carrier because I believe I

104
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,140
read somewhere that Verizon has said we will not push this update

105
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,839
to our customers.

106
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,170
-- Interesting.
-- Yes.

107
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:48,559
So yeah.

108
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,309
Well, I mean, my understanding is for the,

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,970
and this is one of the reasons I went with an iphone

110
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,269
is so that there are no carriers involved in my updates.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,970
But

112
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,019
in general, yeah, with the, with the updates shipped through the carriers,

113
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,940
the carrier has to put them on their servers

114
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,209
and actually push them out to the devices.

115
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,470
And, and you think about the

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,769
incentives here is if you're Samsung,

117
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,029
you want

118
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,549
a dangerous device off the market.

119
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,380
If you're Verizon,

120
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,510
if you break these devices, you now have angry customers.

121
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,279
Yeah.

122
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,200
Well, especially at this point, I mean,

123
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,339
the kind of person that hasn't handed their phone in

124
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,899
either really loves that phone or really hates dealing

125
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,500
with their phone carrier or some other version.

126
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,489
No, like by definition right there. It's a, it's literally a self selecting group

127
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,279
that probably is really going to be unhappy that you break their phone

128
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,079
probably.

129
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:41,709
But it's, oh, man, this is such a weird problem.

130
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:45,589
Now, now there's, there's kind of another thing to think of here is

131
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,519
so

132
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,140
in the context of the telephone,

133
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,600
there is actual physical harm that can result from a manufacturing defect, right?

134
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,200
And

135
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,679
the way the law works in this instance is

136
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,799
this is something I'm not a lawyer.

137
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,519
And so I'm certainly not an expert,

138
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,140
but I've discussed this with a handful of lawyers in the past is

139
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:12,850
you have to show physical harm for there to be

140
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,040
some sort of liability suit you could file.

141
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:19,049
And obviously in the case of an exploding phone,

142
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,450
there's certainly physical harm. Right.

143
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,500
Whereas

144
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,059
if it's just a device that

145
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,250
steals all of your information,

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,019
there's no actual physical harm there. And so

147
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,809
this is such a crazy problem to think about and

148
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,250
it's not something we've ever had to deal with before.

149
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, we've had, well, that's not true. We've had bad hardware.

150
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,809
Like a perfect example. Hoverboards, right? Hoverboards were so bad that

151
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,329
they were entirely banned from import to the US for a while is my understanding.

152
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,029
Um, but of course, hoverboards generally don't

153
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,299
do over the air software updates

154
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,940
-- and
-- they don't hover, which

155
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,109
I,

156
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,089
no, I was quite annoyed about that.

157
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:56,750
I

158
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,290
remember when I saw the headline at the hoverboard.

159
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm like, oh my goodness, someone did it.

160
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:02,070
The

161
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:02,269
thing

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,359
is wheels. Like what the heck this isn't a hoverboard. This is just

163
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:06,320
the

164
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,420
seriously.

165
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,000
But, um, so that's the thing. Right.

166
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,980
We've never really had a hardware device that was this

167
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:16,679
clearly badly affected. Right. We've had hardware devices that, like,

168
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,040
die after a certain amount of time or just, you know, whatever fail or don't work.

169
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,029
Right. But not, like,

170
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,700
really catch fire.

171
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,130
With the exception of a lot of those hoverboards with cheap batteries

172
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,399
combined with the fact that we have

173
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,320
an actual device that does have that

174
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,880
internet wi fi capability and most importantly,

175
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,559
a manufacturer who will shove out an update. Right?

176
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,079
Most of those,

177
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,459
my understanding is like you look at these hoverboard manufacturers,

178
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,959
they're not, you know, brand names you would recognize,

179
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:43,839
right?

180
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,589
And I really, you know,

181
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,279
obviously based on the fact that these things were catching fire all the time,

182
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,320
I don't think any of the manufacturers really care all that much.

183
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,899
Probably not

184
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:55,799
because, I mean, let's face it.

185
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,079
If the phones didn't have

186
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,920
a, we'll say very well established

187
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,559
international brand associated with them.

188
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,149
I wonder if the manufacturer would even care or, I mean,

189
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,040
in the case of some of this dodgy import stuff, how much of this stuff is,

190
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,929
I, I guess sold by companies that,

191
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,130
that are just paper companies that they were

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,769
spun up just to sell this one particular product

193
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,559
and if it fails miserably, they just dissolve themselves.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,820
Well, that's, I mean,

195
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,750
that's exactly what happened with all those digital video recorders, you know,

196
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,530
you had the, um, the Chinese company whose name I can't pronounce

197
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,030
c

198
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,830
actually creating the hardware and software and then basically shipping boards

199
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,260
with software preloaded out to uh white box manufacturers who,

200
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,750
like physically, you know, wrapped a case around it, put a sticker on it and then,

201
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,500
you know, sold it via

202
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,979
alibaba.com or any number of importers. Right.

203
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,710
And those companies, even though they're not technically a paper company,

204
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,140
they're,

205
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,409
they're quite happy to, to, you know, change their name and, and keep.

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,250
-- Right.
-- Right.

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,179
Well, and let's face it too when a lot of this stuff, like,

208
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,799
especially when you're buying a hoverboard.

209
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,830
How many people said, oh, what company built this, I'm only buying the name brand.

210
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,820
You know, nobody said that they were just, oh, Hoverboard,

211
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to buy the one for 100,000 a

212
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,330
name brand. Hoverboard.

213
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:15,719
Are they all Hoverboard? I don't, I don't even know.

214
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,349
Well,

215
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,729
I was watching a TED talk talking about this and so the

216
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:22,010
name Hoverboard actually was a viral thing because at first they were called

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
all sorts of things.

218
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,750
Like, uh, well, actually some people call them segues or stick Segways or,

219
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,090
um, you know, uh,

220
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,369
what was it?

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,520
Unicycles or?

222
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,809
Exactly.

223
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,849
And, and Hoverboard is funny because this guy showed, you know,

224
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,650
these listings on ebay and on, uh,

225
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,859
I think it was Alibaba or one of those related sites,

226
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:42,210
you know,

227
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:45,869
showing that eventually everybody converged organically on hoverboard.

228
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,390
Right. And that's just the word that won,

229
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,950
you know. So it's not like somebody picked that word.

230
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,309
It just, it's what ended up happening.

231
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:54,500
Um,

232
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,229
so, yeah, with the Samsung phone, it's, I mean,

233
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:01,469
you obviously Samsung does generally seem to care a little bit about their brand,

234
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,440
uh, which is good

235
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,489
and,

236
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,859
yeah, I, I really wonder if.

237
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:12,059
So talking about product liability law, what does the law say about, you know,

238
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,450
a phone that fails to make a 911 call resulting in actual harm to somebody?

239
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,859
That's an interesting question.

240
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:23,679
I don't know how that would work because there's obviously physical harm

241
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,250
in that. Well,

242
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,859
there is, but there, I don't,

243
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,450
-- well,
-- there was lack of action,

244
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:30,059
right?

245
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,299
The phone did not cause the harm but the phone maybe made that harm worse by, you know,

246
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,840
not being able to call an ambulance.

247
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:37,419
-- Right.
-- But I guess

248
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,549
so, here's part of it too though, is,

249
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,520
can you blame the phone manufacturer when you have had

250
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,099
a ton of warning to get rid of this thing?

251
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,729
And they told you they're going to break it

252
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,650
and, you know, it isn't going to work.

253
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,330
See, my thinking is that would be the exact,

254
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,049
-- that would be one of the arguments if I were a lawyer I would look at, I mean,
-- this,

255
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,210
this seems like a, a pretty dodgy position if you have one of these phones.

256
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,849
If the manufacturer has told you get rid of it. It's dangerous.

257
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:08,929
They've taken

258
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:14,219
incredible steps to deal with this problem and you're still holding on to it.

259
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,489
I mean, this, this would not be, you know. No, no. You know what

260
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,969
I wonder because let's say you have an automobile

261
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,150
and there's a recall where if you say

262
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,380
get into an accident, it bursts into fire

263
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:30,940
claims and you don't get the recall work done on the, on the vehicle.

264
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,940
If you get in an accident and someone gets hurt,

265
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,950
I would hope if you've been contacted multiple times by

266
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,869
the the manufacturer that basically it's your own

267
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,429
fault for not doing something reasonable about it.

268
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,630
So here's an interesting area we move into.

269
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,390
I don't want to say blame the victim, but in the sense of you own a device that,

270
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,049
you know, can

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,859
ultimately cause harm in some way to another person, either by

272
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,659
catching on fire or in this case by being bricked and not being available.

273
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:00,549
Um

274
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,979
I mean, we've, we've sort of seen this to some degree with cars,

275
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,580
although to the best of my knowledge,

276
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
you know, it's never, well, it's

277
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:13,039
there are not laws per se against this that I'm aware of, but there are, you know,

278
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,619
if you get into an accident with somebody and their car was not well maintained,

279
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,260
you can, you know,

280
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,619
your lawyer could definitely argue that they did not take due care,

281
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,640
um, you know,

282
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,750
with their vehicle and thus created. Um

283
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:28,859
well, basically they would be liable for the lack of action, lack of say,

284
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:29,609
maintenance, right?

285
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,130
Or lack of whatever that resulted in their car hurting, you know,

286
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,169
if the brakes failed.

287
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,510
So that's already well established that, you know, to some degree you have to,

288
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:36,919
you know,

289
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,760
you can't like tie pointy sticks to the front of your car and take the brakes off.

290
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,719
-- So,
-- so that flame thrower, I mounted on the front, That's a bad idea.

291
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,770
-- Uh, yes. Yes. It's also illegal, I think in all States except for Nevada.
-- I

292
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:53,080
-- wonder is that illegal?
-- I don't know. I'm pretty sure flamethrowers are illegal.

293
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,650
Uh, because

294
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,280
I remember Mythbusters did that episode. Um,

295
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,409
but you can get those propane torches

296
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,450
but they're not technically flamethrowers,

297
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:05,729
but they did. I, well, I know they ended up using a guy's flamethrower in Nevada.

298
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,869
So I'm thinking it might have been legal but anyways

299
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:10,250
back to the car thing and the, the device thing is,

300
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:14,219
yeah, I mean, at some point, if a device manufacturer has contacted you and said,

301
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:15,429
you know, we,

302
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,479
we sold these light bulbs, they catch fire.

303
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,830
We've told you about this, we've offered a trade in program or, you know,

304
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,539
something reasonable.

305
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,640
Not like a dollar off your next light bulb.

306
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,280
What a deal.

307
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,010
Yeah.

308
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,020
You know what, at what point do you,

309
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,239
the consumer of this faulty product start to become liable?

310
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:37,200
You know, is, is it a month, six months, a year? 10 recalls

311
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,429
avoiding an over the air firmware update.

312
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:41,489
I, I

313
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,880
don't know.

314
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,820
-- I mean, this is crazy, crazy stuff to think about it to say the least
-- it's,

315
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,750
but it's gonna happen.

316
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,349
-- It
-- is
-- happening, right. We're in the middle of it right now.

317
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:51,950
Yeah,

318
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,059
I mean, and the thing is what's interesting to me is,

319
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,719
is with an over the air update of your cell phone that's harder to block.

320
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:00,159
But with, uh for example, like a Wi Fi device like um well, for example,

321
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,510
I have n smoke alarms at home.

322
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,429
I could

323
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,830
block their access to the Wi Fi internet, right?

324
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,270
I could just turn off the access point and

325
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,750
they would no longer get over the air updates from Google.

326
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,479
But conversely, I would lose a lot of the functionality of that device in that,

327
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,239
you know, when my smoke alarms go off,

328
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,239
they talk to the Wi Fi which sends a message to Google which in turn then sends a,

329
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,030
you know, a message to my phone.

330
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,380
So my phone starts ringing whenever somebody burns dinner

331
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,179
with these devices, some of them probably won't

332
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,400
suffer as much from lack of connectivity to the internet.

333
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,679
So for example, light bulbs maybe or

334
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,260
you know, something along those lines.

335
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,200
Does any, I wonder if anybody has

336
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:44,599
run into this before with electronics or with a car where, you know,

337
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,039
there's been a recall

338
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,789
and people have ignored it and then caused harm

339
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,039
as a direct action of ignoring the recall.

340
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,239
I mean, it must have happened at some point like, uh,

341
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,059
the Firestone tire recall. I don't you remember that from about a decade ago?

342
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,520
I do you know that was, I mean, when they showed those rollover tests it was like, oh,

343
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,150
dear,

344
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:04,559
that, that's bad.

345
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,380
Yep. Yeah,

346
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,630
it's,

347
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:13,429
but, but again, we end up in a situation where I feel like

348
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,109
automobiles

349
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,750
are more clear to people.

350
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,989
If you don't do this, you're going to get hurt

351
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,190
-- and
-- well, self driving cars are not too far away with

352
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:25,090
software like

353
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,989
Tesla is already do over the air updates.

354
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,070
Right.

355
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,520
And that's a whole another ball of crazy right

356
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,130
there when we think about devices in that context.

357
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,309
But, but so back to the phones though is,

358
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,010
I guess you could make the argument

359
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,789
that

360
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,640
if you bring your phone in.

361
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,190
Do you get a new one immediately or do you have to wait for some sort of warranty type?

362
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,309
Depends

363
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:47,489
on your, see,

364
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,179
that's part of the challenge here is that depends

365
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,559
on the carrier that depends on your contract.

366
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,010
That depends on a whole bunch of different things. Right. I mean,

367
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,590
and it could even vary between customers. Like,

368
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,960
uh, at one point I know I've been a customer of my phone company for like,

369
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:02,479
10 years and I had, you know, and they were like,

370
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:05,559
they actually were trying to get me to trade in my phone for a new one for free.

371
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,150
Right.

372
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,799
So that they could lock me into another two year contract.

373
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:10,700
Right.

374
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,039
And so like you could have, I'm, I'm certain there's Samsung people who, you know,

375
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:16,510
have been with their carrier so long that their carrier would be like,

376
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,679
we'll give you whatever phone you want. We don't care.

377
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,940
You're a great customer versus, you know,

378
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,880
the people who are not such a great customer and they're like,

379
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,979
we're gonna take your phone and hang on to it for like,

380
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,640
Lord knows how long and we may or may not give you a phone

381
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,239
at some point or you have to buy a new one. Sorry,

382
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,739
I, I don't even know what the deal is. You know, if you have the phone on contract,

383
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:37,190
do you technically own the phone at that point or is it like a lease thing?

384
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,469
I,

385
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:42,380
I always assumed you own it and you just have like the payment thing going on. But

386
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,950
again, I, I really, I, I don't know.

387
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,669
So I think that's part of the problem, especially with phones,

388
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:50,440
most devices are very clearly sold,

389
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:54,390
right? Like when you go buy light bulbs, you go and you buy light bulbs, you don't

390
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,440
sign a contract.

391
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,799
Uh saying that, you know, you'll stay with the light bulb carrier.

392
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,599
I don't know, whatever for a few years

393
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,799
carrier, you know,

394
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,050
you know, even with things like Nest, right?

395
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,569
If I buy a Nest camera, I can cancel my contract with Google. Uh I believe.

396
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,500
But, you know, I would still, well, I would lose a ton of functionality of the device,

397
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,010
you know, whereas with a cell phone you can change from one carrier to another.

398
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,630
So I,

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,510
I wonder if cell phones are maybe gonna be a

400
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,969
weird corner case because of just how strange they are,

401
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,130
you know, and that they have this, like,

402
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:28,068
they require network access to work, obviously.

403
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,058
Uh, but you can switch carriers, you can switch networks.

404
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,379
Yeah, I mean,

405
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,418
yeah,

406
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:37,760
you can, you can. And so it, it depends. Oh,

407
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,449
man, it's

408
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,250
my brain can't handle this.

409
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,550
I think the lawyers are going to have a heck of a time with this.

410
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,579
I'm gonna apologize right now to any lawyers who might be listening for our,

411
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,089
we'll say

412
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,400
egregious

413
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,410
-- armchair lawyering that's going on right now.
-- And,

414
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,390
and I mean, of course,

415
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,069
it varies by jurisdiction because remember those European jurisdictions where,

416
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,619
uh it was just recently in Denmark,

417
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,719
the guy,

418
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,479
it was like a four year court case

419
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,219
and he basically took his iphone into the Apple Store

420
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,060
to get it replaced because it was broken or something.

421
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,380
And they wanted to provide him a refurb and he was like, no,

422
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,670
you'll give me a new phone and four years later he, well, he's getting his new phone,

423
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,140
I guess.

424
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,229
Um So that's the other thing to remember, right?

425
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:20,680
Is some jurisdictions have laws that say literally like this product

426
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,030
has to be suitable for purpose and the customer has,

427
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,560
you know, one or two years

428
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,449
that, like, it has to work, you know,

429
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,469
you can't just poop out after 30 days,

430
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:31,670
you know,

431
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,229
and I'm pretty sure that remotely bricking your phone counts as not working.

432
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,719
I think that's fair.

433
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,849
Yeah, it's, I mean, this is one of the reasons I actually,

434
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,040
I think with self driving cars I would much prefer to see them

435
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,469
as much as I dislike the idea of like,

436
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,469
these large companies like Uber kind of controlling the whole fleet

437
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:51,280
at the same time. I'm not sure.

438
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,319
Something like a self driving car maybe should be owned by individuals.

439
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,280
You know, I don't think it should be because what happens

440
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,260
if I go into my car

441
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,599
and I tell it quit stopping at intersections and all the other

442
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,219
self driving cars are smart enough to not run into me.

443
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,890
Well, it doesn't even have to be something illegal like that.

444
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,859
It could be something like,

445
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,959
you know, don't let people, people in during a zipper merge

446
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,339
or don't, you know, don't, uh,

447
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:20,239
there's all sorts of things you can do while driving that are not illegal,

448
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,839
but they're certainly, you know, kind of not very polite or safe.

449
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,520
Right. It's,

450
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,219
I get this right. It's crazy

451
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,270
what is happening to these devices in the world

452
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,280
they are going into and I think it's safe to say that

453
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:41,359
humans are totally unprepared to deal with this as well as our laws

454
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,670
as well as just the, the corporations building this stuff. I mean,

455
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,140
we're rushing out to IOT

456
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,890
and we, like, we don't know what's out there.

457
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,949
We're, we're running into a field full of razor blades and monsters.

458
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,079
Yeah. No, it's, I mean, socially too, I'm kind of really,

459
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,160
uh, you know, a great example being every time I've flown in the last few months,

460
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,359
you know, they have that specific announcement saying that the, uh, what is it,

461
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,719
the US Department of

462
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:10,900
Transportation has like explicitly banned this one model

463
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,280
of phone from being on a plane?

464
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:12,810
A a

465
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:13,790
-- oh, sorry,
-- the

466
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,329
-- FAA
-- ban.

467
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:15,810
Yeah,

468
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,930
you know, that's like

469
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,089
specifically this is banned, like if you have one, tell us now or I,

470
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,010
I'm not really sure what the consequences.

471
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:25,560
It's a federal

472
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,270
offense.

473
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,719
I believe it's a felony if you're caught with it,

474
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,040
which means you could technically go to jail.

475
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:32,300
They

476
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:33,880
bring

477
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:36,430
something that is known to catch fire onto an airplane.

478
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:40,670
I mean, you're effectively bringing a bomb onto the plane, right. That's what it is.

479
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:45,719
Yeah. So are we going to see a lot more of that? Are we going to see that,

480
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:46,920
you know,

481
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,709
something along the lines of that with the road system?

482
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:54,310
You know, this, this, uh, this car with this version of firmware is, you know,

483
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,569
illegal, it's just so dangerous or something?

484
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,569
Right. Well, and where do you draw the line though? Right.

485
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:02,910
I mean, in this case, a phone literally starting on fire

486
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,729
is easy to understand. That's bad.

487
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,560
If you have a light bulb that is burning your house down,

488
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,569
that's bad.

489
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:14,410
If you have a car that gets into accidents, that's bad.

490
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,849
But what happens when you have

491
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:19,869
smoke alarms that maybe sometimes fail?

492
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,670
-- Sometimes?
-- Well, Nest had that

493
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:22,849
they

494
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,219
did,

495
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,449
Nest had, uh, Nest

496
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,050
had, I don't know if they still have,

497
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,439
but they used to have a feature where you

498
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,589
could just essentially wave your hand at the smoke alarm

499
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,310
and it would stop alarming. Um,

500
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,479
instead of having to physically hit the big button in the middle. Right.

501
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:39,550
Because, you know, I guess, well, yeah, if you have like 12 ft ceilings, you know, go

502
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,930
get a broom.

503
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:41,989
Um,

504
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:45,939
and they remotely over the air updated that to remove that

505
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:50,410
feature because apparently during certain types of fires or certain situations,

506
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,339
the fire, the smoke,

507
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,900
whatever could essentially replicate that it

508
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,479
could trigger that motion sensor type deal

509
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,109
to say, basically don't alarm. Right.

510
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,469
And obviously, you know, if you have a real fire that, that's a huge problem.

511
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,410
So they disabled that functionality.

512
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,380
Now, I'm lucky because, you know, I have 8 ft ceilings and I'm 6 ft two. So,

513
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,270
ok, it's annoying, but I can,

514
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,390
I can go hit the button.

515
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,369
Can't you just

516
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:13,709
my

517
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,910
cell phone to push a button or something?

518
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,030
Uh, I

519
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,030
think you can remotely, yeah, I think with the app you can tell it to stop alarm.

520
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,280
I'm not certain that you can, I think you, maybe you can't hang on a

521
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:27,569
second. I

522
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:27,959
just

523
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:28,550
need

524
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,260
cell

525
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,790
phones.

526
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,569
That don't.

527
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,140
I

528
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,609
actually, no, I don't, I've never noticed that feature in the

529
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,630
app.

530
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,239
Um, but anyways,

531
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,089
so,

532
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,260
you know, that's, that's an obvious health and safety thing. Right.

533
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,050
The smoke alarm doesn't alarm me when there's a fire.

534
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,719
And so, yeah, Google updated it forcibly. Too bad.

535
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,819
You're getting that update. Um Unless you like unhook it from the internet,

536
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:50,819
basically,

537
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,420
I don't think that's unreasonable in some ways, but in other ways,

538
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,469
you clearly don't own that device if the manufacturer can effectively

539
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,260
make whatever changes they want to it at any time.

540
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:03,739
Right?

541
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,589
Well, I mean, that's true of

542
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,109
essentially anything running software at this point because how,

543
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,619
how can I even open source stuff?

544
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,239
I can't possibly review all the changes that made

545
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,790
in the last Linux kernel update I installed or

546
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:23,040
Gnome or emacs or, or on my web browser. Good Lord. I mean,

547
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,989
the web browser is how big now

548
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,020
it's

549
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,060
and for example, you know, chrome just decided like, well, not just decided

550
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,599
a whole bunch of browser vendors. Oh, this is a good example.

551
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,910
Actually, a whole bunch of browser vendors have decided

552
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,380
that, you know, shaw one,

553
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:42,449
the signature uh algorithm sha one is no longer secure enough for, you know,

554
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,550
certificate use.

555
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,329
And so they're phasing it out right, starting in um what is it January of Well, yeah,

556
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,040
2017 so we can.

557
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:49,729
Oh

558
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,890
wow, six weeks.

559
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,030
So

560
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,459
yeah, that's ok. That's coming up quick folks.

561
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,560
Um you know, they're gonna start disabling it for root certificates.

562
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,670
And by my understanding is by 2019, Chrome will

563
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,469
will stop supporting sha one end of story.

564
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,020
Like you can still use sha one for

565
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,329
intermediate certificates or for end certificates currently,

566
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:14,180
but come 2019 that ends like chrome is

567
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,469
just chrome is basically saying like look if you

568
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:20,150
use sha one that's too bad for you go find a different web browser or you know,

569
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,910
fix your certificates because sha one is no longer considered safe.

570
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,189
So this is a very similar case of, you know, there's that

571
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,079
again, there's this very

572
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,199
small potential for harm.

573
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:32,989
It's more than

574
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:37,459
-- we've
-- seen this already though where how many organizations

575
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:40,160
had to keep a copy of IE six laying around

576
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,729
because some, some,

577
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,719
some server they had

578
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,719
only worked with IE six.

579
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,310
Yeah. Well, or the South Korean banking industry, right?

580
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,339
They standardized on that uh one algorithm,

581
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:55,170
encryption algorithm that was then really only available in an active X component.

582
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,510
So South Korea for the longest time was beholden to internet explorer

583
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:01,489
that if you wanted to do online banking, which of course, you know,

584
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,750
pretty much everybody does.

585
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,380
Um I believe they finally changed that.

586
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,989
And so now the browser usage in South Korea is changing, but

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,780
the reality is I think at this point, you know,

588
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,390
the software's gotten so large and so complex, I have to proxy my trust to a

589
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:15,969
lot of,

590
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:19,130
there's, there's two, there's two sides to this,

591
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,359
I think is there's the concept of proxy and

592
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,130
trust where I run yum update on my Linux machine

593
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,380
and stuff happens and I get updates

594
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,810
and if you have AAA Mac,

595
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,439
you get magic updates. If you have Windows, you get updates.

596
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,520
It's, in fact, I think in,

597
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,239
in Windows now you don't have a choice like you're just getting the updates.

598
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:42,079
Well, what they did is they used to provide updates,

599
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:47,229
essentially one software update per sort of vulnerability kind of model, right?

600
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,479
Uh or not necessarily per vulnerability but per block, you know,

601
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,869
group of vulnerabilities and say a specific version, right?

602
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,469
And you could download them separately and test them and install them and blah,

603
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:55,880
blah blah.

604
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,670
And then starting in, I think it was October of this year.

605
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,630
They like for Windows 10, there's every Microsoft Tuesday is now one file

606
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:05,050
for Windows 10,

607
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,180
I believe for server, they're still broken up, but don't quote me on that.

608
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,670
Um But for Windows 10, for the desktop especially,

609
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,709
it's like here's your update for October, either install it or don't

610
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:17,150
right there

611
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,329
by default they install,

612
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,010
which means the vast majority of people are just going to get updates magically,

613
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,619
which I do think is the right thing.

614
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,609
Mind you, I think that is correct.

615
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,640
But now

616
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,569
at the same time,

617
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:31,050
you've got

618
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,329
these operating systems and applications

619
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,250
that

620
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,520
-- I, I think for the
-- most part

621
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,670
critical systems.

622
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,280
That's fair. I agree with that.

623
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,569
But then we look at these devices

624
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,439
and

625
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,739
is it, is it, this, is it a comparable

626
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,949
thing that's happening with the way we're updating

627
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,469
a computer versus the way we're updating,

628
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,869
say a smoke alarm

629
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:58,800
where Google is just pushing things to it and you don't,

630
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,079
I think you just hit the nail on the head.

631
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,719
That's not a smoke alarm. That's a computer

632
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,560
that happens to behave as a smoke alarm.

633
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,439
But fundamentally it's a computer. It's a general

634
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,599
-- purpose computer,
-- isn't it?

635
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:14,459
Was, it, was it Bruce Schneier who said, uh, it's not a car,

636
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,969
it's not a car with a computer.

637
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:17,280
It's a computer with wheels.

638
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,160
Yeah. And I would agree. I mean,

639
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:19,790
I,

640
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,329
I look at my bathroom scale,

641
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,189
my bathroom scale is a general purpose computer that just,

642
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,359
its main purpose happens to be displaying to me how much I weigh.

643
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:28,339
Ok.

644
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,939
So, so we can call it a computer that also does something else, which I think is fair.

645
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,390
Well, I think the problem is,

646
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,459
is it used to be that even if you had a somewhat general purpose computer in a device,

647
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,060
it wasn't networked.

648
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,959
Right. So, the attack scenario for it was very limited. Like you had to have,

649
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,380
let's not even get to attacks.

650
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,400
I mean, we, we're just worried about updating this stuff.

651
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,900
And what about when manufacturers intentionally break something?

652
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:56,969
That's,

653
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,729
it's never really been a problem before.

654
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,560
Well,

655
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:02,550
the majority of these computers I think were doing things

656
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,979
that were simple enough that they almo like a toaster,

657
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,609
you know,

658
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,650
uh, a toaster definitely has the potential for failure most, like, just,

659
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,729
you know, burning the heck out of everything right

660
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,359
-- now.
-- Ok. So, yes, I mean, let's use a toaster is I

661
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,160
am on probably my third or fourth toaster since getting married

662
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,839
because the old ones will break eventually.

663
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,719
And

664
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,599
underwriters labs did some testing and said when the toaster fails,

665
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,680
it won't explode and burst into flames, it'll just stop working,

666
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:32,589
which is what happened.

667
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:34,680
And then I went to the store and I bought a new toaster

668
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,719
and

669
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,449
that makes sense.

670
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,579
But now let's think about it in the context of iot

671
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,560
there's failure modes for things

672
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,790
and let's even assume someday your smoke alarms will fail due to

673
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,069
whatever manufacturing

674
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:52,349
I've actually had

675
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,599
a smoke alarm fail.

676
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,099
Ok.

677
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,589
It started randomly going off at three in the morning.

678
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,510
And what was most interesting to me? What a good feature.

679
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,810
Yeah, it was awesome. It was a great week. What was most interesting to me at first?

680
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:06,869
I was like, whatever the first time it happened, you know, also I was so, like,

681
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,469
woken up and just so disoriented.

682
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,189
Right. I had no idea what was really going on.

683
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,050
Um, you know, I'm stumbling around the house looking for fire. Like, what the heck.

684
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,550
Anyway,

685
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:19,189
-- so after like four or five times of this happening, I phoned
-- four times.

686
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:22,260
I think after the second, I would have thrown the thing away.

687
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,790
Uh, well, it was intermittent, right?

688
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,270
Like it happened once and then it happened like a month later and then,

689
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,640
you know, um, and then it happened like twice,

690
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,900
I think in one week anyways point being is I phone Google

691
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,380
and the guy, you know, what's your name?

692
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,959
Like some security questions for your account? Fair enough.

693
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,839
And then he's like, ok, let me check the records

694
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,680
and you know what? He immediately said, he said, oh yeah, that doesn't look right.

695
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:45,900
Yeah. No.

696
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,569
So, but the point is Google had the data where they could very and he's like, yeah,

697
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,469
we'll get one to you.

698
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,390
Like basically the way it works is they send you a new

699
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,339
one and then you send the old one back in the box

700
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:56,900
and you have like 30 days or something to do it.

701
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,420
And it literally showed up like two days later.

702
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,060
And, but the point being is they had the data on their end

703
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,339
that allowed them to very easily

704
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,260
apparently make that call of.

705
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,069
Yes, this is broken like the smoke alarm definitely went off,

706
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,189
but the temperature sensors weren't going off.

707
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,229
There was no smoke

708
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,930
sensor more to the point why doesn't their system automatically flag that?

709
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,150
-- But I
-- digress because it would cost them money to be proactive.

710
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:21,540
Yeah.

711
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,510
So, but what was interesting to me was that they, they, you know, like the,

712
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,869
I don't know if you remember the Tesla Lemon story,

713
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,170
but basically Google had the data

714
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:31,010
to essentially say, oh, yeah. No, you're right.

715
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,770
Your smoke alarm is broken and we'll fix

716
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,930
it right away because it's clearly our problem,

717
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:35,689
not yours.

718
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,869
And I think that's an example of things going. Right.

719
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,510
But now if you bought, I mean, smoke detectors are a terrible example here.

720
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,829
But if you bought smoke detectors from some dodgy internet site

721
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,040
that are,

722
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,709
-- you know,
-- you know where the

723
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:48,400
Depot

724
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:49,280
comes from.

725
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,150
But are they internet connected?

726
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,810
Yeah, dude, go to Home Depot now. They have an entire aisle of home automation.

727
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,869
Even if I went in there and looked,

728
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,040
I would not go down that aisle because I'm sure I would,

729
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,290
I would be weeping by the time I made it to the other,

730
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,469
I, I've looked at these and I recognize I'm like, oh, Google Nest. I recognize that.

731
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,400
And then there's a whole bunch of brand names where I'm like, uh,

732
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,689
you know, Honeywell's gotten into it. Ok. Good.

733
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,459
Did Honeywell do it, or did they subcontract?

734
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,979
I don't know, you know, Google probably subcontracted this stuff.

735
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,310
Yeah. Well, they bought nests. So.

736
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,630
But, um, yeah. So,

737
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,030
you know, it's, um,

738
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,869
yeah, it's, it's worrying. But,

739
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,079
yeah, the failure modes. I think the problem is it's

740
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,430
kind of going back to quality of life.

741
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:37,500
You know, if your fridge fails, that's, that's a pain. Right.

742
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,630
You know, those things are big and heavy to move.

743
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,569
They're, you know, they're typically full of a couple of 100 bucks of food,

744
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,650
um, or a freezer, you know, a freezer just turns off. Right.

745
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,979
You're gonna lose a couple of 100 bucks of food, potentially.

746
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,069
Right.

747
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,770
But, ok. No, no, no, there is.

748
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,619
That's a different.

749
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,040
I I think the problem is there's like 10 things going on here at the same time,

750
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:58,760
right?

751
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,839
Because failure is not necessarily the same as updates,

752
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,459
which is not necessarily the same as

753
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,040
the the whether you own something or not.

754
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:13,359
And and we can even confuse it more by throwing in that open source angle of, you know,

755
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:17,000
does it run Linux, which is always the first thing I ask when I get a new device of,

756
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,439
you know, can I put Linux on that?

757
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:22,280
Which granted there's no good reason to do it. It's just can I,

758
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,119
let's see.

759
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,319
And so now you also have the issue of,

760
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,880
let's say you have a smoke detector and let's say,

761
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,869
Lord forbid you put Linux on it because you can

762
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:35,660
and now your house burns down and, and your cat dies.

763
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,849
Well, I would argue that's no,

764
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,819
that's no longer the device the manufacturer sold to you.

765
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,540
And more to the point, I'm sure that it is covered in the U

766
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,339
the

767
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,099
user license

768
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,640
agreement which

769
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,270
you know, you don't get to fiddle with this.

770
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:48,829
So

771
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:49,520
you,

772
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,300
you just,

773
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,189
and uh you said a really important thing is by chain by putting Linux

774
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,359
on it will say it's no longer the device that was sold to you.

775
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:02,260
And I think that might be the key is once

776
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,609
you change the operating system or anything about the software

777
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,719
enabled devices will say

778
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,400
it's not the same device you bought.

779
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:12,709
Well, we already have that right.

780
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:16,439
If you make modifications, physical modifications to avoid a device,

781
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,920
you know, then you typically void the warranty,

782
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,109
but these aren't physical modifications.

783
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,270
I mean, this is,

784
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,930
-- I'm just
-- saying we have that established process that,

785
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,670
you know, if you, if you modify your engine significantly and it blows it,

786
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,319
it throws a rod and blows up,

787
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,300
you know, the engine manufacturer is gonna be like, well,

788
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,589
that's really too bad for you.

789
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,250
And

790
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:39,390
now if you change the software in your car and the same thing happens,

791
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,229
which could be done just given the way this all worked.

792
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:45,270
I assume you'd be in the same boat, right? Where the car manufacturer would be like

793
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,180
you put Linux

794
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,569
in your Toyota, man. I'm not actually probably run

795
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,199
well. It's, you know, because there are part of the challenge here, right?

796
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,130
Is a lot of people have moved safety

797
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,219
systems from being hardware shutoffs to software shutoffs.

798
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:57,920
Right.

799
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,189
Right.

800
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,250
You know, so there are actual governors and limiters, especially in car software,

801
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,339
right.

802
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:03,300
That limit, you know,

803
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,979
when things happen, like, when do the sparkplugs fire, when does the fuel, you know,

804
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:08,540
how much fuel, how much air?

805
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,020
Right.

806
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,070
Uh, so you could easily break a car, you know, by mucking with the software.

807
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:14,310
-- I'm guessing
-- without a doubt.

808
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,449
And I suppose if you bring that back to the manufacturer,

809
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,540
they're gonna tell you not our problem.

810
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:19,389
However,

811
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,110
in a lot of cases,

812
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,938
it's, you can't make these changes.

813
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:28,649
Well, and I guess that's kind of the way these devices are going, which is very anti

814
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,379
open

815
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:29,840
source.

816
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,070
Richard

817
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,429
Stallman

818
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,020
was.

819
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,120
Richard Stallman probably isn't a very happy guy right now.

820
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,889
I'd imagine that

821
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,520
it's, but at the same time, I mean, this is where I'm super torn is,

822
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,399
I love the open source universe and I

823
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,909
have obviously spent a significant amount of my life

824
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,350
working in that place,

825
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,149
right.

826
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,728
But at the same time, I don't want people putting Linux in their Tesla.

827
00:34:55,958 --> 00:35:00,629
I don't want a self driving car being controlled by some crap,

828
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,800
some guy downloaded off github.

829
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:03,899
You know what I mean?

830
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,760
Well, yeah, it really comes to that competency angle.

831
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,209
I mean, a great example of this where we had problems was, remember, mail servers,

832
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:11,540
right?

833
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,139
Remember back in the day when actually people used to run their own mail servers

834
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:18,739
and a lot of them were poorly run and spam was a huge problem.

835
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,830
So we had things like blacklists and, you know, Oh, this IP address is known to

836
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:22,729
the

837
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:23,169
relay.

838
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,489
Well, true.

839
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,219
Well, you know,

840
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:27,570
but we've gotten pretty good filtering now so I

841
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,139
get very little spam actually into my inbox,

842
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:30,530
you know.

843
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:32,389
Um, but anyways,

844
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:33,570
so we have that, you know,

845
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,010
where basically the majority of people no longer run mail servers,

846
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,290
they use a mail service.

847
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,959
Um, the challenge being with email, we have that network effect of, you know,

848
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:45,699
I have to talk to other people with a car.

849
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,739
My car can be totally rude and that's great for me. You know, I'm running,

850
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,780
run anyone over though.

851
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,030
No,

852
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,199
but that's the problem, right?

853
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,959
Is with an email, you have this network effect of, you have to

854
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:01,120
communicate with other people with cars. Like your car can be a total rude,

855
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,040
you know, speeding butting in line and that's ok.

856
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,520
You know, until the cops catch you

857
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,260
except they're in self driving cars too so they can't get you.

858
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:11,489
Yeah.

859
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:14,310
So I, I really wonder, you know,

860
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,469
there's a lot of uh a great example being like wi fi access points, right?

861
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:20,959
Like if I juice up my access points, so I get a better signal in my house.

862
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:23,100
It, you know, interferes more with my neighbors.

863
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes. And it may burn your radio out faster. So I've been told,

864
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,320
um you know, so I,

865
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,270
I it boils down to,

866
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,790
I'm not necessarily opposed to people changing the

867
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,409
firmware on these things or modifying them,

868
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,199
but I would have to question. Did, did they do so correctly?

869
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,169
Did they do so? You know, and

870
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,875
so what would the intent of the change? Right.

871
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:48,425
Are they intending to make it better or are they actually just trying to be, you know,

872
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:48,905
rude?

873
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,625
Well, but, but here's the thing again,

874
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:56,264
if I take my wireless access point and I crank the wireless up to an 11,

875
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:58,675
so it's drowning out all my neighbors.

876
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,945
Nobody's going to get killed.

877
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,939
And I think that's,

878
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:03,560
that's the

879
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,459
stop working.

880
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,020
I would stop getting, well, no, they would work locally,

881
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,899
but I wouldn't get the alerts.

882
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:10,500
For example,

883
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:14,439
you wouldn't get the alerts, but the device would still be functional and,

884
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,030
and, and,

885
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:16,979
or what if you, what if,

886
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:20,679
what if you have some sort of radio jamming and the cell phone stop working.

887
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:24,399
You can't dial 911. So there are angles to this. But fundamentally, right.

888
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,159
Fundamentally,

889
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:27,659
if I modify an access point,

890
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,800
there isn't an immediate,

891
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,399
I, I guess danger. Whereas if I have a car that's

892
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,239
driving like a maniac,

893
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:37,760
that's very odd.

894
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,560
And I guess this is part of our challenge is how do we wrap our heads around

895
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,489
this concept of what is dangerous, what isn't dangerous, what's harmless,

896
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,629
what isn't harmless?

897
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,429
And

898
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:49,209
it's,

899
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,969
it's not obvious.

900
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:51,439
Yeah.

901
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:51,629
No,

902
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,409
I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna basically computerize a lot more stuff.

903
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:57,169
And currently, you know, we've never really,

904
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,969
we've not computerized.

905
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:03,290
Uh, well, we've computerized airplanes and ships quite heavily actually.

906
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:06,669
But those things tend to be professionally operated. Right.

907
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,500
Like, you have, you know, to be an airline pilot,

908
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,149
you actually need to know how to fly one of these things, you know, reasonably well.

909
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,290
Whereas I hate to say it, but with cars I know,

910
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,750
especially in some places like North America, you know,

911
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,310
and other jurisdictions, Eastern Europe, for example, or whatever,

912
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:24,610
you know, there's, there's a pretty low barrier to entry.

913
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,820
Um, they actually just wrapped up another season of Canada's worst drivers.

914
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,929
And what always I'm reminded of, you know, is for Canada's worst driver.

915
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:36,290
These people have to have a license and insurance to go on the show.

916
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,370
They're legally allowed, like they legally are allowed to drive

917
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,379
and these people are terrible.

918
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:47,149
Like, like I remember the one lady, uh, on one of the first, uh, seasons was like,

919
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,929
well, I only drink and drive when I go to Bingo.

920
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah, that, that was her rational.

921
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,199
-- It's late at night and there's not many people on the road. Here's
-- the problem.

922
00:38:58,209 --> 00:38:58,939
So firstly,

923
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,739
I'll say I've been through enough countries now

924
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,379
that I think I can say with confidence

925
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,419
there is nowhere that isn't full of terrible drivers,

926
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,300
right? So there's that, but more importantly is

927
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:11,500
your, your thing of I only drink and drive when go to bingo

928
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,729
and that's the problem with people

929
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:17,409
is everyone thinks they're special and so they think they can

930
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:20,850
do something that breaks the rules and it's no big deal.

931
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,610
So, because it's my car,

932
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,139
I can install Linux on it and that's ok because everyone else isn't doing it.

933
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:30,409
And I'm smart and I'm special when in reality

934
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm not.

935
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:32,760
And

936
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:37,489
in some instances you might have someone who has enough knowledge to not, like,

937
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,260
be killing pedestrians by installing Linux on their car.

938
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,000
But in many instances it won't be, I mean,

939
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:47,120
I don't know if you still have this problem, but I remember back in the day

940
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,229
I would have people I knew be like, oh,

941
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,510
I just put Linux on my computer and now everything's broken.

942
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,449
Can you come fix it?

943
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,250
And that's what, that's like my,

944
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,409
that's my horror of letting people like mess

945
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,419
with these devices is they're gonna be like,

946
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:02,729
oh yeah, I tried putting, you know, th this thing on my car and,

947
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:05,209
and it's broken now and I need someone to fix it for me.

948
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:06,340
-- Would
-- you be

949
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,000
-- more
-- concerned about the,

950
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,790
the more quieter failure modes where like the breaking,

951
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,919
the breaking doesn't work on ice in winter anymore,

952
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,149
but you don't find that out for six months because

953
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,399
you know, you did the software modification in June.

954
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,959
That's true. That's, that's a really good point actually.

955
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:22,979
And that's,

956
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:25,840
that's what really terrifies me with a lot of this internet of things is like,

957
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,639
for example,

958
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,280
with these nest smoke alarms knowing what I know about them. Now,

959
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,820
I don't think I would buy them to be honest.

960
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,350
But the problem is I didn't learn about sort of all the failure modes

961
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,800
and all the problems with nest smoke alarms until I had operational experience.

962
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,850
And quite frankly, I don't, I, I'm probably not rich enough to, like,

963
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,360
buy six different self driving cars and somehow test

964
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,810
them out properly and make sure that they work,

965
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,169
you know, I'm really gonna have to rely on like the law and consumer reports and, and

966
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:57,409
whatever,

967
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,520
you know, to same thing with like these, you know, that,

968
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,489
that's why I've essentially banned the internet of things from my house.

969
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:07,429
I, I refuse to invest money into these things. Like a great example. Being Pebble.

970
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:10,340
Remember Pebble watches? Super awesome. Watch kick started.

971
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:11,610
Yeah.

972
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,699
So Fitbit bought them

973
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,409
and then an email went out saying, you know, the, the servers that

974
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,659
I guess make Pebble do useful things.

975
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,459
Um, yeah, they're, they're gonna do less of that and, or be turned off.

976
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,219
-- So, you know, good luck.
-- Right.

977
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,139
It sounds like

978
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,030
they pebble bought mostly the intellectual property and the

979
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,820
employees and then everything else is up too bad.

980
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:35,840
Yep.

981
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,270
Well, and you know,

982
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:37,729
you,

983
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,479
you spent money acquiring this company and now you're going to spend more

984
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:44,229
money making sure their old product keeps working that you don't sell anymore.

985
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,830
Yeah, that's, that's going to be a common case, I think for the internet of things.

986
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:50,100
I mean, it totally will be

987
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,239
so,

988
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,760
you know, and that's why I've just literally banned.

989
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,090
I mean, I was given an internet of things device for Christmas.

990
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:57,939
Uh

991
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,139
and it only worked on 2.4 gigahertz

992
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:00,540
Wi

993
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:02,070
Fi not on five gigahertz wi

994
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:02,459
Fi.

995
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,179
And to talk to it, you had to talk directly to it,

996
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,860
right? You didn't talk through a server, which was kind of nice. But then

997
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,419
when I upgraded my wifi to five gigahertz, I mean, if I wanted to control this device,

998
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:11,979
I had to like

999
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,729
leave the five gigahertz wi Fi join the 2.4 gigahertz wi

1000
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,219
Fi.

1001
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,439
Talk to this device, make it do something and then, you know,

1002
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:19,729
go back to the five gigahertz Wi

1003
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:20,229
Fi.

1004
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,750
-- Ok?
-- But look, let's face reality though as well. You talk tough.

1005
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:28,560
But if your kids show up on Christmas Day with some little toy

1006
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,919
that's IOT and internet connected and they beg you to use it,

1007
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,540
you're gonna cave,

1008
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:34,159
right?

1009
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,330
You're gonna cave. You don't even pretend you are,

1010
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:37,300
you know,

1011
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,290
but I'm not gonna buy, for example, light bulbs or a thermostat or,

1012
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,250
you know,

1013
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,060
all these other things that require internet access and software updates.

1014
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:51,149
In, in fact, I know my, my wife one time asked about, oh, we should get one of those nest

1015
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,040
thermostats.

1016
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,310
And I said, no, my,

1017
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,020
like $10 piece of crap mercury filled thing I have on the wall that works great.

1018
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,649
I'm not getting anything else.

1019
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,889
Yeah. No, it's Yeah, I, the thermostat thing really blew me away.

1020
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:06,719
That Google essentially said that these things will not operate

1021
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:10,000
without internet because that's not the experience we want people to have.

1022
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:14,040
Right. And I know someone, I forget who even told me this, but

1023
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,699
their internet died

1024
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,800
in their house and the furnace quit working or something

1025
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:19,550
like

1026
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:19,989
that.

1027
00:43:21,229 --> 00:43:23,469
Well, yeah, especially if you live in a cold climate,

1028
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,879
but it wasn't that cold at the time.

1029
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:26,969
But, yeah, it's, it's terrifying.

1030
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:29,080
So, I've actually seen that happen.

1031
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,699
Uh, my kid ripped the thermostat off the wall at their, their house,

1032
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,810
broke it. And, um,

1033
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:38,110
so I had to tell my ex-wife essentially how to hot wire the furnace. Right.

1034
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,409
Luckily you just touch two wires together to turn it off.

1035
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:42,449
Yeah, pretty much.

1036
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,570
But I was like, just take, you know, what is it like,

1037
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,620
the white and the red one just twist them together,

1038
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,889
you know, and do that for like half an hour every hour or whatever

1039
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,449
and, you know, and we'll, we'll fix the thermostat tomorrow or whatever,

1040
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,979
you know, it's, but, you know, when it's minus 40 blowing outside you like right now.

1041
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:02,129
So, just so the listeners know,

1042
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,189
I have to turn my furnace off while we podcast

1043
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:06,409
because it makes enough noise that you can hear it.

1044
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,659
And typically in the 1 to 1.5 hours, we do a podcast,

1045
00:44:09,669 --> 00:44:12,939
-- the temperature in my house drops by about four degrees Celsius
-- and,

1046
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:14,939
and to avoid looking like a huge dirt bag,

1047
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:17,260
I have told Kurt on multiple occasions that we can

1048
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,500
live with the noise and to turn your furnace on.

1049
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:21,540
Yeah. But, uh, no, it's not so bad.

1050
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,399
It goes from about, I,

1051
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,439
so what I do now is I have that I set the

1052
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:27,010
temperature one or two degrees higher than it normally would be.

1053
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:29,209
So that way it only gets down to about 17

1054
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,590
Â°C in the house.

1055
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:36,379
Yeah. So it's, my feet are a bit chilly, but beyond that I'm, I'm not going to die.

1056
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:37,520
Um,

1057
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,179
but fundamentally, you know, II, I,

1058
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,540
-- yeah, I really do like heat in winter. It's a good thing.
-- It is a very nice thing.

1059
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,820
And if it's any consolation

1060
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,689
I am very cold as well because I live in a really old

1061
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:52,939
house and my office has two exterior walls and when I shut the door

1062
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,260
it gets freezing in here and my windows are super old too.

1063
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,340
So, like, everything sucks.

1064
00:44:58,169 --> 00:44:58,449
Yeah.

1065
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:58,800
I,

1066
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,260
I've looked at buying one of those Dyson bladeless

1067
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,060
heaters but they're like four or 500 bucks,

1068
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:03,209
you know,

1069
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:04,669
you could probably go to the store and

1070
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:07,739
buy an internet connected space heater for $25.

1071
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,189
Yeah. Right. Exactly.

1072
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:14,399
Yeah. I actually, oh, what was it? Oh, yeah. Those USB cup heaters

1073
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,649
just get

1074
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:16,379
a,

1075
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:16,520
yeah.

1076
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:18,000
Right. There, there you go.

1077
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:20,840
There you go. That's probably energy efficient. I think.

1078
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,719
I think I have a Bitcoin miner in the basement. I should go dig that thing out.

1079
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,050
Ok. So, so, anyway, anyway,

1080
00:45:28,169 --> 00:45:28,179
I

1081
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:28,350
think,

1082
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:33,679
I think what we can agree on is that it's probably a bad idea to modify software on a,

1083
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:38,909
you know, 2000 pound device that can approach speeds of over 100 miles an hour.

1084
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,040
-- Ok.
-- But, so there's that aspect and let's say

1085
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,600
you buy a device

1086
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,439
-- and you can't update it, which is very anti
-- android

1087
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:50,719
phone. Anything

1088
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:53,110
like, like your toaster, your refrigerator,

1089
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,020
you are not allowed to change the software.

1090
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,879
The things the manufacturer

1091
00:45:58,334 --> 00:45:58,985
gives you

1092
00:45:59,195 --> 00:46:01,655
is the way it is, it will self update,

1093
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:05,014
it's gonna run its own thing and there's nothing you can do about it.

1094
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:05,675
Right.

1095
00:46:05,824 --> 00:46:09,905
Not open source friendly, but that's kind of the way things are going today,

1096
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,754
-- but
-- it's kind of how things are. I

1097
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:12,465
mean, look at your

1098
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:12,844
existing

1099
00:46:13,024 --> 00:46:14,274
toaster, how would you modify it?

1100
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,780
Magic?

1101
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,340
You know, you'd have to dig it apart. Replace some custom circuit maybe or,

1102
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
-- I don't know.
-- Ok.

1103
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,860
So, so there's that, ok,

1104
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,139
let's say we can't update anything and that's just going to be the way it is,

1105
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:29,770
which is very anti

1106
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,739
open ideals.

1107
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:32,399
But

1108
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,939
ignoring that argument for now,

1109
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,500
even though this is called the Open source Security Podcast. But ignoring that

1110
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:39,100
right

1111
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:42,750
now, you have a universe where

1112
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:47,919
the manufacturer, if they go out of business or they decide to end of life, a product

1113
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,669
or

1114
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,770
goodness knows their server room crashes.

1115
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,229
Now,

1116
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:58,350
what happens to the device when it can't receive updates or it can't phone home or,

1117
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,239
or whatever?

1118
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,270
There's a bunch of things that can happen here.

1119
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:02,129
Yeah.

1120
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:03,209
Well, and that's why I,

1121
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:06,729
I would really like some sort of labeling system for internet of things,

1122
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:08,290
devices that say, for example,

1123
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:13,090
you know, does this device require internet for setup for operation?

1124
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,219
What happens if you don't have internet?

1125
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,760
You know, can you set it up? Can you?

1126
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:18,659
Well,

1127
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,239
yeah, I mean, I used to really enjoy Razor

1128
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,290
mice, you know, they're gaming mice.

1129
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,530
But then I realized, you know, if I don't have internet,

1130
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:29,310
the mouse doesn't quite work properly.

1131
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:29,879
A

1132
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,899
mouse, Razor mice have software um

1133
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:37,610
that for at least for the setup and stuff requires internet access and

1134
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,750
they have this thing where you can store your profiles on their central server

1135
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,669
so that you can have like you can download your profile.

1136
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,149
It's like for the gamers and stuff, right?

1137
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,590
So they can download their, their key mappings and whatnot, you know, easily.

1138
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:53,850
Um But fundamentally it's like I'm, I don't really wanna

1139
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,600
use hardware that depends on talking to some

1140
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,379
random internet server doing God knows what,

1141
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,000
especially when you know, it can download and install more software,

1142
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:06,110
right? I just, I have trust issues,

1143
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:06,580
right.

1144
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:07,729
Well, you do,

1145
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,129
but most people do.

1146
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,689
Well, most people aren't even aware it's happening,

1147
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:12,939
right?

1148
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,100
You know, that's the one thing I love.

1149
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,959
So I use Macs and I, you know, run Linux and virtual machines,

1150
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,439
but I use little snitch firewall program that, you know,

1151
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:23,250
especially for outgoing connections is quite fascinating.

1152
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,379
All the stuff that wants to make outgoing connections to weird stuff,

1153
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:29,459
you know. Um My favorite case was like Webex,

1154
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,139
Cisco. Webex doesn't use my DNS servers.

1155
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:35,209
It uses 8.8 0.8 0.8 whether you like it or not.

1156
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:36,790
Interesting,

1157
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:37,729
you know,

1158
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,290
um, from their point of view, I totally get it. You know, they,

1159
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:44,120
that's a way that's a DNS server that typically works

1160
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:48,550
from my point of view. I filter out going DNS and incoming DNS and I log it all.

1161
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,729
So I'm not a big fan of that.

1162
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:55,409
Oh man. All right. So we've rambled on about this for the longest time, I guess.

1163
00:48:55,419 --> 00:48:56,889
Let's wrap it up. Like this

1164
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:03,449
is updating the Samsung Galaxy Note seven to brick itself a good idea

1165
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:04,530
or a bad idea.

1166
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,080
I think it's a great idea.

1167
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:09,219
I would say

1168
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,280
part of me thinks it's a good idea,

1169
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,370
but part of me is worried other manufacturers will

1170
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,419
then use that excuse to do terrible things.

1171
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,419
It is certainly not out of the question.

1172
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,820
My concern is the thin end of the wedge.

1173
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,370
You know, what about when a device reaches end of life?

1174
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,409
What do they

1175
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:30,030
-- force the end of life?
-- Is it?

1176
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:30,550
I mean,

1177
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:31,570
that's we should,

1178
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:32,709
that's a whole sale

1179
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,520
doctrine, right? Like

1180
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,389
I bought my toaster, let's say it's supported for three years. Great.

1181
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:41,399
But what if I want to keep using it because it still kind of toasts. Ok. Mostly,

1182
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,030
you know, or for example, like, um, you know, the cabin, we,

1183
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,379
we have internet over well via cell phone.

1184
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:49,719
But,

1185
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,510
you know, with, at the cabin,

1186
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,070
what's gonna happen when these devices don't have internet

1187
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,750
all the time or only part of the time?

1188
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,409
I don't know. All right. So let's do this, let's

1189
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,580
call it quits

1190
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:02,409
and acknowledge that getting rid of the Galaxy Note

1191
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:05,229
Seven is probably a net benefit to society.

1192
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,250
However,

1193
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,830
I think something we should do is go away

1194
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,620
and do some research in a planned obsolescence,

1195
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:14,340
which is a thing in industrial manufacturing,

1196
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,639
forced obsolescence would be the

1197
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:20,820
planned obsolescence is where they basically build a device

1198
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,330
to only work for a set amount of time.

1199
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,659
And this is like physical, non internet connected things.

1200
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:29,219
But I think forced obsolescence is kind of where we're going with this.

1201
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:30,300
And

1202
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,659
is that,

1203
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,709
is, is that the future?

1204
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:36,840
I, I don't know, I think this is something for us to go and look into because I mean,

1205
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,399
let's face it.

1206
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:37,689
Like

1207
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:39,419
we all heard stories about, you know,

1208
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:42,000
grandma's washing machine that lasted for 75 years.

1209
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,979
And now like if you get five years out of a washing machine, you're doing pretty good,

1210
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:45,479
you know.

1211
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:49,209
So it's just, it's, it's interesting how this all works. So,

1212
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,360
I'd actually be less worried about the obsolescence

1213
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:52,379
thing and more worried about the fact.

1214
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:53,709
Can I resell this device?

1215
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,590
-- I never sell
-- anything, you know,

1216
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:56,290
on

1217
00:50:56,729 --> 00:50:57,129
my

1218
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,209
neck,

1219
00:50:58,979 --> 00:51:00,479
my car, I sold my own car.

1220
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:01,760
But anyway, alright,

1221
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:03,600
thank you folks

1222
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,570
for listening. Thank you, Kurt for this

1223
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,959
ridiculous conversation in all the bizarre places it went.

1224
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:16,020
This is an insane problem to say the least and I know this won't be the last we talk

1225
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,580
about it and it certainly won't be the last

1226
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,600
we hear about it because I'm sure there are countless

1227
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,040
precedent setting events.

1228
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:27,020
This is gonna be the first Christmas where there's gonna,

1229
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,989
I think there's really gonna be a lot of internet connected toys,

1230
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,479
especially for the voice recognition.

1231
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,189
You're absolutely right.

1232
00:51:33,209 --> 00:51:34,340
And not only that,

1233
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,929
but there's gonna be tons of disappointment

1234
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:37,479
because some of these servers will crash.

1235
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:38,159
Right.

1236
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:41,419
It's gonna be great. Merry Christmas. Everybody.

1237
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,679
-- Happy holidays. All right,
-- Kurt, I'll talk to you later. Thanks.

1238
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,179
Bye bye bye.
