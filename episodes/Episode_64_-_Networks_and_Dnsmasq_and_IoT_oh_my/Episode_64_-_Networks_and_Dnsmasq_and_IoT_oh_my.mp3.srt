Hello and welcome to episode 64 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,720
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,829
-- and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser
-- 64 is a great number

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,430
as, as a monkey with 10 fingers.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,889
I love the number 64. More than 50 or 60

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,280
or 70 I guess. So. There we go.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,940
I think my favorite large integer in that neighborhood is 60

7
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:32,040
because of the signs

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,099
they were, right.

9
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:37,689
Whatever. 64 is a special number for computers. So, it's awesome.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,540
Yeah.

11
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,610
Anyway, actually it's, it's, it's funny,

12
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,090
I remember one time I was talking to somebody, this was,

13
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,380
this was years and years and years ago and

14
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,470
I don't know why we were talking about it but the powers of two

15
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,220
were, were part of the conversation and, like, I know many of them.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,919
Right, just due to computer stuff.

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,729
And I, I used to know a lot more than I do now because I, I don't,

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,099
I don't deal with a lot of this stuff

19
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,430
and they were flabbergasted that a human being would know,

20
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,699
like two to the power of anything well into the many digits.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,669
And it, yeah, it was it was fun.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,919
I mean, well, but people memorize sports statistics and dresses. I mean,

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,949
I have to memorize my new postal code and I'm like, t

24
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,480
five.

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,900
Uh,

26
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:21,879
-- yeah.
-- Anyway,

27
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:22,470
you

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:22,790
know

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,980
that, that's right. But write that stuff down.

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,489
Right.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,220
I just plug in my address to Google and it's like

32
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:33,220
this address, this post code and I'm like, oh, thank you, Google

33
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,459
-- it.
-- I

34
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,150
hope it's right

35
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,819
because my packages are going there,

36
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,669
someone's gonna get a surprise.

37
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:46,250
Oh man, I know, I know exactly what you mean. Actually, that's one thing I, I remember

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,839
when I moved,

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,769
I would always freak out that I was sending packages to the wrong address

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,349
and it was one of those things I would keep double checking the,

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,569
the emails just to make sure even though I checked them 10 times before

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,610
you got to love it.

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,730
Yeah.

44
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:04,500
All part of the fun man.

45
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:09,369
So I guess on a darker notes, uh do you want to say it or do I

46
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,179
say I am sick of

47
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,529
terrorists?

48
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:14,429
So

49
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,509
locally here in Edmonton,

50
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,149
like, seriously, I live in Edmonton.

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,440
Ok,

52
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,149
like you're going to have to Google it unless you're a

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,220
sports fan and know who the Edmonton Oilers are or,

54
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,740
or you host a podcast with a dude from Edmonton.

55
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:29,169
But seriously, so we had a terrorist attack on Saturday,

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,350
uh an immigrant, uh essentially, well hit a cop with his car,

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
then tried to stab him a bit, then ran away,

58
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,830
uh, and then the cops caught him at a checkpoint, he drove off, uh,

59
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:45,990
he gotten a U haul van somehow, probably, I guess, rented it as well.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,309
And he basically tried to drive over a bunch of people, hurt four people.

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,339
Luckily nobody died.

62
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,610
Uh, and then they caught him and of course,

63
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:56,160
now he's been arrested and he's facing a whole pile of, you know,

64
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,740
terrorist related charges.

65
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:57,929
Um,

66
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:02,270
oh, yeah, he had a, an ISIS flake in his car. So they're pretty sure it was

67
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,389
that,

68
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:09,039
-- um, but that all pales in comparison to, I guess your country's news?
-- Oh,

69
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,699
man, this thing in Vegas.

70
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,449
Some, some crazy person, I think not calling them a terrorist is wrong

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,369
but they were in the Mandalay Bay and shot up a crowd of people,

72
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,220
which is, which is, I guess

73
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,500
the thing that freaks me out as well is Mandalay

74
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:26,419
Bay is where black hat is held every year.

75
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,860
And so, like I was there just a couple of months ago

76
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,740
and, yeah, it's crazy, man.

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,149
Yeah. No, it's, uh,

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,660
but we're not going to talk about the things because I think

79
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,089
quite frankly probably everybody else just like us has heard more than

80
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,740
-- enough about that. Thank
-- goodness. I know. I know, man. Everyone has an opinion

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,699
and there is, uh, anyway, let's, let's talk about security, right?

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,380
Yeah.

83
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,279
So one bit of good news, the fiber guys did their little,

84
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,649
uh,

85
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:59,139
you know, where they put that orange flexible pipe, I guess you call it.

86
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,740
It's like a garden hose basically, you know,

87
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,179
they shove it through the earth and then they'll blow the fiber through it later.

88
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,509
Conduit.

89
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,300
Is it Conduit?

90
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:07,559
Conduit?

91
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,740
Because Conduit can be flexible pipe is rigid.

92
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,889
I think I'm gonna Google that later.

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm probably wrong.

94
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:19,209
Um, but yeah, so it was, it was, uh, quite nice because they're, uh,

95
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,470
doing up the whole neighborhood.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,899
So about every third or fourth house is getting this, you know,

97
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,839
because you basically whoever signed up to, you know, get this

98
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,470
and um you know,

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,170
my kids were quite enchanted by the little ditch wich digger machine thing,

100
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,929
you know, that shoves the pipes into the ground.

101
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,679
They're awesome.

102
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,880
Oh, they are lovely because I was kind of wondering, I'm like quite honestly,

103
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,220
if you want to install fiber to my house, I you can dig a 50 ft wide trench.

104
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,829
I don't care.

105
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,970
I just want some of that sweet, sweet fiber.

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,559
Um But they dug like a little tiny hole at

107
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,410
the side of the house that they basically then,

108
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,709
you know, ran the conduit to.

109
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,410
And that's that.

110
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:55,239
Yeah, it's pretty cool the way it works, man.

111
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,179
And my assumption is it's even less about digging trenches

112
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,329
as

113
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,179
I bet when you dig a trench,

114
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,899
you have to be super careful because there's no doubt other utilities in the way

115
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:06,339
and so

116
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,380
marked all of them.

117
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:07,899
Yeah.

118
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,420
Um

119
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:12,739
but uh well, the biggest thing with trenching too is that you got to, like,

120
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,540
well, there's like trees and stuff in the

121
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,899
and rocks, you know, just stuff, yeah, sidewalks, whatever.

122
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,779
So, yeah, it was pretty cool because they basically, uh,

123
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,380
they've been working at it for probably about 23 months now and they started with,

124
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,260
you know, kind of pulling the main fibers in,

125
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,279
um, you know, kind of the backbone. Right.

126
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,359
And for example, there's like a large vault in the ground in my neighbor's yard.

127
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:37,000
It's about 2 ft by 3 ft, like it's pretty big.

128
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,839
Uh And there's about one of those, every

129
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,940
uh about every block or two, I guess, kind of scattered all over the place. And then

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,920
everybody like me kind of has like a little, sort of a little, I don't know,

131
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:48,570
like

132
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,459
plant pot sized thing in their front lawn, which is where the, you know,

133
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,799
the fiber goes from the little vault to that into

134
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,170
my house or towards the side of my house rather.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,820
Um So yeah, so hopefully soon I'll have 1 50 100 and 50 megabit symmetrical.

136
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,899
Wow, nice man. You could do some pretty serious uploads then.

137
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:06,869
Well,

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,260
I'm actually ditching my file server because I'll be able to upload all my data,

139
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,549
like in a timely manner

140
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,140
you could

141
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,029
run

142
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,920
right now.

143
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:18,570
I think the fastest upload I can get is if I buy like business class service. So,

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,869
and it's like 25

145
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,790
Yeah. Right.

146
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,459
When you think about it, 100 and 50 megabits is, I mean,

147
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,160
I remember running a home network on 100 megabits.

148
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:26,579
Oh,

149
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,549
I remember 10 megabit, you know,

150
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:30,480
two

151
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,040
stupid B and C connectors and then you'd accidentally jiggle one loose.

152
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:35,559
And the thing,

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:35,890
that's

154
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,489
right, if the cap falls off nothing works.

155
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:38,880
Yeah,

156
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,589
exactly. You

157
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:40,549
chasing

158
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:41,510
the cable and,

159
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,709
like, undo every connector, redo it.

160
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,829
Yep. Yep. That stuff is terrible.

161
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:49,059
Or Token Ring, man. Do you ever use Token Ring before?

162
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,350
No, I couldn't afford that stuff.

163
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,750
I only had to use it. Actually, I never set up a token ring network

164
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:56,989
on purpose.

165
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,589
I was working in a company.

166
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,790
No, no, no.

167
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,410
So I was, it was my first job out of college and I'm

168
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:05,399
a, I'm an A IX

169
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:05,609
ed

170
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:09,119
to give me an idea of how progressive this company was.

171
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:09,989
And

172
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,929
so I'm, you know, doing S

173
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,950
Ain stuff

174
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,989
and one day they,

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,980
they come to me and said I need you to get the old Token Ring gear out of the closet and,

176
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:19,049
and set up a network.

177
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,940
I thought they were kidding. Right.

178
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,549
I thought this was like they were, oh, ha, new guy, you know. Right. Exactly.

179
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,260
They're like, no, you don't understand.

180
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:30,700
We have a meeting with a bank in London and they only have Token Ring.

181
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,410
So for the demo, we have to make everything work with Token Ring. And I was like,

182
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,720
you're kidding?

183
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,760
And yet. No, they were like, totally serious.

184
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,799
And we had to stand up the token ring network in

185
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,119
the server room so we can make sure that everything worked.

186
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,640
It was so crazy and it was so bad.

187
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,320
And I remember I,

188
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,329
I use this stuff and by after a day I thought

189
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,220
this is the worst thing anyone has ever created ever.

190
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,440
It was awful.

191
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,480
It was, it was a very,

192
00:07:58,859 --> 00:07:59,470
what's the word I'm gonna,

193
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:00,459
I'm gonna use over

194
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:00,829
engineered

195
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,459
and it solved a lot of problems as it turns out didn't need solving.

196
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,589
That's networking by committee, right? Like that's exactly what Token Ring was.

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,399
It was you like a committee of people in a room and they come up

198
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,000
with Token Ring is the only inevitable solution they're going to come up with.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,130
Yeah.

200
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,459
Well, I guess, you know, well, actually when you think about it,

201
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,079
it's the exact dynamic of a meeting, right?

202
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:26,570
Somebody has the speaking stick. Everybody else has to shut off

203
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,170
-- the table.
-- Not only that in,

204
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,459
in typical group fashion.

205
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,619
Token Ring doesn't have a failure state. Really? Right. Whereas like

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Ether

207
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,599
is just,

208
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:36,890
you

209
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,039
know

210
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,440
what I mean?

211
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,940
Where Ethernet basically, it's like the drunkard on the corner screaming

212
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,440
and, and you know what I mean? Everything works,

213
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,239
but it only works because of, of madness.

214
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,809
Whereas Token Ring is very orderly, right?

215
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,130
It, it feels like something that would come out of a committee. Whereas

216
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,770
Ethernet feels like something like a drunk college kid thought up one night.

217
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,729
Well, the, uh, the, the Metcalf, was it Metcalf?

218
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,909
Anyways, the guy came up with it on the back of

219
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:02,059
a

220
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,570
good news for you.

221
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,169
There is only

222
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,609
one

223
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,010
token ring listing on ebay.com.

224
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,729
So it's almost dead for real.

225
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,479
That, that's actually very impressive. Yes.

226
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,020
Yeah, it's a print server, uh, for a Lexmark printer. Token ring.

227
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:22,640
That's it.

228
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,150
There's, but there's literally that one thing on ebay.com that and I mean,

229
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,679
let's face it.

230
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,380
That means the technology is dead.

231
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,789
Like, you know, if there's no secondary market for,

232
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,820
I agree with that.

233
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,150
So that's good.

234
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,210
I like it when things die sometimes. Uh technology wise.

235
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,080
Uh All right. Just, just because I could, I, I typed it in and my United States, ebay

236
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,919
has more than one.

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,359
I have 2000,

238
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,559
2910.

239
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:49,979
Did you

240
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,030
Lord? You're

241
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,539
Token Lord of the Rings.

242
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,030
Uh I, OK.

243
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,429
So like the fifth thing is a ring now that you say that,

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,330
but uh the vast majority of this, are you doing Token ring,

245
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,969
one word or token space ring?

246
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,070
Uh a bit of both.

247
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,299
I,

248
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,830
I did token space ring and there are some

249
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,799
rings now that you mentioned Lord of the Rings,

250
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,359
which

251
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,580
we'll say that counts.

252
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,539
-- So
-- anyway,

253
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,700
there is some stuff where it's, they kind of spelt it funky and it's

254
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,039
for

255
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:17,330
Token

256
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,549
ring.

257
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
I'm going to declare it undead, right?

258
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:20,640
OK.

259
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:21,719
It's still limping

260
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:21,880
along.

261
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,500
-- It's
-- still hanging in there.

262
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,950
Get your token ring. Now, folks, you're gonna, it's gonna be rough to get,

263
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,059
just don't lose the token

264
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:30,640
-- one.
-- Right.

265
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,119
That's what those rings are for. They're selling, it's fine.

266
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,320
Uh, so anyway, anyway,

267
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,400
anyway,

268
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,210
but, yeah, so, I mean, basically, and that's,

269
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,159
that's largely the premise of getting rid of my,

270
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,229
it here is that my internet connection at home

271
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,130
will actually be faster than, like, my home network was up until. Ok. Well,

272
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,669
I guess 1015 years ago now, 100 megabit. Right.

273
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,659
And

274
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,500
so

275
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,010
the biggest thing, yeah, is that, is that initial,

276
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,219
that upload of all my data can actually happen now and not take like three months.

277
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,325
Mine only took two months. So it's

278
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:04,905
cool. It's

279
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:06,635
-- fine
-- and more to the point.

280
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:10,065
I mean, 150 megabit bidirectional, that's fast enough to, you know,

281
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:13,034
even with somewhat, not great latency, it's going to be, you know,

282
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:16,844
2030 milliseconds to sort of the internet gateway of my ISP.

283
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,585
That's still very acceptable,

284
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,174
you know, especially for stuff that's just files,

285
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,020
you know. It's, uh, so, yeah, I'm basically, I'm currently in the process of, um,

286
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,869
dumping my file server onto a, a removable hard drive

287
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,799
and then I'm going to wipe both my file servers.

288
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,479
Uh, I've already wiped my firewall, my network switch and a bunch of other stuff.

289
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:41,700
Uh, I've also moved just a,

290
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,929
uh, I'm 100% wireless network now. There will be no wire.

291
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:50,090
-- Uh,
-- you could use that new DNS mask issue to wipe your, wipe your router

292
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:51,880
probably.

293
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:52,919
Yeah.

294
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,489
Yeah,

295
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,260
that was, yeah. Yeah.

296
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,030
I mean, that's, well, and that's actually,

297
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,119
that's one of the reasons I'm getting rid of all this gear is because

298
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,530
so

299
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,159
part of it is all my stuff's mobile and so

300
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:06,479
it doesn't spend all its time at home anymore.

301
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,169
So it's going to end up in a coffee shop or whatever.

302
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:12,119
So it has to be secured against the raw internet period.

303
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,729
And number two is, yeah, I mean,

304
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,500
if I have a bunch of network here that I forget to update or whatever,

305
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,859
-- I'm just
-- making none of this stuff ever gets an update.

306
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,780
It doesn't matter if you forget or not.

307
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,500
Right.

308
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:25,700
Oh,

309
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,330
it's one of the reasons I went with a PF

310
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,479
Sense based firewall is PF Sense is a full fat distro

311
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,299
that

312
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,150
gets updates.

313
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:32,840
That's

314
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,590
the downside being is that, you know, it's,

315
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,710
um,

316
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,760
-- it's one more system to administer
-- is that the Intel box you own that, you know,

317
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,309
is going to self destruct

318
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,650
the chip set that's going

319
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,309
to die.

320
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,619
So if anybody wants to buy it cheap,

321
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,559
it's good for apparently at least another, like,

322
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,010
I think it's good for at least 18 months before the chip set might cramp out.

323
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,179
So,

324
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,179
but yeah, to put it bluntly like,

325
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,119
uh you know, I'm also finding like that,

326
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,429
that I bought a rather high end wi fi router that

327
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,299
um

328
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,049
you know, it is pretty quick. Has the

329
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,320
memo, the, the multi,

330
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,729
what is it, multi

331
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,340
input, multi

332
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:10,320
output or something?

333
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:11,250
I have no

334
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,719
-- idea.
-- Whatever the magic that makes the internet faster.

335
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,340
I'm not, I'm not hip to all this new technology.

336
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,070
But yeah, so basically I've downsized my network.

337
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,520
It'll be the ISP gear one box each and then

338
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,039
a Wi Fi router and two raspberry pies.

339
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:26,630
That's really sweet man.

340
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,299
And more to the point, you know, II I was kind of doing back of the envelope

341
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,020
and,

342
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:37,229
you know, each of these systems does take 1020 hours a year to administer and manage

343
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,070
-- uh
-- maybe,

344
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,489
and I believe that

345
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:41,760
it adds up, you know,

346
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,590
three or four of those and that's like two or three working weeks.

347
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:44,929
-- So
-- I,

348
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,940
I have a funny technology story to tell you before we move on to like real security

349
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,840
is

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,989
I have a myth TV machine

351
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,099
in my house

352
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,159
and I've had it forever

353
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,049
and

354
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:59,530
the power supply was making a terrible noise.

355
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,440
And so I assumed it was probably going to die soon

356
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,390
or light on fire and neither of those would be optimal.

357
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,570
So I, I went and bought a new power supply

358
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,880
and it was strange because I went to Best Buy to buy

359
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,280
it because I wanted it like right now in my hands.

360
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,690
And they, they have,

361
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,849
I think they had six of them

362
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,440
and I, I was amazed. I figured they'd have one

363
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,929
and no, no, they, they had a bunch.

364
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,130
Anyway, I, I bought the power supply.

365
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,669
I take up the old one and it was, it was a 400 watt power supply.

366
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,489
And I thought it is a miracle.

367
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,260
This computer is even working with this power supply inside of it because

368
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,380
there's no way I'm not drawing more than 400 watts.

369
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,500
-- And so anyway, I
-- don't have a video card.

370
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,559
Well, the problem is I have two capture cards for,

371
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,090
for,

372
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:47,119
I have two hard diss in it because one of the, in their spinning diss

373
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,640
and then I, right, like, I'm pulling way more than 400 watts

374
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:53,479
in any way I put in the new stuff and turn it on and, like,

375
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,000
amazingly the computer is working much, much nicer than it has ever worked.

376
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,479
One reason I always over spec the power supplies

377
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,429
in all my systems is so that they wouldn't,

378
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,349
like the fans would be a little quieter

379
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,929
and hopefully they would last longer because it

380
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,469
was less stressful on the power supply.

381
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,229
Right. Right. And, and that's my assumption.

382
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,000
I, I didn't think the power supply could really have,

383
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,755
have a effect on a system like this.

384
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,455
But yeah, it's like everything is working really well.

385
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:20,695
-- It must have just
-- been power supplies, commit murder suicide.

386
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,815
Well, all I can figure is it was barely hanging on.

387
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:27,215
So it had just enough power to mostly work correctly

388
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,534
and now that I've actually given it the proper amount,

389
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:30,594
everything is happy.

390
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:31,434
So yeah,

391
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,724
-- it's crazy man because
-- I know I bought one high

392
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:36,054
end ASIS motherboard and it actually had like built in

393
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,974
voltage monitoring and protection and

394
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,390
it like would war like the one the power supply it was on was dying and it,

395
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,710
it warned me that like it basically said like the power supply is trying to kill me.

396
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,969
Please do something about this.

397
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,140
Um So I, I swapped that out and yeah, I was much happier. But

398
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,099
uh well, yeah, when you, when you think about these things, I mean, again,

399
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:55,859
these are like

400
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,099
amazing,

401
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,640
you know, these power supplies are like 50 bucks.

402
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,929
They run nonstop for a couple of years

403
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,500
providing pretty clean

404
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,669
power plus or minus, you know.

405
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:09,979
Ok, there's a lesson here, there's a lesson I'm gonna,

406
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,580
I'm gonna turn on the security knob.

407
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,840
Here is

408
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,179
this is human nature, right? Is we want to buy something and use it forever

409
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,989
and like in the case of a power supply, whatever, there's to my knowledge,

410
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,049
there's no security updates for power supply.

411
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:26,950
I'm I'm sure there is one, I'm sure one exists and someone will tell me about it and,

412
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,039
and I look forward to it,

413
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,349
but the point being

414
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,229
humans love to turn something on and let it run

415
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:32,950
and

416
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,190
in the world of internet insecurity,

417
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,549
you cannot do that because as soon as you turn something on,

418
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
you've created a risk

419
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,919
and

420
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,640
the longer you let it run,

421
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,440
the greater the risk becomes until it inevitably reaches 100%.

422
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,049
Right.

423
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,919
Yeah. No, I'm just trying to remember there was that one sun

424
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,320
server where the power splice had and I quote, unanticipated thermal events.

425
00:16:58,109 --> 00:16:58,200
I

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,640
wonder how many lawyers it took to come up with that

427
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,800
and, but, yeah. No,

428
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:05,089
I

429
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,979
mean,

430
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,180
and it kind of goes to that whole,

431
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,900
um,

432
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,769
I don't know if you saw that iphone thing where they basically had like a,

433
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,499
they made a malicious iphone screen that was able to, you know,

434
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,968
basically could hijack the phone

435
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,368
electronically.

436
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,968
Right. And, well, when you think about it, right, these components, it's not like

437
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,140
most computer systems don't have, like,

438
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,020
security between the CPU and the motherboard.

439
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,579
Like, if you put in like a malicious

440
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:33,300
motherboard, like the CPU is not

441
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,459
gonna somehow protect itself from that. Right.

442
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,939
Or, or a great example being like, you know,

443
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,339
network cards with direct memory access.

444
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,260
Right. Right. Well,

445
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:46,729
that's getting better. I mean, there, there's things like Intel is SGX now and arm

446
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,099
the enclave and,

447
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:49,699
-- well, and
-- that's,

448
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,060
we're getting there.

449
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,780
Yeah.

450
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:56,500
But when you think about something like, uh, when you have a subsystem in your phone,

451
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:56,819
but

452
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,119
the thing to remember too is we, especially as old timers,

453
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,300
we think of a computer as having AC pu,

454
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,250
right. And that's really wrong nowadays

455
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,339
-- because
-- the battery has AC P

456
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,000
my mouse. Yeah.

457
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,900
Oh, yeah.

458
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,380
My laptop battery probably has more CPU power now than, like my first laptop.

459
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,189
I, I have no doubt,

460
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:18,189
you know.

461
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,459
Um, and so every single subsystem component has something that

462
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,050
kind of looks a lot like a general purpose computer because let's face it,

463
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,140
it's a lot cheaper to make some silicon like that than

464
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,650
it is to make like a really purpose built chip.

465
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:30,849
Well,

466
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,650
and did you ever see the instructions that

467
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,119
the NSA gave Glenn Greenwald for destroying his gear

468
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,510
where they, they have things like drill here, you know,

469
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,589
knock the break this with a hammer hit this

470
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,520
here and they were obviously targeting specific chips.

471
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,119
And the intention must have been that these chips either

472
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,439
could store data

473
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,719
-- or some sort of process
-- network card now have how much memory and compute power?

474
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,089
-- Oh man,
-- I know

475
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:55,920
crazy

476
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:02,640
-- video card are flat out.
-- Video cards are computers. My video card has two gigs of ra M

477
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,280
I mean, what, when did that happen?

478
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,780
Uh Yeah, and you know, same thing with hard drives, right?

479
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,719
You have hard drives, you can change the firmware on them to, you know, uh sniff data,

480
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,800
report it back, whatever.

481
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,319
Right. So,

482
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,630
yeah, anyways, but

483
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,390
I, I have no doubt that, you know, the same thing, um,

484
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,890
could happen to a lesser degree with power supplies.

485
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,430
Um, although I did have one power supply that plugged into,

486
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,510
I think it plugged into the USB or something to report its condition.

487
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,109
I seem to remember that maybe I'm wrong.

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,959
Um, but like,

489
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,209
I know I had another Asus motherboard that actually had like

490
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:38,390
a firewall built into the motherboard that you could interact with.

491
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,489
So, it was like on the chip set on the network chip set, which was kind of neat.

492
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,800
But at the same time, like, uh, how do I trust this?

493
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,790
You don't,

494
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,449
-- you can't.
-- Well, it's not that I don't trust

495
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,020
them because they're malicious. I don't trust them because they're like,

496
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,589
they write bad software like everybody else

497
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,040
like the DNS mask thing, right? Google took a poke at DNS mask

498
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,160
and they found a couple of

499
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,130
-- flaws
-- tell this story because this one

500
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,989
actually has some interesting undertones to it.

501
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,969
Well, I mean, simply put Google.

502
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:11,530
Uh Well, there's a couple of organizations now, like Google is one of them

503
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,489
that are kind of looking at that. Really?

504
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,099
There's a lot of computer code, uh

505
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,010
especially in the open source world

506
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,089
that is

507
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,209
really security critical in the sense of like a lot of stuff runs it.

508
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:29,660
And this stuff typically listens to the network and can be talked to by an attacker.

509
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:29,900
So

510
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,260
samples include

511
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,540
web servers, you know, SSL, like open SSL

512
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:38,609
and then like, yeah, all this like DNS and sort of network set up bits

513
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,760
-- and,
-- and what is DNS mask?

514
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,790
OK? It's DNS MA SQ. Right.

515
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,390
And that, for those of you who may not know, DNS, MA SQ, not MA SQ.

516
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,670
-- DNS
-- Mass. So it's basically, uh well, it's

517
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,510
called the web page.

518
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,420
Uh DNS Mass provides network infrastructure for small networks.

519
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,459
DNS DH P rotor advertisement and network booth. So to put it bluntly,

520
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,579
it's doing everything

521
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,510
-- uh needed to stand up a computer,
-- to stand up a network, right? This is

522
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,880
to stand up a computer first, but also a network, right?

523
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,699
So it can do network boot, it can discover, you know what I need to, you know,

524
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,819
where do I get my information? Where do I get my boot image, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,510
And yeah, and then stand up the network

526
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,780
and get your local area network running basically.

527
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,739
So basically every router on the planet.

528
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,699
Yeah. Well, I should say every home

529
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:29,180
router.

530
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,890
-- Right.
-- Right. Right.

531
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,030
And

532
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,199
like my home network is

533
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:40,000
pretty much existing right now because of DNS mask running on my router.

534
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:43,150
And I, I know that in fact, it's quite nice because I can,

535
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,079
there's a box in my configuration that I can give it extra options if I want to,

536
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,250
which I don't anymore.

537
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,349
But I used to because I thought it was cool.

538
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:52,170
And,

539
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,630
and that's actually one of the exact reasons I'm getting rid

540
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,089
of all this network here on my end with the exception of

541
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:00,369
my ISP routers, which I, I have to have

542
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,199
because,

543
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,680
you know, they're running the NS mask, of

544
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:03,880
course,

545
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,939
they all are.

546
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:09,089
So, anyway, that, that's irrelevant though. OK, we know what it is

547
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,109
and now

548
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,050
Google found some crazy issues with it, but here's the kicker I think

549
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,079
is

550
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:21,400
they released proof of concept exploits for all this stuff after a

551
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,670
very short window of kind of reporting and fixing the issues,

552
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,030
they provided pretty good patches.

553
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,170
That's what I've heard. But, but at the same time they were

554
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,750
patches.

555
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,880
I, I feel like

556
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:37,000
they did it the way it needs to be done.

557
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,000
I, I think even a year ago, I might have disagreed with them doing it this way.

558
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,390
But I feel like now

559
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,569
we've reached a point and we've seen things that

560
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,910
everybody figures this stuff out about the same time.

561
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,300
And so if Google figured it out, it means someone else did too.

562
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,910
And, and this actually this hit home with me

563
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:01,709
about two weeks ago

564
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:02,550
is

565
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,270
with, with, this is dealing with, with some work things.

566
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,979
We had a, someone internally found a security bug

567
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,219
and then a customer reported the same bug,

568
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:15,969
not a week later

569
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,329
and then a security person that was doing some research for us reports, the same bug

570
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,020
and today it got, got reported again and I'm thinking holy crap and we, it's,

571
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,170
it's fixed now,

572
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,380
-- but like this is crazy,
-- right? Part of it, I think my theory there is,

573
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:38,199
is the, the ecosystem is maturing and as people kind of get the skills and the,

574
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,770
the looking for things, I mean,

575
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,599
remember when cross site scripting first came out and everybody's like,

576
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:43,369
whoa knew what,

577
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,069
you know, or, or all sorts of shenanigans like, you know,

578
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,589
return oriented programming,

579
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,849
which is this like clever way of manipulating programs

580
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,160
to, you know,

581
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,170
when you have arbitrary code execution but

582
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,069
have to like work within certain constraints.

583
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,160
And

584
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,650
R

585
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:01,900
is the big one now. Well, I mean, I double free is my favorite example ever is

586
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,770
I remember for a long time you'd see a double free issue and we'd say, 00, well,

587
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,420
double free.

588
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,369
Nobody cares.

589
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,040
And then solar designer figured out how to exploit it.

590
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,560
And now all of a sudden they were thinking uh we

591
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,969
didn't fix a bunch of these because we

592
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:16,989
didn't think it mattered.

593
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,660
Segmentation flaws.

594
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,130
I think it segmentation flaws,

595
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:23,709
-- faults. I think wells
-- are

596
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,920
caused by a variety of things. You think you can stack buffer overflows by chance

597
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,209
-- or
-- no? No, I'm thinking,

598
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:30,930
yeah. No ses

599
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,609
and the Linux kernel we used to be like, yeah, whatever. That's not good.

600
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,359
Oh, you mean kernel panics? Probably.

601
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,189
But

602
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:36,510
more to the

603
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,260
point now, we basically treat them all as code execution because they probably are.

604
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,239
-- Yes,
-- exactly. If someone has enough time and intelligence, they can certainly turn

605
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,530
kernel panics into

606
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,109
an exploitable flaw because generally a kernel panic

607
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,189
is caused because something brought something somewhere it shouldn't

608
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:54,890
in memory.

609
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,510
And I

610
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,880
part of the problem with the DNS mask is it's not that they found one flaw

611
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,250
they found, well, seven flaws. Uh, what was it? Uh, three of them in DH CP,

612
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,260
uh, and four of them in DNS.

613
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,089
Three R ce s. Right.

614
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah. Well, and the problem is they can also be like

615
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,050
they can be used to help each other. Right.

616
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,349
So there's one flaw here in an information leak that can help you then bypass,

617
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,790
you know, address stack.

618
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:18,800
That's

619
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,140
funny too because info

620
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,949
leaks. I remember we didn't care about them

621
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,849
but now that a SLR is a thing,

622
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:27,989
info leaks are potentially more valuable than some remote code execution flaws.

623
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,060
Yeah.

624
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,709
So I mean that's, you know, that's the thing is,

625
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:35,829
you know, if you found just one of these flaws, it would be like, yeah, OK, whatever,

626
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,119
it's bad, we should fix it.

627
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,630
But you know, when you find seven flaws that

628
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,859
are interrelated and can be used to help each other to get

629
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,390
essentially to go from zero to full remote code execution,

630
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:48,339
that's a problem.

631
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,349
And I mean,

632
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,199
Google also uh I don't know if you read

633
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,229
the fine print but they talked about how they also

634
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,390
um

635
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:59,069
release some patches to help make it uh sandbox a bit better with the

636
00:25:59,530 --> 00:25:59,810
the

637
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,910
stuff. Yeah,

638
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,949
it would be, I forget, I forget the particular set

639
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,930
rule. But yes,

640
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,530
you're gonna, they're gonna use Setcom

641
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:07,849
and, and let's face it man.

642
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,579
It doesn't mean Google could spend a million hours fuzzing

643
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,310
this thing to death and I could come around tomorrow

644
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,430
and, and find something they missed.

645
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,229
And so sandbox is the key.

646
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,589
Yeah, I was having a conversation with somebody and I basically said, you know,

647
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:26,160
if I fixed a million remote code execution flaws in the Linux kernel,

648
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,589
would you bet your life that there's no more?

649
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,329
What about a billion or a trillion? No,

650
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,349
exactly. Not just that

651
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,030
there, how many, how many commits get added per day to the Linux kernel

652
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:40,030
and, and some percentage of those are security flaws, right?

653
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,790
Yep.

654
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:41,680
And, and

655
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:42,300
I

656
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,010
guarantee you that if we had a graph,

657
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,219
the number of security issues going into the Linux

658
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,900
kernel versus number of security issues getting fixed,

659
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,829
they are,

660
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,810
they don't line up very well.

661
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,319
But um

662
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,569
no, it's, I mean, it's

663
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,800
DNS mask is especially problematic because it's one

664
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,420
of those things kind of like um well,

665
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,199
busy box is another good example.

666
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:07,599
Uh Well, maybe not so much now because you know, ra M is cheap but

667
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,650
um

668
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:11,949
DNS mask is, yeah, it's widely used on like everything,

669
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:15,689
especially a big pile of stuff that will never get updates.

670
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,089
-- That's it.
-- It'll never get an update.

671
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,010
And

672
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,250
man, this is like, welcome to the future. I guess

673
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,770
this is just the way everything is going to be. I fear.

674
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,699
Well, like I said, the, the,

675
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:34,819
the two ways to deal with this are either you buy expensive gear

676
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:39,060
that is either supported like say apple or has a subscription model,

677
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,479
meaning it's supported

678
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,920
or,

679
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,880
uh, you get rid of it if possible, I guess. II, I don't know.

680
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,229
Like that's, I'll be honest.

681
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,890
Like that's why I have barely any iot stuff in my house because

682
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,119
it could be the most awesome IOT device ever.

683
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,310
But three or four years from now, I can guarantee you,

684
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm not gonna get any software updates.

685
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:01,280
Yes,

686
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,739
I, I think you're half right.

687
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,060
I, I think

688
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:09,689
there, there is certain gear you can buy that's better than others.

689
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,010
But I think for the most part, a lot of it is terrible.

690
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:13,569
What do I find

691
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,199
out though?

692
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,619
Because by definition,

693
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,760
the problem doesn't manifest until two years from now when the manufacturers,

694
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,430
like, oh, yeah, we're not making a lot of money off this thing.

695
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:22,020
Let's stop shipping updates. Right.

696
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,900
Right. Right.

697
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,140
And it, it, it's even more than that though is,

698
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,369
I guarantee there are devices in existence

699
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:35,010
that were created and contain DNS mask and nobody knows it's there.

700
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,560
Well, there was that article recently about Equifax and their, um,

701
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,000
that they straight up could not patch

702
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,109
all their strut stuff.

703
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,630
That's what I heard. And II, I believe that

704
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,689
I'm familiar with legacy systems. I know how this stuff works.

705
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:53,630
I'm not saying it's right

706
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,280
-- that I'm familiar with it.
-- Well, it's how the world is.

707
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,670
It's, it's tough, you know,

708
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,510
if you have to make a decision between kind

709
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,530
of shutting down the business and running vulnerable software.

710
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah. Guess what's going to win.

711
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,260
You know, the security guy is not going to shut down the business

712
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,680
and that's the scene, that's what really tears me about.

713
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,420
The whole infrastructure thing is,

714
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,550
you know, I don't,

715
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,680
I don't really want my power company to take down everything weekly for patches,

716
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,859
but, you know, I also don't want some,

717
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,209
like Russian cyberattack taking down my power grid.

718
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,319
So, you know, what do we do?

719
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:26,819
We? Yeah, I mean, that's, that's actually a really good example.

720
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,869
And that's a great thought experiment because

721
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,150
power is something that's critical for, for nearly everybody and, and

722
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,300
I can survive without electricity for a while, but I, I lost power for,

723
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,599
I think eight hours.

724
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,209
Um I don't know, this was,

725
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:45,040
I don't remember, it was sometime in the spring

726
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,489
and it, it sucked.

727
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,930
-- I'm not even going to pretend that I did
-- not

728
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,400
like if you or your local area loses power. That's one thing.

729
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,180
But like if your entire country loses power like Puerto Rico

730
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:00,339
-- and that
-- you have this incredibly devastating for its own reasons.

731
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,550
But, but no, no, let's not

732
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,599
restarting everything, right? Like I know for a fact

733
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,660
because I've worked with people and they're like, well,

734
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,050
this is a cold start plant which literally means you can turn everything off,

735
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,939
unplug it from the grid and start it.

736
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,780
And there's a lot of plants that are not cold stars.

737
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:15,550
A lot of

738
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,619
-- nuclear reactors are not cold star,
-- no,

739
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:17,969
a

740
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:22,739
lot of nuclear reactors. If you shut them down, you will never turn them back on ever.

741
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:26,540
Like they, they just, things will break and it will be unfixable.

742
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,650
In fact, I, when I was in college I worked in a paper mill in the summers

743
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,300
and I remember

744
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,939
we, we had to shut the mill down because in the summer the,

745
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:39,439
the mill pays less money for electricity.

746
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:41,780
And if demand goes too high, they tell the mill, you know,

747
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,329
you have to shut down in an hour.

748
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,579
And that was nontrivial,

749
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,380
but more importantly is it took 24 hours to turn it back on

750
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,890
once it was time to do that. And that's crazy.

751
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,500
I mean, yeah, it's not like my home computer where, oh, the power is back.

752
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,170
Let's go turn everything back on.

753
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,770
It's crazy. But anyway, anyway, so let's think about this though.

754
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,689
Let's say the power company has to take gear

755
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,660
offline every day to do a security update.

756
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:12,410
Can you imagine what people would do?

757
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,920
You? It'd be like living in India

758
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,400
in a tier two city

759
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:17,979
straight up.

760
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,890
And that's part of it. If, if these problems happen often enough,

761
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,569
then people get used to them and deal with them.

762
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,130
But it's, it's when the problem happens infrequently

763
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,959
that we don't really deal with it all that. Well, so hurricanes are a great example.

764
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:32,050
Right? They, they happen,

765
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,510
you know, frequently enough to be a problem.

766
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,219
-- But like, typically a place only gets clobbered every five or 10 or 20 years.
-- Ok.

767
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,650
No, no, you,

768
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,849
you might be on to something here though is because if we look at breaches,

769
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,199
breaches have historically been, we'll say relatively rare events.

770
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,930
But I think we're reaching a point now where this is just normal.

771
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
I mean, everyone is getting hacked all the time.

772
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,199
If you do, you read Brian Krebs website at all.

773
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:58,199
The thing is just horrifying.

774
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:03,079
I mean, I, I get in my RSS feed and every time it pops up, I just think, oh, what now?

775
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,400
And, and yeah, like every time

776
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,839
it's some new company got hacked

777
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:15,180
and it's just like it's never going to end. Everything being hacked is normal now.

778
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:15,719
Right?

779
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,719
And so this is where, what you just said is, is borderline terrifying to me is

780
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,920
we, we're, we're going to learn to adapt to this

781
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,000
and it's just going to be the way it is.

782
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,510
Let's face it.

783
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,189
Everybody's personal information

784
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,030
has been or shortly will be compromised.

785
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,939
It's all been

786
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:36,290
after

787
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,599
Equifax. It's all compromised.

788
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,959
Uh You know, it's like the um

789
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,119
oh, it's happened so long ago, like last year,

790
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,130
but I can't remember the name, the, the big government hack where they put like,

791
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,780
-- what was it, a Chinese subcontractor in charge of the
-- database, the

792
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,760
breach,

793
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:52,040
the OPM breach,

794
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,170
that was the office of personnel management where it was like, that was

795
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,390
really sensitive information. Like it's not just personal information

796
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,729
but like all the stuff around your security clearance.

797
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:05,189
So like interviews about your finances, your like sex life, your friends,

798
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,390
your family, like

799
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,630
lots of juicy stuff for black males.

800
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,420
And yeah, go ahead. The whole thing. Whoops.

801
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,729
And you know, and uh, well, a perfect example of this is, I mean,

802
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,310
that's how I'm architecting my home network.

803
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,650
I'm architecting my home network now with the

804
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,729
idea that everything here will get owned.

805
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,500
So I'm getting rid of everything I can

806
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,270
and

807
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,729
you know, all my end user devices, ipads, laptops,

808
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,689
whatever are gonna be basically

809
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,369
run as if they were straight up on the internet.

810
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,020
Yeah, I mean, I, you know, you're not wrong

811
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,319
-- and
-- same thing with the distributed weakness filing, you know, I, I've

812
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:43,920
uh the new CV E form to make it really clear

813
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,949
to people that this is not meant for embargoed CV.

814
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,810
You know, it's like this will go to this spreadsheet and this spreadsheet is public.

815
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:49,869
You

816
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,050
know,

817
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,229
anybody can comment on it. I mean,

818
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,939
well, we had this discussion actually today on the CV automation board where

819
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,300
uh where

820
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,199
the G pilot project has been successful. And so now

821
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:02,800
we're going to um

822
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:08,070
proposed to the board. Uh and I can't imagine why it would be rejected,

823
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,510
but we're gonna move from like Miter's G

824
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,750
server to github,

825
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:16,780
-- which I can't wait for. It's gonna make my life so much easier,
-- everybody's life.

826
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:18,188
Uh But anyways.

827
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,500
And, you know, because historically, one of the things that's happened is some CV,

828
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,070
numbering authorities will occasionally, uh upload stuff and be like, oops,

829
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,958
we didn't mean to do that.

830
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,860
Uh It's too early, it shouldn't be public yet.

831
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,168
And, you know,

832
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,750
Miter has a sort of a quasi manual publishing cycle so they can catch it, you know,

833
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,070
given a little bit of warning.

834
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,250
Cool. Um, but obviously with automation

835
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,510
that, that goes away, right?

836
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,290
Like when you get push and that gets accepted by the C I system and published,

837
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,620
you know, 17.3 seconds later.

838
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,409
Uh Yeah, too bad.

839
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:53,850
-- But, but, you know, that's not an excuse, man, I mean, oh, no,
-- no, exactly.

840
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,688
And, and the general consensus was like, you know, well, first of all, you're,

841
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,320
you're publishing to a github.com A URL.

842
00:34:59,330 --> 00:34:59,889
So like

843
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,649
you, you kind of should have the expectation, this is public,

844
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,040
you know,

845
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,879
um

846
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,590
and that more to the point, you know, these companies just have to

847
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,080
grow up and deal with this. Uh DNS Mass is a great example.

848
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,520
We actually almost had a leak.

849
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,689
Um One vendor leaked the CV numbers and titles accidentally.

850
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:25,040
Uh It didn't and it got shut down uh fast enough that it wasn't in Google or anything.

851
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,560
Um But it was noticed because some of these vendors monitor each other for, you know,

852
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,979
CV, mentions and stuff because, you know, we all kind of run the same software

853
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,239
and you know, so leaks do happen.

854
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,530
Uh Typically in the open source world, I would say ballpark about maybe twice a year.

855
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,250
Uh We have an embargoed issue where there's like a, usually a,

856
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,750
like a sort of a small leak that's not very bad or public enough to be public.

857
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,719
Um Like, for example, one leak was to a

858
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,949
private mailing list that was not publicly archived

859
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,979
anywhere and it was trusted people anyway.

860
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,360
But the fear was, you know, we don't, once you send out an email,

861
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,429
who knows where it went?

862
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,280
Nobody.

863
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:01,939
Um

864
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,340
But yeah, and that's part of this is that, you know, especially with the miter,

865
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,889
the true CV database is like, yeah, once you,

866
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,959
once you put something in there, like you, you, I mean,

867
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,489
it's supposed to be a public database that's kind of the whole point.

868
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,709
Well,

869
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,129
and so here's the thing I think about a lot too is I've

870
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:20,800
been thinking about this a lot lately for a variety of reasons,

871
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,169
but

872
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,969
everything is full of open source.

873
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,899
It's, it's literally everywhere.

874
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:28,850
And so I think that the days of pretending you can hide

875
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,659
is now on the open source foundation. Is that the name of it?

876
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,850
-- Yeah,
-- they're one of the largest contributors to open source.

877
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,929
They might even be the largest now,

878
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,909
I mean,

879
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,590
which is, which

880
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,189
my brain explodes because so actually I'm, I'm giving an IRC chat with uh

881
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:48,560
uh the D GP L

882
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:53,459
tomorrow. I think it is which whatever day this comes out it'll be in the past. But,

883
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,449
but the point is,

884
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,729
uh and this is one of the things I, I was, I was just, you know,

885
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:00,560
writing some historical notes as part of my intro and, and I,

886
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,250
I got to some Microsoft things and I thought,

887
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:04,699
I remember

888
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:08,229
when these guys were like the worst enemy ever

889
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,800
and not just that they were actively hostile,

890
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,770
the Halloween memos just Google the Halloween

891
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,320
memo,

892
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:13,820
Microsoft

893
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,510
-- and
-- now they're, they're super friendly to open source.

894
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:17,860
And

895
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,090
Microsoft has joined the open source initiative as a premium sponsor

896
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,300
-- that was six days ago, like
-- good for them.

897
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,129
-- And the world has changed open
-- source,

898
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,129
open source. Totally one, which is awesome.

899
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:31,689
It's,

900
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:36,540
yeah, I love it there. It, it's so crazy and, and, but anyway, the point is though

901
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,439
that now that everyone's involved and, and it's spread far and wide.

902
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:42,429
I,

903
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:45,229
I don't think you can make arguments like I remember

904
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,370
the good old days when we could embargo issues for months

905
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,090
with, with the Linux distribution,

906
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,780
we would embargo everything like it didn't matter how big or small it was.

907
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,310
We embargoed it because we could,

908
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,139
and part

909
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,330
-- of it was, we also didn't have nearly as many issues to deal with.
-- It was less issues.

910
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,949
There was much less usage.

911
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,489
So you just weren't the target you are today and

912
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,340
it was like four groups having to work together,

913
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,649
right?

914
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,570
It's nothing like today

915
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,090
where the concept of embargo anything I think is, is looney.

916
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,919
And the right answer is you just have to be able to move quickly

917
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,770
because that's the

918
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,149
only

919
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,080
-- to be
-- fair. There are sometimes when we really do need embargo.

920
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,310
A great one being the call stack

921
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:26,659
stuff back in May and June.

922
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,139
And, and that was a really important embargo because quite frankly,

923
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:32,320
the scope of the problem wasn't understood.

924
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,669
And as it turns out like, oh, we'll just

925
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,820
increase the stack card pages, you know, it turns out no,

926
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,879
that absolutely will not work like it will be trivial to bypass

927
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,320
and it required changes to the kernel to G lipsy and to GCC.

928
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,290
And I mean, we're talking changes to the memory management in

929
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:48,860
Gypsy,

930
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:55,080
which is like that is some scary, scary stuff to be touching because if you muck it up,

931
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,239
you just broke the world.

932
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:59,399
So here's, here's what I wonder about that though is

933
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,219
stack

934
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,030
guard for as bad as it supposedly was.

935
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:07,449
Has anything come of it? I haven't seen any security.

936
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:14,330
-- Everybody patched it real fast. Uh And
-- is that why? No, I don't believe you because

937
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,020
uh dirty cow

938
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,530
is being exploited on android devices. I just saw a new story the other day where

939
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,110
-- there's all these old unpatched
-- device

940
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:22,510
is

941
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,020
not

942
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,449
-- easy to exploit it.
-- It

943
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,770
isn't. And, and right, and so I get that,

944
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,330
but anyway, it makes me wonder that

945
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,330
there.

946
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,689
I'm not going to say we shouldn't have embargoes, but I feel like we're still

947
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,649
too far over the line.

948
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Well, I would say stack

949
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:42,719
art is a good example of one of the few times,

950
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:45,270
probably about 10 times a year that we should embargo stuff.

951
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:49,050
And, and the thing to remember too is that embargo was like, 4.5 weeks long.

952
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:50,719
Like, it was not a

953
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:52,840
long embargo by

954
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,479
contemporary standards.

955
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,639
That's the thing to remember too is like, now when we talk about a long embargo,

956
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:59,310
we're talking like three or four weeks,

957
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,159
you know, it's a more sort of like the standard quick embargo being like 1 to 2 weeks.

958
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:05,850
Uh The other thing to remember too is it's,

959
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,290
uh especially with holidays.

960
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,570
It's, I, I, you know, especially certain times of year,

961
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,459
like around Christmas and certain bits of summer, especially in the US.

962
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,790
Like, well, right now China has their national,

963
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:16,300
uh

964
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:16,870
they have their,

965
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:20,350
what is it National Day of something which actually as it turns out is a week off.

966
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,530
You know, so,

967
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:23,459
you know,

968
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,699
uh like right now it is kind of not like this is

969
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:29,060
not a great week for DNS mask because everybody in China is

970
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:32,729
doing whatever they do during the holidays in China,

971
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,820
right? Um

972
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,000
You know,

973
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,419
and, and so that's, I mean, so the one in two week embargoes do make a bit of sense,

974
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:43,139
especially when you have like a long weekend involved or

975
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,189
Christmas and New Year's, you know, that kind of stuff. Um,

976
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,979
plus just giving people a little bit of time to deal

977
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,550
with it and sort of in a calm manner versus,

978
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,020
like,

979
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:51,899
you know,

980
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,449
I have the register online one and the, you know, the Wall Street Journal online too,

981
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:56,500
asking for comment.

982
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,379
Right. Right.

983
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,300
Um, you know, because when people are time constrained and panicking,

984
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,699
they tend to make mistakes and,

985
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,110
you know, that totally, if we'd had to compress the stack,

986
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:06,570
gu

987
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,020
embargo there not mistakes would have been made, but we would have

988
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:17,139
not had the time to, you know, find the things that we found and do it properly

989
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,260
all at once rather than. Well, a great example being shell shocked where that's

990
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,020
exactly

991
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,060
dribbled out and we ended up with like, I think a total of,

992
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,620
-- I want to say four CV
-- S it was really bad

993
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,830
-- and
-- yeah, it was just this kind of constant. Like, wait, we didn't, we just fix that.

994
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,340
No, we fixed it. OK. I know we fixed this twice.

995
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,979
Why are you talking to me about it again?

996
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,300
We just fixed it twice.

997
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,750
Oh, there's a third one.

998
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,540
-- You know, and it just got very messy and
-- that was a monkey show. I remember that.

999
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,379
Yes.

1000
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,800
Oh, man, I'm, I'm glad that one's gone.

1001
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:52,169
So I would say like, like I said, a few times a year, we have very

1002
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,050
difficult problems and,

1003
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,260
and typically it's like either a code

1004
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,010
that's really old and really ubiquitous like bash

1005
00:41:59,189 --> 00:42:03,060
or it's the kernel and that's not to pick on the kernel.

1006
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,649
But the kernel is just a very complicated piece of software.

1007
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,090
And it's again, very ubiquitous because it's the kernel

1008
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,419
and DNA mask is a great example of like, well,

1009
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,409
we found some really bad flaws but the patches are very straightforward.

1010
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,320
Right.

1011
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,159
Right. Right. Generally speaking. Right. This is not rocket science. This is not,

1012
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,280
oh let's change how memory allocation works on all the systems.

1013
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,770
Well, it's going to be rocket science for some people because

1014
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,179
there's a lot of devices that will never see these updates.

1015
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:32,570
And I bet there are developers working on some of these devices that,

1016
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,290
that legitimately don't know what to do

1017
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:37,080
because they've never had to go through this.

1018
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,840
It's not that they don't know what to do.

1019
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,590
What they need to do is simple, rebate to the current version

1020
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,479
-- and then run your QE Suite and make sure your
-- software

1021
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:44,739
works.

1022
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,199
If that's possible, that would be optimal. Yes.

1023
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,050
And,

1024
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,060
but the problem is that's probably not possible because why would you spend money on

1025
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,600
that when you can also have that developer writing new software for a new device?

1026
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,360
Maybe, I mean, maybe it's,

1027
00:42:58,899 --> 00:43:02,790
yeah, this is, this is tough stuff, man. I don't think there's good answers.

1028
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,110
It's fundamentally the economics, right? Like

1029
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,610
uh all in theory, all software should be able to, you know,

1030
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,169
have whatever it depends on be updated

1031
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:17,219
which will definitely break things because behaviors change or, you know,

1032
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:19,520
assumptions change or, or we fix.

1033
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,449
Uh, I mean, how many,

1034
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:23,620
there's been a number of security flaws that have been fixed that changed, you know,

1035
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:24,969
-- default behavior
-- or

1036
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:25,620
sometimes,

1037
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:28,090
and, you know,

1038
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:29,169
um,

1039
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,889
the problem though is a lot of people don't have the source code for their software.

1040
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:36,189
They bought a commercial off the shelf application from a company that may

1041
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,719
or may not support it or may or may not even exist anymore.

1042
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,239
Yeah.

1043
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:40,739
Yeah.

1044
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,780
Um,

1045
00:43:42,899 --> 00:43:46,879
and you know that again, going back, that's why I won't buy IOT stuff for my house is I,

1046
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:47,439
you know,

1047
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:52,979
if I could somehow legally be guaranteed like three years of support and updates.

1048
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:53,520
Sure.

1049
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,889
You know, that's like with the iphone, a great example is generally speaking,

1050
00:43:56,899 --> 00:43:57,639
I'll get for sure.

1051
00:43:57,649 --> 00:44:01,449
Three years, I've now got some ipads that are old enough that they will not get ios

1052
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,360
-- 11,
-- whatever, man.

1053
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,600
You said you just re architected your whole network for beyond Corp.

1054
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,439
You shouldn't care if you put malicious IOT devices on your network now. Right.

1055
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,739
Well, but those malicious IOT devices, for example, are cameras in my house.

1056
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,280
Well, don't run cameras. I mean, that's just foolish. Right.

1057
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,419
But I'm saying, you know, you can have

1058
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:17,719
a

1059
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:18,989
lock me

1060
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,600
out because they stopped working.

1061
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:21,620
Right.

1062
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,540
Right. Wasn't it?

1063
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,860
I just,

1064
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:27,100
I read an article the other day that it was it a light bulb that when you disabled Wi Fi,

1065
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,959
it didn't actually disable anything.

1066
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,750
Kept talking.

1067
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,689
I'm not at all.

1068
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,770
-- I know I'm just flat out. Not surprising.
-- It's a comedy of errors. And so,

1069
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:39,629
and I guess here's the thing I always think of and this is,

1070
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,830
we'll kind of head it, we'll take it home on this message.

1071
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,409
But this is, this is crazy talk is,

1072
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,770
I feel like we're never going to fix the software,

1073
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,909
right? It's never going to happen. Even if the government says you have to,

1074
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:55,530
you have to make it up update.

1075
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:58,949
Well, it, it, it's partially a technical problem. I think

1076
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:03,050
the technical problem is the symptom of the underlying economic problem.

1077
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,689
It's not just an economic problem though. I'm saying that the point is

1078
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:14,659
how do we build a device that let's say there is a, a broken DNS mask library on it

1079
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:20,159
and, and how do we do things in such a way that nobody cares? And it doesn't matter,

1080
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:22,790
right? I think

1081
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,750
uh well, a big part of that is sand boxing

1082
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:26,600
to

1083
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,340
minimize.

1084
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,280
Maybe.

1085
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:29,469
And,

1086
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,979
and the reason I say maybe is I feel like sandboxes

1087
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:37,030
are the best idea we had using the tools we have.

1088
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,939
And I feel like we're, we're cave people banging rocks together.

1089
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,830
And someone realized, you know, if you, if you tie a rock to a stick,

1090
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,989
you can bang harder.

1091
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,360
And in reality, it's like still a rock dude. It's just

1092
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,770
my my truly ugly, honest answer.

1093
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,879
I think the future is kind of because this has come up on the CV board with, you know,

1094
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:55,959
CV S for software.

1095
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:57,429
What about CV S for services?

1096
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,300
I think the truly ugly answer is companies will not so much

1097
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,070
sell you a device as sell you a thing that does something

1098
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,979
and it does that thing, but like you basically don't touch it,

1099
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:11,909
it automatically updates the company configures it, whatever

1100
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,379
and those things already exist.

1101
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:16,439
And essentially you have a contract with them that says

1102
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,040
this thing will do this function for five years.

1103
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,120
You will pay X

1104
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:20,649
and,

1105
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:21,780
you know,

1106
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,810
they're basically responsible for making sure it functions

1107
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,629
-- and that it's reasonably secure and
-- that's it.

1108
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:29,100
You know, I'm gonna buy light bulbs

1109
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,229
with that

1110
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,790
light bulbs cost a dollar.

1111
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:32,389
Right?

1112
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:32,770
Or they

1113
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:33,139
don't.

1114
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:35,010
And that's part of the problem. Right? Is exactly.

1115
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,340
People won't want to buy that at the low end.

1116
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:38,409
Um,

1117
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:43,350
when can I buy my Apple light bulbs? Right. They'll cost $1000 and, and

1118
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,629
have a funny plug that I have to buy a special lamp from Appleton.

1119
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah.

1120
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,010
So I think the next best thing is you just buy cheap crap.

1121
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,020
That was the

1122
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,590
thing

1123
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:52,909
that

1124
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,409
cheap crap is winning today. And,

1125
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,570
and

1126
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,689
it might be the way it is.

1127
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:05,659
We might have a world like a dystopian universe filled with just cheap garbage that

1128
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,679
everything is part of a botnet and everything

1129
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:09,929
is attacking everything else and it just,

1130
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:11,969
it sounds like a Neil Stevenson novel.

1131
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:12,729
But

1132
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,189
that might be the way it is. I don't get me wrong.

1133
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,729
Like, the, the optimist in me hopes it doesn't.

1134
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,850
But the realist says

1135
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,949
that's what it's looking like today. If, if, if I was a betting man,

1136
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,679
that's where I'd probably put

1137
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:26,959
my

1138
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:27,229
money.

1139
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:29,659
Uh, what's this guy's name?

1140
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:32,389
I forget this guy's name, but he's a machinist has a youtube channel,

1141
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,030
you know, and he's constantly, like, dissing cheap tools and cheap parts.

1142
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,510
But the reality is, you know, like he says,

1143
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,610
like these things win because they're really cheap.

1144
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,949
Like

1145
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,300
he did a review of this, like, really crappy digital caliper.

1146
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,739
But it cost $10.

1147
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,820
Actually, he was like, I'm going to keep coming back to that point.

1148
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,439
I was, I complain about this,

1149
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,000
but it cost $10.

1150
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,580
No, I know exactly what you mean. I, I buy a lot of tools, a lot of tools.

1151
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,800
Every time I do a project of nearly any sort.

1152
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,879
I, it's an excuse to buy a new tool.

1153
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:04,719
And I've reached a point where I'm buying very silly tools now that like,

1154
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:05,709
no human needs.

1155
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:07,399
But that's cool because that's fun stuff.

1156
00:48:08,129 --> 00:48:11,909
And there is a place in the US called Harbor Freight

1157
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:12,649
that sells,

1158
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,070
I will never go there. I went there one time

1159
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,870
and I bought saw blades for a hacksaw

1160
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,070
and I bought this box of probably 50 saw blades and I can literally,

1161
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,560
I can use the blade one time and I have to throw it away because it's completely

1162
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:29,439
in

1163
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,800
the show

1164
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:35,090
notes to this guy because he's, he's awesome and he uses old timey swear language.

1165
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:36,780
-- It's the
-- best,

1166
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:37,590
darn

1167
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:38,540
the best

1168
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:42,489
this guy. Arduino Vers versus evil.

1169
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:47,189
I, I'm interested now, now I have to go watch this. That's, that's exciting.

1170
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,370
It's, uh, it's, it's quite lovely.

1171
00:48:49,629 --> 00:48:50,290
Um,

1172
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,010
yeah. No, I agree. And I, I don't know what the future will bring.

1173
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,010
I, I could because for example, cars, cars were terrible, terrible death traps.

1174
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,570
And now quite honestly,

1175
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,810
like they're pretty good at not killing you if you crash them.

1176
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,459
Yes.

1177
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:06,340
And actually I, I submitted to talk to Rs A about this and if they don't accept it,

1178
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,850
I might just kind of put together a series of blog posts where I did some research on

1179
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:12,969
various industries

1180
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,010
uh specifically around safety

1181
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:18,449
where like mining and automobiles and, and

1182
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,330
environmental and

1183
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,830
like industrial things and all this. And

1184
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,010
it,

1185
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:25,590
so here's the thing

1186
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,949
is these industries

1187
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,070
basically got to the point where a river literally lit on fire,

1188
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,850
which is about the worst thing you can imagine before people cared.

1189
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:36,090
And

1190
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,229
if the if the world of iot and computers, like if, if a river never lights on fire,

1191
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,439
it never gets better.

1192
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,149
Just period. Right? That is the story.

1193
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,560
-- That's crazy to think
-- the beauty there is not only did the river catch fire.

1194
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,850
-- But it was the railroad company complaining
-- there

1195
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,709
were like 10 rivers caught on fire.

1196
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:55,149
All right.

1197
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,550
Pick one.

1198
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,770
But the point is

1199
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,570
the river catching on fire means something has gone so horribly wrong

1200
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:07,199
that it, it basically can't go any more wrong than it's gone. Right

1201
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,459
and

1202
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:07,800
say

1203
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:08,270
that. But,

1204
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,250
ok, it's reached the point.

1205
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,639
People have to pay attention because now all of a sudden, like,

1206
00:50:13,649 --> 00:50:16,409
-- look ma the rivers on fire and they think,
-- well,

1207
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:18,489
I think that might actually help with the information security

1208
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,389
now, like,

1209
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,760
like an information breach of personal information.

1210
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,879
It's kind of abstract and the majority of people honestly,

1211
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:24,969
even if they're affected,

1212
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:26,330
they're not really affected.

1213
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,750
I mean, it's not until somebody uses that information to like their

1214
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:29,379
life.

1215
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,340
I hate to say this,

1216
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,830
but I think we need like more than 100 people to

1217
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,840
-- die as a result of a cyber attack before anyone
-- will.

1218
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,530
Or we need like all the light bulbs in New York City to turn off at the same time

1219
00:50:41,669 --> 00:50:43,239
or like, start blinking out Morris.

1220
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,830
That would be really cool just for a different reason. But yes. Yes,

1221
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:52,550
exactly. And you know, even then I bet, even if a bad guy

1222
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:55,870
literally took over every light bulb in the city and made them blink,

1223
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,939
I bet that wouldn't be enough.

1224
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:00,429
Probably not.

1225
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,750
And I, I can think of nothing better to end the podcast on

1226
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,469
that happy thought.

1227
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,719
Uh So what do you think Kurt, is it ever gonna get better?

1228
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,729
Um,

1229
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,280
I don't think it necessarily will get better, but I think it might get less worse.

1230
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,479
That's perfect.

1231
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:23,750
That's

1232
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:24,090
worse.

1233
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,530
Is ok. I can live with less worse.

1234
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:27,800
I, I love it.

1235
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,330
