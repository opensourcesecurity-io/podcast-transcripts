Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,279
Kurt Siefried and my partner in totally not thought crime.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:11,989
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,510
what is totally not thought crime? Is that regular crime or is it not crime?

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,069
It's not, not thought crime,

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,510
-- not,
-- not thought crime.

6
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,989
Look, we can't say anything bad about Google. So we can't think about Google.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,149
We can't say anything bad about Google because if you know,

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,500
both of us lose our Google accounts, we are screwed.

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,670
Uh

10
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,389
Yeah, that's true.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,099
-- Why, why do we care about this?
-- Well, so in, in past

12
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,790
I actually moved to Google because they supported IMAP properly.

13
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:44,099
And so I moved my email there because I knew I could move it back out if I didn't like it.

14
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,330
And email is, you know, it's relatively portable, right?

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,659
Getting a copy of all your email and your email inboxes, you just, you, you know,

16
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,400
you use IMAP sync or something to get it all.

17
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,479
But the problem is now I use a lot of single sign on with my Google account.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,959
-- Yep. That's right.
-- And that's not portable.

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,560
Uh No, no, it is not.

20
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,440
So today for those of you who haven't figured it out from Kurtz will say

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,919
awesome description.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,389
We want to talk about single sign on

23
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:12,419
because it's been something that's been on the minds of

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,440
Kurt and I for a couple of weeks for,

25
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,699
for nothing particularly important or interesting.

26
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,650
It's just, it's a good topic and I think we should discuss it.

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,319
And more importantly, we want to focus on single sign on

28
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:30,669
as provided by major companies like Google or say Twitter, linkedin, Facebook.

29
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,949
We're not talking about like corporate enterprise, single sign on or for example,

30
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,120
the CS A where we run an authentication back in.

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,510
So that,

32
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,230
you know, when you access CS A stuff,

33
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,760
you have a single account with us to access multiple services.

34
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,169
I think the corporate example is good though because it, it's something, it's,

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,480
it's something you can understand and I would explain it as

36
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:52,300
how many of us have had services we signed up for with

37
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,779
our work emails and then you switch jobs and then it's like,

38
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,389
oh crap,

39
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:00,720
I can't access this anymore because I don't have access to that email.

40
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:01,639
Yes.

41
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,720
And that's one reason we're so

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,029
encouraging people to put that backup email

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,569
address and because of exactly this right,

44
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,508
people change,

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,270
we witness about it's about 1 to 2% a year

46
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:14,059
of the email addresses we have in our system just

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,470
die mostly due to people switching jobs or leaving that company,

48
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,029
right?

49
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:19,619
You know,

50
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,699
and then for them to get back into their account

51
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,910
is if they didn't set up that backup email address.

52
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:24,440
Oh,

53
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,789
it's a nightmare because, like, how do you prove you're, you

54
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,089
and you're the CS A?

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,070
If you try to do this somewhere, like Google,

56
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,100
there's, there's nothing you can do.

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,570
Unless you literally know someone who works at Google, you can ping and say, like,

58
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,929
please take pity on me.

59
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,509
Even if you know somebody who works with Google, you, you, it's no good

60
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,729
the, the, the latest hacker news threads.

61
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,369
Yeah, that could be.

62
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:47,630
Yeah.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,169
-- No, it's that, that ship has sailed. So
-- there you have it. I mean,

64
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,570
ok, so let's,

65
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,039
let's set this all out that way before we go

66
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,779
off on whatever ridiculous tangent we end up on.

67
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,449
So fundamentally

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,100
when we, we, we love sso and obviously if you listen to the show,

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,889
Kurt and I have talked about the awesomeness of single sign on for, for many,

70
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:07,490
many years now.

71
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,475
But I think one of the, the hidden dangers in it

72
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:14,585
is let's say I log into a lot of services with Google, which I do.

73
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:18,225
And let's say my Google account gets shut down for

74
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,436
whatever reason. Right. There's millions of reasons this can happen.

75
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:21,815
Well,

76
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,326
and they won't even tell you the reason in some

77
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,475
cases as to why they shut it down because Right.

78
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,425
Right. And, and in fairness they,

79
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:28,796
this is one of those catch 20

80
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:29,492
where

81
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,901
Google deals with abuse at such a

82
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,492
volume that they actually can't tell people specifically

83
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,121
why or how they caught them because then

84
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,052
the abusers will just change their patterns,

85
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:39,962
do different spam, whatever, whatever, right.

86
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,141
But that means that those,

87
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:44,082
those innocent bystanders that get caught caught up in this,

88
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,171
you know, they're caught in a calf

89
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:49,222
casque nightmare of what did I do wrong? Well, we won't tell you what you did wrong.

90
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:50,192
So the point is

91
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:55,022
you can lose access to your account via Google or Amazon or Apple or whatever.

92
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,259
And now you can't log into any services that you

93
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,960
had tied to that account using their single sign on.

94
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,470
Like what does that mean? And what can we even do?

95
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,880
Well, the frustrating thing too is like,

96
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,139
I have the Google advanced account protection enabled.

97
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,380
So I have all sorts of, you know, all the two of a goodness and multi factor blah, blah,

98
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:10,660
blah.

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,179
I cannot replicate that myself,

100
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:13,869
right?

101
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,039
Or right.

102
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:16,988
In theory, I could replicate that myself,

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,350
but not at the reliability and cost that Google does it, which is 50 bucks a year.

104
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:24,070
There's no way I can build that for 50 bucks a year.

105
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,209
Well, and look, it doesn't matter because

106
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:29,910
if I use some random service,

107
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,959
they aren't going to be willing to tie into my single sign on environment.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,989
Well, exactly.

109
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:35,549
Yes.

110
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,200
And that's something we have at the CS A where, you know, we support a bunch of, we,

111
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,700
we prefer people to use single sign on

112
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,510
because then the accounts under their control and

113
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,950
we don't have to deal with their passwords and stuff.

114
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,329
And we support a number of major single sign ons.

115
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,609
And while the one big thing though is we also

116
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,869
let you set a backup email address to do account

117
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,984
recovery. Right. And I think that's sort of the correct answer here because,

118
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,355
yeah, realistically,

119
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,475
so in the past, there were things like open

120
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:04,385
off or OO or open ID. And for example, at one point, kurt.c.org

121
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:08,804
was a wordpress.com hosted site which actually had an open ID endpoint,

122
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:13,415
which I could then use to log into any open ID enabled service.

123
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:14,464
And it was kind of funny because

124
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:17,924
some of those open ID services, like when you plug in curt.c.org,

125
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:18,984
they just flipped out

126
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,309
and would spit out all sorts of warnings,

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,600
but then it would work because it was a valid, you know,

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,589
end point for the authentication.

129
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,529
A lot of them refused to use it because it's like, oh, it's not one we recognize.

130
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,809
And so

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ironically, all these protocols,

132
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,850
the single sign of protocols that were sort of help meant to help

133
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,040
in part decentralize all this login stuff,

134
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,359
ended up the reverse of it centralizing it

135
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,920
heavily because to put it bluntly running accounts

136
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:46,959
is hard

137
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,220
and expensive and a pain like if somebody gets a hold of your password and user name,

138
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,760
they can log into your account,

139
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,970
maybe, maybe not like if you have Google advanced account protection, you know,

140
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,089
it's going to look at your IP address.

141
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,119
It's gonna ask for two fa all those things. Not let you do anything nasty.

142
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,100
Even if somebody gets your user name and password,

143
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,279
that's really hard to replicate and build, it's extremely difficult. Yeah.

144
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,660
And so we, we're at this

145
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,929
point where on the one hand,

146
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,790
I want users to use single sign on and

147
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:18,309
have one account that they protect properly and well,

148
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,239
rather than have, you know, 100 accounts with their email address and,

149
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,119
and random passwords now.

150
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,040
And that would be fine if they all had a good password manager, but they don't.

151
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,059
That's right. That's right.

152
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,850
So there's another side of,

153
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,660
there's something you said way at the beginning

154
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,420
where you mentioned about a backup email.

155
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,489
And

156
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,339
I mean,

157
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,869
that's not a practical solution for most people

158
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,820
because the vast majority of people might have

159
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,630
a backup email and they're going to give

160
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,269
it a completely useless and worthless password,

161
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,109
which will probably be very easy for an attacker to get into.

162
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,459
And now the attacker can reset the password because

163
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,200
they have access to the backup email account.

164
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:56,510
Right.

165
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,079
Which is,

166
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,600
and that's something I spend a lot of time thinking about right

167
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,470
now is all these places that have really good front end security,

168
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,170
but their account recovery is weak.

169
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,040
You know, the classic one being,

170
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:10,130
especially for stuff you pay where as one of their validation questions.

171
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,119
What is the last four digits of the credit card number you used to pay for this?

172
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,410
Well, quite often that

173
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,130
that

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,700
numbers get included in like an email receipt sent to you. That's right.

175
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,339
It's funny to me that on the one hand,

176
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,010
I get all these receipts with those last four numbers printed on them.

177
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,750
But on the other hand,

178
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,880
they're also somehow treated as being like secret data that can be used

179
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,273
me to validate who I am.

180
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,532
That's probably just because the credit card companies

181
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,673
let you store the last four digits.

182
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:36,472
So it's like the only identifying information

183
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,203
they have on you

184
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,822
that the customer,

185
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,032
the customer service person can actually see.

186
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,013
Yeah, exactly.

187
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:47,463
So I've seen many places that have account recovery

188
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,592
that is far weaker than the front end security.

189
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,192
The classic case being,

190
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:55,186
oh, you got locked out, you need to reset your password, plug in your email address.

191
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,776
So, ok, if you control that email address now you control that account

192
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:58,675
or worse

193
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:02,976
your phone number and with the whole SIM swap thing like, and I didn't realize this.

194
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,696
I thought SIM swaps were always targeted.

195
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,876
I didn't realize what was happening for a while was they would break, you know,

196
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,966
they would break into a cell reseller at

197
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,385
a, at a mall

198
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,055
and just, and grab like say

199
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,675
100 or 1000

200
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,545
phone numbers sim swap them all out.

201
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:18,526
And then

202
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,055
the thing is you go to Google or Facebook

203
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,390
and they go, oh, you forgot your account. Like you,

204
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,700
you've forgotten, like you somehow forgot your email address. Cool.

205
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,769
Plug in your phone number

206
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,020
and then it sends you a text and I'm just like

207
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,000
who forgets their email address but ok, whatever. No, no, no, let's just,

208
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,159
let's ignore that.

209
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,960
So given just control of a phone number,

210
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,260
you can go hijack people's Facebook or Google accounts.

211
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,159
Ok.

212
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,919
I want to stop you right here because you just said, who forgets their email address?

213
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,080
And the answer is normal people. We're not normal people.

214
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,559
And my suspicion is most of the people listening to us aren't normal people.

215
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,380
And

216
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,450
we live in two extremely different worlds where the technical people

217
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,080
like forgetting my email address is a laughable

218
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,960
concept that would be like forgetting my name.

219
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,659
But

220
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,900
I know people that if I said what's your email address, they'd probably say,

221
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:09,640
I don't know.

222
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,820
And like while I can't understand that

223
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,979
they probably also can't understand the universe

224
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:14,984
where

225
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:19,784
someone's email address is like literally part of their identity because I,

226
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,104
I own a domain, you know, like that.

227
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:25,025
That's not something normal people can comprehend.

228
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:25,385
Yeah.

229
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:28,015
Well, and, and all the, all the, well, number one,

230
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,765
all the good names are taken and b there's a lot of people, you know, John Smith.

231
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,945
John Smith 23,

232
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:36,690
right? Like, well, no,

233
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,150
like what do you do if you're John Smith?

234
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,690
Like what do you pick, you have to pick random garbage?

235
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,250
I, I have, I have an example I can give is there is a gentleman

236
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,039
we used to work with at Redhead. His name was Matt Smith. I believe he's still there.

237
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,559
And there were,

238
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,489
there were two Matt Smiths at Redhead and they

239
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,479
would obviously get the emails for each other.

240
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,409
And it was always a good laugh because I,

241
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,530
I screwed this up all the time and I remember I was talking to him one day and he's like,

242
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,940
this is the first company I've worked for where there

243
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,460
weren't at least four Matt Smiths working in the company.

244
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,250
And I'm like,

245
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,119
that is a banana's problem to think about because I'm pretty sure I am

246
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,479
the only Josh Bresser on the planet Earth and I have a suspicion.

247
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,679
There are millions of people named Matt Smith.

248
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:20,919
There's actually a shockingly simple solution to this that I saw.

249
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,799
I think it was AT&T does it back in the day? I don't know if they still do it.

250
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:24,669
Ok.

251
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,989
First initial part of your last name and then it was three or four random digits.

252
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,630
So it was like J Smith, 2794.

253
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,359
-- But
-- that's

254
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,780
AT&T, I don't want to work at AT&T like

255
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,349
-- I got to pick my email address at work.
-- Well, and that's the thing, right?

256
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:44,010
Like a phone number isn't sort of, nobody wants like 1 800 Josh B

257
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,950
-- or whatever, right? Josh brass.
-- I wonder what that is.

258
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,510
I'm gonna, I'm gonna figure this out later

259
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,960
but, like, everybody wants

260
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,770
sort of their name at company.com and, and that's great.

261
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,250
If, like,

262
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,359
there are four Courtesy Foods in the world and the chances

263
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,609
of two of us working at the same company are low,

264
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,570
although all four of us work in it.

265
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,710
But, um,

266
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:04,719
yeah, if you're like John Smith, then that, that's a problem.

267
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,679
So that's the thing, right? People don't identify with a phone number.

268
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,400
Like I've never heard anybody complain about the phone number they were given,

269
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,940
but they do complain

270
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:18,880
like they want their email address to not be, you know, QX 47293 at company name.com.

271
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,940
-- Well, sure.
-- Which is reasonable.

272
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:26,559
-- I, I agree, but we're, we're also talking about a single sign on.
-- Now.

273
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,159
What gets me to is, is

274
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,739
one of the things I level with single sign on is

275
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,419
as the provider of a service using single sign on it.

276
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,219
Lets me just

277
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,739
on the one hand, I get to outsource a whole pile of pain and costs like, oh,

278
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:42,409
you lost access to your account. We literally can't do anything for you,

279
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,289
right? Like that's your Google account. Go deal with it

280
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,169
on the flip side,

281
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,450
especially if they paid for something.

282
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:49,549
Yeah,

283
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,989
you kind of do have to maybe even legally kind of let them back into their account.

284
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:57,280
What I find shocking though the number of places that do single sign on

285
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,179
and then allow you to register a backup email address is almost zero.

286
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,390
-- In my experience, it's pretty
-- bad. And even if they do, it's often not encouraged.

287
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,309
I mean, so one of my favorite examples here actually is

288
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,159
uh feed

289
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:15,179
because this is one of the first services that I, I realized this on.

290
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,599
And the only reason was just because I was trying to connect some

291
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:22,150
weird device that couldn't log into Google because Google didn't like it.

292
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,539
It was,

293
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,150
it's this hilarious

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,869
combination of problems.

295
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,179
And anyway, I was using Google to log into Feedle

296
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:29,330
and,

297
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,539
and then I through reading for

298
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,700
posts, I found out I could set a user name and password for my account,

299
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,010
but it was nontrivial and it was really hard to do.

300
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,369
And once I did that, oh, I remember now.

301
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,489
So I had a,

302
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:46,320
I had a device that it was, it was like an E reader or something. And I wanted to read,

303
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,039
I, I think I needed to log into Feed le to use their app or I forget what the,

304
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:51,760
what the details were.

305
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,479
But basically

306
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,229
Google wouldn't let me log in because Google was like this device is insecure

307
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,880
and it probably was because the web browser was probably like 10 years old

308
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,880
and, and like that's what set me off on this journey. But

309
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,590
no, nobody would have done this. And

310
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:07,559
now at the same time, this also made me realize

311
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,179
Ok. So

312
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:11,210
if I have a service

313
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,929
and it's only tied to Google and I can't log into Google for whatever reason,

314
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,609
I'm completely screwed.

315
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:21,809
So I put some effort into trying to register backups for whatever I could.

316
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,849
But it's definitely,

317
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:29,960
it is hard to do and most services don't encourage it in any way, which I understand.

318
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,210
I just want to call out Feeley here because I just like I,

319
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:33,450
I read feed through the website.

320
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,919
So feedle.com/whatever, click on your little profile, click on settings

321
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,510
and then you click on logins and click, add, log in and it's like

322
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,109
Google

323
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:42,359
Feed,

324
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,590
-- what normal person would do that. Right.
-- But I'm just saying it's actually easy to do

325
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,359
and it's possible and easy to do. Right.

326
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,039
-- Yeah. Yeah. Before who knows
-- it was back when I did it, it was not easy.

327
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,609
-- That's all I remember.
-- But I'm,

328
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,340
I'm gonna call them up for actually making this possible and easy

329
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:03,369
because I've dealt with other things whereas there is absolutely no way

330
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,210
to

331
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,239
set up a different one as far as I know.

332
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,109
And, and I know because we, you know,

333
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,309
we did this at the CS A and it's a very nontrivial amount of work.

334
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:17,159
Yeah. Like it's far easier just to have it hand off

335
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,159
and be done with it.

336
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:22,059
-- Not, not have a backup, not have an account recovery system, just whatever.
-- Right.

337
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,640
And well, and you think in, in certain instances, so, like feed is a great example. I

338
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:27,739
do not pay feed

339
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:31,799
money, do I? No, I, I don't think I do anymore anyway, I don't pay the money. Right.

340
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,140
So, if I lost access to my account,

341
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,260
why should they care? Right.

342
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,919
Whereas if I'm paying someone money

343
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm in, in theoretically it would be different. Like an easy example. Here could be I

344
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,750
AT&T who is my internet provider has a single sign

345
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,989
on surface which I need to access HBO go,

346
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,869
which is a hilarious combination of weirdness.

347
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,419
But anyway, like in that instance, I can call a human,

348
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,619
I can say I can't access my account.

349
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:58,909
Like

350
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,380
let's let's fix this and they could almost definitely work through.

351
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm sure they have some hilariously insecure account recovery process.

352
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,580
But you know what I mean? Versus a service

353
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,219
that has no phone number,

354
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,580
it has no contact info. It's almost certainly a black hole. If I try to email anybody.

355
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,250
What do you do then, you know,

356
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,080
also,

357
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,150
so I was just poking on github's interface trying to

358
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,760
see if I can add backup sort of logins.

359
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,849
One thing github

360
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,539
has that I,

361
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,010
I didn't even think about that I should have

362
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,700
is successor settings like next of kin type thing

363
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,849
because, and that's something that's interesting to me is because I,

364
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,679
there will be cases where you don't necessarily want your

365
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,770
next of kin to get something automatically because you're dead.

366
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,900
You know, it, it might be more of a corporate thing.

367
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,049
But you do want, for example,

368
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,940
if somebody shows up with a death certificate for that thing to

369
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,659
be handed off to somebody else so that it smoothly continues.

370
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,549
Yeah, I mean, so actually funny enough I maintain a package like this.

371
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,869
Well, it's not a package. It, there's, there's this old text based game called

372
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,659
Yarn,

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,429
which the original author of is, is deceased

374
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,719
and there's like three or four Forks. Of course, we all claim we're the real one.

375
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,409
But, like,

376
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,289
I through a series of weird events, it landed in my lap one day and I'm like, ok, I,

377
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,130
I'll own this

378
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,960
and, yeah, like the original author is gone.

379
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,239
What, like, obviously in our case, like github

380
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,039
didn't exist way back then. But,

381
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,479
-- you know, it's a real problem.
-- Yeah, I'm looking at this. I can change my password.

382
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:20,590
I can add two factor off.

383
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,919
I don't seem to be able to set like a backup email address or anything.

384
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:24,979
And maybe I'm just,

385
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,919
and if github

386
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,000
does support this,

387
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,000
they are not making it easy to find.

388
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,539
II, I don't know.

389
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,700
I've never, no, I know you can add different accounts because in fact,

390
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,659
my github

391
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:41,659
account is tied to my work single sign on and my, like,

392
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,679
you can join organizations or something.

393
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,400
I think I forget how it exactly works,

394
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,859
but it's definitely something weird like that or maybe it's tied to both.

395
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,280
I don't remember. It's so confusing.

396
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,179
-- Ah,
-- you can manage, it's under verified email settings,

397
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,539
you can add verified emails.

398
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,140
See like this is

399
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,549
I found it. So it's under emails, add email address, ah backup email address.

400
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,118
So yeah, I would have not thought to look under emails for, you know,

401
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,420
my account login type thing.

402
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,550
I mean,

403
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,939
this is one of the problems is there's zero standardization and so

404
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,079
it's just kind of let's click around until something looks right.

405
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,898
And in fairness though some places like Google are now when you register an account.

406
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:24,178
Really vigor like actually Microsoft is a better example, Microsoft 365. Now,

407
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:24,448
at

408
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,308
least on the corporate plan we're on when a user logs in Microsoft

409
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,779
is completely insistent about getting a backup email address or phone number.

410
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,619
Interesting and not letting you proceed until you do

411
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,769
because part of it is for account self recovery

412
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,660
that yeah, I mean, because how else are we going to do it? Right?

413
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,319
They have to add some secondary piece of information like a phone number or an email.

414
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,609
-- So
-- we've gone on and on about this problem. But II I want to talk about.

415
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,859
So how, how do we, how do we fix this? Right.

416
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,920
The first two things that I think are going to pop into everyone's mind is,

417
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,900
oh, let the government run an identity provider,

418
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,859
which ha ha good luck or let's regulate the giant identity providers.

419
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:07,250
And um let them like we'll, we'll say you have to let people reset their accounts.

420
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,130
Honestly.

421
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,989
I, I use login.gov

422
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,609
like, yeah, I'm a Canadian. I know I have a US government account.

423
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,150
It's because the Nexus pass.

424
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,900
-- I like login.gov. It works really well. I don't even
-- know what login.gov

425
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,540
is.

426
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,099
It's

427
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,300
a,

428
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,170
it's literally what it says. It is.

429
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,489
The public's one account for government,

430
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,310
use one account and password for secure

431
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,729
private access to participate in government agencies.

432
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,910
You should call them and try to regain access

433
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,890
to your account pretending you forgot your password.

434
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, absolutely. Because they have everything about me.

435
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,910
They have my passport, my driver's license, they have

436
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,489
my biometrics.

437
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,329
They

438
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,329
like I have us federal identification

439
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,060
in the form of a nexus pass, right? Because, and it's

440
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,609
purely like it's 80%

441
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,680
just to skip the lines at the border, especially the land border man that,

442
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,670
that land like, oh, wow.

443
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,260
Yeah, the tail back from going from Vancouver to Seattle versus the Nexus Line. Who

444
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,800
so worth it. So you, you joke about the US government running a single sign on

445
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,969
-- but they, they do and it works
-- well. Ok. Hold on, hold on.

446
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:13,599
I'm not saying they are incapable of running single sign on.

447
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:16,369
My suggestion is more along the lines of,

448
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,290
I don't think we could get the citizenry to use it

449
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,439
because it is clear that a nontrivial number of people, if the government said,

450
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,369
like, don't play with fire,

451
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,000
they're going to be like you can't stop me from playing with fire

452
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,000
and they're going to burn their house down just to prove them wrong.

453
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,660
Like that is the problem I see is if this existed,

454
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,839
there would be a group of people that would be

455
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,939
like I'm not using computers anymore to own the government,

456
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,739
but that's the world we live in.

457
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,959
And I think there's some good sort of niche alternatives.

458
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,819
So for example, in, in Canada, with the Canadian Revenue Agency,

459
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,280
you can have a AC R A my account for

460
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,800
looking at your tax statements, making payments, whatever.

461
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,680
And the way they do single sign on is via your bank account.

462
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,300
You,

463
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,900
they essentially support about a dozen or so financial institutions in Canada,

464
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,609
which is like

465
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,319
that covers pretty much the whole population.

466
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,099
And so you, you go to log in and you, you choose like TD or Scotia Bank or whatever C I BC,

467
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:15,010
click it

468
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,229
and then, you know, bump you over to their website,

469
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,060
you log into your website uh to the website like normal

470
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,780
and allow basically cr A to let you log in through your bank account.

471
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,869
And, and that's also nice because that

472
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,180
banks tend to do good, know your customer, right?

473
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,010
Like they, they tend to know who you are.

474
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,729
There's a lot of people without bank accounts who can't get bank accounts.

475
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,819
True. Absolutely true. But the problem is

476
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,569
then you're saying, oh, we,

477
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,760
you can't do this because it doesn't cover everybody Well, yeah,

478
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,010
that's always going to be the case.

479
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,609
-- No,
-- I'm saying

480
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,430
if you did that,

481
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:50,609
you have to make sure there's some alternative for the people who are unbanked and,

482
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,270
or make it easier for everyone to get bank accounts,

483
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,719
which is probably a whole another story.

484
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:55,050
But,

485
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,719
and this is going to one area where in that email I wrote where

486
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,959
I think this needs to be regulated because, uh, like,

487
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:08,160
I like banks are regulated and as terrible as they are, it's generally, you know,

488
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,209
the bank can't just take my money, lock me up and walk away and laugh

489
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,819
like it happens. But we'll ignore that,

490
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,109
you know, there are processes to deal with it.

491
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,140
There are legal processes to deal with it. Whereas if Google shuts down my account,

492
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,619
I'm screwed

493
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,180
too bad. Like,

494
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,020
yeah.

495
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:25,300
And so

496
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,219
I think where this is headed is

497
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,890
these single sign ons potentially end up as gatekeepers

498
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,119
well to everything. And I think as such, there maybe needs to be some regulation.

499
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,329
Like there needs to be some,

500
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,920
some way to do account recovery, you know, that they can't,

501
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,819
like, it blows my mind that they can just shut down accounts

502
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:44,800
and

503
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,510
I get that they can shut down accounts because it's private system. They own it.

504
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,540
They deal with the bruisers and spammers and all sorts of horrible stuff,

505
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,599
but they do catch innocent bystanders

506
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,099
and I've seen it happen,

507
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:56,810
you know,

508
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,260
and

509
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,280
the problem is, you know, somebody pointed out if you have like,

510
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,439
a 1% outage that sort of evenly affects everybody for one minute out of 100 minutes.

511
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,020
Sure. Whatever. No big deal.

512
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,079
But if you have a 1% outage that affects 1% of your users consistently all the time.

513
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:14,300
Yeah, that 1% of users is screwed.

514
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:14,939
Yeah.

515
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:16,219
Totally.

516
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:16,920
You know,

517
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,339
and that's like account lockout is,

518
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,709
yeah, it's kind of,

519
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,959
it's pretty severe potentially.

520
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,920
And so I, I don't know what the answer is but the reality is,

521
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,589
I think we need more single sign on

522
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,530
because user name and password, like, have I been ped

523
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,780
has how many records now?

524
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,319
-- All of them, it has all of
-- the record.

525
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,380
I think

526
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,569
the last time I looked it was like seven or 8 billion. Oh,

527
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,020
-- it's
-- more than that. It's got to be hundreds.

528
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,140
It might even be what, what's after billion, trillion,

529
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:44,790
trillion?

530
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,060
It's any normal.

531
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,599
Oh, I was way off. Yeah.

532
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,099
Uh, 11

533
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,699
-- billion, 11.4 billion.
-- That's it. I figured they'd have way more than that.

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,489
But you, you get the idea, I, I think talking about regulation is

535
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,430
easy

536
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:04,900
but the reality is, I don't know anyone on, like,

537
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,640
a national or global level that even considers this a topic.

538
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,380
You know what I mean? True.

539
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,660
And I,

540
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,390
I think it will be at some point but it's also one of those

541
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,589
problems of how do you explain this to a lawmaker or a voter or anyone

542
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,270
in a way they can even reasonably understand because let's face it.

543
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,060
Google, shuts down probably millions of accounts a day.

544
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:29,020
The vast majority are bots and a couple of people they,

545
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,619
and they catch in their net is such a small number that it, it,

546
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,819
no one's really gonna care.

547
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,939
And anyone truly important. Like, if they did this to a senator or someone,

548
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,819
the senator is going to be like, Google,

549
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,310
shut down my account and Google is going to be like, oh, sorry, Mr Senator,

550
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,430
we'll fix it right away.

551
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,030
Whereas if you're Kurt siefried, they're like, yeah, whatever, nerd,

552
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,750
we don't care.

553
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,260
Yeah.

554
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,650
Well, the thing is in the past we have had a similar thing, which is the post banks,

555
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:54,630
right? The idea being that people needed bank accounts to do

556
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,400
banking type stuff.

557
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:01,089
And there's most countries have a postal system which has the unique property of,

558
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:05,199
we know where everybody lives because we deliver their mail. Right.

559
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,400
And so,

560
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,479
and they also have the unique property quite commonly of, oh,

561
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,609
you want some sort of organization that can provide services to, like,

562
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,079
99% of your population within a two hours walking distance.

563
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,670
Yeah, it's the post office.

564
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,489
And so,

565
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,569
I mean, there were post banks in the past, you know, in Germany, Japan.

566
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,849
I know we had big ones. I'm just looking at the list here. China had one Iran

567
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,119
anyways.

568
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,239
So, the, the idea of having, like, a government,

569
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,489
either run or regulated entity that kind of provides

570
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,050
a basic service to everybody that involves authentication.

571
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,369
And,

572
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,890
you know, ideally, banks involve authentication because I want

573
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,750
not you to get my money.

574
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,810
Um,

575
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,800
-- we have done this successfully in the past.
-- I mean, it, it's possible.

576
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,119
Well, although again,

577
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,680
we come back to,

578
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,359
I think the political climate today would make it incredibly difficult.

579
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,000
Whereas even in the past, there was probably some of this but

580
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:08,540
-- it, it clearly worked to a degree well
-- and, and there are valid arguments to be made,

581
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,089
you know, there's people, for example that say I,

582
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,550
I'm not so much concerned about this activity,

583
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,839
but I'm concerned about the backend database then being used for other purposes,

584
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,579
right? And that has been a problem in past in various countries. You know, it is

585
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:21,290
true.

586
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,449
I, I don't know what the answer is but I, I

587
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,020
feel deeply uncomfortable giving Google Twitter, Facebook and linkedin

588
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,609
because those are the four big social sign ons,

589
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,130
you know, and Apple. So let's say those big five,

590
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,900
I do feel uncomfortable giving them so much

591
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,060
power with no oversight and no regulation and no

592
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,699
-- recourse.
-- I mean, I agree. I, I think though,

593
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:47,939
I, I don't,

594
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,660
I don't see how we get to a point where people care just because this is

595
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:58,689
such a non issue on the grand scale that unless you're like some weird identity nerd,

596
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:00,770
you don't even know this is a problem,

597
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,530
I think because every time I read about identity theft and

598
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,520
you read about how much time and effort people put into fixing

599
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,880
the problems they're experiencing with identity theft.

600
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,869
You know, calling vendors, calling banks.

601
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,339
It's

602
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:14,270
hundreds of hours. And so they're, they're,

603
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,790
yeah, but it's, it's hundreds of hours that don't affect the people in charge.

604
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,280
So, why do they

605
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,060
-- care?
-- Well, yeah.

606
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:19,910
Well,

607
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
and it's also kind of spread out like nobody

608
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,000
unless you actually know somebody that went through it.

609
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,989
Like you're not going to see somebody making hundreds of hours of phone

610
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,959
calls to their banks trying to sort this out like it happens in private

611
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:30,910
and, and,

612
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,109
and here's the other part of it is even if

613
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,989
you know someone that's been affected by identity theft,

614
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:36,989
it's, they,

615
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,329
they might complain a little bit but the vast majority

616
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,469
of people recognize like this isn't a conversation topic.

617
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,229
Don't

618
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,489
just sit there and complain about this because no one cares.

619
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:49,589
Like, granted we have a podcast so we could talk about it for hours.

620
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,829
But like normal people, they don't have an out

621
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,709
and, and, I mean, this is,

622
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,780
this is a weird and hard problem and I don't,

623
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:57,890
I,

624
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,469
I want it to get fixed.

625
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,880
I want to think it's easy to fix,

626
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,569
but I think it might be in the probably impossible bucket of problems.

627
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,199
Well, more I think worryingly is that

628
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,880
fixing it remotely correctly? Is

629
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:14,359
it's a lot of work. Like,

630
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:17,949
I know providing a single sign on and providing multiple,

631
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,839
single sign on and providing multiple sign,

632
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:22,420
single sign on with backup email addresses.

633
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,839
It's a lot of work.

634
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,189
Yeah. Yeah.

635
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,119
And like the CS A actually has

636
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,109
customer support that's actually customer focused because like,

637
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,510
we have things that cost money.

638
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:37,130
Yeah. And when somebody pays money for us and then isn't able to log in and get at it,

639
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,910
they get really annoyed. It's so strange.

640
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,099
Now, if you guys had a billion users who weren't paying you any money,

641
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,989
you'd probably be like, whatever.

642
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:46,630
I don't care.

643
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,400
And I get it and, and, yeah, on the flip side, yeah,

644
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,630
you can't have a billion users that pay you $0.

645
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,380
Uh, I mean, if there's some way to monetize them enough to provide good support,

646
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,849
I would love to know what it is.

647
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,949
And so with Google, I bet

648
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,270
and Facebook and

649
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,939
-- tiktok and all those guys. But
-- they, they seem to be doing pretty well.

650
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,390
I don't, I don't think this is on their list.

651
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:08,829
Yeah.

652
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,520
II, I suspect it's going to be one of those things where it's just, you know,

653
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,989
the people that get affected by this, it's gonna really suck for them.

654
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,010
That, that's it. That's the end of my thought

655
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:17,739
that it is. And

656
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,035
I don't have any good news.

657
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:24,415
No, I, I agree. And I think kind of anyone listening if you haven't done so already

658
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:26,224
figure out what kind of your,

659
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:31,025
your critical path services and accounts are and make sure you've got either

660
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:35,875
a secondary sign on enabled or a backup email or something important.

661
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,060
Because yeah, if, if you lose Google, what happens and it would be, I mean,

662
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,540
I guess that's one of the things actually,

663
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,550
I think about a lot is like I own breast.net, which is my email address.

664
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,619
And while I use it with Google services, if Google boots me,

665
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,270
I also made sure I didn't register the domain with Google.

666
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,510
So if they boot me, I can just pick up my domain and go elsewhere.

667
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,290
-- It would suck and it would take a long time to deal with, but I could at least do it
-- well.

668
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,410
And that gets into the whole, you know,

669
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,310
people having multiple domains like so you have

670
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,699
domain A which is primary but you have

671
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,140
Domain B which is kind of your admin domain and you use for your admin logins

672
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,000
and also to

673
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,349
protect stuff more blah, blah, blah, blah.

674
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:10,910
But

675
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,560
yeah,

676
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:14,510
that's like carrying a full set of winter tires in your

677
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,550
car all the time just in case it snows a bit.

678
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,569
Yeah, no one's going to do that. I mean, let's face it.

679
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,280
The vast majority of people have like a Gmail account.

680
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,800
Well, even people with their own domain,

681
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,199
they're not going to get a second domain to protect the first domain and then

682
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,829
you know, an anti anti anti

683
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:27,500
missile

684
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:31,479
actually in all seriousness. If you need a great backup email, a proton

685
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,380
mail is phenomenal and I'd highly suggest throwing them some cash anyway,

686
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,239
just because like they're doing, they're doing the Lord's work for sure.

687
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,239
Like, go look at what they're up to. It's great.

688
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,280
And then the challenge too is with, with things that are privacy, security minded,

689
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,699
like proton

690
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,109
mail.

691
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,500
Well, then the bad guys tend to use them and they tend to, you know, it,

692
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,949
it can be difficult to send email from them because

693
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,209
that's true. Actually,

694
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,189
it's, it's a catch 22 and in

695
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:54,910
that,

696
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,310
if you actually provide people with good security and privacy,

697
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:02,079
yeah, guess, guess what kind of people go there to use that service?

698
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,760
-- You, you get some of that, you
-- know, I've seen like with all the, uh, you know,

699
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,780
with all the stuff that has trial offers now and

700
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,770
everybody's trying to do crypto mining on them or whatever.

701
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,430
It's just

702
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,079
if you provide a good service, people are going to try and abuse it, that's just

703
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:16,349
a

704
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:20,699
-- universal thing.
-- I know I'm going to call this one. I feel like

705
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,530
I feel like we've beaten this to death.

706
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,520
I wish there was a better solution but there's not. So

707
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,329
here's hopefully at some point in the near future we could do another show of, oh,

708
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:30,319
how we were wrong.

709
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,229
It's easy to fix and this is it.

710
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,689
I don't, I don't think that's happening anyway. Thank you.
