0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,150
Send mail will outlive both of us.

1
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,509
That is absolutely true.

2
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,729
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

3
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,760
Kurt Siefried and my partner and hopefully never running a mail server again.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,350
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I

5
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,190
will never run a mail server again.

6
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:21,680
I am confident in saying that apart from the fact

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,950
that I'm just not confident enough to do it anymore.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,049
It's such a just,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,370
it's like a den of snakes now on the internet when you're running a mail server.

10
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,909
Well, the other problem is nobody actually wants a

11
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:34,979
mail server. What they want is

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,250
mail, calendaring, file sharing,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,740
collaborative file editing.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,819
Ideally, appointment scheduling, spell check.

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,159
They want grammar check like they, they want the whole suite

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,569
when they say email. And,

17
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,130
and here's the trick.

18
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:50,090
Email is the only

19
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,409
sensible working push messages system we have

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,990
and I don't count S MS.

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,220
It's, it's email.

22
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,770
Email will,

23
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,709
email will last until the sun explodes because

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
we don't have another push system and we never

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:03,630
will.

26
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:07,180
Well, we'll never have a new push system because it's been tried multiple many,

27
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,690
many times and they never get traction because,

28
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,510
well, they're basically not as good as email to begin with mostly.

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,559
-- And somebody else controls them and wants money for it. Pretty
-- much.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,339
I get it. Actually. It's funny you bring this up because I set up D

31
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,160
mark on my domain, like, some time ago

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,580
and there's a service. What is the power D mark? I think. You, you showed it to me

33
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,279
because they gave it to us for free.

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,239
Yeah, I've had it, I've had it configured,

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,889
like for a year and I basically wasn't looking at it and

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,269
I've had some issues with people complaining my mails are going into spam

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,309
and I thought, ok, I need to like, figure out what, what have I screwed up?

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,419
Like, did I break something?

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,830
And I look and like DKIM is set up, I've got what SPF is working, right? All that stuff.

40
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,404
You're like me only use Google now like you're just, it's gmail, that's it.

41
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,815
Yeah, it's all Google 100% Google. It's like I'm like, oh wait, I have power D

42
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,285
Mark set up. Let's see what it says.

43
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:59,495
And like half of the mail being sent for my domain

44
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:03,004
is coming from like freaking scammers in Eastern Europe and,

45
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,654
but I had my, my D

46
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:07,345
mark, what do they call the policy or something? I forget what it is,

47
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,395
the policy I had it sent to none.

48
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:09,979
Yeah.

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,809
So just observe,

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,979
-- basically I
-- just said it to reject and now

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,710
obviously anyone trying to send mail is me from,

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,970
not me gets thrown in the bin

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,770
if the mail servers beve incorrectly.

54
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:23,779
A lot of them actually kind of ignore reject and set it as quarantine some of them.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,300
But

56
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:27,020
well, by some of them, like I think office.com still does it

57
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,470
maybe

58
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,485
the people I've been dealing with. So it's, it's gmail, right? Gmail.

59
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:33,544
Users were seeing my mail in their spam folder sometimes.

60
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:36,274
And so I, I know Gmail will do this, right?

61
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,434
So yeah, that's that.

62
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:42,184
No, it's I love that like at the CS A we're up 97.9.

63
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:46,274
Uh sorry, it's 97.7% of our email is dr compliant.

64
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,744
And when I look now like

65
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,929
it's all spammers, like I click on each of the IP S and it's,

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,820
it's not like 10 to 50 spam list

67
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:54,770
which

68
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,910
I am shocked at how many spoofed emails are sent out. Like

69
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:00,770
I,

70
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,100
you know, like I just,

71
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,179
I didn't think it was that many but it is

72
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,240
which and I mean,

73
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,550
and this is with like gmail doing all the

74
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,649
-- heavy lifting and patching and running the mail
-- server.

75
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,789
Ok. So II I just pulled it up. 81% of the mail sent for my domain today is junk.

76
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,839
It's shocking how much especially I I suspect part of it is because

77
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,100
we have old domain names like they're more than 10 years old.

78
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,119
Probably.

79
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:31,195
No dude. My email address is like a rash on the internet. It can't get rid of.

80
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,955
It's just, it's everywhere because it's so old.

81
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,854
Well, and my theory is that they basically keep trying and testing domains

82
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,475
to find when they become

83
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:44,725
misconducting. Somebody tried,

84
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,179
what was it? Eight character long,

85
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,759
like random

86
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,869
letters uh like dot Cloud security lines.org, like tried

87
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,149
it was they tried 100 and 81 different subdomains that

88
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,520
were randomly generated from 100 and 81 different IP addresses.

89
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:02,589
So obviously they have tooling like they have some system but you know,

90
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
they say like go test is

91
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,759
and I think they were trying to see if we had like insecure

92
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,070
sub policy or something said, I don't know. But like, I'd never seen that before.

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,399
I've only seen it the one time in like five years.

94
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,460
So it's clear that like

95
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,428
they have automated the heck of us, they've got good tools and like, well, I mean,

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,170
-- because spam is still a problem,
-- it's

97
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:20,548
OK.

98
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:20,980
I

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,279
just realized something we're going on and on

100
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,089
about Demark and spam and all this stuff

101
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,559
and we should explain what this is because

102
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,209
there's going to be people listening who don't,

103
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,260
don't have a clue what we're talking about.

104
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,760
So in the world of email,

105
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:32,559
there,

106
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:33,910
you have a domain, right?

107
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,290
Like breast.net, in my case,

108
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,730
and breast.net has what's called an MX record

109
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,179
which tells people sending email where to send my

110
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,720
mail,

111
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,739
right? In my case, it's going to Google, right?

112
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,269
And everything was fine and we use that for

113
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,579
a long time and then people started sending spam

114
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,859
right where they were pretending to be, they would find open relays,

115
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,220
whatever they would send spam saying, oh, I'm Josh Ha ha.

116
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,980
Look at me but they weren't really right.

117
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,619
And then we got these things at

118
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,100
-- SPF is Center policy framework, center
-- policy framework. And,

119
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,690
and it's simple, it basically says who or what is allowed to send it

120
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,149
Email is from this domain and it can be an IP address, it can be a host name,

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,010
it can be also a look up record like sales force does that.

122
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,109
And so the idea was like you could say

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,309
only Gmail and Sendgrid and this IP address of this

124
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,070
mail server I run are allowed to be pressed on that

125
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,410
for outgoing email

126
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:28,559
and that kind of worked for a while except the problem is you have major players

127
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,459
that are

128
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,529
doing email for multiple people and don't

129
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,750
always like separate their tenants properly and,

130
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,579
and shared IP S

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,059
this is one of the problems I see is because

132
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,980
I use the Google MX hosts

133
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:41,959
that

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,309
there's so many of them that a lot of the SPF

135
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,500
tests are like this isn't a host in your domain.

136
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,739
We don't know what's going on, right?

137
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,140
Like something weird is happening,

138
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,739
we think except that's normal in every instance.

139
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,700
So then we got dkim, which I don't know dkim

140
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,130
-- stands for. Do you know what dkim? Stands for
-- domain keys identified male. Yeah.

141
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,739
So basically you publish a public key in your DNS

142
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,929
and

143
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,000
the private keys used to sign on your email.

144
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,459
And actually what I love about this is less from a spam perspective,

145
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,329
although it is useful for preventing spam,

146
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,220
but we're really

147
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,649
shines is essentially all

148
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,350
DKIM email is now

149
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,260
-- evidence grade evidence.
-- That's probably true.

150
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:23,420
Actually, if there's a DKIM signature, yeah, you can prove it right.

151
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,500
Because it's cryptographically signed.

152
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,549
Like you, you can't monkey with the time stamps. You can't say,

153
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,730
oh, I didn't send it.

154
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,510
Well, well, your server with the private key sent it at this time.

155
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,769
Right?

156
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,149
But now, now it should be, it should be said though that SPF and DKIM, they,

157
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,829
they fail a lot in many environments.

158
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,549
-- They
-- used to fail a lot recently. I've noticed over the last year or two

159
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,089
it's changed a lot.

160
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,880
And I, I think simply put the reason is,

161
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,500
is because fewer people are running their own broken mail servers.

162
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,829
-- I mean, that's probably true.
-- I used to get enough reports in Power D

163
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,630
mark from the um,

164
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,899
the L A Department of Water and Power that it

165
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,959
showed up because they were like forwarding email or something.

166
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,059
It was broken. And so I was getting

167
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,399
Angeles,

168
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,029
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

169
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,350
Yeah,

170
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,690
it was, it was noisy enough that it showed up like it was in the top 50 of my thing.

171
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,989
And I'm like, what's, what's L A DWP, whatever, blah, blah, blah.com.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,549
And I look it up and I'm like, oh, it's the L A Department of Water and Power

173
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,429
and,

174
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,130
and then at some point they fix their system or another good one was duke.edu.

175
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,549
They have two main mail servers that were just

176
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,709
not configured right in some way.

177
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,149
And for the longest time they were in the top 10 of like, broken,

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,970
like your email is not properly SPF or Deacon signed.

179
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,559
And I'm like, yes, it is.

180
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,149
And then like one day it just went away like they fixed it. And so what I've noticed is

181
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,109
I used to get a ton of these false reports.

182
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,649
They've all gone. There

183
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,630
are no more.

184
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,380
-- I mean, that's cool. I, I hope to get there someday and
-- a part of it probably is

185
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,660
because if your mail is that badly configured

186
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,369
and you're bouncing email from like gmail,

187
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,079
that's like what, 50% of email on the internet now.

188
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,970
Right. Exactly.

189
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,609
You don't, you don't want to be bouncing email from gmail and,

190
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,079
and there's other things too that, that people have been doing in the,

191
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,459
-- in the universe of, of spam prevention,
-- the blacklist or block list.

192
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,209
-- Sorry.
-- Right.

193
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,220
And then we end up with, with D

194
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,869
mark, which I just pulled this up.

195
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,369
It stands for Domain message authentication reporting

196
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,600
and D mark kind of has two pieces to it

197
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,640
there. Is

198
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,239
you, you configure it, it's configured in DNS, of course, as all these things are,

199
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,720
again, we have nothing else.

200
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,600
How else am I going to publish information about my domain?

201
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,779
-- I mean,
-- what can you trust? Right.

202
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,450
Because you can't ask the mail server because an evil mail server is gonna be like,

203
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,380
oh yes, I'm definitely Kurt and you should definitely trust all of this mail.

204
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,049
But anyway, so, so we have Dar

205
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,030
and in Dar, you can configure kind of a place to send.

206
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,638
Uh I, I guess information about email, right were good or bad.

207
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,218
Well, reports of the email,

208
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:50,278
like I received this email from supposedly from breast on

209
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,348
that and it was for example SPF compliant or not

210
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,718
-- decom compliant or not. And
-- then it also has a policy where you have none,

211
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:02,039
you have quarantine and you have reject and that tells the remote mail server

212
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:07,455
-- if you have a male that fails DKIM or SPF, what should you do with
-- it?

213
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,474
And it's a little more so than that, you can also set SPF and DKIM

214
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,155
policy of like, be relaxed or be strict.

215
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,934
And then so like, that's

216
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:18,335
what I did with the CS A is of course, at first I had a policy of none because it's like,

217
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:19,755
observe and report like just,

218
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,724
you know, we're going to sit tight and assess. Exactly.

219
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,219
And you know, and, and I went from like, uh DKIM and SPF from like relaxed to like, ok,

220
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,150
I'm like over 95%.

221
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,380
Set it to strict. OK. That's working,

222
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,409
you know, and then went from none to quarantine. OK?

223
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,400
Nothing too terrible happened then to reject because

224
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:43,000
like for c.org it was simple c.org, this is Gmail. That's it. Like my SPF record is

225
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:48,054
include gmail.org minus all my DKIM is like here the Google Selector key

226
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,864
and my D mark is like if it's not from Gmail don't take it.

227
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:53,625
Whereas the CS A we have like, you know,

228
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,604
like seven mail services we use plus a bunch of,

229
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:59,275
I had to break stuff into subdomains because SPF has a 10 record.

230
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:01,864
-- Look up, blah, blah, blah.
-- And that's where things get difficult,

231
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:02,695
you know.

232
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,304
But the point is it's, it's doable now.

233
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:08,695
And like I said, I've, I've seen way less false positives because

234
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,705
if you don't have your email set up, right?

235
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,969
People aren't going to get

236
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,320
-- it.
-- We just spent

237
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,809
a lot of show

238
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,289
talking about a

239
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,789
functionally D mark which I'm OK with because I love this.

240
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,080
But we actually have a better topic than just this.

241
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,770
But wait, it gets worse.

242
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,010
So you've done all this SPFD, Kim D mark stuff to dip battle spam.

243
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,969
But hey, you can patch your server. OK? So let's play a game. Guess how many CV ES

244
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:38,169
there were in Microsoft Exchange so far this year

245
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,630
in OK. So it's, it's October of 2022 at the time of recording. It's the end of October.

246
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,299
So patch Tuesday for October would have come. So that's 10 months,

247
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,440
I would guess. 100.

248
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,349
Oh, well. Ok. You're way, way more pessimistic. Uh, no, it's like 3030 two.

249
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,419
That's not that bad.

250
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,419
-- I would have expected way worse than that.
-- Ok. But let's see, we got a 9.8 we got a 9.8

251
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,049
we got a,

252
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,510
we got some, like, pretty critical remote code execution ones

253
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,179
that's fair.

254
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,140
There have been some really,

255
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,419
really bad exchange issues and maybe that's why

256
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,440
I overestimated it because I assume if,

257
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:16,080
if they're fixing a 9.8 there's probably like six other lows,

258
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,700
but no one's paying attention to those.

259
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,159
Ok. So exchange is terrible. Ok, let's get rid of exchange and run something else.

260
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,599
Well, we need something that does email calendar and all that stuff. So

261
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,380
the most obvious one that comes to mind is

262
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,049
-- the
-- only other one I can think of is Zambra.

263
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,539
And I know they've also had some terrible issues in the last couple of months.

264
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,710
They've had a bit of a rough year. So guess,

265
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,479
-- I mean, how many have they had, let's say 30
-- 20

266
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,510
but let's see, 9.8339 0.8

267
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,340
like three, basically

268
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,859
-- code execution.
-- They've had a rough, a rough year.

269
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:51,409
Weirdly, they had a really quiet last year but, and then in 2020.

270
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,250
-- But anyways, how was
-- exchange last year? Can you look up the number of exchange?

271
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,090
I Ds last year. I bet they had a quiet year also. Then is my suspicion.

272
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,039
-- Uh,
-- there was that

273
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,510
one and then to the next page. Um, ok, about another 20. Let's go to the next page.

274
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:10,830
Uh, oh, ok. Another page. Ok. Basically two pages of results.

275
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:13,630
So, like, what is that? 40 ish 40.

276
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,450
Yeah, about 35.

277
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,119
-- So
-- that's, that's on track for what we're seeing for this year. Basically.

278
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,929
So. Ok.

279
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,380
Well,

280
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,159
ok,

281
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,659
we obviously have to run these things because like, if you use exchange,

282
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,020
you can't just get rid of it.

283
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,719
Like you can't just be like, hey, folks, you know that thing,

284
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,650
you used to do all your calendaring, email and documents.

285
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,830
We're getting rid of it. Good luck.

286
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,020
Well, there's another piece to that though and, and this is,

287
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,640
I think it was Will Dorman did a lot of work on this on Twitter.

288
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,359
I'll put a link to Will's Twitter account and you can dig through his stuff, but

289
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:41,549
a

290
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,015
lot of people are running like active directory on

291
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:48,666
Prem which then gets tied in with exchange in really

292
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:51,315
weird ways you have to and you can't like,

293
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,716
replace any of this stuff.

294
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,736
If it's running your infrastructure, you're basically locked in forever.

295
00:12:55,846 --> 00:13:00,036
The only thing you can reasonably do is forklift it into Azure.

296
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,995
I don't think you can from reading

297
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,705
a lot of exchanges between

298
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,445
Goss the dog and will that I won't, I don't totally understand because

299
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:10,312
-- Goss the dog used to work at micro soft
-- when I say that I'm kind of lying.

300
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,651
It's technically theoretically possible.

301
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:16,132
-- I don't
-- think it is from reading their stuff. It's not possible at all.

302
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,762
Like, if you're talking, oh, perfect example. Let's pick on Maersk.

303
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:19,692
Right. Because remember Maersk

304
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:20,892
almost died to not pay yet.

305
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,091
But the only reason they survived is they had that one,

306
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:26,211
a DS server in Africa that was powered off and they pulled

307
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:26,851
out of it.

308
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:30,932
Yeah, if you have something like that, you know, you're not moving to Azure because

309
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,690
it's just not, you know, like I'm saying,

310
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,349
if you have like a small medium business with

311
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,309
like two A DS servers and like 100 people,

312
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,570
you can,

313
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,390
yeah, you can basically forklift it into Azure. It won't be pretty, but it's doable.

314
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,469
But if you have like a major like fortune 500 sit up.

315
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,669
Yeah, that's what you're stuck with

316
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,059
and, and

317
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,460
it's just too damn complicated

318
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:56,270
and that even assumes like your software is up to date and compatible because,

319
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,700
you know,

320
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:02,840
-- I
-- mean, so look, look up post fix. I mean, the postfix is probably the next, we'll say

321
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:07,559
most reasonable mail server. I would say that I would expect someone to use.

322
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,020
-- Postfix
-- has

323
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,880
like

324
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,400
-- one so far this year it had a critical two criticals last year.
-- One is not enough.

325
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,000
One tells me no one's using it.

326
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,989
No, no, it's got, it's got an average of a couple a year.

327
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:20,700
And

328
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,150
the thing you forget though is that postfix is actually really well architected.

329
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,280
Right.

330
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,500
It's got that master process and then it's got all the sub processes that run with,

331
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:28,869
like,

332
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,340
not root. And that really does tend to save it a lot.

333
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,679
And then send mail has as one from last year, one from this year one. You know,

334
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,479
it's, I think part of it too is s

335
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,210
mill and postfix 27 years old at this. Well, no, they're actually older than that.

336
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,919
They're like 30 years old. Well, postfix only.

337
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,590
Yeah, whatever point is they're very old, relatively mature.

338
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,799
They've been beat up and more to the point.

339
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,590
I think a lot less people are looking at them than they used to because,

340
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,669
well,

341
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,500
not Microsoft Exchange.

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,799
Right. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. 100%.

343
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,179
And then if you look at exim because like XY, is that like, oh, it's secure blah,

344
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,950
blah blah thing.

345
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,239
There's like four of them from this year.

346
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,349
One of them is critical exim before 4.95 has a heat

347
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,630
based buffer overflow for the alias list and host name.

348
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,309
-- Look up in host dot C when center host name is set. Oh, that's, that's a bad
-- one.

349
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,349
Honestly, I feel like any mail server today.

350
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,669
They, they should be in Rust or something.

351
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:22,979
Don't?

352
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:27,210
I feel like every single piece of code that's doing DNS lookups needs to be like,

353
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,559
especially paranoid

354
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:31,619
because here's the thing I love about it is number one as an attacker,

355
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,869
I control that DNS reply to an absurd degree.

356
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,229
Like I can send binary code.

357
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:35,989
And number two,

358
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,830
it's actually one of the only things you can really

359
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,659
reliably trigger a DNS look upon is a mail server.

360
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,210
Uh, it's certainly one of them. Yeah.

361
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,770
Well, because you have a web server public facing

362
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:50,619
and if you're doing DNS lookups in real time to do logging or something,

363
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,030
you're insane.

364
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:52,599
Yeah, I know

365
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:56,950
-- a lot of time with
-- email. Yeah. Email has to for anti spam and SPF and all that

366
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,849
stuff that,

367
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,440
you know,

368
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,119
and

369
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,270
so, yeah, I mean, if I had any DNS code that was running in an email server context,

370
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,789
man, I,

371
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,280
-- I'd be so paranoid but
-- regardless, regardless it's

372
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:06,872
relevant.

373
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,721
Well, the point is we're still making these mistakes 20 some years later.

374
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:10,271
Well,

375
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:14,642
we're not though because I think if you look at the vast majority of organizations,

376
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:16,091
they've migrated to things like

377
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:21,142
gmail or office 365 or even just running exchange on Prem,

378
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,831
which does suck for its own reasons,

379
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:28,372
but it's still not trying to maintain like your own, you know, UNIX infrastructure.

380
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,601
But like exchanges. I mean, did you read the past

381
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:34,664
of where he tried to patch exchange up to date? Like it's, it's impossible.

382
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:35,984
Oh, my goodness. That was, that was

383
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:40,783
Gussie the dog. He, he started with a version of Microsoft Exchange

384
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:41,984
-- 2000
-- 16.

385
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:45,023
-- Right, and tried to, which
-- is like the second last version,

386
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:45,523
right.

387
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,914
Apply all the Microsoft patches to bring it up to

388
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,283
current patch state and it did not go real good.

389
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:53,583
Let's say we'll put a link in the show notes. It was a travesty for sure.

390
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:54,864
But I, I think this is,

391
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:57,395
it's not surprising if you are a human being

392
00:16:57,546 --> 00:17:02,056
managing servers these days. Like it, it's not better than it was 20 years ago.

393
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,315
It's still terrible.

394
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,234
Oh, it's worse. The complexity.

395
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:10,214
This is fundamentally what the, what the topic today started out as is

396
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:14,984
the real reason we came up with this is because, uh Michael Zaluski, who's what?

397
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:15,656
Cam

398
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:19,156
Tuff on Twitter? Ok. I got that right. I think, I hope I did.

399
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,560
He put,

400
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,180
he had a blog where he talked about infosec stuff and he basically

401
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,280
put a post up that said I'm sick of running this blog.

402
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,550
It's too much work. I'm done.

403
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,760
Right. Follow me on Twitter. Here's my substack.

404
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,479
Well, and he was also pointing out that there's kind of potential for a downside,

405
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,729
significant downside if somebody takes real offense to you

406
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,599
or worse the company does and decides to,

407
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,469
because I've had that happen.

408
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,920
I've had companies threaten me over what I've said publicly,

409
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,314
-- not so much recently back in the day, but,
-- but regardless you get the idea is then,

410
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:48,744
then the discussion curtain I inevitably had is just the

411
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:50,824
fact that like running a mail server running a blog,

412
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:51,594
any of this stuff.

413
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:51,625
It,

414
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,005
it sucks. Like,

415
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,915
like we use uh wordpress for open social Security podcast.com

416
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,150
and I just turned off all the comments because I don't even want to deal.

417
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,969
I don't want to think about it. I don't want to deal with it.

418
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:05,469
Like no comments, you want to comment, you go to Twitter and I'll delete your tweet.

419
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,319
Like I don't care.

420
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,270
You know,

421
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,780
I consistently read the blog of, you know, one of my favorite,

422
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,150
favorite authors and the amount of time he has to put

423
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,079
into with one or two other mods to police and comments.

424
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,619
He has a pretty small relatively sane community and even still he

425
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,229
has to like yellow and red card people and like it's just

426
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,650
-- no, I'd rather go drink a beer and watch TV.
-- This is Charles Strauss, isn't it?

427
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:29,280
Yeah.

428
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,670
Right. Because that's the only blog I know that accepts,

429
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:32,699
doesn't Schneier's

430
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,530
blog accepts comments too. Right?

431
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,530
And I comment there once in a while and,

432
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,050
-- and
-- again, I think he's nuts but whatever.

433
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,229
Well, I I'm pretty,

434
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm pretty sure there's like there's an

435
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,380
approval like you have to be approved because

436
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,729
no, no, because

437
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,010
you don't have to authenticate you just put

438
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,829
in like your name and email address and comments

439
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,869
basically and then like it sits there for a while and then magically shows up later.

440
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,390
So I'm pretty sure it's just manual

441
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,074
approval of everything which like at a certain scale works

442
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,824
-- could be
-- if you're also willing to live with. Latency.

443
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:02,954
Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:06,755
Well, then he's probably paying a service or something to, to deal with this crap.

445
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,234
He's probably, there's probably,

446
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:12,555
I imagine there's people that would be happy to do that for him for free just to,

447
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,114
you know,

448
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,449
given his stature and his kind of just his deal in the universe.

449
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,810
I think that it makes sense.

450
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,280
I mean, it's probably worth it to him to allow comments to his blog.

451
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,260
-- Well, and there's some good comments there, but
-- sure. Sure. Right. Totally.

452
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,819
And so anyway, the point is like,

453
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,699
the point of all this is the conversation curtain I have is just about

454
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:36,619
the fact that like running a lot of this infrastructure these days is horrible

455
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,300
for a million reasons, mostly

456
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:38,964
to

457
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,094
-- quote
-- that one. I'm going to misquote it. But basically they said, like

458
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,415
your project is finally complete when you have

459
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,395
to build like a content moderation system.

460
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:47,344
Right?

461
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:51,055
I've seen, I've seen things like that because I mean, it's funny actually because

462
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,724
I had this discussion with people more than once if you look

463
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,574
at a service like Twitter or Facebook or kind of anything.

464
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,214
And there's always this

465
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:02,454
idea of, oh, we should have this like utopian free speech zone or whatever.

466
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:03,015
And it's like

467
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,680
you have no idea what kind of garbage is going to appear on here.

468
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:09,430
Like you can't just let people do whatever they want,

469
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:14,439
I live in Edmonton and we have like, people on street corners with bullhorns

470
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,750
talking about stuff that is not very nice, let's just say,

471
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,050
and they're out there consistently, like,

472
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,660
even in winter and it's cold out there and

473
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,750
that's a lot more effort than commenting on Twitter.

474
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,189
Right.

475
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,150
And so my point is like,

476
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,439
if somebody will go to a street corner consistently and do stuff like,

477
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,150
they'll probably also hang out on Twitter and say mean things to people.

478
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,439
Oh, totally. Absolutely.

479
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,609
100%.

480
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,910
And, and so,

481
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,660
I mean, the, the content moderation,

482
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,069
I don't want to get into that because that's like a whole another bag of worms.

483
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,390
Content moderation is basically impossible because no matter what you do,

484
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,550
-- it's like
-- spam, right?

485
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:46,400
It's spam.

486
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,790
If you have an audience of one person,

487
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,849
you can probably say something without offending them too much.

488
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,020
10 people. Sure, 100 people, probably 1000 people.

489
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,880
But if you say something to a million people, like,

490
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,420
well, anyways, I can't find the tweet right now, but basically, uh hacks were pan

491
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,150
posted like kind of like,

492
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,849
I like ice cream and then, you know, the replies that they would get are like,

493
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm lactose intolerant that's insensitive of you or like, you know,

494
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,640
ice cream killed my father or ice cream promotes diabetes or like whatever,

495
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,880
whatever, whatever and like,

496
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,949
you can't even

497
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,920
like,

498
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,670
no matter what you say, somebody on the planet will be offended by it

499
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,869
-- definitely
-- circles are round and I bet I just made some mathematician twitch.

500
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,989
I mean, are they? I don't know.

501
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,270
I feel like I'm going to have to do some research on this. They're not square.

502
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,469
-- I'm comfortable saying that. Are they? I guess
-- not, not in our geometry.

503
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,449
-- I don't,
-- I don't know.

504
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,229
-- What is the definition of round? I don't know. Oh,
-- interesting.

505
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,410
A circle is a round shaped figure that has no corners or edges.

506
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,750
Doesn't it have to have at least one edge.

507
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,420
Does it have an edge? I don't know.

508
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,500
I don't know. I don't know.

509
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,599
Well, here's OK.

510
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,260
OK.

511
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,589
-- There's no
-- difference between circle and round.

512
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,369
I'm

513
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:49,569
just,

514
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,900
I'm not going down this hole,

515
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:52,900
-- but that's
-- the

516
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,270
-- point,
-- right?

517
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,800
Like no matter what we say, like the world is round, people are gonna be like, no,

518
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,199
it's an

519
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,020
ate spheroid,

520
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:58,869
you know.

521
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,630
Well,

522
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,670
no,

523
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,199
no,

524
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:04,280
no, I'm pulling us out of this hole and we're talking about

525
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:09,530
the fact that running your own infrastructure is hard and in many cases impossible.

526
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,030
And, and I think sometimes short sighted when I was young,

527
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,410
I ran a lot of infrastructure

528
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,650
and there were two pieces to that. There was a fact that I, I value

529
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,729
the learning I got from it and now I'm

530
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,829
not saying no one should run their own infrastructure.

531
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,660
You will learn a lot if you do this and

532
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,050
I learned an amazing amount about the internet and everything.

533
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,569
But I also recognize that when I was young, I had a lot more free time than I have now.

534
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:35,130
So I was willing to invest hours a week into maintaining my infrastructure.

535
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,849
I don't have hours a week anymore to maintain infrastructure,

536
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,589
which is why I'm happy to just give Google some money

537
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:44,569
and say deal with this crap for me. Thank you.

538
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,160
Well, and I think that's part of the challenge, right?

539
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,170
Is if running infrastructure and doing operations was like doing

540
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,810
new things all the time and only doing new things,

541
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,660
I would 100% be into that.

542
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:59,410
But it's not, it's adding a user deleting a user, adding a user deleting user.

543
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,050
So it's doing repetitive things

544
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,290
that aren't really gonna teach you a lot

545
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,449
when you're running infrastructure for like a company. That is true.

546
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,630
But when I was running my infrastructure, it would be things like, oh,

547
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,040
I'm seeing spam from this domain.

548
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,260
How can I make this spam go away?

549
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:19,020
And I would then do some reading about anti spam and I'd learn about blacklisting.

550
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,739
I learn about Bay

551
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,319
and filtering and whatever.

552
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,290
And I learned a lot from that, right?

553
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,260
-- But
-- like applying patches every first Tuesday of

554
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,449
the month or second Tuesday of the month.

555
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,589
If you run Linux, it's like every day

556
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,550
and that's not super useful. It's just a time sync.

557
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,209
Uh No. OK. I disagree with that though. When I was learning.

558
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,209
-- Well,
-- the first few times you learned something. But then

559
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,510
no, no, II,

560
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,040
I usually learn something because I almost always

561
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,910
broke my server when I applied patches.

562
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,910
Be it a configuration file changed?

563
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,119
Or some library was moved or some crazy hack I

564
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,949
was using suddenly didn't work because they fixed the bug.

565
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,189
I needed like whatever.

566
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,750
And so again,

567
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,829
when it's

568
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,400
view it as a learning experience, I think it has value.

569
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,030
But as an old man who just wants email, it is totally not worth it.

570
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,989
And I think, I mean, you know,

571
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:06,670
Cam

572
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:10,119
is in the same boat where he wants to talk about stuff

573
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,020
and he just doesn't want to deal with the crap anymore.

574
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,270
And he wasn't even running the blog. It was on what blog spot. Right.

575
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,280
-- Yeah. So it was just a matter of like, I'm sick of the crap, I'm
-- out.

576
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,839
And I mean, it's funny because we're doing this podcast and I mean,

577
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:24,390
what's weird to me is we don't actually

578
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,640
get much hate,

579
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,130
which I'm, I'm always a bit shocked by that.

580
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,619
-- Somebody isn't more offended by what we said.
-- Well, there's two pieces to that.

581
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,050
I think

582
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,369
first of all,

583
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:39,729
we are mindful of what we say on purpose because there has been more than one time,

584
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,369
one of us has told the other you can't say that

585
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,300
and then

586
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,530
because it's not live, I fix it later, right?

587
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,849
So there's that angle because there, there have been some doozies

588
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,589
you have to listen to it.

589
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,349
Like you can't just search the internet for it or, you know, it's like,

590
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:58,180
I think that's one of the aspects of the written text piece is like, it's,

591
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:00,579
it's faster to consume and especially things like Twitter

592
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,540
because they're so short, you know, they lack context.

593
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,069
-- Oh, absolutely.
-- I don't know.

594
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,770
Maybe, maybe the people that hate us get bored of listening to us probably

595
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,359
look,

596
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:14,900
there have been people who have sent us many emails explaining why we're wrong.

597
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,839
Well, that's different though.

598
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,180
I'm ok with somebody telling me I'm wrong but just saying I hate you or whatever.

599
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah. No, we've never gotten anything like that.

600
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,540
But even when people say we're wrong,

601
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,459
I try really hard to be like I'm going to

602
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,459
understand this and I do some research and I'll,

603
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,760
I tried to give them a legitimate reply.

604
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,109
That's like here is why we talked about this

605
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,760
the way we did or sometimes we're wrong and we

606
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,750
were the ones,

607
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,869
remember when we didn't check that source on that article about Apple,

608
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,430
we did check the source.

609
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:44,859
It was correct at the time and then it disappeared overnight

610
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,270
because we recorded like on a Wednesday,

611
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,060
we published on a Sunday in the freaking

612
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,270
news article we based our entire said that was

613
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,875
-- some Apple podcast. It was the
-- copyright, the

614
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:55,185
copyright one

615
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:59,194
that was so embarrassing but whatever. But again, OK, here's the deal.

616
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:00,505
Here's a great example.

617
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,194
We screwed that up big time.

618
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,185
And I'll never forget I get, I got some Twitter messages.

619
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,755
I'm like, this can't be right.

620
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:09,925
And I started furiously looking, trying to prove, prove I'm right.

621
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:13,915
Which is a normal human reaction. I'm like, ok, at some point I was like, I got it.

622
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:15,875
I, I'm, we're wrong. Like we screwed this up

623
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,260
and this was like six o'clock in the freaking morning.

624
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,380
I immediately went upstairs to my recording station.

625
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,040
I recorded a new intro that was basically like,

626
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,209
we screwed this up everyone. Sorry about that.

627
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,619
You know, you can listen if you want,

628
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,699
but it's all lies and then I appended the audio file and it's still there.

629
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,859
So anyway, anyway, but that's, that's

630
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,829
regardless, regardless of all this.

631
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:40,939
The,

632
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,880
the other reason I think that we don't get a lot of

633
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,319
hate is we don't have a massive audience like we're talking about,

634
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,349
I think, what do we get? We get most of our episodes first day, 2000 downloads

635
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,869
and then we'll maybe hit 4000 by the end of the

636
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,689
week and then after one week it's like zero functionally.

637
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:56,550
That's hang on

638
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,369
-- a second. What is the math on
-- that? It's not that many. It's not that great. Right?

639
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,060
It's enough. But, and I shouldn't say that that's not 4000 downloads.

640
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,609
That's 4000 unique downloads because

641
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,339
the, the system recently changed how they, they used to measure raw downloads,

642
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:11,609
which our numbers were like amazing.

643
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,829
But obviously some people are downloading it many times.

644
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,219
-- So,
-- so every week we are wasting 2.5 months of people time.

645
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:19,589
I am so proud of us.

646
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,589
We're not wasting OK. Look. OK.

647
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,199
So, so here's another part of this and this is something quite serious.

648
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,079
And I want to like,

649
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,949
like the audience should hear this as well is

650
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,380
every now and then we try to be self deprecating

651
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,060
and

652
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,949
I, I was reading kind of a,

653
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,219
a beginner podcast thing and one of the bits of

654
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,369
advice was don't be too self deprecating and don't,

655
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,199
don't make jokes like,

656
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:40,050
oh no one listens or things like that because there are people listening.

657
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:40,900
And

658
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,339
if you, like, you are doing your audience a disservice by self-deprecating,

659
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,060
you're suggesting they're idiots if they're listening

660
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:48,290
to you and you self deprecate.

661
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,579
So like we do it a little bit because I acknowledge like Kurt

662
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,579
and I are like old and stupid and I'm fine with that,

663
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,979
but it is fun.

664
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,290
-- And we do have, we'll say a wealth of experience that I'm, I love sharing.
-- Well, it's,

665
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:01,209
you know what, it's more that we have a wealth of unique experience.

666
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,349
That's fair because that's most people thank goodness,

667
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,579
will never have to do what we've done.

668
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,680
And you've done some horrible, like we've seen and build some horrible

669
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
stories and,

670
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,520
and luckily a lot,

671
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,319
like there's actually quite a lot of what we do that's just kind of gone now where it's

672
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:18,680
Well, the cloud.

673
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,010
Oh, no. Absolutely. But, but some of it, it's funny

674
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,800
because every now and then, like, a weird thing will happen and, like,

675
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:28,770
I, I understand like, I PV for networking or something and I know how to do, like,

676
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,589
routing and stuff.

677
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,400
People are like, oh, how do you do that? It's like, just don't even ask.

678
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,400
-- It's like
-- the whole Blockchain shenanigans thing.

679
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,829
I'm like, this is just the.com thing 20 years later,

680
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,880
like search and replace Web with Blockchain.

681
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,109
Anyway,

682
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,829
we're in the weeds, we're in the weed.

683
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,020
I want to bring us back so we can end this show at some point in the near future.

684
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:50,260
I guess the question is. So there's kind of two things here doing an activity

685
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,530
typically has an upside. That's why people do it.

686
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,219
That's why they smoke cigarettes and eat sugary foods and stuff.

687
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,540
I want candy

688
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,739
and then there's also potentially downsides and some of them are like,

689
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,829
very long term, like getting lung cancer and some of them are only potential, well,

690
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,859
like getting lung cancer.

691
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,089
But

692
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,439
the thing is especially with this kind of professional writing.

693
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, there's the potential to like,

694
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,410
really stick your foot in your mouth and make people hate you or get, I guess fired.

695
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,000
Even if you say something offensive enough.

696
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:19,000
I think if we think about it in the context of running your own exchange service,

697
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:20,099
right.

698
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:21,280
The, the, there's,

699
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,420
there's obviously upsides if you're doing it one of the upsides might be just,

700
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,680
I can't move, like I've done it for so long.

701
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,400
There's downsides, you know, migrating this stuff is hard

702
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:31,479
and it's not, it's not free.

703
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:31,959
Like, I,

704
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,290
I can't imagine what it would be like

705
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,280
to migrate a reasonably sized infrastructure from,

706
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,349
say on prem exchange to office 365.

707
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,880
It's, there'd be so many problems. I can't even fathom it.

708
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:46,920
It's, um, you basically, uh, you pay Microsoft money

709
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:47,545
to do it

710
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,444
because like, there's no alternative, like

711
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,604
-- that's probably
-- fair.

712
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:53,354
But even then there's gonna be problems and you're the one,

713
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:56,094
if you're the it person in charge, you're the one who gets blamed

714
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:59,045
and you could say it's because Microsoft screwed it up, people are gonna be like,

715
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,875
don't even care, I'm playing you,

716
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:01,785
you know,

717
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:04,045
but coming back to all this, I think,

718
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:05,369
I mean,

719
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,839
one aspect is there's kind of this weaponization

720
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,180
of audiences potentially and weaponization of outrage and,

721
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:11,969
you know, all that,

722
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:12,729
which

723
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,910
honestly is,

724
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,810
it's rare enough that it makes the news kind of thing, right?

725
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:21,780
Like it's actually not super duper common and, but on the flip side, I get,

726
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,810
I honestly, my, my,

727
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:27,369
my personal thought is the majority of this boils down to most people,

728
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,589
you know, they got

729
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,260
other things they want to do with their life and not, you know,

730
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,609
blog or write or do a podcast or whatever, like they wanna

731
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,010
hang out with their kids,

732
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:37,640
which is totally fine.

733
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,239
That's the key, right? Is we all have limited time in our days

734
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,369
and it's a question of what do you actually want to be doing?

735
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:49,920
And this is even true when you're working your day job.

736
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:54,099
Do you want to be patching servers or do you want to be doing something else?

737
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,500
And that's, that's really the question and that,

738
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,880
that's what we all have to grapple with.

739
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,780
And I think that that kind of sums it up

740
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:03,400
is all of this, all of this, you know, running infrastructure,

741
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,910
everything is all about like, what do you actually want to be doing?

742
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,439
In some cases you're going to learn and the

743
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,869
experience is worth it and totally do that.

744
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,319
And don't, don't like, don't feel that

745
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,030
I know there are probably exchange admins

746
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:15,760
that

747
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,560
have friends who give them no end of grief because they're running exchange.

748
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,920
But here's the deal if you want to do it and you like doing it and it's working out,

749
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,680
who cares what they think? Good job for you, you know.

750
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:29,640
But at the same time, you're an exchange admin and you don't wanna be like,

751
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,685
life's pretty short.

752
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,814
I'd go, I'd figure something out, you know.

753
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:36,564
