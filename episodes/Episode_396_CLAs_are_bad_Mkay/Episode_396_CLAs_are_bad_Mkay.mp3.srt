Kurtz Fried and my partner in

9
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,284
the amazing thing that this is

10
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:32,424
Jo

11
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:33,174
Pressers.

12
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:33,834
All right.

13
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,634
So it amuses me that you just read

14
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,735
the text of a computer contributor license agreement

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,529
when this podcast

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,209
is

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,250
Creative Commons licensed.

18
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:48,770
-- It's uh I think ccbys A, you can, what if
-- we need to change that in the future?

19
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,930
And monetize that like we could monetize,

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,020
like we could charge people to train their A is off of this and get

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,159
a

22
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:54,409
super

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,770
smart security A I

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,110
-- that is not a guarantee by the
-- way. OK.

25
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,759
So I can answer this question from the perspective of us,

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,540
we own the copyright on this show,

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,319
-- but you'd have to get my agreement.
-- We technically own the copyright on this show

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,010
and this part gets even more dicey

29
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,360
because you don't publish the show. I publish the show.

30
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:19,519
So

31
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:24,569
I probably own the distribution rights to this podcast,

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,769
which we have an implicit agreement.

33
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:30,970
I would be interested to see how that court case would, would rule out.

34
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:34,959
In fact, I change, I assigned the license to the

35
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:37,769
podcast without your explicit permission as well.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,970
And so

37
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,370
in summary,

38
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,529
nobody knows, but also just, just for reference, uh Kurt is joking there in no way,

39
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,970
our contributor license agreement for this podcast

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,620
to be serious for a moment when somebody,

41
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,339
there are people that send us an email and we're like, oh,

42
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,349
that's an interesting idea.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,819
Or

44
00:01:56,169 --> 00:02:00,760
a bunch of the show is as a direct result of me reading an interesting too.

45
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,019
Or I say something on mascara

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,400
and somebody replies, I'm like,

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,860
oh, this is kind of like messed up and deep and I have no idea. Let's,

48
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,020
that's a show.

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,669
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,740
Like, well, you, you, there have been court cases where somebody's like,

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,529
I came up with the idea for X, you know.

52
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:14,710
Yeah,

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
granted the company did all the work and

54
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:17,940
everything in the heavy lifting and monitor,

55
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,789
you know, blah, blah, blah.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,229
But I want my cut and I

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,550
think in general, the courts have not been very kind to these people.

58
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,179
No, without a patent, you generally have no rights in that regard.

59
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,360
-- Yeah,
-- or a copyright of the content if it's whatever,

60
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,669
if they if you can prove they're stealing your copyright.

61
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:37,589
But, ok, so this is a show about contributor license agreements.

62
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,804
I told Kurt, I wanted to talk about this because

63
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,365
at, at the point in time we are discussing it,

64
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,544
the previous recording was when we discussed the hashy Corp cl A.

65
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:49,845
But this show will not come out immediately after that.

66
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:53,725
Well, it might, I don't know, maybe it will, we don't know, but at some point,

67
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:54,794
this show will come out.

68
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:57,664
And so we thought a contributor license agreement

69
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,425
is an interesting enough topic by itself,

70
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:03,925
-- it's very misunderstood and
-- it is extremely misunderstood.

71
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,044
Like a perfect example is I,

72
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,285
you will see

73
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,490
not necessarily contributor license agreement but because it's not exactly

74
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,089
AC L A but it's similar to AC L A

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,139
in, for example, when you sign up to Facebook or Twitter,

76
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,000
and they say essentially

77
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,759
you have to assign us the right to redistribute and

78
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,399
broadcast your crap because that's what our website does.

79
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,589
-- Well,
-- and that's viewed as an end

80
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,175
-- user license agreement.
-- Right?

81
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:30,024
Ya,

82
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,294
but there's kind of a continuum here where

83
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,445
they're under an end user license agreement,

84
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:38,054
you are assigning certain rights to the company.

85
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:39,634
They're like we,

86
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:42,654
because a great example is the company is like, well,

87
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:46,934
we can't just say we're going to do X with your data because six months from now,

88
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:47,664
there might be

89
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,839
the augmented reality might actually take off, who knows? Right.

90
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,020
Uh

91
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,369
Sorry, spatial computing. Is the new term. Augmented reality is dead.

92
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,289
It's spatial computing. Now, folks,

93
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,300
that's what

94
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:58,580
Apple

95
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,289
and Apple is never wrong. You're holding it wrong. Apple knows best

96
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,490
Apple knows best you're holding it wrong.

97
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,289
And so that's part of it is because for example, as Facebook, I can't

98
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,449
go out and get everybody's permission to like, so I can deploy a new technology.

99
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,729
Right? That's right. You know,

100
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,529
and um there's a, well, a lot of um

101
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:22,509
like Wikipedia, for example, like some day, they might want to print that thing out

102
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:27,820
or put it on tablets and fire them off into outer space. I, I don't know.

103
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,779
And so, you know, by contributing Wikipedia blah, blah, blah,

104
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,579
they get to do whatever it is they want to do with the data.

105
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:34,890
Now, the, the

106
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,489
I think the problem is a lot of people don't understand

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,600
what that means and what it means is at some level,

108
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:45,179
the company has to be able to redistribute your stuff as they see fit

109
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,230
because there's new technologies. But on the flip side, that also means,

110
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,209
well, what about training A I

111
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,010
and large language models? And that's the current thing, Du

112
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,149
Jour

113
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,429
with, you know, Zoom and everybody kind of messing that up.

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,869
And my understanding is the majority of these licenses as they're written,

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,730
never sort of explicitly anticipated this, but they do allow it.

116
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,804
So, OK, there's a lot you just said and some of it's kind of wrong

117
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,845
Well, it, let's start with Wikipedia.

118
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:14,274
So Wikipedia is not and this is, I'm, I just, I just look this up so I don't have the,

119
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,644
the depth of knowledge

120
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:16,774
I would like.

121
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:20,825
But my understanding with Wikipedia is Wikipedia is you aren't

122
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,445
giving them the rights to your content in the.

123
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,005
And so as they own it,

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
you are giving them

125
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:33,029
content licensed by ccbys A which is Creative Commons, share alike,

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,019
meaning content submitted to Wikipedia

127
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,059
is

128
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,640
not owned by Wikipedia.

129
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:44,019
You are technically still the copyright owner, but it also is create, it is

130
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,149
licensed under Creative Commons in a liberal way.

131
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,910
Well, and that gets even messier because for example, that means technically,

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,019
I own one word of the entry for Edmonton on Wikipedia because they, they had it.

133
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,760
Edmonton is dissected by the river of the North Saskatchewan.

134
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,420
I'm not close, it's bisected but good try.

135
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,024
But this is where we get into that Pamela Ches

136
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:03,334
stack

137
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:07,454
blog post on copyright and who owns the copyright, the last person to touch it.

138
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,654
All the contributors we don't know today and

139
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:11,295
we're not gonna talk about that particular,

140
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,894
that's for the lawyers to sort out.

141
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:13,975
Yeah, that too.

142
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,565
I want to talk about cl A specifically because

143
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,174
I think the Wikipedia instance is a good example.

144
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:19,654
We're gonna,

145
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:23,135
we'll run with that for now because I think it's easy for people to understand

146
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,815
and it, it is

147
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,859
not going to be contentious versus some other things

148
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:30,429
Right. Obviously

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,890
famous last words. Right. Of course, of course, I can't wait. But these are,

150
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,519
they could be

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,540
who likes puppies anyway.

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,459
Dogs are the best, by the way,

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,769
like cats, but dogs are the best.

154
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,299
Everyone knows that we're on day seven and inky is si t

155
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,029
once per session without me putting the finger over his head

156
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
to get him to si t like he's getting there.

157
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:54,730
But you can't say the word sit without your cat doing something weird.

158
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:58,130
-- Well, we're training him to do that on command. So yeah.
-- Oh I see.

159
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,519
So you're not whatever. OK? Anyway, that's why I like dogs.

160
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,950
They like that's not hard to do.

161
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,179
-- But
-- we're at, we're at a stage in his training where I need to be careful

162
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,820
and not confuse him, right? I need to be very consistent

163
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,010
-- anyway.
-- OK.

164
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,100
Anyway, so

165
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,739
when we talk about contributor license agreements, right?

166
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,839
There is a big difference between contributing to open source

167
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,109
that has

168
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:24,359
a license, for example, like let's say I contribute content to Wikipedia.

169
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,299
It's covered by ccbys. A

170
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,179
meaning

171
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:32,049
I'm saying these contributions I'm giving to Wikipedia, you are free to use.

172
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,630
This is not something I can go back later and be like, no, I've changed my mind.

173
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,910
I'm taking this stuff back.

174
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,000
It is

175
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,029
content I'm giving them to use with the

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,429
understanding that this will be reused and redistributed

177
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,260
-- in an understood manner, right? Like that's very
-- open source.

178
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,540
And also one critical point

179
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,260
that you have the right to give this contribution

180
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,820
-- for
-- sure, for sure. That's true too. Because

181
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:58,220
when you and this is where that stupid sign off thing you

182
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,100
get with a DC O which is developer certificate of origin,

183
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,100
which that exists funny enough because when

184
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,600
SCO

185
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,690
sued IBM for stealing

186
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:14,654
UNIX and putting it in Linux, which is like the most hilarious flow chart ever.

187
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,154
But

188
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:16,734
basically,

189
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:19,035
the DC O was created as a way to

190
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,515
push liability under contributors and contributors have to say,

191
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:28,565
I pinky swear that I have the rights to contribute this code to the thing.

192
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,915
I'm contributing it to which I'm still skeptical would

193
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,775
hold up in court in any meaningful way.

194
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:34,164
But that's another

195
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,695
really

196
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:37,440
lawyer. I just love it.

197
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,020
-- So I, I don't know, I don't know.
-- Well, but here's the thing, if I use the DC O and it

198
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,969
sheds a bunch of risk for essentially zero money.

199
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,280
Well,

200
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,719
here's the thing. Does it make things worse?

201
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,849
-- It annoys me that I have to remember to use. That's
-- an externalized cost.

202
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:58,190
That's I'm not annoyed. You're annoyed, but I'm ok with you being annoyed.

203
00:08:58,869 --> 00:08:59,989
Like, no, seriously,

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,830
like every time I have to hunt through VS code and find that stupid

205
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:03,715
check box,

206
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:04,784
right?

207
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,174
You know, because every time I contribute to the Os V, I'm like,

208
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:09,734
I forget to do signed off by and then it like bounces back

209
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,304
-- and I'm like,
-- right,

210
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:14,325
right now I have to remember how to do a force push

211
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,284
-- and
-- it's like a one line change to AJ on file.

212
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,044
I don't think

213
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:20,025
I know. I know. OK.

214
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:25,005
So anyway, so now if Wikipedia had a contributor license agreement,

215
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,244
what that would mean

216
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,885
is I would have to sign a thing

217
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,869
that says any contributions I am giving to you, Wikipedia.

218
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:37,299
I am also assigning the copyright of it to you,

219
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,099
meaning

220
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,059
I have no say over what you do with this content after you get it for me.

221
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,440
And so Wikipedia could

222
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:45,200
relic

223
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,760
it.

224
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,280
They could say we're closing Wikipedia up and now you can

225
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,979
only look at Wi Wikipedia for $10 a month or something.

226
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:55,760
And there's literally nothing you could do about that with AC L A now,

227
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,840
even with ccbys A, like they could say we're closing Wikipedia up,

228
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,080
we're charging $10 a month.

229
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,450
But because it's licensed ccbysa,

230
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,510
I could download all of it

231
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:09,085
Wikipedia and be like, I just made a mirror of Wikipedia. Everybody called wi

232
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:09,325
a

233
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:13,495
media or something and everyone can look at it and there's nothing they could

234
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,705
-- do about that because of the license carried on the content
-- and see,

235
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,645
and this leads to a meta topic that we probably shouldn't get into. But

236
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:24,176
I've been talking to people a bunch about copier and why do we care about copyright?

237
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:28,705
And the general answer is we care about copyright because it allows us to

238
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:32,395
enforce our rights and gives us

239
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,632
control of that thing that we created and have copyright over.

240
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,711
But for example, the cloud security lines, a lot of what we create,

241
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,901
we then try to give away as freely and widely as possible

242
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:46,721
or back to my support ticket example, like telling you how to change your password. I

243
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,872
don't really care.

244
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,062
And so what I'm realizing is the

245
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,692
traditional media companies and the traditional companies.

246
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:55,671
Yes, they very much care about copyright because

247
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,122
oh

248
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:56,802
perfect

249
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:59,768
example, Disney is no longer doing physical media in

250
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:01,348
-- Australia. I did
-- see that you said

251
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:01,807
that

252
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:06,088
there will be no more Disney DVD S or Blu Rays in Australia.

253
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,528
It's all gonna be on Disney Plus

254
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:09,127
or

255
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:09,538
whatever,

256
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:10,057
like

257
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,947
it's on Disney Plus but then they license it to somebody else.

258
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,388
So they take it off Disney Plus and so that could happen. No, it could, it does

259
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,648
it happen that there's been movies that just go

260
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:24,038
missing for a while because somebody else licensed it and

261
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,783
oh my God drives my kids nuts and me nuts because I'm my son would literally be like,

262
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,463
I want to watch this and I'm like, yeah,

263
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:32,463
I'm like, it's gone. That sucks.

264
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:35,424
And then I have to go by Paramount plus or like Nickelodeon plus or some other.

265
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,383
-- So
-- this is a perfect example

266
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,184
of

267
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:43,164
when, when one entity is the sole copyright holder of content,

268
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,424
they can literally do whatever they want with it

269
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:48,713
because it is their content and it is up to them and that

270
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:53,573
is fundamentally the purpose of AC L A is you as a developer and

271
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,799
like I know you mentioned Facebook's ya

272
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,390
and whatever. But the cl A and

273
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,229
ya are legally probably the same thing, right?

274
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,260
-- But it is a way for an organization to
-- say it looks like a duck.

275
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:04,719
It looks

276
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,200
like a duck. Probably. I don't know.

277
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,510
It's, I'm assigning a bunch of my rights away like it.

278
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,500
-- If, if
-- there's lawyers listening and there's a difference like let us know, I think

279
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,460
so as a, as a developer, right, I want to contribute code,

280
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,869
I sign AC L A that says I'm giving this

281
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,909
organization permission to do whatever they want with my code.

282
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,679
And of course they pink he swore to me

283
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,090
that they would never relic

284
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,679
the code is something else.

285
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,760
But as we're seeing this is happening more and more often it's not going to stop.

286
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,419
Well, and I think the challenge is again, the way these are written

287
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,919
like this is a real world one for all materials you submit to the blank,

288
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:41,419
you hereby grant the blank and the blank, a perpetual worldwide non exclusive,

289
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,010
no charge, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license

290
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:44,479
too.

291
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,090
And here's the important part that they do care about to reproduce,

292
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:52,030
prepare derivative works of publicly display, publicly perform,

293
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,429
sublicense and distribute such materials and derivative works now

294
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,119
because it's on a website

295
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,929
and maybe some dates on an FTP site or

296
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:00,929
who knows?

297
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,530
But the problem is as this is written,

298
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,349
it means we can also shove this into an A I and build a large,

299
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:10,489
a large language model or we can, they want to turn it into a rap song and like,

300
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,049
make a kajillions dollars off of a cool rap song,

301
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,010
whatever.

302
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,820
And I think that's the,

303
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:21,210
the people are realizing that like, oh, I really signed away my rights.

304
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,280
And

305
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,190
the problem is then when somebody like, has

306
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,340
a

307
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:24,739
corp

308
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,049
does the license switcheroo,

309
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,510
everybody's like, whoa, wait a minute, what? And

310
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,869
you know, I'm always reminded of

311
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,580
if it's not in the contract, it's not in the contract and it's not real.

312
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,900
I was watching, oh the founder, great movie, by the way,

313
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,010
uh Michael Keaton, I have no idea what that even is. It's the founder.

314
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,859
-- It's about the, it's the mcdonald's story.
-- Oh, the mcdonald's movie. I know of it.

315
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:49,570
-- I haven't
-- seen it. Yeah. And Michael Keaton is fantastic.

316
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,820
Like, like just, oh,

317
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,659
the actor is amazing and they basically stay very true to the story.

318
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,460
So they don't embellish it a lot because they don't need to. It's just such a crazy

319
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:57,945
story.

320
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,414
But they basically,

321
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,984
when Ray Croc bought mcdonald's from the mcdonald brothers, right?

322
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:04,424
They mcdonald brothers,

323
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:08,224
like we want 1% of worldwide royalties in addition to the million dollars and blah,

324
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:08,544
blah, blah,

325
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:12,744
and Ray Croc was like, oh man, like my money, people just can't, I can't do that

326
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:13,614
but

327
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,424
we can take it out of the contract and do it on a handshake deal.

328
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,065
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah,
-- they never got their money.

329
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:22,815
-- Shocked. I'm shocked about that
-- because 1% of mcdonald's

330
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,140
like that, that is so much money.

331
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:27,940
Like

332
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,679
those big

333
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:28,960
add

334
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,400
up.

335
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:31,869
So, anyways, but that's the thing, right? Like,

336
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,500
people are realizing, like,

337
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,090
i,

338
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,479
it's like the zoom thing I'm going to pick on zoom.

339
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,380
They changed their terms of service without really warning people that much and

340
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,020
they wrote it poorly. So it sounded like

341
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,260
they could use your material,

342
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,260
your your conversations that were you talking over Zoom

343
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,140
to train a large language model? And people lost their minds.

344
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,479
-- I
-- have a very strong suspicion that was not an accident just for them.

345
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,039
And then they walked it back rather quickly and

346
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,190
said we explicitly won't do this unless you opt in

347
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,059
in the future now.

348
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,739
-- But the point is they can change those terms of service
-- until each and,

349
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,380
and that's the thing.

350
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,090
All of these yah

351
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,859
have basically a thing at the bottom. That's like the

352
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:12,460
escape clause.

353
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,219
Whenever we change this, you automatically agree to what we're changing it to.

354
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,200
So ha ha gets

355
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,880
too bad.

356
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,380
So I feel bad for companies like Zoom because companies like Microsoft Google,

357
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,450
all those guys, they have a copy of the web,

358
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,659
they can train off of cool a company like Zoom does not not yet anyways,

359
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:34,080
people are realizing that these licenses are like they have power,

360
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:36,820
-- they, they matter,
-- they do. And I think

361
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,179
if you look at the history of open source, there were,

362
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,340
there have always been contributor license agreements in

363
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,510
place like the free software foundation has one,

364
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:48,570
lots of open source projects, have them, lots of companies had them.

365
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,169
I will, I will give Red Hat credit for this.

366
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,650
Red Hat has never used AC L A to my knowledge.

367
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,380
Well, I shouldn't say that I'm sure they have projects, but generally speaking,

368
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,460
Red Hat was not focused on cl A content whereas

369
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,919
I, I think canonical might have been for

370
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,960
ubuntu if I'm remembering correctly. So,

371
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,200
and, and, and here's the thing many years ago. No one worried about this.

372
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,750
-- Uh
-- Canonical. Absolutely does have AC L A. They do have

373
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:11,619
AC L A. OK?

374
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,880
And one thing I'm just going to point out

375
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,159
you can almost never say Red Hat doesn't do X because Red Hat is so big and,

376
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:21,919
and has done like everything like Red Hat has shipped

377
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,609
uh closed source binary,

378
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,080
-- commercial software, real player.
-- Yo. Remember real player

379
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:28,929
or

380
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,809
like they,

381
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,950
they bought a company and stapled the Red hat logo onto the software and shipped it.

382
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,390
Oh

383
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,099
And then we but open

384
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,090
sourced it later on. But that takes time.

385
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,760
You can't just, it takes time to open

386
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:40,919
source stuff. Trust me, folks. If you

387
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,250
-- and I
-- remember the,

388
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,380
-- the KVM product.
-- Yeah, I was

389
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,130
that's the one

390
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:50,955
ran on Windows server when they bought it, which was an amusing lull as well.

391
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:55,224
And it's like, I mean, now it doesn't, but like, people seem to sort of expect, oh,

392
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:55,395
it's,

393
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,364
you can just change the code and fix it and it's

394
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,244
like it's gonna take more than a week or two.

395
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:01,804
It's a little, it's a little more work than that. But, but anyway,

396
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:05,973
I just got to read this story. I have to read this at Canonical. We manage a lot of open

397
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:06,723
source projects.

398
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,760
This is true

399
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,189
and we're required to have agreements with everyone who takes part in them.

400
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,680
It's the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions in

401
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,780
effect, you're giving us a license but you still own the copyright.

402
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,608
So you retain the right to modify your code and use it in another project.

403
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,250
Technically,

404
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,689
everything is true.

405
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,109
Several upstream projects require all contributors to agree

406
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,760
to the rules for inclusion of their code.

407
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,859
We encourage ubuntu members to support those

408
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,680
when working with UPSTREAM on contribution of patches

409
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,229
back to those projects or direct contributions.

410
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,410
Well, obviously, if you're going to contribute to a project that requires AC L A

411
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,189
and you don't sign the CL A, you're not gonna get to contribute.

412
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:44,709
Right.

413
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,839
Like, right. Right.

414
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:46,520
So anyways,

415
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,300
for most projects that Canonical,

416
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,650
the preferred approach is a wide license rather than an assignment of ownership.

417
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,469
So that, that's the, the less evil, the good part

418
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,540
and the agreements are documented below

419
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,229
other projects take their own view,

420
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,469
but we typically recommend supporting their preferred approach

421
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,189
to contributing and licensing whatever that might be.

422
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,449
And see, that's the challenge with canonical is even if canonical is like,

423
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,310
we hate CLAS, we don't want to do CLAS.

424
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,680
Well, they have to ship software that has

425
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,430
like c

426
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,125
there's just, there's open source stuff that you can't, not ship

427
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,285
there doesn't

428
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:17,525
mean they need AC LA,

429
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:18,255
I mean de

430
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:20,005
and doesn't have AC L A. Right.

431
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,984
-- Well,
-- but the thing is if you're going to contribute to a bundu

432
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,234
fork of law,

433
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,135
they're gonna wanna upstream that.

434
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,885
So they're going to need you to sign the CL A so they can contribute back upstream,

435
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:30,444
right?

436
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:34,165
-- They need the rights to your work to push it back upstream. You,
-- you might be right.

437
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:35,844
But this feels very obtuse.

438
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,175
Well, the, the point I'm trying to make though is

439
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,604
it's not

440
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,979
a company like ubuntu doesn't necessarily want to do Clas,

441
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,750
but it's part of the legal reality of, well,

442
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,229
there's all these projects that do CLAS that we need

443
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,670
to ship and we need to update and interact with.

444
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,130
I'm not a lawyer

445
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,839
but lots of other Linux distributions use software with CLAS

446
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,329
that don't

447
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,130
have you sign AC L A

448
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,469
-- true
-- and maybe they're not as aggressive about contributing back to

449
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,729
them or maybe to put it simply they're not evil.

450
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:10,250
-- Who knows?
-- And I don't know that canonical is evil or not.

451
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,969
I, I don't think they're evil because

452
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,609
-- if they were evil they'd probably be richer. Like Oracle.
-- That's probably fair.

453
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,810
-- Anyway,
-- like Oracle is famous for having a contributor license agreement.

454
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,530
-- They don't just have clas, they have, like, the Dewitt Clause is from Oracle.
-- Right.

455
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:32,010
That's the one where you can't publish benchmarks of the software.

456
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,050
Yeah. They,

457
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,250
well, they didn't invent it but they definitely made it

458
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,939
-- popular.
-- They pretty much,

459
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,550
yeah, they made that a thing.

460
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,650
But, but anyway, Clas, right.

461
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:41,660
Ok.

462
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,369
So after we've gotten ourselves a bit off track, we'll say fundamentally right,

463
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,829
early days of open source clas existed,

464
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,869
people at canonical had them and no one thought a lot about them.

465
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,119
I mean, I remember signing Clas for various projects

466
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,430
and it was like, whatever, no big deal. That's fine.

467
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,329
There's not a ton of money in this stuff like,

468
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,739
well, they're probably, no, no, there wasn't at the beginning.

469
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,859
That's fair until you get bigger.

470
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,660
Like let's be real elastic search prior to version one.

471
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,910
Yeah. Whatever. It's a neat little search thing.

472
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,270
Right. Right. For sure. For sure.

473
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,040
Engine

474
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,609
X,

475
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,640
I remember Engine

476
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,949
X from before. It was cool. And a big company

477
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
didn't, doesn't Cisco own Engine

478
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,319
-- X
-- now F five, bought in

479
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,219
2019

480
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,219
-- for 670 million U. Si.
-- Mean, that's respectable.

481
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,359
That's some real money.

482
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:28,250
I

483
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,400
know.

484
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:28,819
Right.

485
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,540
That's a lot of money.

486
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:31,390
Good for them.

487
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:35,109
But. Right. Does Engine X have AC LA? I bet they do.

488
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,949
Oh, I would

489
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,189
think better.

490
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,920
In fact, they probably do because I, I suspect you would struggle to sell

491
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,449
a project such as that without AC L A.

492
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,109
Well, the challenge is if you don't have a contributor license agreement,

493
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:50,699
you can never relic

494
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:51,810
the darn thing.

495
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,140
And that's kind of seen as, as

496
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,500
companies don't necessarily want to do that,

497
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,109
but they definitely want the option of doing it right.

498
00:20:59,119 --> 00:20:59,560
You know,

499
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,300
and so, uh I don't know that I, I'm Googling engine

500
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,170
X contributor license agreement and they don't,

501
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,400
-- it's not popping
-- up. Maybe they don't. And if they don't, I think that's cool too.

502
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,599
I think it's phenomenal if you can get away with that.

503
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,010
But anyway, OK.

504
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,680
So the point is,

505
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,560
-- so why do companies like CL
-- A S gives them

506
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,839
the perception of control and the option of control?

507
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:22,939
It does the option. I don't think the perception is necessarily important

508
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:24,160
because here's the thing,

509
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,819
if you have an open source project without AC L A,

510
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,880
but you are the like primary owner of the github

511
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,010
repository,

512
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,079
you are in control of that project. If people send you fixes

513
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,290
and obviously when they send you fixes,

514
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,670
it's understood that whatever their patches are will

515
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,140
be covered by the license the project uses,

516
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,250
be it Apache two or GP L or whatever you send them a fix, your patch goes in,

517
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,599
but they they could say no, I don't want this.

518
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,199
I mean, this happens all the time, right?

519
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,839
Where someone will send a patch to a project and the project is like, absolutely not.

520
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,300
I mean, just go look at the Lyonel

521
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,339
mailing list.

522
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,040
I mean, that's fair. But a

523
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,170
better example might be

524
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:07,760
you have a company with an open source project and they have like

525
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,709
an open core add on or a commercial add on or whatever.

526
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,479
And if you submit a patch to the open source that tramples on their commercial value,

527
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:17,489
they're gonna be like no way we're not taking this

528
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:20,030
and that happens literally all the time, right?

529
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,050
You can run that project without a contributor license agreement. It just means

530
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:29,650
the source code in your project is viewed as being owned by all of the contributors,

531
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,040
even if you contribute

532
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,569
99% of the source code,

533
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,209
it's viewed as

534
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,810
having other contributors as like the copyright owners, right?

535
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,339
And so that means

536
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,520
if you're looking for investment or to sell your company or whatever

537
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,469
the investors are gonna be like,

538
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,300
you don't own your source code

539
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:52,630
and it's complicated. I know, but that's going to be the discussion that comes up.

540
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,079
-- I hate to say it really depends on what that source code is and does because for
-- sure,

541
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,959
-- for sure
-- some things are

542
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,510
more infrastructure, some things are more niche,

543
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:01,880
you know,

544
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:02,589
it

545
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,430
and some things lend themselves to being as a service and some things don't.

546
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,750
That's right. Exactly. Exactly. It's, it's a complicated discussion.

547
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,430
But now if I'm a company

548
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,790
and I have AC L A

549
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,810
I own every contribution to that software,

550
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:20,619
I am the sole unquestioned copyright owner of the software.

551
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,609
If I want to relic

552
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,550
it, if I want to close it,

553
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,300
I can do anything I want, I could sell that project to Oracle

554
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,310
and that's just the way it is. Yeah.

555
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,744
And I think historically, that has not been a concern people had.

556
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,125
Well, yeah, 20 years ago,

557
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:39,155
nobody would have bought a web server for $670 million.

558
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:39,454
Exactly.

559
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,994
That's what I mean by. There's no money there back in the day.

560
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,344
-- Like, well, there wasn't.
-- Exactly.

561
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:43,755
I

562
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,834
remember redhead going public and its valuation was a

563
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:47,905
-- lot.
-- But,

564
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:50,204
yeah, for a week

565
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:50,944
and then,

566
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,425
like, and what blows my mind is Engine X is

567
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:55,385
like, I don't want to say it's a one trick pony. But

568
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:57,660
I mean, it's a good web server but

569
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:01,239
-- it's a good web server. Like, come on. There's
-- no, no, here's the thing.

570
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,709
Name, three web servers. Kurt, I bet you can name two

571
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:04,060
Apache

572
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:05,300
and jxiis.

573
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,930
-- What
-- is, is, oh, that's a Microsoft. One name. Three open source web servers.

574
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:14,160
The is, doesn't count. I forgot that even existed. To be honest with you. H A proxy,

575
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,079
I don't, is H a proxy web server. Yeah,

576
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,949
-- it has a web server.
-- That's fair.

577
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:19,140
You know what I mean,

578
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,069
-- yeah, I agree. I agree. And to be
-- honest, engine

579
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,739
X has captured the mind share, for sure.

580
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,819
I've been a long time Apache user and I've been a long time engine X user. And if I had

581
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,189
to pick one to actually deploy and care and feed for,

582
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,099
I would pick engine

583
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,229
-- X,
-- I haven't run Apache

584
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:40,630
in probably 15 years. Everything I do is Engine X now because it's just so much easier

585
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,280
the config files along

586
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:48,140
and not just that when I need to do something weird, like if I need a reverse proxy,

587
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:52,175
whatever, like if you search for the engine X configuration, it's like,

588
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:56,015
oh these two lines do it and then you're like, I search for the Apache configuration.

589
00:24:56,025 --> 00:25:01,135
They're like this zip file contains all of it. It's like, holy crap. What is this?

590
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,135
Well, and then there's all the out of date answers but back anyways rabbit hole. So

591
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:06,964
I,

592
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:07,739
I

593
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:09,329
think part of the challenge is

594
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,250
is it's, it's

595
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,140
one of those things where a lot of this ran on gentlemen's agreements

596
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,270
for sure.

597
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,260
And

598
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,180
that

599
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,459
works

600
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,680
until it doesn't.

601
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,880
And then when it doesn't work well, I'm sorry. But the contract says X

602
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,660
and I think, I think you also like a good example of this is historically speaking,

603
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,150
you would have something like GP L, right?

604
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,099
And you'd have a handful of people who violated it. And then

605
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,500
there were a handful of court cases.

606
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,619
I mean, I remember the first couple of GP L court cases where we were like,

607
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,140
is it gonna stand up in court?

608
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,060
-- Like, is this gonna
-- work? Can you actually use copyright to do this?

609
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:45,439
Right.

610
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:48,300
And like, we didn't know and it did so far it stood up.

611
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,670
But like there are,

612
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,130
there are still instances where people violate the GP L and I bet in 80%

613
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,859
-- of the cases they probably get away
-- with

614
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:57,760
-- it
-- more like 99% of the cases.

615
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,939
Because if you look at iot,

616
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,630
-- no, look
-- at IOT, that's probably fair. There's a

617
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,310
lot of iot that

618
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,790
there

619
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,209
is

620
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,329
and the thing is, there's just,

621
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,670
there aren't these massive corporations behind these projects

622
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,819
with tons of money trying to defend this.

623
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,660
And that's part of, to me, the beauty of this is because we've commoditized and,

624
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,180
and put this so far into the utility category.

625
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,959
There's not a lot like there's no money in Auck and Grep and said, but

626
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:27,839
like if those tools cease to exist, I would cry and drink for a week,

627
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:29,319
but no one's paying for them either,

628
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,390
like for sure,

629
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,510
I would probably pay for them because I really rely on

630
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,770
because you're a weirdo but no one else would. But anyway,

631
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,680
so

632
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,119
I think

633
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,050
this is what kind of makes it different is, is a lot of open source.

634
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,699
People, people recognize

635
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:51,069
that some of these licenses come with rules and, and you know,

636
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,609
things demands that are made on the user.

637
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:58,010
And as that is discovered, I think legally, companies start saying like, OK,

638
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,380
we need to understand what we have what's going on

639
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,619
versus the CL A is I think the opposite of that,

640
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,650
this is where the developers need to say, all right,

641
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,800
we need to understand what's going on and what's happening.

642
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,290
And I,

643
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,150
I have no doubt

644
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,050
that the, the age of the CL A

645
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:18,750
is going to end because no one is going to contribute to a project that has

646
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,719
AC L A at some point in the near future just because they keep getting screwed.

647
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:26,849
The thing is if the project succeeds and becomes Monetti

648
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:27,790
Zable,

649
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,959
then it kind of has to push the cl A button if they have that button available to them

650
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,010
because

651
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,369
you can't tell people like, oh,

652
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,540
we could totally make $100 million off the software

653
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,819
or sell it to F five for $670 million.

654
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,329
But like we're not going to, you're right, you're going to be deposed.

655
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:44,900
No.

656
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,900
What I'm trying to get at is somebody is going to see that potential value

657
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,099
and go,

658
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,180
I want to take that

659
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:53,130
and

660
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,650
they might like

661
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,479
open source projects have been kind of hijacked in the

662
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:00,310
past because they have value some of them for sure.

663
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,650
You know, and, and this is what I'm getting at. There's those incentives of,

664
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,699
you can't leave a half billion dollar pile of money.

665
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:10,209
-- Sitting there without expecting somebody to take a crack at it.
-- Well, ok.

666
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:14,930
No, let me, let me rephrase this. I think you have the right idea.

667
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:18,569
But I think how you got there is wrong engine X

668
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,250
isn't source code.

669
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:23,709
Engine X is a community of knowledge that was

670
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,930
built around a project that shares the same name.

671
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,239
Yeah.

672
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,540
And I think that's the thing people often don't understand is they

673
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,589
equate engine X equals source code like we need source code.

674
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,050
But the reality is the source code is irrelevant.

675
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,729
It's the fact that the engine X name is very recognizable. It has a good brand.

676
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,800
You can go and just type like engine X reverse proxy into any web search on the planet.

677
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:47,969
Heck,

678
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,060
I bet you can ask chat GP T and it would tell you the

679
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,859
answer without issue because there are so

680
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,699
-- many documents already explaining this so
-- well.

681
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:55,859
Uh

682
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,380
the way I see this is and the source code is relevant, but it's

683
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:04,165
1% of the ecosystem and what you want is the ecosystem. Right. Right.

684
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:09,444
For example, that's why. So I needed some GP US to run A I on my workstation here

685
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,084
and I picked NVIDIA because C A

686
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:11,714
because C

687
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,285
is popular and it just,

688
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,755
there's so many guides and

689
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:15,435
like

690
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:15,775
there's

691
00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:16,515
like

692
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,959
I, I literally seriously considered intel cards

693
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,160
because they are sort of, they're,

694
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,479
they're better bang for the hardware buck.

695
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,959
But the software ecosystem and the

696
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,439
people ecosystem.

697
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:32,300
It's like seven people compared to the NVIDIA ecosystem, which is

698
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,959
-- everybody for the last 20 years, except
-- with NVIDIA cards,

699
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,400
you have to install their horrible drivers on Linux.

700
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:41,449
-- I'm running
-- windows. Oh, you are?

701
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,979
-- That's
-- the trick

702
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,689
windows. 11 plus

703
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:45,944
to drivers

704
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:46,244
running

705
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:46,435
the

706
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:46,915
windows. Subsystem

707
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:47,625
for Linux.

708
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:48,375
There's

709
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:48,555
a

710
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:51,094
ton of tutorials out there because it just works.

711
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:51,854
That's fair.

712
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,165
-- I mean, I'll accept
-- that.

713
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:53,925
I spent like,

714
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:56,555
an hour getting it working and 30 minutes of

715
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,464
it was wasted reading out of date tutorials.

716
00:29:58,474 --> 00:29:59,895
Then I was like, oh, this is dumb.

717
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:02,545
I'm just gonna do it my way, which is try and get it working.

718
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,145
Read the error message, fix the error message,

719
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,145
repeat it like three times and it worked.

720
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:07,104
I mean, if you were on Linux,

721
00:30:07,194 --> 00:30:09,604
you would have spent three hours getting their drivers installed

722
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,854
one anyways. But so back to this is

723
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,119
the

724
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,520
in general there, there is some value in the source code, but there's

725
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,199
far more of the values in that ecosystem. Like, can I get help for this?

726
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,160
Is there answers for this that are up to date?

727
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,550
Like Apache is a great example of this. When you search for Apache, how to things,

728
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,540
you'll get a ton of answers for like a patch of 2.2

729
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,530
which is so hilariously old and out of date,

730
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,660
it's the opposite of helpful and

731
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,569
yeah, you know, and so anyway, sorry to backtrack of it.

732
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,849
Part of it too is licenses are an expression of the culture of that software

733
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,040
even going so far as to

734
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:52,189
uh one thing I never really understood for a long time was GP L versus BS D.

735
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,000
And then I realized the GP L and BS D view

736
00:30:56,239 --> 00:31:01,239
the end user differently in the GP L. The end user is the end user

737
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:03,880
in the BS D. The end user is the developer.

738
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,199
Yeah, I won't disagree with that.

739
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,920
And when I figured that one out, I'm like, oh, this totally makes sense now,

740
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,520
I get sure,

741
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,000
sure.

742
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,859
And

743
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,280
this is something

744
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,560
where again, having the cl A

745
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,520
gives you the option of making changes.

746
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,520
OK?

747
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,180
I want to take this home in one last push

748
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,500
and this will give everyone something to think about

749
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,170
and we are not going to answer this today.

750
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,229
So don't you dare try to go down this rat hole?

751
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:30,900
But

752
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:36,189
AC LA I truly believe is a response to open source

753
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,890
not keeping up with the current just environment around it.

754
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,020
I think all of our open source licenses

755
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,310
are from 20 plus years ago

756
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:49,119
and it was a very different world. And so while I don't like cl a si understand

757
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,540
the idea and intent behind them.

758
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:55,599
And so I think what we actually need is we need like Bruce Perens,

759
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,199
I'll try to dig up his talk, Bruce Perez.

760
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,260
Oh,

761
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,729
I have bad news for you.

762
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:01,099
The GP LV two is over 30 years old now.

763
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:04,390
Yeah. I, I, right for sure. Like, they're, they're all ancient.

764
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,199
Like Bruce Perens has a nice talk where he kind of talks about some, like,

765
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,869
what does the future of open source licensing need to look like?

766
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,270
And of course he, he doesn't have any money or, or people working on this.

767
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,430
So it's, it's not going anywhere at the moment.

768
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,949
I, I remember I sent him some messages about it and he was basically like,

769
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,589
do you know anyone who wants to fund this?

770
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,939
And I was like, sadly, no,

771
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,670
but

772
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:28,290
I think that is the thing we need to think about things like the CCLAS are hammers.

773
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,579
You know, we're trying to put in,

774
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,140
we're trying to screw in a screw with a hammer is what we're doing.

775
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,459
It's,

776
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:37,329
I think it goes past that these, these software licenses were written for a world

777
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,410
that doesn't exist in it

778
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:43,010
and it's not just that there's new things like cloud and as a service

779
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,989
and a I trying to gobble up all the data to train stuff but

780
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,300
the software problems we were trying to solve. Like, yeah, open

781
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,219
source one. We're good. Yeah,

782
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:51,229
exactly.

783
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,989
But the thing is, I,

784
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,459
I don't know that it could have won without these licenses

785
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:57,305
and without CLAS to get us along the way 100%.

786
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:02,025
But here's the trick is in some ways we're really stuck with them because,

787
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:03,354
like, the, you can't relic

788
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:06,775
the Linux kernel at this point and you can't not live with the Linux kernel.

789
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,795
-- So like, what do you do?
-- Well, that's fine.

790
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:11,405
I think there are certain things that are different,

791
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,685
but I still think that for

792
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:18,474
new upcoming organizations, I mean, we talked about this in that,

793
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:20,724
that the hashy Karp episode where like start ups

794
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:22,685
are using open source as their marketing wing.

795
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,900
And so you end up with this like just bizarre usage,

796
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,890
like we need open source licenses that reflect what's happening

797
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,180
in the universe around them and we don't have that.

798
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,699
And I think that is like my whole ending point of all of this

799
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,810
is CLAS are

800
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,589
as open source licenses abused copyright.

801
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,119
CLAS abuse open source licenses when the correct answer is,

802
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:49,060
and this probably is partially copyright needs to evolve,

803
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,050
partially open source licenses need to evolve.

804
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,739
Like there's a lot of moving parts

805
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,930
and we certainly aren't going to fix this.

806
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,390
But it is something

807
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,859
that I would love to see movement on and I

808
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:02,310
don't see anyone really doing anything meaningful in this space.

809
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,560
If there is someone let us know because I would absolutely love to learn about it.

810
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:05,869
Well,

811
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,949
and one challenge is these existing open source licenses allow people

812
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,989
to abuse them in ways to monetize them and get away with

813
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,429
-- basically murder. In some cases,
-- I don't think it's abuse, it's just how it works.

814
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,270
Why

815
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,550
would I want to fix that? I mean, and as a start up.

816
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,510
I don't

817
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:26,436
have a million dollars to spend on legal fees to create a good new license.

818
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:27,895
-- No,
-- no one's creating new licenses.

819
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:32,114
You need to use existing licenses and, and I think many start ups would gladly

820
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:36,125
use a more business friendly license. That,

821
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:37,746
because look at the same time,

822
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,976
like I'm sensitive to the fact that there are large

823
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,835
companies strip mining the crap out of open source.

824
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:44,855
And I don't like that either.

825
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:47,135
And that's kind of what we want though because I don't want

826
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:50,065
the reinventing crappy web services that are full of security flaws,

827
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,362
complicated, right?

828
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:54,721
It, it, there's commodity and then there's interesting things, but all right,

829
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:57,461
I'm going to call this one here and this is just food

830
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,681
for thought and we will no doubt revisit this topic many,

831
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,961
many times in the future because that's not going away.

832
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:03,802
So, thank you, Kurt.

833
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:06,882
Thank you everyone for listening. Go to open source security podcast.com.

834
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:07,731
Hit up the show notes. Yi

835
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:11,562
Pound O says podcast hashtag on Mastodon to get our attention.

836
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:15,441
-- Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.
-- You too. Thanks everybody. Thanks

837
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:15,922
everyone.

838
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,052
Bye bye.
