Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 53 with myself,

1
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,640
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:15,039
-- Josh
-- Presser. Thought Crime. That's very clever. Well done, sir.

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,760
Well, just technically we've been admitting to felonies for the last 52 episodes.

4
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:21,379
My partner in crime

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,620
partner in crime, I understand

6
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,379
your crime. It doesn't necessarily have to be a felony.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,020
Well,

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,219
I just over the weekend I learned a

9
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,489
lot about various indictable offenses and what not.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,669
So it's, uh, I like to avoid admitting to anything I should or haven't,

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,990
definitely haven't done.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,599
I see, I see that that's

13
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:39,590
fair. I can totally understand that.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,380
And, and I'm a huge fan of

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,400
not telling people anything they don't need to know.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,520
In fact, it's always funny because

17
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,349
whenever my wife and I have like a business dealing

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,599
or something or like buying a car or whatever,

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,159
she's very willing to give up information

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,159
without being prompted for it. And I was like,

21
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,639
stop, stop telling them those

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,200
things, you know, they don't need to know that.

23
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,409
And she thinks I'm some sort of paranoid nut,

24
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,069
which

25
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,589
probably because I'm some sort of paranoid nut Yeah.

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,680
Yeah, I actually got that comment from one of the other parents at school today.

27
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,019
That's when, you know, you're doing good.

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,279
Yeah. So, anyway, so some, there's a,

29
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:22,029
there's been an interesting development in, I guess, flight software.

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,120
Yes. And you promised to explain all of this to me and I have no idea what's going on.

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,040
So I will let you take it from here.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,209
Ok. So I'm a classic, like, armchair aviation is,

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,919
I guess, is the word aviation

34
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,839
enthusiast. Yeah, there we go.

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,650
Um,

36
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,819
so I'm probably basically wrong about everything I'm going to talk about right now.

37
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,040
But having said that so traditionally, uh there's a concept

38
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:51,519
in software and security in general called security through obscurity,

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,930
which basically is to say

40
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,010
that by keeping something secret, it'll help make it more secure.

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,569
And

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,900
a lot of people hate this principle

43
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,199
-- and a lot of people like
-- this principle, it doesn't work.

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,620
Let's just say that.

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,120
Ok.

46
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:11,070
-- Well, at least in software security, it doesn't work security
-- through obscurity,

47
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:14,690
really doesn't work if you can't change the secret.

48
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,509
So for example, you have a password, the password must be

49
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,570
secret, right? If somebody knows the password, they can log in as you.

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,839
But with a password typically, you can change it very quickly and easily.

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,860
Obviously, software is like at the opposite end of the easy to change spectrum,

52
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,410
you know,

53
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,330
if, if you're trying to keep your software uh

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,830
secure and un viewed

55
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,110
uh while the second it becomes exposed, uh you know, it's going to take you days,

56
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,520
weeks, months, years, decades to rewrite the whole thing.

57
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,779
So, it's just basically, it's not possible really, in most cases,

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:49,740
you know,

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,440
I don't even,

60
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,029
I don't even think it's that as much as I think there's, I, I, I've seen two

61
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,839
kind of attitudes here is you've got encryption

62
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,279
where people would say if you don't know the algorithm,

63
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,639
how could you possibly crack it?

64
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:08,020
And actually if, if you do any sort of research and encrypt analysis, uh yeah, that,

65
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,619
that doesn't matter because they have ways to do this.

66
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:11,800
And then,

67
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:13,690
-- and
-- that's the public stuff we know about.

68
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,399
Right.

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,919
It's anyway.

70
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,419
And then, then there's

71
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,679
the kind of I'm going to keep my source code a secret.

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,550
So the bad guys can't find bugs in it. And I think

73
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,690
the history of windows is kind of the,

74
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,479
the body ridden path that proves that does not work.

75
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,960
-- Right.
-- Well, the reality is there's a lot of security flaws that are trivial to find.

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,669
I mean, cross site scripting is a great example, right?

77
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:42,399
You just plug in random wonky values and uh Boop comes a javascript alert.

78
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,250
That's true. And you generally don't have access to that source code.

79
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,479
Well, look at what Tavis has done, you know,

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,149
he was fuzzing Windows defender software and

81
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,910
he apparently got tired. It was very slow on windows.

82
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,929
So he actually ported it over to Linux.

83
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,199
Uh, we'll,

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,089
we'll include show notes to that because I don't even want to try and explain that.

85
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,440
Uh, it makes my head hurt when I think about it.

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,699
And, um, so, yeah, he's fuzzing Windows Defender on Linux machines and, you know,

87
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,580
he's found,

88
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,080
uh,

89
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:10,570
I think there was just a new article on the

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,919
register with him mentioned from yesterday or the day before.

91
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:14,830
Yeah.

92
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:19,970
Yeah, he just released, I think two days ago from when we're recording this, his,

93
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:24,429
-- his latest Windows defender security problem.
-- Exactly.

94
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,100
So, like, yeah,

95
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:29,230
clearly you don't need access to the source code to find really nasty flaws.

96
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,730
Um,

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,390
and on the flip side, however, I wouldn't say that, like,

98
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,250
just because you're open source means everybody's going to like, look at your code,

99
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,459
find the flaws and fix them.

100
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:42,850
And that was uh Eric Raymond coined the term Linus's law,

101
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:46,559
which was what with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow and that, uh,

102
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,290
that law is false,

103
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,940
right? That, that is not a law.

104
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:51,170
The trick

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,399
is

106
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,029
nonsense.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,850
Well,

108
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,220
the problem is people have to know that they're looking for bugs and quite honestly,

109
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,200
most of us don't have time to go looking for bugs.

110
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:00,769
-- We, we're so busy like fixing stuff or
-- even the

111
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:02,204
man, I mean,

112
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:06,524
this actually came up just the other day at work where someone basically said, oh,

113
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:07,315
look what I found.

114
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,325
And I said that's a security issue because of this, this you know,

115
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:11,524
and then I laid out what,

116
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:14,975
what would happen and it was a very complicated process and they're like, oh, crap.

117
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:18,665
I said, you know, security guy ruins it again, you know.

118
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,434
Never fails.

119
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:21,075
Yeah.

120
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:22,834
Yeah. So,

121
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:26,214
I, so, yeah, the reality is, um,

122
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,065
I think if you're heavily relying on security through obscurity,

123
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,765
you're probably gonna have a bad time

124
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,350
because quite frankly, the bad guys generally don't need to see it.

125
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:38,200
-- Even the good guys
-- don't. Yeah, exactly.

126
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:43,170
Um And the flip side too is, is at some point, you know, everything leaks eventually.

127
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,109
That's true. And that's another story

128
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,410
we can get to after you tell me all about

129
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,410
this airplane because I actually really want to know.

130
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,019
Yeah.

131
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,489
So, ok, so basically, uh apparently

132
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:56,480
in a pro

133
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,570
this is off of Bru's

134
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,529
blog.

135
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,410
Uh So in a proposed rule by the FAA, it argues that the software in an ors a model E RJ,

136
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,140
that's a uh what does it stand for something?

137
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,010
Regional jet

138
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,170
enterprise, regional jet, whatever

139
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,429
uh model 1 90-300 airplane is secure because it is proprietary. So to quote,

140
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,089
in addition,

141
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,709
the operating systems for current airplane

142
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,079
systems are usually and historically proprietary.

143
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,255
Um And I suspect that's more true for like legal reasons than, and actual like,

144
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:24,654
you know,

145
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,695
security reasons realistically, um you know,

146
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,815
you don't want your competitors to see your special sauce, right?

147
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:32,415
Airbus versus Boeing.

148
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,234
Uh Anyways,

149
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,505
therefore, they are not as susceptible to corruption from worms,

150
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,214
viruses and other militias actions

151
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:40,345
as are.

152
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:44,584
Well, and of course, I hope to, goodness sake,

153
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,954
none of these are running on Windows XP.

154
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,829
No, they're, they're not actually.

155
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,380
So this part I do know something about because

156
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,950
I've had dealings with the FAA in the past is

157
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,190
when you write software to run on airplanes.

158
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,350
Now,

159
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,529
there's a huge difference between software that runs on

160
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,329
the ground and software that runs in the air,

161
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,540
the stuff on the ground,

162
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,059
there's a bit more leeway and you can

163
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,279
start getting into general purpose operating systems.

164
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,489
But the stuff that's in the air, basically, it has to be,

165
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,809
it, it has to be custom written

166
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,450
because you have to be able to show why every line of code exists in that. And then

167
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,170
basically anytime there's a change,

168
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,649
you have to show exactly why the code is changing

169
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,070
for what reason and it has to be fully documented.

170
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,510
So they,

171
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,809
they literally can take this operating system that's running on an airplane

172
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,989
and they can trace it back to the dude who wrote the first line of code or JT,

173
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,540
I guess, you know, we won't be those guys, but you know what I mean?

174
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,239
It's, they can literally, they can show the history,

175
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,859
they can show the provenance of all of this stuff.

176
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,940
It's crazy how strict it is.

177
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,980
Well, the reality is, planes are really expensive.

178
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,119
Uh Well,

179
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,739
they're expensive but there's also like that whole like people die if it crashes,

180
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:58,760
right? It's, if your car crashes or stops working,

181
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,730
it could be bad. You may or may not die.

182
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:05,040
But if the plane stops working, like you're going to die, you know.

183
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,350
Uh but anyways going back to this.

184
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,790
So uh because access to the design details of these proprietary operating

185
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:14,970
systems is limited to limited to the system developer and airplane integrator.

186
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,540
Some systems installed in the umbrere model E RJ 91 90-3 300 airplane will use

187
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,709
operating systems that are widely used and

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,410
commercially available from third party software suppliers.

189
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,850
So I'm assuming that's stuff like the entertainment system or whatever.

190
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:27,730
Let's hope so.

191
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,029
Um The security vulnerabilities of these operating systems may be

192
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,380
more widely known than the vulnerabilities of proprietor operating systems

193
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,950
that the avionics manufacturer currently use. So

194
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,280
um

195
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,989
I'm gonna say they're not entirely 100% wrong but

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,630
they're basically mostly wrong and I think they're wrong.

197
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,219
Probably not for the reasons that

198
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,830
people and you

199
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,840
think they are.

200
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,890
Um

201
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,349
my first comment would be again, you know, back to this whole source code versus like

202
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,419
binary thing is I'm pretty sure if we lease a one of

203
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:03,059
these jets and like do a uh a memory dump of,

204
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,429
you know, the operating system and everything.

205
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,640
I'm pretty sure somebody like Tavis given

206
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,549
a week could probably find something nasty.

207
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,409
He probably doesn't need a dump of it. You would just need some level of access.

208
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,669
And I'm going to hope now,

209
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,369
although there's that guy who claims he hacked an airplane and made it, like,

210
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,520
turn or something through the entertainment center.

211
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,969
Right.

212
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,489
I think that was debunked.

213
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,929
But the reality is, I know on some models of plane, apparently now they are using

214
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:31,900
a single physical data bus with essentially V

215
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,000
lands to separate entertainment. And,

216
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,729
-- well,
-- I agree.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,539
Yes and no, because here's the thing,

218
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,859
this is a difficult trade off because on the one hand V

219
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:43,460
lands and that type of tech technology

220
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,570
is quite well understood and reasonably secure.

221
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,340
And the reality is adding

222
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,099
secondary wiring to a plane. You know, it's going to be at least

223
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,900
several dozen, if not hundreds of pounds of wiring equipment.

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,940
And that has a real long term cost on the plane.

225
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,469
Um Air Canada's uh subsidiary Jazz is a great example of this.

226
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:05,469
So Air Canada has this like cheap flights, thing called jazz.

227
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,070
Uh And they took all the life jackets off all the planes

228
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,599
-- to save weight.
-- Does it never fly over water?

229
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,070
Uh It has to fly within like 20 or 30 minutes of the coast or something.

230
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,229
So, in theory, you can like glide to the beach if like it's,

231
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,109
yeah, basically so that the flight is uh somewhat restricted,

232
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,380
but they're mostly flying over Canada, right?

233
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:27,789
They're not doing like, uh cross ocean flights.

234
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:28,280
Um,

235
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,710
but the reality is this like even a cost savings of like 100

236
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:35,700
pounds over the co over the like life of one of these aircraft

237
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,869
is a lot of fuel

238
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:38,960
saved,

239
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,599
you know.

240
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,599
Um, so, yeah, it's, I mean, on the one hand I, I am like, oh yeah,

241
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,039
you should just physically separate this all out, but on the other hand, you know,

242
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,719
that's like an extra 100 pounds or 200 pounds of equipment and wiring and everything

243
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,940
and that really does add up especially across a fleet of planes.

244
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:55,750
Um

245
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,010
But what's really fascinating to me is that

246
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,020
uh reading uh so there's an FAA bulletin

247
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,289
um

248
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,739
essentially special conditions, Ombre

249
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,039
S A model E RJ 190 slash

250
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,549
dash 300 airplane, flight envelope protection, general limiting requirements.

251
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,609
I don't understand anything you just said,

252
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,010
ok,

253
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,969
so basically, um

254
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,619
when we started out with uh like planes,

255
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,479
we literally had wires connected to stuff that you would like when you pulled the,

256
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,869
the the stick, like say when you pulled it backwards,

257
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,109
it would actually like pull on a cable that would physically move

258
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,140
Arons and

259
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,590
like move stuff around, right?

260
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,710
And like, so, you know,

261
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,960
flying was a physically demanding and exhausting profession.

262
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:37,960
Um

263
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,039
And you know, then you got things like power assist like in your car and

264
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,929
eventually you got fly by wire where you

265
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,859
essentially have like a joystick telling a computer,

266
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:45,030
you know,

267
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,989
like turn the plane to the right and then the plane decides what to actually you know,

268
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,979
it turns the a

269
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,130
or, you know, moves

270
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:51,969
Arons or

271
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:55,119
the flaps or whatever needs to happen to turn the plane in that direction.

272
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,729
Even outside of computer, there's a certain

273
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:04,049
hesitation for a lot of people to think that like when you move the stick,

274
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,049
you're just flipping a switch that then goes through a wire as electricity and you

275
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:08,210
have

276
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,929
something to do.

277
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,849
What does, it doesn't even have to be a computer necessarily, right?

278
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,250
It can basically be a switch

279
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,609
that does something sort of stuff, regardless.

280
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:20,369
It's all computerized now.

281
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,039
So, and what's interesting is so, you know, as, as time goes on,

282
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,280
we've gotten a better understanding of aerodynamics and crashes of planes.

283
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,960
And so, for example, we have things like stall warnings, you know,

284
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:30,869
like you're going too slow,

285
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,229
so you get a stall warning or you're going too close to the ground.

286
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,309
So you get a proximity alert, you know, saying pull up.

287
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,380
Um, but as of yet,

288
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,369
there are very few, like there are some specific

289
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,359
things in flight systems for certain well understood corner cases where the,

290
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:47,190
like the plane,

291
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,869
some models can essentially take control and get you out of the problem before.

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,750
Like the humans realize it's a problem,

293
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:55,820
right? Because part of the problem too is with a lot of these aviation things.

294
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,849
Like if you have a problem and you don't react to it in five or 10 seconds, you're dead,

295
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,320
you know, you're literally you're gonna hit the ground.

296
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,289
So what it sounds like is uh blah, blah, blah,

297
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,580
this airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to

298
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,080
the state of technology envisioned in the

299
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,940
airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes.

300
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,210
Uh So basically what they're saying is this airplane has a

301
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,840
new thing compared to all the other transport planes and,

302
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:20,950
and when they say transport planes,

303
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,799
they don't mean just like transporting stuff but they mean people as well

304
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,409
to be clear these planes

305
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:25,700
for

306
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:26,520
people.

307
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,919
Yeah, exactly.

308
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,780
Just really bothersome cargo.

309
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,609
Uh This design feature is a new control

310
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:34,820
architecture and full digital flight control system,

311
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,080
both of which provide flight envelope protection.

312
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,080
So what is a flight envelope? Well, a flight envelope is a fancy way of saying

313
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,530
if you go outside the flight envelope, like you go outside these parameters,

314
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:45,080
you die.

315
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,840
That's it, right.

316
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:47,900
Um The,

317
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:51,789
the air France disaster uh over the

318
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,760
South Atlantic is a great example because essentially

319
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,950
to fly

320
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:03,090
in a very fuel efficient manner, you have to fly very close to what is safe

321
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,539
and if you go a little bit slower or a little bit faster or a little bit too,

322
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,210
you know, a slightly different angle of attack,

323
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,599
uh the plane will stall or,

324
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,080
you know, bad things will happen and you will die.

325
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,130
Um

326
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,169
So essentially these planes are, you know,

327
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:24,450
flying in a manner where even a slight change in circumstances mean you,

328
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,359
you're now up up the creek without a paddle.

329
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,630
But if you can fly that way, reliably, you can save a ton of fuel,

330
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,549
you can get there quicker, all these good things.

331
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:37,590
And so what it sounds like is that this flight software is now

332
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,539
sort of understanding the flight envelope of the plane

333
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:43,119
and ensuring that it stays within that flight envelope.

334
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,489
So

335
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,549
I think, um,

336
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,630
like there's been cases for example of where people had the autopilot going,

337
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,349
they were flying a certain speed,

338
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:53,549
uh, you know, and then they hit some weather or they hit like, um, you know,

339
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,229
hotter air or colder air which has a different density

340
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:59,419
and that changes the, the characteristics of the flight

341
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,000
and the flight envelope and

342
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,520
you can have a problem

343
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,369
and the auto

344
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,919
doesn't like that.

345
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,650
Well, what if they're like having a nap or eating their dinner? And

346
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,409
I don't

347
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:08,659
know, I

348
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,140
don't know how,

349
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,820
well again, autopilot.

350
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,719
So, I mean, depending on how sophisticated they are,

351
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:17,169
some autopilots literally are just like, keep you on a bearing

352
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:18,200
to

353
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,150
the wheel

354
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,489
pretty

355
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,309
much. Yeah.

356
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
And again, that's, that was a, there was a,

357
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,869
there was a flight that crashed up in northern Canada because

358
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,479
they engaged the autopilot to fly a certain course

359
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,229
and that course flew them into a hill.

360
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,460
Whoops.

361
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,159
Yeah.

362
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,859
Uh, the worst part is the second officer raised this concern and was overruled.

363
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,119
-- Yeah.
-- Well,

364
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,080
what, like we're flying right at that hill.

365
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,640
What

366
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,429
basically

367
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,469
what happened

368
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,450
had

369
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,979
day we're flying right at that hill,

370
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,659
you know.

371
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,260
-- But anyway, sorry, autopilot. So, what does autopilot do
-- today?

372
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,309
So, there's, there's a variety of sophistication but like a variety of autopilots.

373
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,219
Uh, well, obviously the more sophisticated ones now will do, you know, they,

374
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,609
they'll do things like, keep you,

375
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:08,239
um, at a stable altitude, you know, regardless of, you know,

376
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,919
kind of a little bit of variation,

377
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,859
you know, they'll keep you on the same heading.

378
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,760
Like, so even if you hit, like say a wind coming across,

379
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,650
you know, it'll turn you into the wind a little bit to keep you on course, you know,

380
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,510
-- things like that,
-- right?

381
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,609
I got you

382
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,250
right.

383
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,000
Because what you could hit a jet stream hitting you sideways at 100 miles an hour,

384
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,429
right? If you're flying,

385
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,510
well, no, it's, it's people fly through the jet stream all the time, right? And

386
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:35,380
uh a lot of airline routes take this into account so that they can, you know,

387
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,309
use it as a tail wind to get there faster.

388
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,869
But anyway, so the thing is with these autopilots,

389
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,820
like the majority of them will essentially keep you on course.

390
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:46,590
Um But they won't necessarily like keep you

391
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,609
within a safe flight envelope, right? Like if,

392
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,830
and it sounds like this one is essentially, it's that next level of smart

393
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:55,849
uh

394
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,770
so that it will, you know, for example,

395
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,010
if you hit a thunderstorm or something like that,

396
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,940
it'll take appropriate action to maybe speed up or slow down or,

397
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:05,848
you know, just otherwise reconfigure the flaps of the plane.

398
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,709
Um,

399
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,368
because here's a dirty secret. Right.

400
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,118
You want the plane to have as little drag as possible so that it flies efficiently.

401
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,949
-- Dirty secret. I think that's like the fundamentals of avionics.
-- Right. Right.

402
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,479
But the thing is they've pushed it very far

403
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,329
now to the point where it's almost dangerous.

404
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,630
But if you fly correctly it's, it's ok.

405
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,829
I got you.

406
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:26,939
You know,

407
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,099
so when it works, it's great when it doesn't work. You know,

408
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,390
because like, lift is one of the side effects of drag.

409
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,109
So

410
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:39,569
-- if you have no drag by definition, you have no lift.
-- Exactly.

411
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:42,349
And that's what happened to air France over the South Atlantic. Apparently

412
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,089
I got you.

413
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:43,839
So

414
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:44,329
they

415
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,739
fell

416
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:45,390
out of the sky.

417
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,349
This sounds to me like self driving airplane.

418
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,060
Um, it's,

419
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,560
well, here's the reality, right?

420
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:56,510
You could have a self driving car and just give a GPS coordinates and like,

421
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,010
just hope to goodness that nothing gets in your way.

422
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,430
Right.

423
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,260
-- Sure.
-- You know. But, but obviously that would be insane and not

424
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,349
very

425
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:03,849
smart

426
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,859
-- to not hit things though.
-- Right.

427
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:08,400
Well, and so that's obviously we have to take that into account. Right.

428
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,260
Because the situations change, deer come out of the road, other cars, whatever.

429
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,540
Right.

430
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:17,479
Well, have you seen that video of the Teslas detecting crashes?

431
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,209
And it's like as a human,

432
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,040
I have no idea what's going on and the Tesla already knows what's coming.

433
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,569
And it's, it's amazing.

434
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,400
Yeah.

435
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,229
And so that's, that's a good example of this, you know, in theory,

436
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,920
this flight envelope thing, you know, can detect, oh, you know,

437
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,150
we're losing lift because we're approaching our, you know, the, the, the

438
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,260
arons are trimmed to, you know, make us very fuel efficient,

439
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,209
but we're losing lift for whatever reason.

440
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:43,760
Maybe I need to sacrifice a bit of fuel efficiency. So we don't all die.

441
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,479
I, I, I'm comfortable with that decision.

442
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,709
Um, you know, but to make that decision and say 1/10 of a second versus a human being,

443
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,890
which may take, you know, 1030 seconds or a minute or two.

444
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:56,609
Yes,

445
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,489
that's right.

446
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,040
-- Yeah. No, I
-- get that and that's a big difference.

447
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,170
Well, and not only that, you know what the thing that's going to be really cool.

448
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,900
And I don't know if this system can do this and, and it may not,

449
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,209
but once these planes can start recording all of the data about all of their flights,

450
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,199
then they

451
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,760
start using things like machine learning and artificial

452
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,060
intelligence to basically make the autopilot significantly smarter.

453
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,500
-- Right?
-- Oh, they already do that. Uh And for example, the engines, uh

454
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,119
see here's the thing, for example, like when you buy a plane engine,

455
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,459
you typically don't like a lot of times you don't buy them, you're just leasing them.

456
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,420
Um And I know the, the nicer, like the Rolls Royce engines, the higher end ones that,

457
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,339
you know, are like on 740 sevens and whatnot.

458
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,920
They essentially send back telemetry.

459
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,430
I, I remember that because the

460
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,000
plane that vanished with the Malaysian Airlines plane

461
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:45,880
and

462
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,170
the engine, people had

463
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,550
some, some information about where the plane was, which

464
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,329
basically

465
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,719
where it was based on like Doppler shift and what not going back to the Inmarsat,

466
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,510
-- which
-- is wild.

467
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,910
Yeah. So, I mean,

468
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:01,800
the, the real,

469
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,469
the thing is like a plane isn't like a car,

470
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,069
these things are really expensive and so quite often,

471
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,420
um,

472
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,900
the plane you're on, you know, the company operating, it probably doesn't own it.

473
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,160
They may be leasing it dry leasing or wet leasing.

474
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,829
So a dry lease is where you just lease the plane,

475
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,780
a wet lease is where you lease the plane and a crew.

476
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,390
Um, and you know, for all, you know,

477
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,479
that

478
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:26,479
that plane may not own those engines, they, those engines may be leased.

479
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,750
Uh, because the thing is like, there's a lot of aviation companies that, you know,

480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,000
they don't have the expertise to fix one of these engines.

481
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,959
I doubt any of them do.

482
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,050
I mean, if you didn't build it,

483
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,150
I'm skeptical you can touch it because have you ever seen what

484
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,000
looks like?

485
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,319
Do you think a big airline can though?

486
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:43,849
Oh, they

487
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,689
do? Yeah, like Air Canada, for example.

488
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:45,880
Um,

489
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,300
actually the Air Canada and several North

490
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,209
American Airlines have now moved all their,

491
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:50,349
um,

492
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,119
major sort of repairs and refit down to South America

493
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,770
because it's actually cheaper to fly the plane down there and take

494
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,729
it out of service for an extra 12 or 20 hours.

495
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:01,719
But fly it down to a country where the wages are so much cheaper

496
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,199
to do all the maintenance refit,

497
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,699
you know, and, like, take the plane out of service for three days and, like,

498
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,599
tear it apart and put it back together, basically.

499
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,229
Right. I've, I've read about such things actually and it's a,

500
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,050
because I,

501
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,300
I didn't realize this but most airplanes are in service for 20 or more years.

502
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,410
Which is just crazy to me.

503
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,829
What is the, hang

504
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:20,949
on

505
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,329
a second

506
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,150
-- and
-- they, like, just keep taking them apart and fixing them and then, like,

507
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,930
they'll put in new seats or they'll put,

508
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,300
-- starts to crack.
-- Right.

509
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:30,560
Right.

510
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,739
Or, you know, the wings, you can essentially,

511
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,900
yeah, you can just keep, like replacing the engines and all the other bits.

512
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:39,469
Um,

513
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,540
what is the B 52 service lifetime at this point? I think it's going to be 75 years.

514
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:45,339
Uh,

515
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:45,839
do, do, do,

516
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,140
do

517
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:46,819
it.

518
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,140
They're planning until 2040.

519
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,189
So that's another 20 some years. And it's been around for about 50 years so far.

520
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,300
It's a good plan,

521
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:55,989
I guess so.

522
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,900
And here's the reality after what the F-35 and

523
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,780
F-22 cost to design and build and produce,

524
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,150
I don't know.

525
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,560
That we can actually have a large bomber program that wouldn't turn into a,

526
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,910
like trillion dollar

527
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,030
train wreck.

528
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:11,660
Well,

529
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:15,089
you don't even need bombers anyway. Just drones, man, everything,

530
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,750
drones. And

531
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,449
that's

532
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,310
the other problem.

533
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,719
Well, the other problem too is I,

534
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:22,119
I don't think the US has ever sold the B 52 to another nation.

535
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,540
Right.

536
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,449
So they can't, you know, kind of defray the cost, like, you know,

537
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:30,579
with Canada and Australia and variety of other nations buying F-35s for example.

538
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:31,410
So,

539
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,099
but no, this is interesting because, um, like on the one hand, see,

540
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:39,209
here's the other thing, right is if the plain avionic system doesn't have like

541
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:39,459
a,

542
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:43,829
an interface you can talk to, like, it doesn't have a Wi Fi or a network port, you know,

543
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,380
it's not on the internet, I hope.

544
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,280
Oh, boy, I hope,

545
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,329
um,

546
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,530
you know, it's really hard to attack this thing.

547
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,410
You know, you have to go like the Stuxnet route of like a USB stick or something.

548
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes. And that's, that's fair.

549
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,160
This is a good reason to not tie the

550
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,920
entertainment center in with the now self-driving airplane.

551
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,640
But you, you're probably the

552
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,250
self

553
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:05,949
driving.

554
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,390
Let's be clear on this. They, they autopilot.

555
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,339
-- Most airplanes spend something like 98% of their flying time on autopilot.
-- Right.

556
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:13,910
Right.

557
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,339
Well, you know, it's going to be really wild.

558
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,349
I wonder how long until we see the first flight

559
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,829
that basically takes off and lands completely under computer control.

560
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:24,359
Uh,

561
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,030
so that's already happened.

562
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:26,250
Has

563
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:26,560
really

564
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:27,119
ok

565
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,900
with people on it.

566
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,699
I'm not 100% certain. I know the, I think it was DARPA

567
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,069
with,

568
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:36,510
no, no, I'm saying like a passenger jet, not like some DARPA

569
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:40,500
crazy airplane that's fueled by like, you know, rodents or something. I mean,

570
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,670
like an actual airplane

571
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,550
with, with not me sitting in the city,

572
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,599
it's a tough sell. I mean, I, I suspect it will happen

573
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,609
after self driving cars because we'll get used

574
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,829
to self driving cars and giving up that control

575
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,969
and that perception of control.

576
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,130
I don't know if it, it's gonna be that hard to sell though, man. I mean,

577
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:06,050
I feel like self driving cars are being nearly everybody accepts them and,

578
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,489
and basically anyone I run into that says I don't trust a computer to drive a car.

579
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,250
And I say

580
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,569
you honestly think anything can be worse than a person. They go.

581
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,089
Yeah, you're, you're probably right, like, literally,

582
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,869
I have yet to find anyone that you have to stand their ground on this one.

583
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,250
And I suspect airplane now, granted pilots are highly trained

584
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,369
and so it's slightly different there because it's not just like any Yahoo who,

585
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,739
you know,

586
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,479
paid 20 bucks to the DMV and passed their crappy test

587
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,839
pilots are, are a different breed. However,

588
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,810
I would still trust a computer over a person

589
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,109
any day because a computer doesn't show up drunk.

590
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,989
The computer doesn't fall asleep and I know the computer is going to do it

591
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:46,890
is you can literally hit

592
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,500
realistic scenarios in flight that like nobody's

593
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,199
ever accounted for like um captain.

594
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:53,290
So with the, I've lost both engines

595
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,280
-- on
-- take

596
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,489
off, there are always going to be

597
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,949
those kind of extra strenuous circumstances and, and I expect that to be the case

598
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,989
and

599
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,339
I this is where it gets tricky is, I can envision two scenarios.

600
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,469
Number one is where you have

601
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,339
kind of some sort of remote command and control room

602
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,829
with qualified personnel in it that are able to,

603
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,739
you know, kind of take over.

604
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:17,839
You

605
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,020
have

606
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
to be able to redirect the flights because of weather

607
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,719
and,

608
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,900
well, the computer can redirect flights.

609
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,560
Well,

610
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,099
but at some point you have to be able to tell

611
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:28,069
the airplane like you cannot land here because for example,

612
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,500
there's a national ground stop.

613
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,819
Well, yeah, but why couldn't you? I mean,

614
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,979
well, I'm saying you can

615
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:37,625
just ask the plane nicely. You want to be able to, like you said, control it.

616
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,484
I would assume there'd be some sort of centralized

617
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:44,574
air traffic control system that's fundamentally making sure these planes

618
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:46,045
and part of it too is

619
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:48,805
you're going to have to make sure the planes aren't too near each other.

620
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,084
I would imagine when it's computer controlled you'd

621
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,854
want to keep them even farther apart,

622
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:53,564
maybe

623
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:54,074
closer,

624
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,045
-- safer.
-- You think? So, I don't know.

625
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:56,864
Anyway,

626
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,214
you can

627
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:57,734
a

628
00:25:57,944 --> 00:26:00,625
-- heck of a lot faster than people.
-- Here's the second part though.

629
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:03,285
The alternative is you just say

630
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,329
there are going to be rare events

631
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,569
and the computer is going to do its best,

632
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:08,329
but

633
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,209
sometimes it's gonna crash

634
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,510
and that's even true of people, honestly. Right. I mean,

635
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:19,130
Sully was an anomaly because you had a very experienced seasoned pilot

636
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,930
that, that knew what to do,

637
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,520
you know. II I, if it was anyone else, that plane might have crashed,

638
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,719
the problem is the perception of control. Right.

639
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,790
Like my understanding is a lot of people,

640
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,599
their fear of flying is not a fear of flying per se.

641
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,829
It's a fear of not being in control while they are flying.

642
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,760
The problem isn't flying, the problem is crashing. Right.

643
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,680
Well, yeah. And, but the problem is they, they're not the one driving.

644
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,739
Like they have to trust somebody else to, you know,

645
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,430
not crash the plane and some people just can't handle that.

646
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,790
You know,

647
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:52,349
I, I, and I see the same argument with self driving cars. Right.

648
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,150
-- I want to be in control of it. I don't trust a computer. I don't
-- trust me.

649
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,030
I

650
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,540
trust, I

651
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,699
trust taxi drivers.

652
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,430
Yeah. Right. No, I, I agree. I agree completely.

653
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:06,709
Uh, so anyway, I used to be afraid to fly and I, I didn't fly very much.

654
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:09,630
I, I was, um, I, I did not like it and I don't know

655
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,459
it, I don't feel like it was a control thing. I just didn't,

656
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,459
airplanes are very bumpy things

657
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:20,540
and, and like I took my first airplane flight, I'll be honest with you.

658
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,239
I was 22 years old when I got in an airplane for the first time. I was very old. Right.

659
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,290
Right. I never flew.

660
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:28,910
And so I remember just like all the bumps and the

661
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,540
weird noises and things happening and I was always like,

662
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:31,979
the

663
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:32,390
plane is

664
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:32,760
what's

665
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:33,000
going

666
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,150
on,

667
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:34,020
lack of control

668
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:34,790
it,

669
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,170
you know, it might have been because now that I understand what's going on.

670
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,650
II I don't get bothered at all.

671
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,170
And in fact,

672
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,209
I've been on flights where people were like screaming because we were

673
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:46,619
like crazy things were happening and I was just sitting there like,

674
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,890
man, it's fine and I remember turning to the person next to me, I'm like

675
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:50,650
this happens, it's gonna be ok.

676
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:51,369
You know.

677
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:55,250
No, I think I've been flying since I was like four, maybe three.

678
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:55,930
Nice.

679
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,609
Well, one of my kids are the same way they've been, I mean, they,

680
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:02,329
they won't remember not flying because I've been an airplane so much.

681
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,609
And yeah, I mean, it's just,

682
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,770
it's a non event because I trust in the system because by and large, yeah,

683
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,010
these are professionals with well maintained machines.

684
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,839
Much more so than say a taxi.

685
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:17,050
Oh man, I know, I know. Actually the most terrifying taxi I ever had was in Canada.

686
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,869
Did you know that

687
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,709
it was in, it was in Ottawa. In fact,

688
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,900
I was, uh,

689
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,949
it was technically an Uber ride

690
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,010
but I was, uh,

691
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,060
I was watching the map and I was worried I was being driven somewhere to be murdered.

692
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,810
Luckily I was not.

693
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
-- Yeah. Anyway, anyway, all right,
-- back to the flight control software.

694
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,609
So, I mean, the thing is

695
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,420
the biggest, I think, honestly, one of the biggest things nowadays is,

696
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,650
is it attached to a network and, or the network being the internet, of course,

697
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,839
and if it's not attached to the, the internet,

698
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,369
bam, it's a lot harder to attack because, you know,

699
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,170
some schmuck from Russia can't just like,

700
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:54,430
connect to it.

701
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,130
Well, so here's the thing, I,

702
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,869
I think of the immediately is if you have the equivalent of a self driving airplane,

703
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,750
you're going to have quite a lot of

704
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,880
communication happening between the airplane and the ground

705
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,910
and

706
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:11,790
you're going to have some sort of routed protocol.

707
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,349
I suspect even though it's going to be happening obviously over satellite or, or,

708
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,989
you know, ground to air or whatever.

709
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,229
And

710
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,310
the issue I could see being that if they have, say a central

711
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,469
kind of control, uh uh flight tower or whatever you wanna call it, right.

712
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:32,630
Keeping track of all the airplanes and, and telling them all what to do,

713
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,619
kind of like autos,

714
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,060
air traffic control. I don't know what you even call it.

715
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,910
But anyway,

716
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,160
that is probably going to be connected to the internet because

717
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,189
you're gonna have many of them scattered around the country and

718
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,339
even if it's a VPN, like they're on the internet,

719
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:49,459
which means people can get to the airplanes.

720
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:52,540
So here's the good news, there's already an industry that has,

721
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,939
uh, encountered and addressed and solved that problem largely.

722
00:29:56,969 --> 00:30:01,119
-- Which,
-- which problem I mentioned 10 things. What about satellites?

723
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,359
Satellite control?

724
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,290
Right.

725
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,540
There's ground stations that control the satellites, military, civilian,

726
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,140
whatever.

727
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,250
And, you know, and let's face it, satellites,

728
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,150
they're even more expensive and container

729
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,329
than airplanes.

730
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:15,140
Right. How

731
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,540
-- many breaks? You can't go fix
-- it. How many of these ground stations are there?

732
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:19,604
Uh, I

733
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:19,915
don't know.

734
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:23,324
Uh, the US government military operates a bunch. Right.

735
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:23,484
I mean,

736
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:27,744
-- the GPS thing alone is like quite
-- the military is different because they have,

737
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,084
they have their, it's called super

738
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,925
net and it, they're kind of, you know,

739
00:30:31,104 --> 00:30:35,084
classified network that, that's very well controlled. Right.

740
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,324
I could and granted, don't get me wrong.

741
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:41,244
I don't think this is going to be a problem because for two reasons, first of all,

742
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:43,364
I don't know if anyone's a big enough dirt bag

743
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,694
to actually crash an airplane on purpose like this.

744
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:46,114
I mean,

745
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,459
uh it's already been hypothesized. Remember what was it?

746
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:52,810
I want to say the Polish Defense Minister or Prime Minister or

747
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,739
something like that and his entire cabinet or something was aboard.

748
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:59,880
Oh, here we go. Yeah, Poland claims proof Russia caused presidential

749
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,880
plane crash.

750
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:02,660
So, yeah, it was the Polish

751
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,099
President and his cabinet.

752
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,859
I, I don't think that's comparable to an airplane I'm going to be on.

753
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:09,780
Ok.

754
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:13,180
No, but, you know, maybe somebody else important is on that airplane.

755
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:14,119
-- Let's
-- hope not.

756
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:18,060
I, I'll make a point of avoiding planes with important people.

757
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:21,359
But anyway,

758
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:23,189
let's face it too.

759
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:23,339
Uh,

760
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,920
even if they connect these things to the internet

761
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,739
and they're using VPN S or whatever to,

762
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,760
to communicate between them and whatnot.

763
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:29,790
Uh,

764
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:33,540
for the most part, this stuff works pretty well and,

765
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,660
and even if they get broken into which, which will inevitably happen,

766
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:42,290
if, if they've done it right, they're gonna figure it out and deal with it quickly.

767
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:42,969
I mean,

768
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:45,760
that's just kind of becoming the reality of the world now is

769
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,380
people are getting hacked a lot and if you have a very,

770
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,489
very high profile resource,

771
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,290
you have to be extra vigilant.

772
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,359
Yeah.

773
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:53,660
Well,

774
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,390
I think that in this case we actually have economics working for us in the sense of

775
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:01,819
you have airplanes, especially the commercial,

776
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:04,390
you know, wide body, uh, carriers

777
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,040
are a massive capital cost.

778
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,790
Yes,

779
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,750
there's that not only that the FAA has a ton

780
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,069
of power here and if they tell you to do something

781
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:16,109
you're gonna do it because you don't have a choice. Right.

782
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,339
It's not like an IOT light bulb where nobody cares.

783
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,540
So, I think that's, and, and to be honest, that's, you know,

784
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,650
one of the reasons I would generally trust the system.

785
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,430
Will there be problems? Yeah. Will people die?

786
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:30,189
Um, yeah, I mean, that's the nature of almost any technological, you know,

787
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,030
system, especially when you're moving people around at hundreds of miles an hour.

788
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,119
Um, but is it going to be safer than driving a car from point A to point B

789
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:41,329
-- almost certainly
-- until self driving cars are here.

790
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,829
And then actually, you know, that's one of the things I think about is,

791
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,849
is self driving,

792
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:49,239
cars are going to change the travel industry in ways we can't even imagine because,

793
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,140
like, here's a great example is

794
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,199
if I need to go to the east coast, the east coast is like a 13 hour drive for me. Right.

795
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,430
I'm not driving that

796
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:59,229
I get on an airplane. I fly there. Right. However,

797
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,709
if I could get in a car, like at six in the afternoon

798
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,050
and fall asleep and wake up, you know, in Boston.

799
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,989
That's sweet. You know, I would seriously consider doing that.

800
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,000
There's, I mean, I was reading an article talking about this that it really,

801
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,880
in theory, yeah, self driving cars, especially if you go overnight

802
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,160
would just decimate the airline industry for anything less than 500 mile flights.

803
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:22,780
Yeah. Right.

804
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,150
And, and it would be way more convenient to do that in, in, in all seriousness.

805
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,280
The vast majority of my flights

806
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:33,050
I go there a day before because I can't, you know,

807
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,510
I have got a morning meeting so I cannot show up the day of,

808
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,959
and then I end up leaving at, like,

809
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,390
noon because it's the only time the stupid airplane leaves.

810
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,079
You know what I mean?

811
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,550
Unless I want to get in at 2 a.m. which I don't.

812
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:44,219
So,

813
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:44,979
yeah.

814
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:49,050
No, this would be ii, I actually hope that this, you know,

815
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,339
in theory this could result in like,

816
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:53,869
essentially all the regional air traffic being pretty much gutted.

817
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,479
I'm ok with that.

818
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:56,459
And, um, you know,

819
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:59,180
just essentially maintaining the big hubs to fly

820
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:01,099
people to Europe or Canada or whatever.

821
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,260
-- Yeah,
-- I could see it, man.

822
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,810
It's, it's certainly possible. Not only that, the other thing I think of a lot is

823
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:09,159
so I live in, in an area where the,

824
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,179
the o'hare airport is basically like the, the

825
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,219
Giganto airport for the region

826
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,679
and it's three hours away by car.

827
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,469
So II, I never drive to o'hare because it's too far to drive.

828
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,090
And also I don't want to waste six hours of my life.

829
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,438
Well, between that and security and everything you're looking at like, five hours.

830
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,850
Yeah, at least. Exactly.

831
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,899
But like, if I could get in a car that was gonna drive me there and I could, like,

832
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,070
work or read or play video games or whatever, like,

833
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,290
I would seriously consider that because that would not be a waste of my time.

834
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,929
You know what I mean?

835
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,760
Well, I, I think that's going to be a big thing. Is. I, I know a lot of people who commute

836
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,159
and that's an extra 2030 minutes each way that,

837
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,719
yeah, they can't work. They can't really do much of anything useful

838
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,840
other than listen to, like, books on tape.

839
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,080
-- No,
-- I get it, man. It's gonna be, it's gonna be crazy

840
00:34:55,688 --> 00:34:57,138
anyway. All right, we're, we're in the weeds. Uh,

841
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,188
let's

842
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:01,519
speaking on the topic of security through obscurity.

843
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:04,089
There was also the Microsoft leak

844
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:05,108
that happened.

845
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:07,579
What was that? When, whenever, whenever it happened,

846
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:08,418
that's when it happened

847
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:12,269
last week, a couple of days, whatever, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

848
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:14,428
So what, what basically happened was

849
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,820
some guy found on an FTP site, a dump of a,

850
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,260
what is it like 32 terabytes of windows source code or something?

851
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,129
Apparently

852
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:23,889
something like

853
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,689
official and nonpublic.

854
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,169
I don't know, it was installation images

855
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,449
and they say so

856
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:31,784
for blueprints, what is it?

857
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:36,514
What is the software blueprint?

858
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:38,584
It doesn't matter because we're going to talk

859
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,715
about source code and hiding source code.

860
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:43,274
And, and so, and then of course, Twitter lights up

861
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:46,225
as, as it does and this is what makes Twitter so much fun

862
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:47,274
because everyone's like, oh,

863
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,705
someone at Microsoft is freaking out that's ruined their weekend, whatever.

864
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,235
And I was thinking about this and

865
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:55,379
yeah, I'm sure there's people at Microsoft that weren't happy,

866
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,659
but like at the end of the day

867
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,689
doesn't really matter. I don't think it does.

868
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:00,830
Like, like,

869
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,129
I think Microsoft is so far past the point of

870
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:06,620
believing their source code is some sort of security asset.

871
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:06,719
Now,

872
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:09,989
granted there's there's trade secrets and we won't talk about that necessarily.

873
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,330
But

874
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,500
as a security asset, I don't buy it.

875
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:13,129
Well,

876
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,189
it says that the uh the leak code is Microsoft's Microsoft's shared source kit.

877
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:18,719
So this is

878
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,264
assuming that is source code that they share with

879
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:23,754
-- partners and what
-- the shared source thing was.

880
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,485
Oh man, I've got a great story about this.

881
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,705
So shared source was the thing they started where

882
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,824
like if you were a university student or,

883
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:33,544
or part of faculty or something, you could get access to Windows source code to,

884
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:34,304
to do stuff,

885
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:37,745
right? You could look at it and I think you could build some of it. I don't,

886
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,274
I'm sure you could send them changes whether they took them or not. Who knows?

887
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,745
And you of course, had to sign a phone book contract and,

888
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:44,655
and all this. And

889
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:47,909
I remember I was out for dinner one night with a Microsoft sales rep.

890
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:51,020
This was, this was right when shared source first started. And I was,

891
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,979
I don't even know if I worked at Red Hat back then. It was a long time ago.

892
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,939
And anyway, I remember this guy looks at me and he says, why do,

893
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,179
why do you do this stuff?

894
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:01,020
I don't, I don't get this open source.

895
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,530
I'm like, it's fun, you know, I can, I've got all this source code.

896
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,239
I've got all these tools. None of it costs money. I can work on it.

897
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,139
I can contribute back, you know, whatever.

898
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,129
And he looks at me and like he was completely honest and he said,

899
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,969
but we do that. We shared source and

900
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,439
he took everything in me to not laugh out loud at this guy.

901
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,399
And it's like I,

902
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:24,399
I would love to educate you but you don't get it and I don't think you ever will.

903
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,800
-- It's just, they are not the same thing.
-- No, no.

904
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,600
My understanding is that well, I mean, according to the article it's things. Uh,

905
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,399
yeah, it's not even close to what you would need to build windows.

906
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,810
Uh, well, no, probably not. And, and, but wasn't there a windows dump once?

907
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,409
And somebody did find some security

908
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,659
issues

909
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,370
for

910
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,209
it was a long time

911
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:44,540
ago.

912
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:45,219
And,

913
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:47,360
but whatever the point is though,

914
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,760
that Microsoft has a very mature and when I use a mature, I mean,

915
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,110
like the granddaddy of security development life cycle programs

916
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,110
and these guys have been through it all. They've seen it all

917
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,860
and, and let's face it. Worst case scenario, bad guy gets a source code.

918
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,129
They deal with it. Right. I mean,

919
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,330
yeah,

920
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:07,500
-- well,
-- just like with the stuff Tavis is finding

921
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,139
because he's found at this point. Probably.

922
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:12,270
I haven't been keeping track of everything he's found, but it's,

923
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,739
it feels like a couple dozen really bad windows related security

924
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,129
flaws and windows and defender and a bunch of other stuff.

925
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:18,790
-- He was looking
-- at

926
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,939
everything

927
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,979
-- Tavis has
-- broken.

928
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,389
I'm thinking of all the antivirus that he beat up and then

929
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,419
just kind of gave up on because it was so terrible.

930
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,179
I don't know if he gave up on it, but

931
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:33,020
here's, here's, well, actually, so this is another part of this story is uh open VPN.

932
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,810
Right.

933
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,560
There were what two professional audits done of Open VPN where,

934
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,800
like people looked at code and they scanned the code and they did their thing, right.

935
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,639
And they found a bunch of minor stuff

936
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,080
and like some dude fuzzed

937
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,610
it. He found a whole bunch of

938
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,830
bugs.

939
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:49,870
Yeah.

940
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:51,479
Well, and there were, actually, there was about,

941
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:55,469
I think there were three other flaws that we didn't give CV S because they just,

942
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,939
they weren't exploitable in any way, shape or form.

943
00:38:58,449 --> 00:38:58,989
Um,

944
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,830
but, but here's, here's the point too. It doesn't matter

945
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,409
how hard you look at it, it doesn't matter how good your SDLC is.

946
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,120
All it takes is some guy to show up and run a tool and now you've got a new bug and I mean,

947
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:10,610
that's the thing.

948
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,540
Like you move with Tavis. Tavis can work on this stuff forever

949
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,199
and you know what the next day he could come in

950
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:18,639
and find a bug worse than anything he's found yet.

951
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,760
It's just, it's the nature of this stuff.

952
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,070
Well, and it keeps changing and moving. Right.

953
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,399
It's not like we're, you know, assessing a bridge for flaws. It's,

954
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,469
we're assessing all the bridges

955
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:31,239
that are constantly being rebuilt and refurbished.

956
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,419
You know, I like.

957
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:36,649
And if you look at the, if you look at the turn rate in some open source code projects,

958
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,979
the Linux kernel is a great example, like how many

959
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:45,590
lines of code are added, removed, changed every, you know, major release.

960
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,090
-- And the answer is like, well, it's a lot,
-- you know, that would be really fun.

961
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,629
I might do that. I should, I should take the GIT repo of the kernel

962
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,129
and look at how many lines because obviously you can only

963
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,360
go back to when it was imported into GIT because,

964
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,459
you know, line is used in FTP site.

965
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,750
It starts code management a long time ago.

966
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,909
But it'd be really interesting to look at how many lines of code were

967
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:09,449
in that initial commit that are still actually part of the kernel today.

968
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:12,959
Probably, oh, even the license might

969
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:17,639
ignoring text files in license files and things like that. Right.

970
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:21,080
I'm talking about like c source code and we can even ignore comments

971
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,040
but like actual compiled code. I'd be interested to see

972
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,189
that'd be fun to you too.

973
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,959
I bet I could get GCC to tell me which lines were c,

974
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,139
like which lines it compiles and which lines it doesn't.

975
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:33,280
This would be a fun project. Maybe I'll do that this weekend.

976
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,219
Yeah.

977
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:34,850
Yeah.

978
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,929
No, I mean, and, and not only that but the underlying technology, you know,

979
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,810
part of it too is, and this is what I love is,

980
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,969
this technology is so complex that we have emergent behavior.

981
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,120
Like a great example being the Kuala stack

982
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:46,850
card stuff,

983
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,989
it's like literally whoops,

984
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,750
you know,

985
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,550
that didn't do what we thought it would.

986
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,070
Yep. Yep. Yeah,

987
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,729
you gotta love it, man.

988
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,479
What do you do?

989
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:05,729
Well, I mean, train people to react quickly when the law is found and get it,

990
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,000
get it fixed and get the fix out to customers and to users.

991
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,129
I

992
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:09,860
tend to agree

993
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,280
with that. I, I think that's the only answer because even if you have the best

994
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,840
security training and security reviews and, and whatever

995
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,260
in place,

996
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,719
it, it doesn't matter because you still have software for the critical issues.

997
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,370
I'm, I can't, I'm sure it's out there,

998
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:32,919
but I'm trying to think of a major vendor of software related stuff

999
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,340
that actually builds

1000
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,000
reliably 100% of their own stuff.

1001
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,020
Like even the sombre thing is saying that

1002
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,340
we use third party code and operating systems.

1003
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,030
The only,

1004
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,320
the only thing I could possibly think of would be the space shuttle and only

1005
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,750
because it's running like a code base

1006
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,969
-- from 1970 the
-- space shuttle doesn't fly anymore

1007
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:55,439
and I'm sure it used.

1008
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:56,969
Well, I'm sure some of the airplanes,

1009
00:41:56,979 --> 00:42:02,250
I bet this operating system that we read about is probably 100% proprietary

1010
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,199
but the whole, but no, no, no,

1011
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:06,870
I'm saying the plane as a whole includes other components.

1012
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:07,750
And that's what I mean is,

1013
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,229
I don't think there's a single thing anymore that ships with software

1014
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,560
that is 100% like in

1015
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,199
house. You

1016
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,090
-- know
-- what this is though?

1017
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,040
You're

1018
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,760
shipping somebody else's stuff as well.

1019
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,330
Did you?

1020
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,500
No, no, no, you're uh

1021
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,399
you're on Reddit.

1022
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,590
So I know you saw this.

1023
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,909
Did you see the story about the guy who made the $1500 chicken sandwich?

1024
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,169
Uh

1025
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,469
-- No.
-- Ok.

1026
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,270
Uh So it rings a bell.

1027
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,760
This is, this is old, I think,

1028
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,239
but it showed up on one of the subreddits over the weekend and

1029
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:39,270
I've not heard this story before now,

1030
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,149
but apparently this guy decided he was going to like, make a chicken sandwich as in,

1031
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,919
he's going to raise the chicken and grow the wheat and he like,

1032
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,590
grew all the vegetables and everything to make this sandwich.

1033
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:52,649
And it ended up costing him $1500 and took six months, right?

1034
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:53,479
That's why

1035
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,209
build a toaster from scratch.

1036
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:59,169
-- The guy who tried to watch the
-- TED talk, a TED talk. This guy tried to build

1037
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:01,290
a simple electronic toaster

1038
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,840
that TED talk was stupid. Like this guy actually made a sandwich, right?

1039
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,360
That the TED Talk guy, he, he made a wire, right? Like it was

1040
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,290
my life were not bad.

1041
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,229
What was your favorite part of the process?

1042
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,770
I really enjoyed milking the cow,

1043
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,560
they were friendly and like to be rubbed on the base of their tail.

1044
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,459
But it was also scary because the farmer was telling me

1045
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:25,770
that if spooked they kick with what's called the death kick.

1046
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:26,669
Uh,

1047
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,620
yeah, that, that burnt down in Chicago.

1048
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,600
But, but anyway, so here's the deal, right?

1049
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:35,600
This is why nobody writes all their own software

1050
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,560
because otherwise you end up spending $1500 on,

1051
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,370
-- on a chicken sandwich and it takes
-- you a

1052
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:41,320
web server

1053
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:44,199
or even a basic network communications protocol. Like,

1054
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,669
have you not noticed all those places that, you know,

1055
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:48,360
use UDP and then try to make it into

1056
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,610
reliable delivery and end up badly recreating TCP.

1057
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,629
They create a broken TCP every time.

1058
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,149
Yeah, I mean, and I think this goes back to a lot of,

1059
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,879
you know what I've said about security is I think we'd

1060
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,120
be better off if we had people focus on using,

1061
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:03,479
you know,

1062
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,719
some of the better frameworks and just like, please, for the love of whatever,

1063
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,239
don't like, don't write your own encryption or web server or whatever.

1064
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,479
-- Like
-- the news, one of these professional stats is off.

1065
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,629
Don't roll your own.

1066
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:17,020
I

1067
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:17,219
know.

1068
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,399
Oh yeah, I saw,

1069
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:22,919
I just like two weeks ago saw a new one mentioned on Reddit and it was like,

1070
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,280
just all the y

1071
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:28,080
because they can

1072
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,040
because we, we finally convinced them not to roll their own crypto. So

1073
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,300
now they're rolling their own off

1074
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:34,419
which,

1075
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,560
well, and, and

1076
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,239
o has to involve crypto now.

1077
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:39,159
Yeah, it usually does, doesn't it?

1078
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:39,709
Well,

1079
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:43,959
how are you going to transport in store and verify secrets without crypto?

1080
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,399
It's true. It's true.

1081
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:45,750
Oh,

1082
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:46,760
my goodness.

1083
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:51,239
I guess the moral of the story is buy your groceries at the store.

1084
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,080
Yes. Well, not only that, could you imagine the, just

1085
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:59,060
absurdity if everyone trying to kind of grow and,

1086
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,550
and do their own thing for food instead of relying on, you know,

1087
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,250
essentially factory farms.

1088
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,629
Well, we, we did that.

1089
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,000
It was called the agrarian, you know, the agricultural revolution.

1090
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:10,810
And like

1091
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:14,814
8% of people spent all their time trying to grow food and not starve to death.

1092
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:15,804
That's a good point

1093
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:16,864
and

1094
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:17,995
kind of sucked.

1095
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:22,195
And then we did the industrial revolution and it was not super awesome for a while,

1096
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:22,524
but

1097
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:23,465
it got better.

1098
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:26,625
It did. And we cured polio, which is a big deal.

1099
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:30,935
And now obesity is one of the leading causes of death globally,

1100
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,165
not just in North America.

1101
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:32,705
So

1102
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:34,145
we win.

1103
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,604
Yeah, 2 billion people are overweight now.

1104
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:38,034
Yay,

1105
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:41,850
whatever. All right. So the moral of this story is

1106
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,709
you, you, you have to work with other groups, you have to use third party software.

1107
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,229
And so I guess our trick now

1108
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,030
is how do we vet third party software?

1109
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,149
And, and I don't think we're going to answer that today

1110
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:58,830
because that could be probably a, a 10 part episode if we wanted to cover it.

1111
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,030
But II, I think that's becoming the new issue and,

1112
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,419
and I see a lot of people are being like, oh, open source bad.

1113
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,830
But in reality it's like,

1114
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:12,129
it's, it's just a tool. You know, it, it, it's your hammerer. Now. Go find some nails.

1115
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,780
Well, more to the point. You're,

1116
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,139
what choice do you have?

1117
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,360
-- You don't, you don't have, like,
-- do you remember?

1118
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:19,729
I mean,

1119
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:24,500
I remember when there were several very successful closed source web servers,

1120
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:26,979
-- they're mostly dead
-- now.

1121
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:30,870
-- I the Microsoft one is still around, isn't it
-- true?

1122
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:33,010
But that's only because, you know, Microsoft,

1123
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:34,879
-- but nobody else can afford to
-- do

1124
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:35,110
that.

1125
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,560
Yeah, the other big one was what the, the Netscape

1126
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,080
-- Netscape
-- had one,

1127
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,870
had one

1128
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,429
and so

1129
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,010
had one and there was that one from that

1130
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,370
company in Italy that was actually really quite,

1131
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:47,030
quite efficient and nice.

1132
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,389
Um

1133
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,969
I can't remember the names anymore. They're just

1134
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,709
gone to the winds of time

1135
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,479
and, you know, the more successful one now is while Engen

1136
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,169
X, which is, of course, open source and Apache, the granddaddy, open source,

1137
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,219
you know, so

1138
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,840
although the Google web server serves a lot of traffic,

1139
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,000
not that anyone can run it but them, but I don't even know what that is.

1140
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,149
If it's just some bastardized Apache or if,

1141
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,639
or if they've, they've written their own.

1142
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:19,280
My suspicion is it's probably a whole bunch of open source put together.

1143
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,840
Uh I think they're smart enough to

1144
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,300
not completely suffer from not invented

1145
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,610
here syndrome unless it's absolutely necessary,

1146
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,520
like, say the chrome web browser.

1147
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,800
But even that uses it

1148
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:31,669
a

1149
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:31,879
bunch

1150
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:32,179
of

1151
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,340
-- other
-- stuff. It wasn't not invented here.

1152
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,780
It's just when Web KT became difficult to work with, they had to fork

1153
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,040
and I don't, I don't blame them for that.

1154
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,899
I, I remember when that happened, it was, it was kind of messed up.

1155
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:46,060
I think I was on the security team when that happened.

1156
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,159
I was on the web KT security team at one point.

1157
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,629
I was, I assigned other CV S

1158
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,149
man. That was a long time ago. I forgot that was even a thing.

1159
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,300
Anyway. Anyway,

1160
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,929
it's, it's time to call it. I think any funny thoughts, Kurt.

1161
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:02,550
Uh

1162
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,399
Yeah, I don't know, hobby farming. It sounds fun but

1163
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:08,879
terrible.

1164
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:09,290
Like

1165
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:13,919
I love that I can go buy fruits and vegetables at the grocery store.

1166
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,780
Yeah, I think fundamentally, I mean, specialization of economic labor. It's,

1167
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,989
it works.

1168
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:21,739
Yes, it does.

1169
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes, it does.

1170
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:23,830
All right, man.

1171
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,229
Thank you, everybody for listening.

1172
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,300
Thank you, Kurt for a, a enlightening conversation.

1173
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,949
As always, we'll have the show notes at open source Security podcast.com.

1174
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:36,489
We have all kinds of crazy stuff this week to talk about.

1175
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:40,790
You can use the Pound Os S podcast. Hashtag to get a hold of us.

1176
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,669
We have links to Twitter and Facebook there you can use and if nothing else,

1177
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:45,070
thank you.

1178
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,550
Everyone for listening. Kurt. You have a fantastic rest of your day.

1179
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:50,429
You too.
