Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:11,470
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,979
So, what's new? I think it's summer. I got the pool out or splashing around in it.

3
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,750
The water's 11 degrees. So it's a little chilly.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,440
-- But you know, it's fun for like 10 seconds.
-- All right.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,760
So I need to address a couple of points to your statement. First of all,

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,409
the thermometer where I live disagrees with you.

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,779
It is not summer in any way. The weather has been absolutely terrible.

8
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:38,005
But more importantly, this is a podcast which gets recorded and then played at a,

9
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,284
an unknown time

10
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:42,525
for the various listeners we have.

11
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:47,244
So it may not be summer for the people listening or maybe I'll just

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,205
hold this episode now until fall and make you sound like an idiot.

13
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,715
Well, that's a very northeast view of the globe.

14
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:53,845
I have to say,

15
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,340
-- I mean,
-- what about

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,810
you talked about summer?

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,849
Well, if you hold this till fall, then it'll be summer in Australia

18
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,750
-- check
-- mate.

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,599
Well, it would be our fall. I'm comfortable

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,809
speaking

21
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,480
in the context of where we live because you

22
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,290
and I both live in the northern hemisphere,

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,290
very north in the northern hemisphere at that.

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,410
And so I'm comfortable saying the various seasons and expecting

25
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:21,459
our above average intelligence listeners to sort it out.

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,050
Do we have any data on that? Actually,

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,029
that our listeners are above average?

28
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,989
Well, they listen to us, I mean, that's all the data I need.

29
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,190
This is true or maybe, maybe that makes them below average intelligence.

30
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,190
I don't know.

31
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,069
Anyway. Anyway, um So for what it's worth though, uh Spotify

32
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:41,739
has various like demographic data and whatnot on,

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,709
on people because obviously they're Spotify and,

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,629
and they do give some of that and we have uh

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,800
we are predominantly male, mostly the West, obviously.

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, the, the, the I would say the,

37
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,639
so what you're saying is our listeners look like we do

38
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,599
probably.

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,739
And the core of the listeners are like about 18

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,319
to 40 make up probably 80% of the listeners,

41
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,050
which I mean,

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,480
none of this given AAA Security podcast should shock anybody.

43
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,580
-- I mean, so
-- what you're saying is a tech podcast by two older white guys,

44
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,419
is listened to by a lot of

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,729
-- medium
-- to older white guys. We'll say um Yeah, yeah,

46
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:20,570
it, it right, right now, I will say though we're not, we are like our, our, the,

47
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:25,710
the countries are very split about half North America, half the rest of the world,

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,710
which does make me very happy because

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,589
I would view it as a failure on our part. If it was only North Americans listening to us

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,500
jab around about whatever nonsense it is we talk about.

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,690
Anyway. Anyway, speaking of nonsense,

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,619
uh, we're going to talk about what we'll call, issue 101 today.

53
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:43,500
And

54
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,100
I will give the, the brief overview for everyone since

55
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,589
it's kind of my fault

56
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,889
that this issue is worth talking about.

57
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,669
So,

58
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,479
for anyone who's been paying attention in the world

59
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,250
of security for the last probably couple years now,

60
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,820
there is a group called the Open Source Security Foundation,

61
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,070
which is part of the Linux Foundation,

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,669
which I always love the foundation in a foundation foundation section or whatever.

63
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,550
So the the we're gonna call it the open SSF for

64
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,759
the rest of this conversation because it's easier to say.

65
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,139
So the open SSF has a group called the Tech, the Technical Advisory

66
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:20,300
Council Council. I wouldn't want to say committee, but it's not committee,

67
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,490
Technical Advisory Council, the Tech

68
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,240
and I'm a member of the Tech.

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,740
So I obviously pay attention to what goes on and I

70
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,089
get involved in the discussions and all this kind of stuff.

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,229
And it's meant to be kind of like a,

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,250
a group that helped shepherd along the technical decisions

73
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,889
of the open SSF right?

74
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,830
There's the governing board which is supposed to be

75
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,910
like the people with a bunch of money,

76
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,490
the council.

77
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,009
Um

78
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,809
Sure,

79
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,600
sure, we'll say that.

80
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,550
Uh So anyway, anyway,

81
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:50,110
someone created an issue,

82
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,419
issue 101 that basically asked a question,

83
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,990
what is a healthy number of maintainers for an open source project?

84
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:56,949
And of course,

85
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,190
in the past it's seven.

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,880
I, I mean, it sure, why not? It can be whatever you want. I don't care.

87
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,070
And, and here's what I will say.

88
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,330
I think we could all agree.

89
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,929
It's not one I would actually disagree. We'll get to that.

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,910
I think ideally

91
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,149
you want an open source project with more than one person.

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,670
Because if, if I'm the only maintainer and I get hit by a bus or I get sick or I get busy,

93
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,489
no, nothing happens. Right.

94
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,790
Well, no, not true. I mean,

95
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,920
people can hijack the project, they can fork the project.

96
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,070
I would actually argue that having,

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,980
and, and I love that you, you keep saying one maintainer when,

98
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:39,019
what you actually mean is a fraction of a maintainer because none

99
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,170
of these maintainers are working full time on that one project.

100
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:45,309
And from when I've looked at various ecosystems,

101
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,690
-- there's a lot of maintainers with more than one package to their name.
-- That's true.

102
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:49,920
Ok.

103
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,369
Hang on, hang on, hang on. We'll, we'll get to this.

104
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,290
I wanna, I wanna set, set the stage first. So

105
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,299
there's,

106
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,890
there's this conversation asking what's the right number.

107
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,079
And of course, everyone chimes in with like, oh, you know, we need a number and,

108
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:05,010
and whatever, and one is bad and all this stuff and, and then

109
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,970
I have a bunch of N PM data which we've talked about in the past on the podcast.

110
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,769
I'm, I'm working on a white paper

111
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,630
and I'm like, well, I can answer this question.

112
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,850
So I take the graph of the M PM packages and I say, look, it's predominantly one,

113
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,029
like we need to keep this in mind in this discussion because saying

114
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,809
every project needs to have two maintainers is fine to say,

115
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:26,440
but

116
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,519
where are you going to come up with literally millions of extra maintainers, right?

117
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,630
-- That that's a completely ridiculous
-- goal,

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,790
-- not even just the maintainers, but the time and effort to do this.
-- Sure. Right.

119
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,230
Well, I consider that part of part of the equation, right?

120
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,429
Like saying, Kurt, we need a million open source maintainers.

121
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,649
What now we're gonna be like,

122
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,500
no, it's just not, that's not happening, right?

123
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,130
You can't do it, it's just not, not realistic. So I put this graph on

124
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,250
and of course, this is where

125
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,049
the human condition kicks in.

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,859
And someone says, oh, but this is all N PM packages.

127
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,399
What if we look at the important M PM packages?

128
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,989
So I'm like that makes sense. Let's look at the important M PM packages.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,869
So I take the top 5% by downloads over the last year, right?

130
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,829
Which feels like a good way to measure this

131
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,440
and the graphs

132
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:13,869
are identical.

133
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,359
I mean, and that's a fair question because like for N PM and a bunch of others,

134
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,519
there's like tutorials on,

135
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,510
you know, here's how to build a package and push it into N PM.

136
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,980
And so I would expect there to be

137
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,269
of those 26 million releases, at least

138
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:29,279
100,000 to a million ballpark figure, you know, logarithmic

139
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:34,829
would be a developer, tried it out, pushed up one release, did a release

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,250
and then ignored it forever,

141
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,630
you know,

142
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,890
and that's,

143
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,220
and we can ignore that data because who cares? Right. Right.

144
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,519
But yeah, if it's top 5% by downloads, you, you,

145
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,459
-- those are by definition the packages that kind of probably matter
-- here.

146
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,100
II, I just pulled up the numbers. So I have

147
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:56,410
the number by, by download, right? Of the percentiles of all the packages.

148
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,059
So you gave me an idea. 50th percentile, meaning

149
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,875
the dead middle of what is it? 28 million.

150
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:06,434
So you're talking what, 14 ish million packages have 219 downloads or less

151
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:07,484
like

152
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:11,244
that's zero as far as I'm concerned.

153
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:14,265
Well, and again, I assume a lot of that is companies, well,

154
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:15,904
like yours that scan all this stuff and they

155
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,364
just downloading this stuff because when you mentioned,

156
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,674
I think what was the magic number was?

157
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,595
95 was one of the magic numbers?

158
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:25,600
Uh 90 0, I forget what the 95 number was.

159
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:28,829
Well, I, I suspect that's just somebody has run their script 95 times

160
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,480
that

161
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,630
when, when you look at the number of downloads just as an aggregate for some reason,

162
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,769
95 downloads has a significantly higher peak than any

163
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,269
of the other data around that particular number for.

164
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,149
But you're right, it's because somebody downloaded,

165
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,920
like they have a script that ran 995 times when I checked it and well,

166
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,519
probably 94 because all those developers that downloaded it once,

167
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,980
made sure it worked on the tutorial and then abandoned it

168
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:55,410
and see and

169
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,200
to go into a Segway. But

170
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,880
like Apple on the Apple Store has apparently done a

171
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,519
thing recently where apps that have not been updated for.

172
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,869
I forget the number, it's like 18 months or two years or three years.

173
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,390
Somewhere in there are being kind of kicked out. Part of me is like,

174
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,839
well, we should sort of get rid of dead code. But part of me is also like,

175
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,380
my kids are still pissed off that there are some apps

176
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,239
that no longer work on current versions of I OS.

177
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,869
Like the original Disney Draw program was far superior to the current one.

178
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,940
In my opinion, it was simpler and better or the original Lego Duplo game with the,

179
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,239
you know, with the bunny rabbit and the draft having their adventure,

180
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,239
it's gone and it,

181
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,440
it makes my son cry that it's gone,

182
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,119
you know,

183
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,150
and

184
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:34,808
also more,

185
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,820
this isn't like a server application that's like processing credit cards.

186
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,119
It's a bloody children's game,

187
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,280
right?

188
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,559
So, like, as much as I had to say there's a lot of, like my mom, I love my mom but she,

189
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,119
for the longest time kept an original Sony Netbook with

190
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,330
Windows 95 because it had the version of Solitaire she liked

191
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,280
and you know what,

192
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,960
fine it's not connected to the internet and she literally used it to play Solitaire.

193
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,349
Yeah.

194
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,150
Yeah. What's, what is, like, there's

195
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,989
the only possible harm is that her

196
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,270
cat kept chewing the keys off the keyboard because they, I don't know,

197
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,349
whatever it was of a, that specific keyboard

198
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,330
was like, he just, the, the way they were,

199
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,530
the cat loved ripping those keys off that keyboard.

200
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,549
You know what already is gonna swallow one. Right.

201
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,159
Awesome. Anyway. Ok. I want, I want to get back to this data.

202
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:21,599
I, I wanna let me spout out some more numbers before we move on just so I,

203
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:24,669
I want to set the, the stage here for everyone to understand.

204
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:24,960
Right.

205
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,210
290 downloads. F percentile.

206
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,419
95th percentile is 22,000 downloads, which is not a lot, in my opinion.

207
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:33,429
I think we're reaching the,

208
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,830
this is probably used by somebody territory but I don't think,

209
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,400
well, 22,000,

210
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,669
I mean, if somebody's actually using that package, they're gonna download it

211
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,099
at least a few dozen times because

212
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:48,659
like, when I think about the CS A, like, we're not a very aggressive shop.

213
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,570
We only do like a new build two or three times a week. So

214
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:54,650
that's like 100 100 and 50 downloads a year.

215
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,340
Every developer is going to download a copy of the package every,

216
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,070
every time you run your C I test,

217
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,250
you know what I mean? So 22,000 is not a lot in my opinion,

218
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,150
but

219
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,979
that's 95th percentile. 99th percentile is 1.2 million, which is still not a lot.

220
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:14,919
Now, now, the one thing I will say is when we hit 99 percentile, actually, no,

221
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:15,650
it's higher than that.

222
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,200
It's the top 1000 packages in N PM.

223
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,020
Then we see the split is almost 5050 for one maintainer versus not one maintainer.

224
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,059
-- It's still slightly higher on one maintainer. Yeah, but
-- still 50% 1 maintainer.

225
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,460
That's

226
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,909
like you can't argue with that number. It's not like 5% or 10%. It's 50%

227
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,190
and that number

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,309
is one trillion downloads.

229
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,070
That's where we land for the top 1000. So think about that.

230
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,219
-- Those are clearly used literally everywhere on the planet.
-- Like left shift, right?

231
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,729
When left shift or whatever it was called got nuked. And it broke

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,966
literally all of the, the internet because

233
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,476
anyway, anyway, OK, hang on. We're,

234
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,885
we're 10 minutes in and I'm not even done talking about the issue. All right.

235
00:10:56,945 --> 00:11:00,346
So we, I post the second graph and everyone's like, oh my goodness.

236
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:04,606
So then David Wheeler, friend of the show who we both, you know, know and love.

237
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:05,846
David's like, OK,

238
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,945
let N PM is special because N PM is,

239
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,565
yeah, it's short code snippets.

240
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,702
It focuses on very these small packages that do like one thing.

241
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:15,901
So of course,

242
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:19,341
exactly. Of course M PM has

243
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,372
one maintainer packages.

244
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,182
Python will be different.

245
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,002
So I'm like

246
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:28,781
I can do this. So anyway, I I the, the the story of this is really funny.

247
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,921
So David sends this and I I write a script to start downloading data from the pipe.

248
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:33,421
The,

249
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:39,651
-- the PPP YP I is like the Python version of N PM.
-- Yeah, the Python package index.

250
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,372
Is that what it stands for? I actually don't know

251
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,109
-- that's what's in my head
-- probably.

252
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,010
And if it's not that anyway.

253
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,640
Yeah, the Python package index boo yah 20 years of knowledge pays off.

254
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:56,460
I start downloading the data and it's gonna take eight days because the Python

255
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,260
I, I can't get it from the rest.

256
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,460
API I have to go to the XML R PC interface and let me do one query every two seconds.

257
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:05,690
You have to hit every package and there's 300,000 packages, right?

258
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,559
And then funny enough a guy I work with his name is Weston.

259
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,700
Weston's like, oh, hey, I found all the data on, on, in that

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,559
github repo of all the Python stuff and

261
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,280
it's like current and it's updated every week.

262
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,219
I'm like, holy crap.

263
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:18,900
You just, and so literally like 10 minutes after Weston,

264
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:22,570
I know 10 minutes after Weston sends this to me, I've got the data in,

265
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,169
I generate the graph

266
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,010
-- and it's exactly the same.
-- Of course, it is, dude.

267
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,010
If you did this for like, I'm trying to think of.

268
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,520
Probably one of the earliest ones would be C

269
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,250
A the Comprehensive Pearl Archive Network.

270
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,070
I bet you that it would be the exact same picture

271
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,289
-- at this point.
-- So,

272
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,169
so every step of the way

273
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,609
I've fallen in the human trap of being like, oh, of course, it will be different

274
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,554
and, and hasn't, and I, I've reached a point now.

275
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,924
It's like, I'm pretty sure this is reality.

276
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,215
And so if you read the issue,

277
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,585
I will put issue 101 in the show notes because it is a fascinating read.

278
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,835
But at the end, I'm basically like, look, this is the open source.

279
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:58,065
We have, we can talk about wanting more maintainers and all this other stuff.

280
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,375
But the reality is

281
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,679
there's no way to do that without a massive influx of resources, resources,

282
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,390
mostly being money in this context.

283
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,190
But like

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,950
there's just, it, it's unrealistic to expect

285
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,630
any significant number of open source packages to

286
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,190
be maintained by more than one person,

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,989
I think at this point.

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,270
And so we have to think about that now, like this

289
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,570
is the constraint of reality. What does that mean?

290
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,289
I would say it's even more subtle than that.

291
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,130
It's not just the existing world we have,

292
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,890
this is clearly the world we have going forwards probably forever

293
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,530
because when you look at how hard is it to convince somebody else

294
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,729
to work for free on something?

295
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:37,309
-- It's very hard that worked
-- on

296
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,900
you.

297
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:38,400
Yeah.

298
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,099
-- But I mean,
-- like we both do this podcast for free.

299
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,510
The second thing is I would argue that it's actually better

300
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,799
to have this ecosystem with a whole bunch of packages with

301
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:51,000
one person because it forces us to look at things like,

302
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,039
well, what do we do if that developer is not responsive?

303
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,280
Well, and for example, the uh because what if the like,

304
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,000
what if the developer is actively malicious?

305
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,739
So we just had that happen in the crate rust

306
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,599
ecosystem where there was a malicious package called Rust decimal.

307
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,679
Uh that didn't have the hyphen and it was basically typo squatting

308
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,479
and it's clearly malicious because it's sending like

309
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:13,330
api keys for AWS to a Hiroko instance.

310
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,780
Like

311
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,369
that's not an oopsies. I made a mistake that is like, I

312
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:21,219
I'm harvesting credentials to a Hiroko system

313
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:22,760
that you know, that I run.

314
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,840
And so, you know, the, the, the, the rust crate security team was like, yeah, no,

315
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:28,880
not cool boof.

316
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,530
And they killed it.

317
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,169
To me, the correct answer here is not, you can't get a million more developers.

318
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,010
So like, don't even

319
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,169
try or pretend.

320
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,280
But what you can do is you can get those,

321
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,299
you know, seven or eight people

322
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,380
to be in charge of the ecosystem and the security to be like, ok,

323
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,520
this package is really sort of important.

324
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,479
The developer is not responsive because maybe they're

325
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,500
dead or they're on vacation or who knows,

326
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,859
and we need to push this patch in

327
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,500
and you have a process for that,

328
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,099
right?

329
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:56,210
Or a process to transfer ownership of that package to somebody else

330
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,500
who actively wants to maintain it a bit more or whatever.

331
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,739
Like, for example, I took over ownership of two Fedora packages, uh PHP open ID and I,

332
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,090
the media wiki plug in thing

333
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,250
because I needed them to work and they were broken

334
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,299
and they needed like a quick little update.

335
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,690
And there was a process where I'm basically like

336
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,809
the developer of this package hasn't done anything for,

337
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,979
I think it was like three years.

338
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,099
I'm like, it's, they're, they don't care,

339
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:23,940
like just give it to me and so I can fix it, please.

340
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,900
And then of course,

341
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,789
I fixed it and went to ignoring it and nobody cared because who cared.

342
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,229
Like it's,

343
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,000
-- and that's the thing. It's kind of dead software.
-- Right. Right.

344
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,500
You know, now,

345
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,719
now here is

346
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,219
something else to just overcomplicate.

347
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:39,580
This is, I think it was literally yesterday from the time we were recording this,

348
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,059
there were

349
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,719
two vector packages found uh

350
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,599
phpass which Ph Pass or, or maybe PHP

351
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,570
si don't know whichever it's fine.

352
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,409
And then uh a Python package called CTX and they were

353
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,770
harvesting Amazon credentials again and shipping them off to I think,

354
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,780
I don't know if it was a Hiroko instant whatever.

355
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,409
It doesn't matter like they were shipping them off somewhere. And

356
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,380
the PHP

357
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,909
as, every time I say it like that's all I think

358
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,940
I will do my best to call it Ph Pass. Uh PH Pass was an instance where

359
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,409
the package was available on github.

360
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,270
And I guess that's how you installed it is you

361
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,570
type some magic into what pair is the PHP package manager

362
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,760
and pair would reach out to github and download the package.

363
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,799
The the original maintainer deleted their github

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,710
account in 2019. And then the attacker recreated the same user

365
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,020
name, put the same stuff there

366
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,460
and, and I don't know how many times this was downloaded.

367
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:37,409
My guess it wasn't very many if the package was disappeared for a couple of years.

368
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,489
But you get the idea

369
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,250
like here, here's a great ex.

370
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,219
This is a great counterexample to saying, oh,

371
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:44,260
we need more than one maintainer because with

372
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,530
only one shenanigans like this can happen.

373
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,109
Well, and that well,

374
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,969
but that speaks again to the need for having

375
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,979
a mechanism for that one maintainer to go.

376
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,359
Hey, I don't care about this anymore. Can I, can I give it to somebody else or to some

377
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:56,159
hold in this?

378
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:57,830
That's fair.

379
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,229
Um And the other thing is I forget who it said on Twitter.

380
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,719
But basically, if you register something with a custom domain name,

381
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,270
now you have to keep that domain name alive forever,

382
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,469
you know, and that's the thing with name spaces like github,

383
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,358
name space or domain name, email name space

384
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,270
if something is registered to like an email address or a get up account or whatever.

385
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,949
Yeah, that name space now kind of matters.

386
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,824
And again, I think that speaks more to the need of not having multiple developers

387
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,704
but having a way to sort of surrender your pa

388
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,994
like to put your package up for adoption basically.

389
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:29,814
I mean, yeah,

390
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,584
and also for the tooling to be a bit smarter and

391
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,954
to not blindly like a great example is why did PHP pair

392
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:37,295
go? Oh that

393
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,214
like that github

394
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:41,974
URL is now 404. We need to scrub this package from the index.

395
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,199
I mean, I

396
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:44,359
should have

397
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
II I do agree.

398
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,160
I think it should have been definitely because then I guess they, they flipped

399
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:56,079
the package to some other fork as like the official copy.

400
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:00,430
But yeah, like I, I agree, I think if, if it 40 fours don't, don't point there.

401
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,359
Well, or, or if it's 40 fours for like a month stop

402
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,930
like 1404. Sure, maybe don't kill it yet,

403
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
but like a month of 40 fours.

404
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:09,890
And also the

405
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,199
Yeah.

406
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,560
Well,

407
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:14,390
and this also speaks to the to the having somebody

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,290
like um because it was sneak that was doing this

409
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,130
finding all the sort of typo squatting or, you know,

410
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,239
suspiciously similar package names

411
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,569
or just suspiciously similar or a suspicious package names, like,

412
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,609
like one was like aws something, something,

413
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,640
um,

414
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,469
you know, pretending to, like, be the Aws SDK or whatever.

415
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,550
And so again, somebody, you know, there needs to be a process for, hey,

416
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,380
I found this package.

417
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,709
It's got this kind of like official sounding name.

418
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,229
It has nothing to do with them and it appears to do, like,

419
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:44,630
it downloads a binary from over using curl from this random system.

420
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,569
Like, can we please boot this package out of the ecosystem?

421
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:48,750
And I think

422
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,250
things like that are far more important than getting more maintainers because

423
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,750
fixing, even if you get more than one maintainer per package,

424
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,439
you still have the malicious maintainer issue,

425
00:18:57,449 --> 00:19:01,829
you still have the domain uh the typo, the, the spell check squatting issues,

426
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,150
you still have the stuff that

427
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,949
like dies and then

428
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,770
gets hijacked by an attacker.

429
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,739
You still have all these things and for that, you need some

430
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:14,189
governing security body kind of which a lot of these ecosystems have.

431
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,869
But I think what they need to do now and I

432
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,140
think this is where you and your group should go is

433
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,869
coming up with some best practices and some strategies that

434
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,670
so that they're kind of doing it in similar ways because I,

435
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,099
I feel like there are some best practices here, this, you know,

436
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,339
N PM and PP and

437
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,709
Creighton Rust, I feel like, you know,

438
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,750
there's 90% overlap on how they're going to operate.

439
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,329
Long term.

440
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,869
In fact,

441
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,560
they have a working group,

442
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,410
the various packaging ecosystem leaders have a like subgroup as part

443
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,069
of the open SSF to talk about all of these problems,

444
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,780
like to just come together and discuss it.

445
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,189
So,

446
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,150
so they're, I mean,

447
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,910
they're working on it, of course, it's under the open SSF umbrella,

448
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,959
but they're literally like they, they self, they constructed,

449
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,280
I don't know what it is, self organized.

450
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,020
I guess you'd call it

451
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,900
like they, they're doing this on their own.

452
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,380
This is not driven by the Linux Foundation, which is great. Now.

453
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,459
It's also wonderful that the open SSF gives them like a place to come

454
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,420
and, and be seen, which is also important, I think.

455
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,630
Well, it's like literally in their name, the Open Source Security Foundation,

456
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,939
I feel like they should be providing

457
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,939
resources to open

458
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,770
source ecosystems to do security stuff within.

459
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm cautiously optimistic anytime

460
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,449
any new organization emerges. Because I think you and I have both seen

461
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:30,589
a countless number of open source security groups

462
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:31,829
will say,

463
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:32,739
I would say,

464
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,709
-- and die as quickly as they appeared.
-- I would say there's something special here

465
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,380
in that these people are already doing useful work.

466
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,780
I, I agree. I agree. Anyway. OK. OK.

467
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,050
Before we get in a hole,

468
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,160
I want to talk about something really important you accidentally touched on,

469
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,650
I think, but I think it is the key to this discussion

470
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,479
is

471
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:56,000
when we talk about these kind of problems, we often talk about prevention

472
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,459
as the key, right?

473
00:20:57,469 --> 00:21:02,395
Where we need to prevent this from happening by, I, I argued with Dan Lawrence,

474
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,255
uh yesterday on Twitter last night about

475
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,185
what pinning dependencies and just because I can

476
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:07,094
and, and

477
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,175
where it'll never die.

478
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:11,535
But you know what I mean? There's like, oh, we have to prevent it.

479
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,084
We have to take these actions that will prevent the bad thing.

480
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:18,734
But the reality is, I think if we look at the history of security, especially,

481
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,295
we remember when we obsessed over endpoint protection,

482
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:24,604
antivirus spam filtering, like all this stuff.

483
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,974
And the reality is prevention,

484
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,790
generally speaking, is ineffective.

485
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,910
What is effective is having the ability to observe what's going on,

486
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,189
see bad things happening and quickly respond.

487
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,829
Well, one thing subtly is prevention implies that,

488
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,530
you know what the problem is and how to solve it.

489
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,650
-- Well, that's just
-- it.

490
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:43,839
And

491
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:44,229
so,

492
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
I

493
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:44,979
mean, and that's

494
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:46,290
a great example of

495
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,209
that works in more mature industries.

496
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,160
Like, so for example,

497
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,959
I actually bought a copy of and read our local electrical code

498
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:54,130
book and I loved reading it because I'd be reading it.

499
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,630
I'm like, 00, what if?

500
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,930
And then two paragraphs later, they're like,

501
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,709
so that's why you use an armored cable because

502
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,130
if some poor schmuck drives a nail through it,

503
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,869
they don't die.

504
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,699
You know, like there's literally

505
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,040
reading this thing.

506
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,030
It's like, it's real clear that a whole bunch of people got electrocuted and dead

507
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,930
and they post mortem it and then added that

508
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:12,969
to the code to prevent that from happening.

509
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,599
And so now like

510
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,170
if you have an up to code electrical system,

511
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,310
which almost nobody has because like you're supposed to have AFC I breakers

512
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,050
on all your outlets now and those things cost like 200 bucks.

513
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,550
-- Like they are horrifically expensive. I think
-- you only need.

514
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,660
No, they're not that expensive.

515
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:26,800
A

516
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:27,329
lot.

517
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,079
Old code was bedrooms. New code is,

518
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:31,459
is it all of them?

519
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,520
-- Dude,
-- they prevent fighters.

520
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:34,400
They're,

521
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,550
and when you think about it, yeah, they're expensive.

522
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,270
But spending like 2000 bucks on AFC I

523
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,150
breakers is cheaper than burning down your house.

524
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,209
-- Typically.
-- I agree. Well, look, they're, they're not that,

525
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,589
so I just bought some, not too long ago.

526
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,670
They're like 200 bucks now up here.

527
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,630
Oh, well, in the shortage, I mean,

528
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,150
-- that's true too because when I bought them there
-- was two by fours or $10 each.

529
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,910
-- There were
-- many, many

530
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,300
breakers at the hardware store and the regular ones were like 10 bucks and

531
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,250
AFC,

532
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:01,849
the GFCI, I

533
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,939
think between 2040 depending

534
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,420
upon

535
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,219
we need to do some arbitrage because up here again they're like 100 bucks.

536
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:11,500
I will go, I don't know if that's legal. Remind me.

537
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,020
And when I go to the hardware store next time I will look for you.

538
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,229
But remember this was in the before times I bought these.

539
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,449
So I also made the poor decision of going

540
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,339
with Stab Lock and their factory burned down.

541
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:22,770
No, I'm serious.

542
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
Like the fact that Stab Lock factory and wherever in the US burnt down

543
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,810
a bunch and like there's been a shortage of stab lock brand breakers.

544
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:31,390
Like, yeah, if you're Federal pioneer seamens, whatever,

545
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,550
you're fine but like stab lock.

546
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,410
Yeah. No, tough.

547
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,650
So, anyways, but back to this, like we'll talk later,

548
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,930
I think. So, prevention is nice, but prevention implies that you're actually

549
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,329
doing good prevention like seatbelts, you know,

550
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,770
three point seatbelts turns out work really well.

551
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,290
But Volvo did a ton of crash tests to figure that out

552
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,079
and I feel like a lot of the prevention in the N PM and pi pi ecosystems

553
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:57,530
are the packages with more than one maintainer doing

554
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:00,410
better than the packages with just one maintainer.

555
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,489
What do you mean by better? Exactly?

556
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:03,670
I mean,

557
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,550
is there an actual benefit to having more than

558
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,380
one maintainer from like a security point of view?

559
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,599
-- Does it actually
-- matter?

560
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:12,099
The the data I can pull on that is I can what? What?

561
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,989
And this is, you just gave me some ideas. I can pull

562
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,400
uh update frequency on more than one maintainer. I'm also now I want to also pull like

563
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:21,540
do

564
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,280
do packages with more maintainers, like update their dependencies more often

565
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,469
because I don't know, I I mean, II I can answer that

566
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,319
in theory, they should because they have more resources to fix stuff,

567
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,630
-- the person
-- one would think, but we will find out

568
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,910
again. We don't have to guess because when we guess we're just making crap up.

569
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,020
But also I can look at uh are there more

570
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,469
CV ES for packages with multiple maintainers versus packages without?

571
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,430
And, and now I can tell you the one data, the one graph I do have

572
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,699
is the top 5% of those packages

573
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,540
have.

574
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:01,979
On average, most of the multiple CV ES, most N PM packages have one CV E, right.

575
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:06,099
But the packages with multiple CV ES are generally speaking in that

576
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,829
top 5% which I don't think should surprise anyone where people look.

577
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,729
But I Exactly. Right. It's like with the drunk looking under the light for his keys.

578
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:14,790
Exactly that.

579
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,589
But

580
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,550
we can prove that, which is

581
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,469
I love.

582
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,859
Well, the other thing to keep in mind too is you're operating on a scale.

583
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,989
So you're actually the thing.

584
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,290
And I think this is part of the problem too is a lot of security.

585
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,310
People are not used to operating at scale,

586
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,119
they're used to operating within a company where it's like a sample size of one.

587
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:37,050
You're operating on a sample size of hundreds of thousands of unique packages,

588
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,510
26 million releases.

589
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,349
And the problem there is is we, we can't,

590
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,780
while we can draw conclusions and learn things,

591
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,680
it's more of a bell. Curve of conclusions.

592
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:47,119
Like

593
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,339
it's not more maintainers better.

594
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,400
It's like, no, on average, statistically speaking,

595
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,900
maybe more maintainers is better.

596
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,880
It's not necessarily always better. Right.

597
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,729
Because for example,

598
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:57,040
there's gonna be dysfunctional groups out

599
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,859
there where more maintainers is just worse

600
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:00,619
and then there's going to be the,

601
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,939
the highly competent benevolent dictator for life who

602
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,180
doesn't want to share their package with anybody.

603
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,180
Yep. Yep. Exactly. And,

604
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:08,579
and I think this is,

605
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:11,250
so it's funny you say that that's something I've been kicking

606
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,819
around internally at work about like some messaging and whatnot is

607
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:17,290
the security as security people.

608
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,530
We love to obsess over like individual vulnerabilities or individual events.

609
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,449
When the reality is we need to take a step back and we need to look at

610
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,459
this data kind of an aggregate and understand

611
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,670
like what are the patterns we're seeing emerging?

612
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:32,949
What does like the overall vulnerability universe look like?

613
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,290
So you can say, oh, this package has a critical issue, you have to fix it but it's like

614
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:40,449
let's zoom out a little bit and look like what is, how many issues are there total?

615
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:40,780
Like

616
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:43,439
this, this package has one critical issue

617
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,310
and three other issues.

618
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,770
This package has no critical issues and 700 mediums like that is,

619
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,089
well, I can give you an even simpler example. Remember, was it a month ago?

620
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:53,930
You're like, oh my God,

621
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:57,290
like Oracle did a security release with like over 100 CV S and I'm like,

622
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
yeah, that's, that's how that works.

623
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,250
Like every quarter they released like 200 ish plus CV ES.

624
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,530
-- It was,
-- I thought it was bigger than normal but you,

625
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,500
you assure me it's not and I never looked into it.

626
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,030
But yes,

627
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,719
well, since I started tracking them back at like,

628
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,260
eyesight and I defense which should be in the late two thousands.

629
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:13,660
Like

630
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,640
they've been doing this for like, that's

631
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,479
how it's been for over 10 years.

632
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,630
And so clearly, it's not,

633
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,469
I mean, it's not great, but it's not

634
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:21,630
a

635
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,260
world ending problem. Same with Microsoft.

636
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,180
Everybody's like, oh my God, this Microsoft past Tuesday was really bad.

637
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:27,180
There was like a zero day

638
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,260
that's in the wild that they finally fixed. And I'm like,

639
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:32,800
do you know how many times I've experienced that? Like, on average, twice a year?

640
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,810
Well, like twice a year for over a decade. Like, it's just,

641
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,209
you know,

642
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:38,750
uh

643
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,810
Yeah.

644
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:40,849
Yeah.

645
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:44,280
-- No, II, I like,
-- it's at scale

646
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,699
and I think again,

647
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:49,939
like most people don't read 50,000 security reports over a decade.

648
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,979
Uh or, you know, work at like Red Hat and handle thousands of CV S per year.

649
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:55,670
Again. They,

650
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:55,890
you

651
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,750
folks, this is what happens to you,

652
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,790
right? Well, it's, but again, it's like, I just, I'm reminded of Bison. It's like,

653
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,270
you know, yeah, like for you,

654
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,800
that was the worst day of your life when I came

655
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,739
in and destroyed your village and burnt down and everything.

656
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,729
And, like, for me that was, that was a Tuesday,

657
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:09,849
you know,

658
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,920
same thing with firemen doctors. It's like,

659
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,170
yeah, I'm sorry, your house burnt down.

660
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,140
But, like, I mean, it's lunchtime and I'm hungry.

661
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,250
-- I
-- got, I haven't

662
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,469
done

663
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,510
burning house. I've got to go help out with.

664
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:21,260
Yeah.

665
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,189
So,

666
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,619
and I think that's part of the problem is how do you work at scale?

667
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,489
And there's very few jobs that work at scale like this,

668
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,170
like even within a fortune 100 company,

669
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,619
you're kind of like definitely up the scale ladder,

670
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:33,989
but you're still not,

671
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,400
you know, dealing with,

672
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,189
well, you also have to deal with it over years to see these trends, right?

673
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,329
Because there's have been definite trends over the years,

674
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:43,760
right? The industry has changed over years,

675
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,939
you know, Microsoft has gotten better in some ways and in other ways, it's like,

676
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,739
well, we discussed this with our security scale thing where it's just,

677
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:52,579
they're, they're pushing out so much more code and stuff that, like,

678
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,660
they still have a ton of vulnerabilities.

679
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,349
But

680
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,500
when you look at the size of Windows 11 now, it's like what a couple of gigabytes

681
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,900
that was at one point like the entire open source ecosystem,

682
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,680
right? You are right.

683
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,670
Yes. Like I, my first Linux came on 52 floppy disk.

684
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:13,050
It had gooey, it had text editors, it had everything,

685
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:16,430
52 floppy disk, slackware, 1.1

686
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:17,719
you know. Oh,

687
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,760
my goodness.

688
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,849
And what really annoys me is we've never had the ability to

689
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,349
process this data at scale

690
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,209
because like

691
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:29,630
now you can get a laptop with 32 gigs of RA M and a ton of storage and a

692
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,910
ton of CPU and slap an elastic instance on it and import half a terabyte of data and,

693
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,910
and start manipulating and modeling it

694
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,709
and even better is

695
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,589
these ecosystems matter.

696
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,270
But they like, basically, there's no, I don't want to say there's no,

697
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,030
there's like there's nobody doing N PM outside of the like no js.org ecosystem.

698
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,750
Apart from a few crazy people like Google

699
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,660
where they basically internalize the whole thing,

700
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,390
you know, again at scale.

701
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:54,979
But

702
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,430
essentially if you can

703
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,750
analyze the data for N PM,

704
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,719
that's the data for N PM. Like there's

705
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,390
the number of people not using N PM but using node packages

706
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,579
is less than a percent,

707
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,380
right? So

708
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,250
by analyzing these ecosystems,

709
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,020
that basically is reality.

710
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,569
I mean, II I agree, I agree 100%. And I think that's,

711
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:18,569
that is the story of all this is

712
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,849
everyone is using all of this stuff all of the time.

713
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:24,969
And even if you don't think you are, you're using a service

714
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,089
that has N PM packages somewhere in it,

715
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,670
you're using something that has go running it.

716
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,439
You know, there's,

717
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,010
there's just these fundamental technologies now that are inescapable.

718
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:34,849
And,

719
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,650
and so I think pretending you have some level of

720
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,069
control over any of this is laughable at best.

721
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,630
And, and I, there's a lot of people that do that, that,

722
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,630
that, I mean,

723
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,859
there, there's the old adage, oh, I don't want random people updating my packages.

724
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:51,650
It's like your packages were written by random people.

725
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:52,739
You know,

726
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,489
-- you use that Linux kernel much.
-- Right.

727
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,250
You, you, we have no idea where this stuff comes from and that's ok though,

728
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,339
that there's nothing wrong with that and it infuriates me

729
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:02,989
when I see especially open

730
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,310
source people talking about, oh, there's like some sort of trust

731
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:08,714
they have and it's like you literally don't,

732
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:11,724
we're all just flying by the seat of our pants.

733
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,324
And the reality is like

734
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:15,814
the open source is magic and it works

735
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:17,885
and no one knows how or why,

736
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:21,604
-- but it
-- does close source is the same except without the transparency

737
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:22,564
100.

738
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:24,994
I've been looking at um

739
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:28,584
at uh crypto wallets. Actually there's about 300 of them.

740
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:33,564
Um But I'm like trying so I'm trying to track down like who built these? And

741
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:33,880
Oh

742
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,599
man, in some cases. Ok. Basically there's three buckets of crypto wallets.

743
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:40,280
There's the ones done by exchanges so that you can use the exchange. Ok.

744
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,010
That makes sense. I understand this, that I get it.

745
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,060
Then there's the crypto walls that seem to be funded

746
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,300
by like a large entity given away for free.

747
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,469
I don't really understand them other than I think they're trying to pump shit coins

748
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,540
that could be.

749
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,420
And then the third bucket seems to be crypto Waltz

750
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,000
done by an individual and maybe it's portfolio work,

751
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,020
maybe they just really wanted to scratch their own niche.

752
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,329
I don't know.

753
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:01,420
But

754
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,260
that also ignores the fact that

755
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,839
I don't know that that necessarily is the

756
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,520
entity that actually wrote the crypto wallet,

757
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,640
right?

758
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,920
They might have farmed it out to some

759
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,459
random development house

760
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,880
and so of these 300 crypto walls, there's a bunch that are open source.

761
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,880
So you kind of have that transparency of like,

762
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,369
I'm not going to say which person built it, but like which github

763
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,979
I DS

764
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,400
contributed to it

765
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,880
and whether or not you can map those back to people, I don't know. Good luck.

766
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,239
But it, it,

767
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,630
it blows my mind that because this is an instance of software that actually has

768
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,420
like literal real world value. Like there's, this is

769
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,339
crypto wallets. Like if they do a rug pull or they send a backdoor update,

770
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,729
you know, they're gonna pull billions of dollars out

771
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:43,130
and take people's money.

772
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,109
And so i it's, you know, it's, it's not some theoretical like, well,

773
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,250
if I hack the software, I can make some money or hold them for ransom.

774
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,310
No, it's like this is software that holds money

775
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,290
that's easily moved

776
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,959
and washed well in the grand scheme of things.

777
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:58,619
Not easy, easy, but well, you know, go check out the show we did with the um

778
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,569
I'm totally spacing on his name, the Blockchain security people. Anyways,

779
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,890
the point is like,

780
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,209
and this is how it's operated for decades because

781
00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:07,920
you can no longer build the software in house.

782
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,130
Like in the 19 sixties and seventies, all the software used was built in house.

783
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:13,000
There were like, was no software market.

784
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,660
Like you got a bunch of stuff from IBM and then you built the rest yourself.

785
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,640
But nowadays, no,

786
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:17,540
you,

787
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,510
you pull down 1000 M PM packages and bam it's a website.

788
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,310
-- All right, we need to, we need to close this one up.
-- I want to see more data analysis

789
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,130
and I want to see you chuck this stuff into a github

790
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,489
repo. So other people can,

791
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,160
-- you know, um
-- uh my, my code is in a github

792
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,069
repo. It's missing something. Well, you have to know how to run the code

793
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:36,790
and

794
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,630
it's not documented

795
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,180
and if anyone can figure it out who's not me. Like I will buy you a cookie because

796
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,510
-- ultimately
-- smart,

797
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,609
it's like Jerry gambling doing those Jupiter notebooks on CV data, right?

798
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:50,599
We need more of this like Jupiter notebooks is a good example.

799
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,359
Elastic search is a great example, like

800
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
analyzing the data so that we're not

801
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,750
just because we can't realistically have like there

802
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,910
are not going to be a lot of people like you and me that have read

803
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,150
20 30% of the CV database.

804
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,949
That's no, don't do that.

805
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,030
I, I guess that's, that's kind of my closing thought is

806
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,810
we, there is the open source,

807
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,469
we think we have and there's the open source we actually have.

808
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,280
And I think

809
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,649
we need to figure out what the open source we actually have is because today we're,

810
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,840
we're making too many assumptions and I think

811
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:24,770
assumptions in this context are dangerous.

812
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,330
Well, it's also that it's changed

813
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,060
like in the last 20 years.

814
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:32,360
-- That is true.
-- Like it's changed so much like

815
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,379
the, the whole idea of the like what an N PM ecosystem is.

816
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,040
Didn't make sense 20 years ago because we didn't have web apps.

817
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,219
We didn't have this compos ability. We didn't have C I CD pipelines.

818
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:43,780
Hell, we barely had source control

819
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,239
like

820
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,050
CV S.

821
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,409
Yo,

822
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,159
what was it? Was it sourceforge? Source

823
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:48,790
forge?

824
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,478
They're still around and they're no longer uh

825
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,159
putting uh ad software in the binary downloads.

826
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:54,540
-- Oh,
-- well,

827
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,879
good job guys.

828
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,739
All right. Anyway, I'm going to call this one.

829
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,719
This is, this has been a fun conversation.

830
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,479
