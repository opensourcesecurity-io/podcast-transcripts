Hello and welcome to the hash walk for

1
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:07,530
she

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,210
special of the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:12,359
and my partner in.

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,520
Thank goodness,

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,559
not actually having to update software and ship fixes Josh Pressers.

6
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:18,319
So

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,819
I'm not on the receiving end of this one, but I'm definitely on the other side of it.

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,250
Oh, you're on the giving in now at

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,079
Encor.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,680
-- Well, kind
-- of, I mean, it's,

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,799
it's been a very interesting experience because historically,

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,400
anytime something like this happens, I've, I've been part of

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,959
company that has to like patch the software and

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,790
understand what's going on and kind of all this.

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,330
And from the Anchor

16
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:42,950
perspective, we're helping people detect

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,919
what's happening because

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,130
Anchor

19
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,810
-- has tools that can like crack open the jar files and look inside
-- Gripe and

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,619
uh or something

21
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:56,319
and gripe are the open source tools and then we have the enterprise tools

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,389
and, and some other stuff. And

23
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,569
so it's been really interesting, I think, I mean,

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,279
I'm still working like a mule for sure, but I don't feel like the, the impending dread

25
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:08,769
-- that I would get when I was on the other side of this. We'll
-- say

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,550
you know what always got me was, it was no matter and see the problem is, well, ok,

27
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:13,319
let's name names.

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,510
We both worked at Red Hat. Red Hat has a huge software portfolio.

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,309
-- Right.
-- It had

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,949
over 100 products

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,610
higher than that. Now, I'm sure.

32
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:24,269
Well,

33
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,839
and when I say products I'm talking like all

34
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,709
product would be Red Hat Enterprise Linux with,

35
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:28,269
what was it?

36
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,080
8000 source RP MS.

37
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:30,489
Right.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,309
So these aren't like,

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,629
like notepad dot exe or something like these are some massive monstrosities.

40
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,110
And what always got me was

41
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,580
no matter how

42
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,349
much time and effort we spent, you know, hunting down, say the XML hash do

43
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,150
or

44
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,190
like a log for J type vulnerability.

45
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,389
It was always in the back of my mind. Did we miss one?

46
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,230
And you know, and the answer is yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

47
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,319
When you have that much software,

48
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,430
the answer is yes.

49
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,230
And

50
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:58,230
you know. Oh, yeah. I'm so glad I, I

51
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,919
hate to say this but, you know, I got 99 problems and because it's all in the cloud,

52
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,709
they're somebody else's, you know, I outsourced all of that.

53
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,309
Yeah. Right. Right. And I gave up that control and you know what?

54
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,750
It's great because I don't get yelled at for it if it does go bad.

55
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,259
Well, you can still get yelled at, I'm sure. But,

56
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,279
well, I feel like Brad Pitt, you know, it's like I've been chewed out before.

57
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,589
-- It's not that bad.
-- That's

58
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,500
right. That's right.

59
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:20,750
-- Exactly.
-- But the best part is

60
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,139
because we provide training the CCS K training to companies.

61
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,710
We're getting these vendor supplier questionnaires from like,

62
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:28,979
like

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,110
companies that are really freaked out about

64
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,460
their suppliers being affected by this.

65
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,110
And I just, I love saying it's like

66
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,860
we don't have any Java Code.

67
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,229
Right?

68
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:37,059
And

69
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:42,830
we are affected by CV 2021 44 228. We had to update our ubiquity gear,

70
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:47,149
like we got wireless gear in one office and we had to, we had to run the update

71
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,220
and that's it. We're good.

72
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:52,220
And I'm just, and to be able to say that with 100% confidence and just to be like,

73
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,800
then I'm done with this,

74
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:54,839
you know. Oh,

75
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,449
-- I love it.
-- No, I know.

76
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,080
And now I wanna, I wanna start out, we'll say with the kindness hat on

77
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,160
if you're one of the defenders dealing with this, like, God bless you.

78
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:11,589
God bless you all because this is terrible and it's hard and it's scary

79
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,479
and

80
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,190
it, it,

81
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,479
especially in this particular instance and Kurt

82
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,970
and I will argue about this momentarily.

83
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:17,339
But like,

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,839
I feel like there has been a vacuum of leadership

85
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,080
which means everyone is kind of on their own.

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,910
There has. Well, ok, that's true. We both agree. There's a vacuum of leadership.

87
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,580
We don't agree who to blame.

88
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,410
Yes.

89
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,339
Yeah.

90
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,369
But it's,

91
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,389
I, I know what this is like

92
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,660
and you know, peace be with you all.

93
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,339
Well, it's funny, I hate to say this when people are comparing this to heartbleed.

94
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,059
I'm like, when I say I lived through heartbeat, like me and Josh

95
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,380
lived through heartbleed on the sharp end of the stick, like on the,

96
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,789
like my boss almost ended up on the news because he's the guy.

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,779
When you report a vulnerability to open a cell, it ends up in his mailbox.

98
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,300
Right? And so like, I hate to say this, but

99
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,259
no heartbleed is like

100
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,020
I would have said in the past heartbleed was a 10 out of 10.

101
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:02,529
Now, I'd say it's like maybe a good solid seven.

102
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:09,000
No, I think you can easily say heartbleed was a 10 out of 10. This is an 11 out of 10.

103
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,940
Oh, I'd say it's worse. I'd say it's probably a 12.

104
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,240
That's

105
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,779
fair. And those of the embedded nature of Java, right? That's what kills me.

106
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,660
You can't fix this in half the cases. Like with a heartbeat.

107
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,730
Stick it to less proxy in front. Boom. Done

108
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,730
with this. Oh, just

109
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,079
update Java Jar files that nobody knows where they came from.

110
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:25,899
They came out of a, made a

111
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,720
repository five years ago

112
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,049
and that's disappeared now.

113
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:33,809
-- But
-- there's even a more bizarre angle to this that not everyone understands.

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,239
So all that has to happen is log for Jay has the parts, a string

115
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,529
that has this goofy JND. I,

116
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,570
you know, we'll say

117
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,519
decorations around it.

118
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:46,899
And the thing is

119
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,910
you can talk about, oh, sanitize your inputs and all this.

120
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,609
But like these are valid inputs, these are just normal keyboard characters.

121
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,019
And the thing is like you could have a log server, you know,

122
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,250
three layers deep in the corporate network

123
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,040
that

124
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:04,079
nothing is affected until it hits the log server. And kaboom,

125
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,010
that's exactly like the heart bleed was on the exterior. This one is everywhere.

126
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,510
It's like,

127
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,170
you know what kind of reminds me of it.

128
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,410
It's like the difference between getting a cut on your skin

129
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,200
-- and something like the A I DS virus that hijacks your immune system.
-- Right. Right.

130
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,890
Exactly. And it's just,

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,809
it,

132
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,140
that's what makes it so scary is

133
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,630
with heart bleed, you could just be like,

134
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,790
what's everything facing the internet with this one?

135
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,790
It's like, what's everything? Well

136
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,089
and worse, what's everything with Java? Because

137
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:32,380
here,

138
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,545
if you have a Java application,

139
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,834
I think odds are good that it does some sort of logging.

140
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:39,714
I think we can all agree on that. It's,

141
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,654
yeah, log for J is very, very widely used.

142
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:46,265
And then if it does logging, does it use log for J? And the answer is probably, yes,

143
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:50,234
probably. And by, probably, yes, I mean, almost certainly. Yes.

144
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:52,945
Just

145
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:54,994
so. Anyway, anyway,

146
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,704
I want to start

147
00:05:56,825 --> 00:06:00,875
with the, what I will call the perceived leadership vacuum on this issue

148
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:05,540
and I'm going to pick on the Apache Software foundation. A little bit here

149
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,890
because it's on.

150
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:08,470
But

151
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,290
I, I think if

152
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:12,869
there's been a lot of talk about log for Jay is just two

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,320
volunteers and they do this in their free time and all this.

154
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,950
But, but it is part of the Apache Software foundation.

155
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,779
The Apache Software Foundation is a real organization

156
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,619
with people working with it

157
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,380
that

158
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,440
know how to do this stuff.

159
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,920
And I feel like they had an amazing opportunity to stand up and say, all right,

160
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,209
everyone here's what's going on, here's what we're going to do about it.

161
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,429
And I feel like they just kind of crapped out an advisory and ran away. Like, come on,

162
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,029
they absolutely did.

163
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,070
And I'm going to read a paragraph literally from my

164
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,079
blog post that will probably come up before the show.

165
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,880
I suspect the reason they operate in this manner is simple.

166
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,880
The Apache Software foundation budget in 2019 was $2.26 million.

167
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:50,529
In other words,

168
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,579
a foundation that literally underpins our modern technology driven world is

169
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,700
operating on less than the coffee budget of a major corporation.

170
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,390
The Apache Software Foundation handles roughly 140 to

171
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,260
150 vulnerabilities with CV identifiers per year.

172
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,630
And it's not like they can spend a lot of their budget on security

173
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:08,510
you statement I will say is technically correct. However,

174
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,299
I don't think that's an excuse.

175
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,630
I think this is an example of the Apache Software

176
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,769
foundation and all of the people using it after Harple

177
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,309
should have said we have to make sure we have

178
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,929
this in order and that clearly did not happen.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,690
Well, it's worse than that because

180
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,399
I'm looking at this because this is part of the post mortem. I'm working on. And it's

181
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,459
so these, you know, all these people on Twitter are like, oh my God,

182
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,000
all these companies use this free open

183
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,679
source software and don't return anything back.

184
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,630
And it's like, yes, that's exactly how open sources worked for 20 plus years.

185
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,269
Yeah. Why do you think Linux won

186
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:39,380
anyways? And

187
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,260
I think part of it honestly needs to be that these,

188
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,739
these things that underpin the internet and I don't mean just log for Jay.

189
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,010
But like those, you know, the Apache Software foundation,

190
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,130
they need to maybe be a little more

191
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,489
noisy about, hey, here's all the insane value we're providing

192
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,309
for like

193
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,970
74 cents a day,

194
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,160
you know,

195
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:02,359
or in some cases, $0 per day, like, like curl

196
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,029
like literally a world without curl would

197
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,470
curls just everywhere.

198
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,489
I don't, I don't even know what to say about a world without curl.

199
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,609
I can, I can explain this in a way that I think you can like explain it.

200
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:21,429
Like I'm five, go get your car's user manual, turn to the back

201
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,429
and it's going to list curl

202
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,390
like it's in your car. I guarantee it.

203
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,140
I don't know what the answer is here because obviously companies don't want

204
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,459
to pay money for stuff that they don't have to pay money for.

205
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,340
And open source explicitly allows this, which is fine. But,

206
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,460
but the sustainability issue comes to mind where this company, you know,

207
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,799
if they'd done a slightly better job here, let's put it this way.

208
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:46,219
How many companies spent more than 2.26 million over the weekend on overtime?

209
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,700
All of them. Yeah. Like every fortune 100 company on the planet.

210
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:50,630
I mean,

211
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:56,469
I think the way I would think about this is there's a couple of different layers,

212
00:08:56,479 --> 00:09:00,039
there's the layer of just understanding what you have.

213
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,669
And I think a lot of organizations now know what

214
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,429
they have and they didn't on Thursday of last week,

215
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,659
I, I think a lot of them, not all but a lot of them.

216
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:09,030
Do

217
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,140
they understand superficially.

218
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:12,679
They, they,

219
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,039
this is like saying this is like saying I have half inch plumbing in my house.

220
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,789
Is it copper or PEX? I'm not entirely sure. But

221
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,289
the first step though,

222
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,679
I think we need to be mindful because in security,

223
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,400
we are notorious for pulling the perfect or nothing.

224
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,280
And step one is saying,

225
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,359
do I have plumbing in my house? Oh, I do. You know, like

226
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,520
a professional, like people like us, we know the answer to this

227
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,530
but we're not there.

228
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:41,820
So some of these people need to solve this one on their own and it's a multi

229
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:42,719
step process.

230
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,590
Well, it's a maturity piece thing, right? Like a lot of places, literally,

231
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,469
if you ask them for a list of ingredients and SBM

232
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,169
of what is in the software, not just that you ship, but that you use and rely upon.

233
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:54,869
I don't

234
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:55,130
know.

235
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,890
Right. Right. And, and that, that's ok.

236
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,710
I think that is going to become much more normal after this

237
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,049
one thing. There's tools that actually allow to happen now because,

238
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,250
I mean, up until a few years ago, if you did this,

239
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,809
it would take a heroic amount of manual effort

240
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,950
and then it would be immediately out of date.

241
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,390
Well, and when we used to do this at Red Hat, it was 100% manual back in the day.

242
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,250
I mean, we literally had humans cracking open,

243
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,250
you know, so

244
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,655
first tar balls looking inside of them and then

245
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,494
we would have another list

246
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,184
of security vulnerabilities.

247
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,854
We would basically grap for, you know,

248
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,335
like is this package name somewhere in this list?

249
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:35,474
Oh, it's not, oh, they misspelled it. We missed it, you know,

250
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,200
and

251
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,309
that happened.

252
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,950
So anyway,

253
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,789
there's kind of that first layer that I'll

254
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,909
say just it's understanding what you have,

255
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,330
but then

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,450
you're going to move your way up.

257
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,510
And if we think about it kind of like on the hierarchy of need scale,

258
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,030
I think knowing what you have and then being willing

259
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,179
to fund it is a little high on the list.

260
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,770
-- And I think
-- a lot of that's right at the top. It's

261
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,260
probably very close to the top.

262
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,109
I agree. But I think we've reached a point where now

263
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,150
a lot of organizations are recognizing

264
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,789
we have open source everywhere, we have to know what we have.

265
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,099
And then we also have to make sure that there's like a coherent plan in place for,

266
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:13,809
for maintaining this stuff and keeping track of it because, I mean, at the same time,

267
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,640
like one of the challenges.

268
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,020
OK. So let's say everyone on the planet says here here A F here's a million dollars.

269
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,609
Now, the A F has billions of dollars. And

270
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,630
what now? Right, let's say they hire a ton of people.

271
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,869
But oh wait, the next vulnerability.

272
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,549
Oh That came from this weird little project over here.

273
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,150
That is literally a person in Nebraska.

274
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,150
Well, see, and, and this is again, uh I'll just recycle content.

275
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,909
I've already created.

276
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm doing a post mortem on this and, and here's,

277
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,559
I want to give a timeline of actually how the flaw came to be.

278
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,159
So

279
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,489
uh log for J version one lived its life and then log for

280
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,900
J version two came along and it had a whole pile of enhancements.

281
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,239
And in log for J uh version 2.0 beta nine,

282
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,729
here we go log for J 2-303 J and

283
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,090
look up plug in support. Currently, look up plugins don't support J and D resources.

284
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,390
It would be really convenient to support J and

285
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,580
resource. Look up in the configuration. One use case with J and

286
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,789
look up plug in as it falls blah blah, blah blah blah

287
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,840
uh 2013, July 17th. Cool

288
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:14,580
now

289
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,619
uh two years later, two years, two months later,

290
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,609
log for J 2-11 33 in page configuration section,

291
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,840
property substitution add JND I context.

292
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,280
So literally two years, two months later, somebody's like, hey, could,

293
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,669
could you add this to the documentation that it does this thing?

294
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,630
OK. So, so in

295
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,030
fairness, people who grab log for J in the first two years, unless they, I

296
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,400
guess read the source code or something

297
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,760
or look like

298
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,690
they wouldn't have known this even existed unless

299
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,330
they explicitly knew to look for it.

300
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,070
I mean, I don't think anyone knew this existed as it is.

301
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,219
The documentation for log for J is quite large and

302
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,690
well, you're not going to sit down and read it,

303
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,900
you're going to look for the section you need

304
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,669
-- and that's what you're going to read.
-- Yeah.

305
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,260
And then,

306
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,450
and you're not going to read the change log

307
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,989
between versions and catch this minor minor documentation.

308
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,489
So then two years and two months again later in 2017, November 9th,

309
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,909
uh log for J dash 2109 add property to disable message pattern converter lookups. So

310
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:15,500
as opposed to setting percent M no lookups in all pattern definitions,

311
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,270
I would like to globally disable the feature.

312
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:18,150
And so this is the,

313
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,849
the feature that was added in log for J

314
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,549
version 2.10 that allows you to globally turn it off

315
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,640
that. So basically they added a feature

316
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,340
and it's on by default.

317
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,359
And then they didn't add even a global off switch for over four years.

318
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,080
And that's the thing if this feature had been added and

319
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,409
disabled by default and you had to explicitly enable it,

320
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:40,090
this vulnerability would have come out and people would have been like, oh,

321
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,070
these seven people are affected, go fix it, like go turn the switch on. Right. Right.

322
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,909
Exactly. And of course, that's easy to say in hindsight.

323
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,950
Well, and, and I want to add one other thing to your timeline in 2016.

324
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,729
There was a black hat talk that basically pointed out

325
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,130
that maybe this JND I thing is kind of dangerous.

326
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,109
Well, and that's part of my timeline. Um

327
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,440
But anyways,

328
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,250
so

329
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,460
I just want to stop here also and say, like

330
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:08,159
I'm incredibly tempted at this point to name this episode. Kurt reads his blog.

331
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,349
Yeah, pretty much. I love it.

332
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:09,679
So,

333
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,150
and actually I like that you bring up the black hat thing because

334
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,320
it brings up one of the fundamental failures of this whole system,

335
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,729
which is we have a many to many communications problem.

336
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:20,344
Most of the men

337
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:21,294
don't

338
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:24,114
know about each other because how do I put this nicely?

339
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:28,974
You can't expect a project like log for J, even if it was 20 fully funded people

340
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,255
to somehow track every security

341
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:34,375
presentation on the planet in case their name pops up

342
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:39,219
-- and, and even if it doesn't, even if Log for J
-- wasn't specifically name.

343
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,000
Right. Exactly. Like how would you make that connection even? You know what I mean?

344
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,840
Because how many people actually really knew this was in Log for J? I mean,

345
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,719
I

346
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,719
think the two people that wrote it, I had been,

347
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:53,549
I've been doing stuff with log for J for literally four years

348
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,159
before this point and I had no idea it could do this.

349
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,669
Exactly.

350
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,090
So

351
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,090
yeah. Um

352
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,739
And the other thing is, it's funny, I was talking with somebody and they're like, oh,

353
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,619
you know, the answer to this partly is uh developer education.

354
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,770
I'm like, no, it's not. And they're like what I'm like, no, no, go deeper.

355
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,590
Here's the problem,

356
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,880
especially in the corporate world.

357
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,429
You have a choice. You'll find resources. I want you to add a feature.

358
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,510
Now, if you add just the feature and move on, we it costs say 10 hours.

359
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,969
But if you add the feature properly document it disable it by default,

360
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,190
have a switch to enable it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

361
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,330
Now it's taking 10 or 20 or 30 hours and people have

362
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,140
to turn stuff on to make it work and blah blah blah

363
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,270
versus I have my developers just crank out features that are poorly documented.

364
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,390
And we get 2 to 4 times as many features done.

365
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,669
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:37,169
And

367
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,969
uh in the corporate world, obviously that's going to win

368
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,080
and in the open source world,

369
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
well, developers kind of want to work on features and not,

370
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,000
you know,

371
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,679
spackle cracks

372
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,479
and make sure everything's absolutely perfect. It's like,

373
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
well, we, it's open source, we can fix that later,

374
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,380
help you can fix it if you don't like it.

375
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:55,770
Right

376
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,669
again, Back to open

377
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,760
nothing.

378
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,059
Yeah.

379
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,559
Right. Right.

380
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,799
And, and OK, so before we just keep beating this horse, I also want to mention

381
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:06,630
that

382
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:07,659
at

383
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:10,530
the time of recording, this is improving greatly.

384
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,450
But I feel like at the very beginning of this,

385
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,650
I think some of the, the like

386
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,489
security organizations like CT and Cisa

387
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,729
and whoever else,

388
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,830
like they were also remarkably silent for

389
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:24,750
almost a week before they really started doing anything.

390
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,760
I think the first thing I saw was the, whatever the Dutch version of Sisa is.

391
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,780
I'm not even going to try to, to say your name. I apologize. But I,

392
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll,

393
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:35,609
I'll put a link in the show notes, but

394
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,844
they started putting together this amazing list of all the software.

395
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,304
But now they have one and Cisa has one.

396
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,385
-- Actually,
-- no, the thing is you don't need to put in the show notes,

397
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,484
just tell people to go to the GSD entry.

398
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:46,705
And it's,

399
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,025
it's explicitly remember I picked the winning URL

400
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,205
S because that's another part of this CV,

401
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,164
EGSD and all that.

402
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,085
It's not just enough to have a giant list of URL S.

403
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:58,674
Now we have to curate and pick the winners. And I, I literally did like a log for Shell.

404
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:03,294
Here's the winning URL S for detection for exploitation for hot patch for blah,

405
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:03,744
blah, blah

406
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,030
and, and I mean, I'm going to pick on CD E also as part of this, I mean, like,

407
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,750
so CV E the, the story is hilarious.

408
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,209
They first published the data from the A SF which had an incorrect mitigation in it

409
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,118
and then that got retracted.

410
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,088
No, didn't get retracted. It got silently deleted.

411
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:25,448
That is true. It was silently deleted

412
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,448
and then

413
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,989
there was no NVD score or I'm sorry. There was, yeah, there was no NVD CV SS score.

414
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,048
There was no C pe names attached by NVD until like I think it was late Monday,

415
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:35,928
early Tuesday.

416
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,089
Then CV added some random

417
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,000
URLS that doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to

418
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,170
-- it
-- in fairness. One of them is a link to my tweet, which is true.

419
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,189
The tweet is the link to the GSD with all the data. So that was good of them.

420
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm going to argue linking a tweet is

421
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,430
the worst reference.

422
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:53,770
No,

423
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,530
you know what the worst reference is linking

424
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,969
to somebody's Twitter account and not a specific tweet

425
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,390
-- anyway. Anyway.
-- Ok.

426
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,180
Ok.

427
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:02,949
But then,

428
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:07,489
but then it gets sillier because the original text of the

429
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,239
CV E issue with the bad mitigation ends up back in

430
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,160
the CV E data set and that it was again taken

431
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,949
back out after Will Dorman pointed it out to them.

432
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,369
And I feel like it is clear

433
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,984
that no one is in charge.

434
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:23,474
-- The
-- problem is the way they use GIT is broken, right?

435
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:25,175
They, they, they take data into github,

436
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,944
shove it into their backend system and then shove it back out of the backend system.

437
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,834
And it's so that's every single GIT commit

438
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,974
in the CV list that says synchronized data.

439
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:33,655
That's it.

440
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,854
That's there's one of those synchronized data commits

441
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,734
every hour on the hour no matter what,

442
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,255
which is useless anyways.

443
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,135
But what's really fascinating about this timeline is

444
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,910
uh I don't have the data in front of me, so I'm just gonna wing it. But basically

445
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,839
the, the series of events as I've been best able to parse

446
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,189
is that this first cropped up

447
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,729
on Discord servers talking about Minecraft servers where

448
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,770
Minecraft servers were getting popped through chat.

449
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,270
People were putting this J and D I string

450
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,540
into chat and popping Minecraft servers and hijacking them.

451
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,459
It then

452
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,949
went into that uh issue number 608

453
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,300
in the log for J thing where it's like essentially this person was like, you know,

454
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,359
this bad stuff is happening with this JND I LDA look up.

455
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,359
So can we restrict LDA access to local host only?

456
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,319
Right? Which

457
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,770
realistic, like

458
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,199
realistically if you're actually using this feature,

459
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:22,569
you probably should be running an LT A server locally to handle the lookups.

460
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,560
You think so?

461
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,349
So, and, and ok, this would be good and safe, you know,

462
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,390
you don't have to worry about payloads being delivered

463
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,880
from some random IP address on the internet.

464
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,500
And so what's interesting is, um,

465
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,369
in that issue 608, it's kind of like, ok,

466
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,050
we get that this is a security issue but we're,

467
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,939
we're at first it's kind of like it's not that bad, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,130
But then it very quickly is like, 00, this is bad. We need a CV.

469
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,060
We need to blah, blah, blah.

470
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,770
There's a quote

471
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,609
I think it is,

472
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,640
it is very surprising that this critical security issue

473
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,140
does not seem to have received due attention.

474
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,030
It was reported to Apache half a month ago,

475
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,550
but it was not fixed until five days ago. Even today.

476
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,630
It was not released a new stable version to solve it.

477
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,859
And then one of the replies is, oh,

478
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:00,180
so glad you show such appreciation for the work of volunteers like, yeah, true.

479
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:02,839
A little bit of snark is not totally unwarranted here.

480
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,770
Right? Again, open

481
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,930
source. Do nothing. But

482
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,069
basically,

483
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,819
I don't want to say they dropped the ball.

484
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:10,859
But if I hand you a ball,

485
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,250
it may not be clear that it's a nice happy red rubber ball or what was that?

486
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,119
Saturday Night live, you know, do not annoy,

487
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,630
-- happy fun
-- ball,

488
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,369
ball, you know, do not expose happy fun ball to sunlight,

489
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,650
small Children or pregnant women.

490
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,400
If it starts smoking, sit down and run away.

491
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,160
That was, that was, oh man, that was such a good commercial.

492
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,560
And that's the thing about these issues is like, oh,

493
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,900
I got this weird little glitchy thing.

494
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,849
Can we just, you know,

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,630
restrict

496
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:39,535
look ups to local host turns into the worst security vulnerability in 20 years.

497
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:42,875
Now, there's also another interesting angle to this.

498
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:47,155
So the issue was reported to the ASF on November 24th

499
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:49,074
and it was

500
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:52,834
added to their get on December 6th

501
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,589
and now I say get because they don't use github, but that's whatever.

502
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,390
I, I don't like that, but I'll let it go.

503
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,119
But there are people who are now looking back in time and their logs

504
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,290
and there's some instances of this on December 1st,

505
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,180
people have found and it won't shock me if it might go back even farther.

506
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,244
Like one of the questions is

507
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,734
why was this scene on December 1st? Did someone leak it?

508
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:18,015
Was it already in the wild? Like what is going on?

509
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,334
Yeah, I mean, and, and again,

510
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,364
I'm just going to read from my blog because it's just easier than

511
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,175
doing

512
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,074
it. It's like I, so

513
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,949
hang on a second. Here we go. Ok.

514
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,349
So blah, blah, blah Apache dropped this

515
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:33,079
to say the announcement of CV 2021 44228 land

516
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,959
like a bombshell is an understatement on Twitter.

517
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:37,520
The activity on December 9th and 10th

518
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,510
alone with several 100,000,

519
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,939
I got bored of waiting for them all to load and it went up from there.

520
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,390
She went and got the first hashtag log

521
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,530
for

522
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,819
Shell and hashtag log for

523
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,449
uh J tweets about this.

524
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,060
And what's interesting is there was

525
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,380
a tweet on December 9th

526
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,390
early in the day

527
00:21:56,069 --> 00:22:00,060
that basically said hashtag log for J dollar sign squiggly bracket J and D

528
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:00,800
focal and L

529
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:00,979
dot

530
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:01,140
focal

531
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,170
and slash slash XXXX dot DNS

532
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,770
log.cn/exp,

533
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,250
squiggly bracket.

534
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,189
Now, in hindsight, of course, looking at that, we're like, OK,

535
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,410
that's patient zero on Twitter, so to speak.

536
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,229
So

537
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,229
in theory,

538
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,680
so which contains enough information to craft an exploit

539
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:18,670
but lacks contact and then later tweets gain steam.

540
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,050
But unless you're monitoring Chinese language

541
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,910
tweets for random technology terms,

542
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,069
you know,

543
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,719
chances are you didn't see this until the Apache

544
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,670
software foundation announced it or the CV was released.

545
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,449
Except even that's old.

546
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,939
It appears that the Minecraft community of all

547
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,729
things was experiencing exploitation of this issue.

548
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:34,089
And then I have a, a link to a thread at high pixel.net,

549
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,849
they're talking about this

550
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,750
except even that stale. So Matthew Prince Ceo of Klauber

551
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,000
reported that

552
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:44,630
um what was the date he said that they started seeing exploitation was I think, yeah,

553
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,089
it was it December 1st or whatever

554
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,400
they went through their logs

555
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,630
and yeah, on December 1st at 436 UTC.

556
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,689
They, they saw exploitation of this.

557
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,569
So

558
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,079
it's clear

559
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,920
it's one of those things where

560
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,609
when somebody finds a security vulnerability, you know,

561
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,170
it doesn't immediately get

562
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:05,010
-- pushed up the chain to the right people right away.
-- Right.

563
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,839
Well, you know what's really funny is this came up Thursday night on Friday morning,

564
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:13,729
I had a meeting with one of our marketing people that we just have a normal meeting.

565
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,489
Friday morning. I'm like, hey, this doesn't look that bad.

566
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,329
I said it, it might, I think this

567
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,869
might be a flash in the pan. Let's not do anything crazy yet.

568
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,489
And literally less than two hours later. I was like, yeah, this one's a big deal.

569
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,729
Like we definitely need to pay attention.

570
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,089
And that's the problem is there's,

571
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,089
I can't think of too many things that are analogous

572
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,880
in the real world where it goes from like,

573
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,119
oh, this could be bad to, you know, 17 minutes later.

574
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,339
-- We're like, and we have an extinction level event.
-- Right. Right.

575
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,660
I mean, asteroid impact. I don't know. Yeah.

576
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,430
Anyway, it's, it's definitely been

577
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,709
an interesting challenge,

578
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,920
we can say,

579
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:49,680
well,

580
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,199
and I love that this is going to be

581
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,670
with us forever because here's the thing people don't get

582
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,760
is the way Java software is built and shipped and deployed

583
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,630
is I'm not going to say fundamentally different than other software,

584
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,430
but it is quite different than other software

585
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,869
in the sense of there is the expectation, the culture of having these binary blobs

586
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,849
so that you just get this giant binary bla of software and you turn it on and it works.

587
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:17,150
That's how everyone used to distribute software,

588
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,949
but they still do it in the Java world.

589
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,750
Well, not, not exactly, not exactly.

590
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,709
So there's the old way of Java where, for example, let's say you needed a jar,

591
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,709
you just like literally embed all the jars in your jar

592
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:29,685
and now it's jars all the way down.

593
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:33,165
And a lot of scanners have a hard time cracking those open and looking

594
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:36,255
gripe doesn't by the way, but like so

595
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:37,864
subtle

596
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:38,045
as

597
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,655
it is a hard problem to solve it.

598
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:41,265
So

599
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:42,875
those are useful tools, especially

600
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,324
-- when they're free.
-- Exactly. But anyway,

601
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,630
and now the new way you deal with this in Java

602
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,310
is basically all of the dependencies live at like one level.

603
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:52,930
So if you need,

604
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,790
if something needs log for J,

605
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,390
it ends up like in the application in like the global name space.

606
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:03,839
So it's like there is the new way, but there's so much of stuff that used the old way

607
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,920
of

608
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,680
20 years of software.

609
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,219
-- 20. When did Java come out about
-- 20 years ago?

610
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:11,760
20

611
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,290
years

612
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,079
older than that, I was in college more than 20 years ago.

613
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,150
But,

614
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,310
you

615
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:17,560
know,

616
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:18,089
um

617
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:18,829
anyways,

618
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,369
-- 19
-- 96 KT

619
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:26,869
Java was released on January 23rd, 1996 which was what seven years ago Right. Like,

620
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,199
so

621
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:30,920
the thing is

622
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,579
because of this,

623
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:39,300
it's not clear that people can fix this in traditional ways because

624
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,079
there are Maven repos

625
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:44,609
and packages that just no longer exist. You can't get an update for them.

626
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:49,609
How many, how many companies built an app or a library? And they're so long gone.

627
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:50,560
It's not even funny,

628
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,189
you

629
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,680
know,

630
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:54,300
-- that happens.
-- And, and what I love here is

631
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,489
like in past the using a hot patch that

632
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,310
does like binary modifications or whatever to your software was just we,

633
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,609
we talked about it theoretically at times, remember,

634
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,290
but it like never was something that we

635
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,089
could actually really realistically do really dangerous.

636
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,310
Well, in this case,

637
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,329
not only has it been done, there's three different main packages.

638
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,089
Uh probably the best one is the Coretta one

639
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,790
but Amazon web services has a blog posting saying you should go do this

640
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,479
if you can't patch right away.

641
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,979
-- Normally, I would say don't do that. But in this particular instance,
-- absolutely.

642
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,199
I think it's all right.

643
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:26,640
So yeah, I mean,

644
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,920
that, that alone is a, is a significant change

645
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:31,790
which is, you know,

646
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,699
for desperate measures, I mean,

647
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:35,380
yeah,

648
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,349
but

649
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,430
so

650
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,250
what, what gets me too is

651
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,689
the the the fundamental my fundamental like root cause analysis of this is

652
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,150
it speaks to the culture of feature first, not safety first,

653
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,849
which is how the majority of software works, right?

654
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:55,510
The majority of software culture is let's add features and cool stuff. And

655
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:57,859
yeah, like, I mean, that's how we got here.

656
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:00,979
I'm staring at, you know, Windows 11 is gorgeous. Mac Os is gorgeous.

657
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:02,510
Linux is gorgeous now,

658
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,630
you know, the apps, the richness of the apps and the web browsers is,

659
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,770
it just blows my mind.

660
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,170
I don't have to spell or even get which, which is,

661
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,369
which correct anymore because like, there's things like grammarly,

662
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,189
like the world is amazing.

663
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,420
Like software has

664
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:18,410
made our lives infinitely better with all this functionality, right?

665
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,680
And yeah,

666
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,099
so occasionally we have these, you know, sort of like whoopsies moments where

667
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:28,560
Attackers can hijack every single thing running Java on the planet.

668
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:29,819
And

669
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:30,680
you know what,

670
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,890
it's really not the end of the world.

671
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,510
Like I, I love that people blow up these incidents to be somehow the end of the world.

672
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,880
And it's like,

673
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,339
and yet we're life is kind of just chugging along as far as I can tell.

674
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,280
So I think the important thing to remember here is I

675
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,030
won't say nobody died because of this because it's conceivable.

676
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,479
Something happened somewhere.

677
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,280
But I mean,

678
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:56,569
practically speaking as humans, we freak out when there's an incident that causes

679
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,170
a lot of, a lot of

680
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,410
we'll say casualties very quickly

681
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,589
and this isn't one of those.

682
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,489
I mean, look at, look at like the pandemic, it's a slow burn.

683
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,089
So it's not receiving the level of attention I think it should.

684
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,010
-- Well, that's whatever. And as
-- we record this Al

685
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,989
Ma has taken off

686
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:12,859
and

687
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,140
my premier is literally as we speak, having a an uh

688
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,589
he was supposed to have a pressure yesterday to announce

689
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,069
less restrictions for Christmas and then that got canceled.

690
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,109
They spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada and apparently,

691
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,859
yeah, we might be canceling Christmas this year

692
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,280
-- and I fully support it. We'll
-- just blame Log for Jay if Christmas gets canceled.

693
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,260
But you know what I mean? I mean, I think

694
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:40,060
that's the difference is, is it we are, it is Wednesday right now and this, we're,

695
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:43,640
we're like, what, 76 days into this basically.

696
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,109
And

697
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,910
it's starting to feel less terrible.

698
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,829
I would say, I feel like we can finally breathe a little bit.

699
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:55,229
There's still a lot of work to do and there's a long, long road ahead of us, you know,

700
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,079
but I feel like the worst is behind us.

701
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:59,910
-- Now.
-- I feel like a lot of this is similar to the pandemic in thought.

702
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:03,849
We got lucky and ignored biosecurity for way too long.

703
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,510
Like people just didn't wash their hands enough

704
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,130
or cover their coughs and sneezes enough,

705
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,550
right?

706
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,260
That, that Asian culture thing of wearing a surgical mask when you're sick,

707
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,319
so you don't spread your germs.

708
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, we should probably do that as a species. Seems like a nice idea.

709
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:16,790
And that's a

710
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,869
thing is I think part of the fatigue and the stress is Log

711
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,900
for J forces people to acknowledge things that they have been cheerfully ignoring,

712
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,500
like s

713
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:27,750
balm, like, knowing what software they're running, like,

714
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,290
knowing what version of software they're running.

715
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,270
Like, knowing what configuration switches. Like, here's the thing. If,

716
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,260
uh, if somebody said I'm allergic to tree nuts,

717
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,199
every,

718
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:40,560
every reputable food manufacturer on the planet can say, oh, yeah,

719
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:42,410
you're going to die if you eat our product or you're going

720
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,859
to be fine if you eat our product in literally seconds.

721
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:49,020
You know, one of my sons has a very high sensitivity to Aloe

722
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,479
uh like his mother.

723
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,160
And so buying diapers that don't have Aloe in them and

724
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,959
buying skincare products that don't have Aloe in them is tricky,

725
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:59,439
but you can literally phone the 1 800 number on those things

726
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,640
and get an answer in less than a minute.

727
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,689
But now I, I will say

728
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,609
that is because the government made them do it.

729
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,089
-- It's not because they wanted to.
-- Exactly.

730
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,569
But now it's become

731
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:10,880
a

732
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,810
normal part of how those industries work and it's not stressful for them

733
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,770
and it blows my mind that in it if you ask me, hey, Kurt, like, what software do you do

734
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,829
upon? And I'm like,

735
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,569
I actually don't know,

736
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:24,130
but I consciously don't know because we picked cloud

737
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,770
providers and we outsourced that problem and we accepted that

738
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:31,689
there's an interesting angle to this that I think is coming to light that

739
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:35,689
I've had some people contact me and I've just noticed in the universe is.

740
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,310
A

741
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,250
lot of people went looking for log for Jay

742
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:42,540
and they noticed all the other vulnerabilities

743
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,650
in their stuff and they're saying, wait a minute.

744
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,699
So I think what's, what part of the slow burn of this will be?

745
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,880
We need to get log for J under control.

746
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,780
And then we need to say, all right, what about all this other stuff I found while I,

747
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,119
because it feels kind of like, you know,

748
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,400
when you clean your basement and you're like, oh, that was there, you know,

749
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,400
-- and this is very similar to that
-- I think,

750
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,119
and it's almost worse in a way because there'll be stuff that has CV S for sure.

751
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:04,810
But

752
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,910
how do I put this nicely if you have a

753
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,270
Java library that hasn't been updated in over a year,

754
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:11,319
I guarantee you there's a vulnerability in there.

755
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,829
Yeah, probably

756
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,030
present and, and

757
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,270
the good news is like security bugs are high and bugs in the sense

758
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,359
-- of they don't exist until somebody finds them and starts exploiting them
-- usually.

759
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:21,719
Yes.

760
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,300
Right.

761
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,000
-- Right.
-- Right. They usually don't kind of get exploited by accident.

762
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,760
Now, now I want to say too, I want to before we end this show which we're getting close.

763
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,489
I want to, I want to be very clear,

764
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,239
this isn't just a Java problem.

765
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,540
There are people running node applications

766
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,199
that have multi year old vulnerabilities.

767
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,290
There are people running Python applications like

768
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,839
literally pick a language this is everywhere.

769
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:44,589
This isn't just Java, even though we've obviously picked on Java a lot today, it

770
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,310
is everywhere. So if you literally have an application, I don't care what kind it is.

771
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,119
Go build an S bomb.

772
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:53,709
Yeah, or a service. Also services.

773
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,219
If you're providing services,

774
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:59,400
you need to have an S bomb for what is backing those services

775
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,060
because it's not just the software but the

776
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:03,489
operating system and what services it relies upon.

777
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,260
Right.

778
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,500
I remember, for example,

779
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,819
once we had an outage of the main CS a website because it wanted to load

780
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,260
a piece of data from the blog and it didn't essentially have a time out set.

781
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,729
So it just sort of like the blog went down

782
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,930
because reasons.

783
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,510
And so the main website crashed and it was like, wow,

784
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,109
I the way most have crashed and it's like, oh, because, well, the blog is down

785
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,880
and I, you know, once, once we did a root cause analysis,

786
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,310
it took me three minutes to fix.

787
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,109
But finding like it

788
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,510
like, because what happened is the blog went down and then two minutes later,

789
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,579
the main website went down.

790
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,579
And so I focused on fixing the main website,

791
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,530
obviously.

792
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,829
Right. Right. Of course.

793
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,869
And it turns out if I just fixed the blog, it would have been over.

794
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,780
Um And that's the thing, right?

795
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,579
So is getting those rich that, that data about that,

796
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,260
that rich ecosystem that you have

797
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,849
and, and you do have it, whether you like it or not.

798
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,609
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Absolutely.

799
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,290
All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one, I guess,

800
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,890
uh, when we're recording this things feel like they're getting better.

801
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,380
I truly hope. I don't regret saying that

802
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,109
when I hit the publish button,

803
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,790
they did find that secondary denial of service in non-standard config,

804
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,359
which I'm like,

805
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:10,239
what I find more scary is

806
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,060
this could be warm

807
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,449
and if it's worm,

808
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,880
it could get really, really ugly.

809
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,770
But we're gonna, we're gonna hope

810
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,300
that that doesn't happen.

811
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,959
Let's hope that future Josh doesn't have to put

812
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,979
a little note at the beginning of this episode.

813
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,140
So.

814
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:28,000
