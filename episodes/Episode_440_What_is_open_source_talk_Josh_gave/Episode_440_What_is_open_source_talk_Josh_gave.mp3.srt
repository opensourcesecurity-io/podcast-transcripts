Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,930
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,729
-- Josh Bresser,
-- we're going to talk about what is open source today,

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,010
which sounds like a weird and possibly boring topic. But it's relevant

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,149
to a talk I recently gave at

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,629
the Grassroots Security conference, which I talked about a couple of episodes ago,

6
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:29,370
I think right after it happened and I learned a lot giving this talk.

7
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,369
And so I thought it would be an interesting topic for us to discuss.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,919
Now. It's,

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,240
-- it sounds boring. Right. Because like, what is open
-- source,

10
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:38,080
-- it's whatever the O SI defines
-- it

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,229
as,

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,279
right, which I told people that and they,

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,380
the audience didn't quite grasp the irony of that or why.

14
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,080
It was funny.

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,419
I know it's like

16
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,400
it's what this one central organization defines

17
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,090
this completely decentralized cultural movement does.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,849
Right. Right. And it, it,

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,849
it's funny but you also need like some weird

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,569
historical context.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,470
So for anyone listening who doesn't know there's the O SI,

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,160
which is what the open source initiative, I believe it stands for Institute.

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,279
I'm pretty sure it's initiative. It's not, I don't think It's Institute

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:07,980
open

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,980
source initiative

26
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,410
initiative. All right. Good, good, good. So

27
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,529
the O SI has like this

28
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:16,760
lofty interesting definition of open source and

29
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,879
there's like 10 point bullet points.

30
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,080
-- They have,
-- I'm sorry, I have to read this

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,470
open source licenses are licenses that comply with the open source definition.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,819
In brief, they allow software to be freely used,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,199
modified and shared

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,500
and then,

35
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,580
and then it gets complicated the details.

36
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:38,309
-- Yeah.
-- And, and the reality is if it's on their list, it's open source.

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,139
If it's not on their list, it's not open source.

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,370
Which, and, and the best part,

39
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,330
my favorite part of this is like the GP L people don't like

40
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,809
open source. So they're free software.

41
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,290
So the GP L is on the OS I's list,

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,180
but the GP L people would rather not be called open source.

43
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,779
So

44
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,940
it's hilarious anyway.

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,660
So

46
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:55,959
I give this talk right?

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,669
And I, I go through licensing, I go through the idea of like how projects work,

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,190
like how github

49
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,180
tends to work all this stuff. And now mind you, this was a security conference.

50
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,800
So I, I had some security stories weaved in here and there.

51
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:10,080
And fundamentally though I had this vision in my mind

52
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,929
of explaining open source to a bunch of security people,

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,320
so they could take that knowledge and go back to what they were doing

54
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,119
and

55
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,410
use open

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:19,759
source

57
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:24,048
or, or whatever, right? And the reality is at the end, it was obvious that

58
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:27,807
no one really cared about the definition of open source or how open source works.

59
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:31,477
They were like, how do we use it in a way that isn't insecure.

60
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,057
And I'm like,

61
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,147
that is a completely valid question and should

62
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,207
have been the entire topic of this talk.

63
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:37,968
I mean, I,

64
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,438
I like, I, I, you and I are both old enough to remember the whole shareware scene,

65
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:45,975
which was essentially a polite way of saying we're gonna pirate soft where

66
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:46,615
and

67
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:51,246
because we technically don't have to pay for it, it's not technically piracy,

68
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,136
but also that guy probably doesn't need to eat.

69
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:56,326
-- And so that's his problem.
-- No, shareware was perfect. It was like,

70
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,735
you, you could use a,

71
00:02:58,876 --> 00:02:58,936
a

72
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:03,455
demo. It was basically a demo of the software. See if you like it

73
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:07,975
-- and then if you did in theory pay for the real thing
-- or how many people paid for

74
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:08,585
Winrar.

75
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:09,815
I mean, Winrar

76
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:11,095
is different. I'm thinking

77
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:14,104
like Doom or Commander Kane or one of those things, right?

78
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:19,503
Like, I think games worked well with shareware. But like what PK zip was, shareware.

79
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:23,583
I definitely used PK zip. I mean, I was young and had no money anyway.

80
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,804
So not like I could have paid for it.

81
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:27,694
-- But well,
-- and also like back in the day, how did you get money to somebody?

82
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:30,343
-- Like, straight up some of them were like you mailed them
-- a check, you mailed them.

83
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:30,873
Yes.

84
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:33,953
I mean, I remember the PK where, like, I think it was after you ran it,

85
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,824
it would give you the like, oh, if you're using this and you like it, you should

86
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:37,651
give us money

87
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,031
-- and it had a literal address you would mail money to
-- which is not legal.

88
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,531
-- What do you mean? Mailing money
-- isn't legal?

89
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,111
No, you can't mail cash.

90
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,031
Are you sure

91
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,141
you live in? Canada?

92
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:52,682
Canada is like a real country. Does, does the United States feels a little more?

93
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,511
We'll say

94
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,311
cowboy in that regard.

95
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:59,712
-- They amended it recently.
-- I've received cash in the mail more than once.

96
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,552
Well, and you've probably also driven above the speed limit.

97
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:03,690
I

98
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,009
will not answer that question.

99
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,630
Oh, interesting.

100
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,529
-- Ok.
-- Anyway, no, we are not discussing the intricacies of only cash.

101
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,770
That's not the purpose of this.

102
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,079
They literally changed it a year ago where basically you

103
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,048
have to use registered mail for cash over $500.

104
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,950
So it looks like you could mail small amounts of cash.

105
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,105
PK ware was like 20 bucks.

106
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,424
Like it probably wasn't even that. I mean,

107
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:28,644
this was what the eighties and the nineties,

108
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,255
it was probably like $7 or something insane.

109
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,174
I don't know. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Ok.

110
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:37,915
So the point is give this talk, talk about licenses and at the end of it all,

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,135
it's basically just how do I, how do I use software more securely?

112
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:41,595
And

113
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,225
I found

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,029
the gears in my brain started to kind of go and we were, you know,

115
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,010
doing the Q and A at the end and hanging out in the hallway and all that.

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,670
And

117
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,709
it was, it was really interesting because when you're talking to

118
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,220
like security people or developers, whoever, and I, I feel like I,

119
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,910
I talk to these people a lot.

120
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,109
There was a ton of really good questions and, you know,

121
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,739
there were people just saying stuff like how

122
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,109
do I know what my developers are running?

123
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,299
Which they don't?

124
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,049
Yeah, they don't and you don't like.

125
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,619
Yeah, I OK.

126
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,290
I just found this nice A I fronting called Liber

127
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,760
Chet dot A I it's darker.

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,690
I it's like five or six containers.

129
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,700
It uses a couple of major components like Mongo DB and post grass cool.

130
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:24,339
But

131
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,540
I guarantee you there's at least 100 to 1000

132
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,690
things in there that I am just blissfully unaware of

133
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,000
-- that.
-- No one knows.

134
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,339
Um I mean, this is, this is kind of what like the idea of the S bomb is right where

135
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:36,563
you have software, you can

136
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,924
in theory get an S bomb for it and then

137
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,563
you can't know it's still in it because you have to

138
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,723
-- have some other tool to read the SS bomb because it's gigantic.
-- But

139
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:48,803
well, and to know what it is like, my favorite is always like spices and that,

140
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:53,014
for example, is codes phrase for may contain gluten if you're a celiac.

141
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:53,723
-- Right.
-- Right.

142
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:57,444
And So that's actually, that was one of the questions that came up was OK.

143
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:00,088
So let's say I have a list of all, all the software.

144
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:04,148
Like, what is it? How do I even know what this stuff is doing?

145
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:06,148
And it's like that is an excellent question.

146
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:10,708
-- Like,
-- if packaged food is not a part of some ecosystem like wordpress plugins or N PM,

147
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,067
-- what is fu, well,
-- ignoring that,

148
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:16,067
I'm not even going down that rabbit hole because I think that's bananas.

149
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,238
-- Well,
-- but I mean, at some point, I can't give you like,

150
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,907
I can't say this is a cashew or this is a Koch,

151
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:21,328
Koch.

152
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:22,828
And you're like, what's a Kusche?

153
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,321
Kusche? I'm like, it's Kush.

154
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:24,502
Kush,

155
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:26,201
it's, it's yummy.

156
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:30,041
-- I have no idea what that even is.
-- Well, that's what I'm saying is, it's a made up thing.

157
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,992
So it's like if I say this software contains,

158
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:35,391
that's the best you could do by making up a word.

159
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:36,582
So, but that's what I mean.

160
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:39,011
It's like if this software contains FU and FU is not the

161
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,372
actual package from Pi Pie or N PM or some ecosystem thing.

162
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,092
What the heck is this? Right? And that's why we see that a lot in like Java

163
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:45,752
where, you know,

164
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:48,411
it pulls in some Java package and you try and trace it down and it's just,

165
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:48,921
you can't find

166
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:50,855
it disappeared 10

167
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,756
-- or better yet. It did exist in an ecosystem, but it's gone
-- now that

168
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:58,415
can happen but is less common than it used to be.

169
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,906
Well, except we have a lot of 10 and 20 year old software.

170
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,165
Yeah, that's true.

171
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:05,466
That's true. I mean, if I found PK zip actually, you know, it was wild.

172
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,786
Speaking of that. Sorry, I'm going to go out on

173
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:10,496
a tangent for a moment. So, the company that made PK zip, like, way back in the day.

174
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:13,716
PK ware, they were at a conference. I was at a couple of months ago.

175
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:14,170
I

176
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,070
-- was like, why are
-- they still in business?

177
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,920
I know. Right.

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,470
But anyway, that's another story. I'm not,

179
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:20,609
it

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,250
was data protection solution.

181
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,160
They had no swag I wanted. So I didn't get, I think I got a pen from them or something.

182
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,850
But I was like, holy cow. This is like,

183
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,290
I, I just waves of nostalgia washed over me when I saw

184
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:32,459
him

185
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,269
and everyone there was, looked pretty young.

186
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,609
So I was like, I'm not going to go talk to them about PKZ

187
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,799
because they probably don't even know what that is.

188
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,959
I like that they transition to Z OS in the mainframe market

189
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,820
because those people hate change.

190
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,600
Well, all their products,

191
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:52,750
either men PK Protect for Z OS or PK encrypt for IBM systems.

192
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:57,489
-- Oh, interesting. Yeah. So, well, mainframe people have money and they hate
-- change.

193
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
That's true. That's why they have mainframes and money.

194
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:02,709
Yeah, pretty much

195
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:03,690
anyway.

196
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,269
Ok. Ok. So what is open source? Right.

197
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,059
And so all,

198
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,709
all of these questions, all this discussion

199
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,470
and

200
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,070
it kind of occurred to me that

201
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,890
there is the like technical o SI style definition of open source,

202
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,540
but people using open source, they literally don't care even a little bit,

203
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:23,290
right?

204
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:23,850
-- There's
-- de

205
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,089
and de facto,

206
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,320
this is classic dejo

207
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,899
and de facto is there's this beautiful lofty definition of,

208
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,330
here's the O SI licenses and then there's the actual like de

209
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,010
facto definition of like I grabbed a bunch of stuff off like,

210
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,789
oh perfect example, does a code snippet off stack overflow count as open source.

211
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,690
There's no license

212
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:42,212
on it.

213
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,614
That one.

214
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,783
-- Well, there can be,
-- there are code snippets that have, well,

215
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,713
but let's assume there's no license attached to it and it's just a code snippet.

216
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:52,254
There are code snips and stack overflow that have

217
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,403
literally cost humanity millions of hours in lost productivity.

218
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,164
-- Zip
-- slip. That was literally what zip slip was.

219
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:00,763
It was copying AAA

220
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:05,564
-- snippet from stack overflow and using it and it was incorrect.
-- Yeah, exactly.

221
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,223
So, you know, is that open source?

222
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,820
Well, the source code is there and everybody uses it like it's open source.

223
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,580
So I would say

224
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,780
it's open source.

225
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,640
I I would agree. I mean, and, and this is again

226
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,890
where if you asked a lawyer that question,

227
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,780
you would end up in like a six

228
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,140
hour discussion

229
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,059
about

230
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:26,619
what like what is copyrightable and who owns copy. It's,

231
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,900
-- it's so complicated.
-- Well, not just what is copyrightable and what is licenses

232
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,140
are also different things.

233
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,330
I'm going to put a link, I will not dwell on this, but I'm going to put a link.

234
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,940
I know I've talked

235
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,344
about this more than once on the show.

236
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:40,205
There is a, an article written by a lawyer named Pamela Chast

237
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,034
who's done,

238
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:44,594
she's done a bunch of work in like the open source universe on licensing.

239
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:48,424
She tries to answer the question like, who owns the copyright on source code?

240
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,075
Because this whole like, oh the authors of, of something

241
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:54,625
that does, that is not a legal entity that is not the,

242
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,395
the authors of cannot own the copyright to something.

243
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:01,135
Anyway, so I'll, I'll put a link to it for anyone. Any like licensing nerds. OK.

244
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,065
So anyway, yes, there's the, like,

245
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,940
I don't care what the o si definition of open source is.

246
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,500
There's the fact that my developers are taking this stuff and they're using

247
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,349
this stuff and I'm a security person and I have to know like,

248
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,309
what is this stuff?

249
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,270
And so we ended up in discussions like one of my favorites.

250
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,340
I know a person who works at a company that has a quarterly open source meeting.

251
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,960
They have like a council that has to approve

252
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,869
all of the open source dependencies once a quarter.

253
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,789
-- Is this before or after they're used?
-- Exactly. That's exactly it.

254
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,645
If it's after they've been used, that's a little bit late.

255
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,025
-- That's like me
-- saying, well, it's always after, right?

256
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,614
I mean, so what's funny about that though is I said, I say this and one of the guys like,

257
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,575
oh, that sounds interesting.

258
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,125
I'm like, no, no, please do not do this

259
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:44,554
because well, here's what actually happens, right?

260
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:49,715
If you tell developers who you are literally paying to solve hard problems that

261
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:51,835
they have to wait

262
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:57,155
a month to get approval to use this library, they want to use to solve their problem.

263
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,799
They will find a way

264
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,119
and they're just going to copy and paste the source code most likely

265
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,219
into their application instead of actually using a package manager that can,

266
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,440
you know, upgrade it and track it and all that stuff.

267
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,559
And see, that's the irony.

268
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,270
Like I wrote some Python software to use some different A I back ends.

269
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,400
And I realized it was actually way less effort to package it

270
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,830
up and put it on pi pie than to like maintain my

271
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,979
own copy of it because it literally to package it up and

272
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,440
put it on pi pi create an account on PP create a project

273
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,065
all of that five minute tutorial and then you run two commands

274
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:32,075
and it's done. And so now I can pip install my thing

275
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,244
on any system.

276
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:36,765
And I don't have to like copy a file over and make sure it's the right one I can.

277
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:37,215
It's,

278
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,924
it's actually easier to distribute it to the world than

279
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,684
it is to maintain my own internal distribution thing.

280
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,385
It used to be.

281
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,474
There's actually for anyone who, who does Python work and doesn't know about this,

282
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:51,565
there's a new, there's this p project dot Tonel which is like the new way to

283
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,460
in instead of the old setup dot pie and all that crap.

284
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,809
-- This is
-- using the new one but like literally, I don't have to copy for,

285
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,900
you're using Piero

286
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:58,390
dot

287
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:58,780
Tomel.

288
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,780
OK. So what you can do then

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,739
there is a tool called poetry.

290
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,859
But poetry instead of like using dependencies from pie, pie, you can play it

291
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:10,419
at github repos, which is absolutely amazing in Chef's Kiss. Very nice.

292
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,619
But I'd rather not, I'd rather just pip install

293
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:12,940
well.

294
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,739
But if you use poetry, you don't have to use pip,

295
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:16,306
which is beautiful because poetry will

296
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,755
auto manage your virtual environments for you,

297
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,435
which is amazing.

298
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:24,395
Well, and this is exactly kind of how open source ended up winning,

299
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:26,445
I think because they made it so easy to pull down

300
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,866
stuff and grab stuff that kind of mostly sort of often

301
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:29,866
works

302
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,075
and

303
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,276
you can't stop it without

304
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,536
like massively intrusive firewall

305
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,132
anyway. All right.

306
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,572
I want to pull us back to the,

307
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,932
the actual conversation topic because we're talking about

308
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,692
like how security people view open source.

309
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:48,481
And I think what, what came out of this really is

310
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,461
like a, a myths and truths

311
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:54,531
I think would be vastly more interesting in this regard.

312
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,151
And this is where I need to start collecting these.

313
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:58,581
But like another one was they, these people were like,

314
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,651
how do I know if I can trust this thing?

315
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,252
And I'm like, well, you kind of can't,

316
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:03,682
-- how
-- do

317
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,961
-- you know you can trust your own code?
-- Well, yes,

318
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,890
yes. That's part of the discussion obviously. But,

319
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,010
but examples being like, how do I know if a project is, for example,

320
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,630
maintained by a maintainer from one of the

321
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,780
forbidden countries where in the United States,

322
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,510
for example, there's countries we legally can't interact with, right?

323
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,969
Well, that's the thing.

324
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:27,729
So, so here's, here's the the trick and you say, oh, you can't know and that is true.

325
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:28,450
However,

326
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,145
there is the concept of due diligence with the law, right?

327
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:35,476
So if I just YOLO and don't look at all

328
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:38,085
that's different than saying, I

329
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:42,406
looked at who the authors are and tried to identify their countries of origin.

330
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,926
And this is what I found, right? That is due diligence.

331
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:49,166
I made a commercially reasonable effort, blah, blah, blah.

332
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:52,745
Yes, exactly. And so there's that angle of it, right? And so

333
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:56,286
there's a question of like, how like, how do I know if this project is maintained?

334
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,242
How do I know if like there's people working on it?

335
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:02,012
And this is where like, for example, there's the open SSF scorecard project

336
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,401
which I think we all know from a strictly security perspective,

337
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,401
generates like nonsense data.

338
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:12,122
But from a liability perspective, you can probably claim his due diligence. Right?

339
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,481
I literally just went through this again with,

340
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:17,302
I found a air quotes security vulnerability and it is

341
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:20,202
technically a security vulnerability and that it can reveal the,

342
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,882
you know, valid or non valid accounts.

343
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:22,892
And I literally went to develop,

344
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,197
I'm like, is this technically a security vulnerability?

345
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,607
However, for me, it's more of a GDPR compliance thing,

346
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,177
like it's a compliance issue first, a security issue, second.

347
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,547
And he's like, yes, I agree. You know,

348
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:36,028
and it'll get fixed at some point. It's not a big deal.

349
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,098
And I think that's a big part of so

350
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:43,078
many security people make fun of compliance driven security.

351
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,357
But the reality is at the end of the day,

352
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:48,478
the compliance driven stuff is probably what's gonna bite me more.

353
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:48,604
Oh

354
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,833
for sure. I mean, this is where I think I forget who's, who wrote this.

355
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:54,843
Someone unmasked it on pointed out though, you know, when,

356
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,193
when Microsoft announced their recall feature,

357
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:59,874
which was going to take a screenshot every five seconds or whatever.

358
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:02,513
And the security people were, of course, are losing their minds.

359
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:06,114
And this person said, look, don't talk about it in the context of security,

360
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:09,023
talk about it in the context of, of lawyers

361
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:11,354
because if you get sued,

362
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,023
the legal counsel on the other opposing side is going

363
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,299
cause all this recall data and now you have a screenshot of every

364
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,969
five seconds of everything that's been done

365
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,789
on every computer in your organization.

366
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,179
Holy crap. Someone's going to jail. Probably.

367
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,989
Discovery might find some.

368
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,710
Well, I remember my mother when this is

369
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,549
decades ago was, had a spam problem with her government email account.

370
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,979
Ok. And I was like, well, you know, you're gonna, this is way back in the day.

371
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,190
So I'm like, you're gonna have to get them to, like, block spam for you.

372
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,549
And she's like, well, they say it'll take weeks or months and I'm like,

373
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,929
do you want them to do it tomorrow?

374
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,080
And she's like, yeah, and I'm like,

375
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,960
tell them you got pornographic spam and it's making you uncomfortable and it's,

376
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,909
it's a possible

377
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,799
place, blah, blah, blah, legal issue. And she's like, that's,

378
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:52,270
oh,

379
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,969
and then she comes home the next day and she's like, yeah, they fixed it.

380
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,900
So it's funny you mentioned that.

381
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,700
I think I've told this story here before, but I don't remember for sure.

382
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,760
I remember when we worked at Red Hat,

383
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,169
if you wanted like

384
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,679
a logo or something for a special event for like making shirts or coats or whatever,

385
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,000
like, and some sort of swag,

386
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,039
you'd have to contact the marketing people and they put you on a list

387
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,190
and then you'd have to wait like some amount of time.

388
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,799
Like it was usually months, then they would get to you and help you.

389
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,349
But instead if you sent them an email that said, hey, I'm sending this logo off.

390
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,400
I made to the printers tomorrow

391
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:24,919
just so, you know,

392
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,239
they'd be like, you can't use that.

393
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,500
And I'm like, well, it's, the order has to go in tomorrow.

394
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,739
They somehow find a way to send you the correct logo.

395
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,419
So,

396
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,140
yes, it's very, that, that very much feels like the, what is it?

397
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,809
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness sort of thing.

398
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,539
And, and I think there's a lot of security that even works that way anyway. Ok.

399
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,219
-- So back to
-- if you want to get anything done, that's how you do it.

400
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:49,700
Because if I ask for permission, I'm gonna have to wait a month or in your case,

401
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,169
three months for the council of open source tribal elders at this company to,

402
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,770
to even look at the paper.

403
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,330
You know, this is like dealing with the V

404
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:56,969
the

405
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:57,549
Vons

406
00:16:58,489 --> 00:16:58,650
Vons.

407
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:00,880
I don't want to stick an extra

408
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:04,030
-- anyways
-- because you obviously haven't read the book enough.

409
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,000
You should read it again.

410
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,920
Your punishment is to read Hitch Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

411
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,520
-- That's not punishment.
-- I know. Right.

412
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:14,670
But like straight up, I don't have three months. I need to get it done now like,

413
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:15,858
well, you don't,

414
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:16,900
-- but
-- this
-- is like the

415
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,420
thing

416
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,579
we needed,

417
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,680
we needed a front end for an A I

418
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,000
like in, in, in a week. So I

419
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,348
went and tested a bunch of them and found one and deployed it and here we are like,

420
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,819
and yes, we know you keep talking about it,

421
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,800
it's just, it's such a nice, lovely, well written piece of software.

422
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,479
Like, I'm really happy with it. So,

423
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,380
so anyway,

424
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:35,859
this

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,660
is kind of the discussion about what open source is, right?

426
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,619
Because that's supposed to be what we're talking about.

427
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:44,319
It's easy to rat hole on this one because it, there's just so many weird intricacies.

428
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:44,660
Right.

429
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,900
It's wild to me that security people think developers care about

430
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,770
anything beyond getting their job done as like priority number one.

431
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,280
No, I, I disagree with that. I think developers want to do the right thing.

432
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,640
But

433
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,689
the first most important thing is my manager said, go do X or Bill and

434
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:02,329
I

435
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:02,800
need to

436
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,040
and I will try to do that within the context of

437
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,939
doing it securely and safely in GDPR compliantly and all that.

438
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:11,819
But at the end of the day, none of that matters if I don't get it done.

439
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,930
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. 100%. And, and I think that's,

440
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,359
that's likewise the problem the security people have is

441
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,699
on the other side of that coin is security.

442
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,760
People don't want to be in the way of,

443
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,380
right. They don't want to slow down product.

444
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,270
Well, there are some, but the people I was talking to are,

445
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,939
they're like legitimate in the trenches, good security folk

446
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,160
that just that their problem is their, their developers are using

447
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,699
whatever they don't know what it is and they don't know what to do.

448
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,500
Right.

449
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:42,800
And,

450
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,219
and I think that is a vastly more common problem than the

451
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,859
security team everyone hates because they just say no to everything.

452
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,140
And those do exist.

453
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,520
-- But
-- I also think it's a maturity thing.

454
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:58,319
Like I realize now as a security person at best, I'm a concierge

455
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,579
because people come to me and say I'm hungry and

456
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:03,000
I better offer them a good restaurant that they like.

457
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,630
Or else they're gonna walk out of the hotel and go find a restaurant

458
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,770
whether I like it or not.

459
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,140
And I can't even make the argument now of like, oh,

460
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,199
we can control spending and prevent them from doing it through, you know,

461
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,699
spending controls because

462
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,040
-- they can just use free stuff.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

463
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,000
Like you can't, and that's the thing with open source. Like you can't,

464
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,060
unless you firewall pretty much the entire internet that's

465
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,180
necessary for developers to access, like stock overflowing github.

466
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
That was, what was it that came up? And there was some, some security standard.

467
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,359
I forget which one it was.

468
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,520
But they suggested firewall developers,

469
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,380
workstations and everyone laughed at them

470
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,540
-- because it was like, this is stupid. No,
-- I've seen it.

471
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,959
I have straight up, like, I remember dealing with somebody who,

472
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,459
like all they had access to for an ID was notepad because

473
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:47,160
they wouldn't install any software and it was so firewalled,

474
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,180
it was a US federal government thing.

475
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,739
And he's like, you know what, I get paid hourly as a contractor kind of like it's,

476
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,369
and it's heartbreaking but like

477
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:55,160
I get

478
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,329
paid

479
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:55,969
is a cash,

480
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,030
right?

481
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,140
Yeah.

482
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,760
OK. So, anyway, anyway, I mean,

483
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,380
so, so again, we're going back to, you know,

484
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,680
this particular discussion people talking about,

485
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,219
you know, asking good questions about kind of the open source usage.

486
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:12,560
The XZ discussion

487
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:17,439
I thought was pretty wild because so this was, I mean, I'm in central Wisconsin,

488
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:18,959
that's where this conference was.

489
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,640
So we're not dealing with like, you know, people that were in, in,

490
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,939
in the middle of XZ for months and months, you know,

491
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:26,339
dealing with all this kind of crap, like a lot of us were

492
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,979
and from the perspective of the folks that was there,

493
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,140
it was very much like, ok,

494
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,859
so Xe happened, like, what do I actually need to care about because of this?

495
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,060
And it's like, fundamentally, do you have it?

496
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:38,650
Like,

497
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,199
that's really all you need to care about, you know,

498
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,969
because they didn't care about any of the details.

499
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:46,550
They didn't even care if they had it and it wasn't affected, right?

500
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,180
It was just a matter of like, do I have a bad version?

501
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,939
-- How do I know?
-- Well, that's, I mean, that's true.

502
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,719
Like there's, I've got that letter from Kia that says, you know,

503
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,849
park your car outside because it might catch fire and set your house on fire.

504
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,989
It hasn't so far,

505
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,359
well, just burn your house down. Sue Kia get a new house, how you know, works perfect.

506
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,630
I don't think that's how it works.

507
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,959
Once they've sent a letter and told me to park outside they've met their diligence.

508
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:10,459
Right.

509
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,810
Right. That's

510
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,260
true.

511
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,310
I mean, but yeah, because here's the thing,

512
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,599
I don't have time to deal with all the possible false positives because

513
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:21,680
I literally have, well, a million of them because

514
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,310
software

515
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,530
and, and so that was a huge, that was another big discussion point was the fact that,

516
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,959
like,

517
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:32,989
so let's say you have a scanner, which a lot of a lot of organizations do

518
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:37,020
I scan the software? I get back 700 findings.

519
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,680
-- What do I do with
-- this?

520
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,060
Like I just looked, it's using an eight month old PG vector container

521
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:46,420
which is, it's got to be out of date and have some CV S, right? It's eight months old,

522
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,979
but at the same time, it's only available internally, kind of who cares?

523
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,069
So like again,

524
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:51,729
right.

525
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,020
Yes, that, that's where some of the risk conversations come from then is

526
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,219
OK. I have 700 vulnerabilities.

527
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:02,546
How do I start to try to figure out what actually affects me? And that is a

528
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:02,836
hard

529
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:03,265
problem.

530
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,546
Actually, you're asking the wrong question. They all technically affect you.

531
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,696
It's which ones actually matter

532
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,015
which ones are likely to be exploited

533
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,865
and cause problems, right?

534
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,985
Because perfect example,

535
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,975
there's a ton of cross site scripting and remember we worked at Red Hat and I,

536
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:17,656
I loved it.

537
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,316
Uh There's a cross site scripting product vulnerability, sorry,

538
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:23,015
in a product and there was one that was reported and I'm like, ok, cool.

539
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:25,225
Assign a CV. And that person was like, sure, whatever it'll get

540
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:26,692
when it gets fixed. No big deal.

541
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:28,151
I'm like, yeah, you know, it's a work around.

542
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,911
Just use a separate browser profile, right? So you're not

543
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,452
clicking on weird stuff.

544
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,192
And then I had another organization submit another cross site

545
00:22:35,202 --> 00:22:37,891
scripting in this product and they were like flipping out,

546
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,332
they wanted updates daily and I'm like, no,

547
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:43,612
like we'll fix it when we do. It's a, it's a low moderate.

548
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,732
And ultimately, what got them to

549
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,171
stop harassing me was I, I showed them look,

550
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:51,161
here's another public one like this is cross site scripting is,

551
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,160
it's, it's a web interface.

552
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,239
Well, it can be very serious. I mean, you can,

553
00:22:56,439 --> 00:23:00,369
you can't blow it off. It depends what, how you're using it and what you're doing.

554
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:04,010
-- But
-- this is like owning a house and saying like there's a loose floorboard,

555
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,609
-- that's how floors work.
-- Yes, but it also

556
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,290
cross site scripting is one of those interesting points because it could be

557
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,699
a loose floorboard or it could be like the rotting foundation beneath you.

558
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:16,439
Absolutely.

559
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:17,010
And

560
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,050
my job was literally to check that.

561
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,651
That's the problem with all of these security vulnerabilities is

562
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,561
we don't have a nice way to be able to say like this is foundational. This is

563
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:29,730
a squeaky floor.

564
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,961
It also depends like if this PG vector is only provided on

565
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,031
an internal docker interface through a very limited piece of software,

566
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,110
probably really hard to attack.

567
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,590
Whereas if it's a post cress SQL database running at a web hosting company,

568
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:45,100
yeah, that might be a problem.

569
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:48,151
-- But
-- you know, and so this is so this is what's funny, right?

570
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,651
There are are security tools and products that claim

571
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:54,881
they can do this kind of,

572
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:55,302
you know,

573
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:58,472
inspection of your application and understand reach ability

574
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:00,011
and all of this sort of stuff.

575
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:00,692
And

576
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:01,651
none of them can

577
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:02,182
completely,

578
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,131
it's an unsolved problem and anyone who claims it,

579
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:08,491
like there's some things you can do, but for the most part you can't.

580
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:10,871
But like this is an example of where

581
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:13,612
when we develop software, when we build things,

582
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:17,651
we don't attach metadata that says something like this particular container

583
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,973
is only internal, it has zero network we'll say or, or whatever, right?

584
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:25,233
-- There's a million things we can do.
-- You're bringing back something

585
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,003
I tried to do at Red Hat 10 years ago.

586
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:30,873
And actually Red Hat bought a company that had a product that did that

587
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:34,432
this product would actually like take incoming requests

588
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:39,113
and so you could track the request as it hit databases or cash layers or whatever

589
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:42,203
anyways, it ended up being folded into openshift and that,

590
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,512
that tracking bit of the technology just went away because it was just too

591
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:46,302
complex

592
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:47,244
and expensive.

593
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:48,874
Nobody cared

594
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,683
and nobody really cared.

595
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,764
-- Well, I think people are maybe will care
-- well.

596
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:58,093
But the thing is you have log files so you can, you can do that after the fact,

597
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:00,114
-- painfully retroactively,
-- some of it.

598
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:00,404
I mean,

599
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:04,053
this is actually where the observable space has some really cool features you can,

600
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:04,543
you can leverage.

601
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,673
But anyway, it doesn't matter. The point is back to the like original point, right?

602
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:10,374
It was talking about, I've got all these vulnerabilities, what do I do?

603
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,854
And I mean, this is also where

604
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,973
you can start talking about like

605
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:17,574
understanding what you have and,

606
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,675
and building like this is where s bombs have a cool thing.

607
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,084
Um It's called the relationships, I think in SBO

608
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:25,814
talk. But it's basically just dependency graphs, right?

609
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,155
Of saying like this one, dependency is pulling in 700 things.

610
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,155
Can I get rid of it? Do I need it? What is it doing?

611
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,035
You know, and some of them, you can, some of them you can't

612
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:36,454
every time I install I think what is it?

613
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:38,875
Emac keeps pulling in Postgres SQL or something?

614
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,645
That is epic. If it does.

615
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:43,635
Actually, I found out the other day someone wrote a thing, you know, LD

616
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,495
D, the linker,

617
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,855
whatever. I forget that what LDD stands for.

618
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,355
But it's the like linker on Linux,

619
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:55,176
I can show you what other libraries are linked to by the thing you have right

620
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:55,426
there

621
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:58,095
being linked, that's not being declared.

622
00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:02,286
Well, no, no, no, it's, it only shows you, the things you are linking against,

623
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:04,326
but those other things link against other things.

624
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,276
It's very, you know, the typical dependency problem.

625
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:07,135
Someone in the,

626
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,995
in the example I saw on Mastodon they did that

627
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:12,286
the LD tree or whatever it was called against Vim

628
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,770
and then is linked to AG

629
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,780
VBS like Liv Vor.

630
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm like, what, what the heck is that?

631
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,150
But you know, it's because one of the things,

632
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,219
it links to links to a thing that links to Livor

633
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,170
and it's like

634
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,119
-- the
-- knee bones

635
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,319
to the nuclear submarine.

636
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:26,989
Right. Right.

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,810
And so, but like uh it's just, it's such a and that,

638
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:32,530
that alone could be obviously its own talk.

639
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,209
I think the point is right, when you use a vulnerability scanner now

640
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,729
it, it almost all of the findings are open source, right?

641
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,050
That's like, basically what,

642
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:42,520
well, what else would they be?

643
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,609
-- Well
-- be. That's true because you're not running closed source.

644
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,305
It's kind of a, the

645
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:47,234
pathology of like,

646
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,344
unless it's

647
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:51,015
the only close source, basically,

648
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:53,015
the only close source vendors that are doing a good job are

649
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,025
also all CV numbering authorities and there's like 100 of them.

650
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,185
Yeah, there's not very many

651
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,344
Microsoft. Absolutely. They're doing a good job.

652
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:01,545
Oracle.

653
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:06,464
Yeah. But when you're, when you're doing development, I mean,

654
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:13,000
-- there's um
-- I've seen developers pulling in a copy of Adobe to do PDF shenanigans.

655
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:13,489
Probably

656
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:13,800
true.

657
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,719
I wrote some Powershell scripts that use word to convert

658
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:21,310
word documents because I tried converting them with Python.

659
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:21,560
And

660
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,660
that did not go well, not even a little bit. And I

661
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,500
sadly discovered you convert from word to simplified html and then you feed

662
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,819
it into Python to turn it into even more actual simple html.

663
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,880
And that works because all I wanted was the tables. I just wanted the damn tables.

664
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,469
But anyway,

665
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,150
-- so like all of this, but
-- this is how developers think and work

666
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,390
well.

667
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,750
It is developers solve problems, right? That's what they're fundamentally doing.

668
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:45,910
I

669
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:46,219
mean,

670
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,869
and word is a dependency.

671
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:49,790
Good luck,

672
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,510
right? I know it makes perfect sense.

673
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,959
But my point is like all this stuff put together, right? There's, there's,

674
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,319
it was fascinating to me that and, and I should, I should have known this.

675
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,880
I mean, I really don't have a good excuse.

676
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,790
Other than that I had like this grandiose vision in my mind of like,

677
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,459
oh we're going to talk about like the big open source question and then obviously

678
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,719
everything else will just trickle out from that when the reality is.

679
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,949
I mean, no people just they have their problems,

680
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,839
they don't really care what open source is, they have problems they need to solve,

681
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:17,750
they want them solved.

682
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,550
I just realized, does anybody anywhere teach how to use open source?

683
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,349
-- And I'm guessing,
-- no, that's part of the, that's part of this conversation as well.

684
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,920
And so I guess most there's like tangential references in computer science.

685
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,810
-- Courses.
-- No,

686
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,270
-- I don't think
-- there are well tangential anyways.

687
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,939
What that means though is that everybody discovers and

688
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,589
learns to use open source on their own.

689
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,979
-- So, it's also like the blind people in the elephant. No,
-- it's not that at all.

690
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:45,069
So this is, this was, this was one of the discussions I had as well. Right.

691
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:45,819
Where

692
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,180
people don't use open source,

693
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,609
they use an ecosystem, they're using Python, they're using go,

694
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,030
they're following how

695
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:56,790
tos.

696
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,609
And

697
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,150
if you read a, how to, of like getting started in Python,

698
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,709
it just has you pip installing crap right away.

699
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,430
It doesn't explain

700
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:11,069
what's going on why all of this stuff is available for free. Who is working on it?

701
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:12,922
Where do these people come from?

702
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,802
It's just

703
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,253
run this command

704
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,942
and then paste this code into like test dot P.

705
00:29:18,953 --> 00:29:23,223
You want open source on Mac Os, you run curl space pipe, brew. Sh

706
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:24,623
Right. It's fine, you know,

707
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:26,672
and like, but that's what I mean, it's like

708
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:31,333
everybody discovers open source kind of on their own. And so it's up to them to,

709
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:32,383
they get to sort of

710
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:36,446
-- fine and decide what it means to them. But,
-- ok. No, no, no. Here's the thing.

711
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:40,505
I don't think they even discover it. Kurt, I think the, like the, the single,

712
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:43,215
oh, I see what you're saying. They're like using it and they don't even,

713
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:47,186
-- they're
-- using Python. They don't even understand,

714
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:50,395
like open source is the thing they might have heard the term,

715
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,186
they might kind of get it,

716
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,145
but like they're just using Python,

717
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,020
I think actually. Yeah,

718
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,369
I think you're right. And that, my comment still stands is stats.

719
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,849
Then they're using Python

720
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:01,250
and

721
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,329
they don't even,

722
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,579
like, like I use a car and I'm told to put oil in it and keep that between the L and the F

723
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,890
right. Too high is bad, too low is bad. And also once it's like

724
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,770
black, black, as opposed to like dark black,

725
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:19,040
probably get more fresh oil in there. Somehow

726
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:20,089
I don't even do that.

727
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,800
My car puts a thing on the screen that says go get more oil and then I bring

728
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,040
it to

729
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,459
that. It's like too late.

730
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,290
-- It's an old
-- car, right? But by the time the sensor trips it's just like, wow. Yeah.

731
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:32,400
Sludge.

732
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,400
That's fair.

733
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:37,439
-- That's fair
-- again. So if everybody has sort of a different,

734
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,170
you know, people also have different experiences of it.

735
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,359
Like,

736
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,260
my experience of Python is guaranteed going to

737
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,479
be different than somebody else's experience of Python because

738
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,199
I actually have some understanding of what Python is and I know,

739
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:51,880
-- well, no, like I use virtual environments and stuff to like,
-- I've seen your Python.

740
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,790
It's a very different experience

741
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:58,160
and not in a good way. This is the, I found my sandwich on the ground way.

742
00:30:58,589 --> 00:30:59,880
But hey, my co works,

743
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,719
you know.

744
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,410
That's right. I'm not starving to death.

745
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,079
Oh, you should see the PHP script I just wrote.

746
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,089
-- No,
-- I don't want to, I'm going to completely avoid that.

747
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,099
And that's the thing is security people maybe need to sit down

748
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,260
and talk to these people and kind of understand or at least

749
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:18,160
make sure they're speaking about the same. No, no, let me finish.

750
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,339
Make sure they're at least talking about the same

751
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,469
thing because if you have a security person talk,

752
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:25,479
like if you had me talking about Python security 20 years ago,

753
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,760
I would have been in a totally different

754
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,680
world than the actual developer using Python.

755
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,790
I don't have a good answer for what you're saying

756
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,030
-- right now because I think, I
-- think communication

757
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,079
-- start by talking
-- sort of,

758
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,199
but I also think we need to make sure we frame the problems correctly.

759
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,650
I think just by definition, that's what I

760
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:42,939
mean

761
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,599
us and anyone listening to us

762
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
have a,

763
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,670
we'll say,

764
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,640
probable level of experience and understanding in this

765
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,709
space that it eludes a lot of people

766
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,719
just because that's how, that's how Bell Curves work, right? I I

767
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,000
don't want to brag,

768
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,520
but we're going to say everyone listening to us is on the top end of that Bell Curve.

769
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,239
Well, just knowing that this thing exists already puts you

770
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,485
exactly like you know what open source is.

771
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:09,145
And so this is where I,

772
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:13,765
I feel like the conversation and the way to talk about this and what I'm,

773
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:14,865
I'm now morphing.

774
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:19,365
Also, I'll put a link to my original deck in the show notes that I presented that,

775
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,715
that what I'm working on now is going is like, not even comparable.

776
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,576
But I think the way to talk about this isn't to talk about

777
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,145
open source isn't to talk about like dependencies and all this stuff.

778
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,465
It's really just to say like, so you're a Python shop,

779
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:34,105
what does that mean?

780
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:36,881
And they don't care about licenses.

781
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:40,552
I mean, look, your lawyers are gonna care and they're like, obviously, like,

782
00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:43,682
if you're full of GP L there are requirements, there's things you have to do.

783
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:45,141
So it's not like you can ignore open

784
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:46,041
source licenses.

785
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,962
There's a lot of companies that seem to think about

786
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:51,531
most probably do and, and, but again, that's a problem for the lawyers.

787
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,092
I'm not tackling that just from a security perspective.

788
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:58,531
It's really about like, so you're running Python, what does that mean? Right.

789
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:02,932
Because like a generalized open source talk has no value.

790
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:06,250
But talking about like, this is what Python does

791
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:07,670
that has value.

792
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,069
And I, like I said,

793
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,599
I think talking and just figuring out even if

794
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:13,920
you're talking about the same problem or question.

795
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,189
Yeah, for sure, for sure. So anyway, I,

796
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,170
I learned a lot. It's funny because I, I definitely,

797
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:23,479
I learned more giving this talk than I've learned in a long time,

798
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,500
which is amusing to me because I was the one

799
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,000
who was supposed to be bequeathing knowledge upon the audience and

800
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:32,650
-- they definitely turned that around on me.
-- This is how research happens.

801
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,439
This is how advancement happens. Right? So,

802
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:35,420
goes there.

803
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,369
Oh, I,

804
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,410
what we, what, what used and it's, it's not that you're wrong. It's just that

805
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,250
it used to be correct, but the world changes a little bit every year.

806
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,119
Yeah. And eventually

807
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,489
you go from like all these horror movies that literally now

808
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,449
boil down to take out your cell phone and call 911.

809
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,130
No, I'm serious. Like pretty much every horror film prior to like 1990 boils down to

810
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,619
take out your cell phone and call 911. Don't split up, don't run away. Just

811
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:09,080
no split up. Everyone go into the dark woods. It'll be fine.

812
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,399
Right. Your movie sucks. Kurt. No one wants to watch it.

813
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,438
All right. So with that, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

814
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,010
Go to social security podcast.com for the show. Not Su

815
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:18,320
Podos

816
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,879
says podcast. Hashtag on Mastodon. Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.

817
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,590
-- You too. Thanks everybody.
-- Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
