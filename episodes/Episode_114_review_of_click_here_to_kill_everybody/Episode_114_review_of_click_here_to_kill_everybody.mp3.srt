Hello.

1
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,170
And welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 114 with myself,

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,890
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,389
-- So,
-- we're gonna review a book today. Have we reviewed a book before?

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,190
I don't remember.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,389
I don't know that I've ever read a book before

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,030
anyway.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,920
No, honestly, well, in the context of computer security,

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,649
I haven't bothered to read any of the books

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,899
in ages because they, well, has there been any good ones?

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,529
Uh, there was, uh, there will be cybercrime, I think it's called

11
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,180
or will, there will be Cyber War or it's Mark Goodman's book?

12
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:42,360
It's actually pretty good. I read that one some time ago. I, I've read a handful.

13
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,009
I need to actually look back at my,

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,810
-- I've
-- looked at most of them

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,209
and the synopsis,

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,689
synopsis. I don't know the plural, uh, of those and, and just not been terribly

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,180
impressed and more to the point.

18
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,669
So, what, like, what's the actionable advice?

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,060
Uh, they never like

20
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,310
advice. Exactly.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,630
Um,

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,360
you know, and, and I can totally see reading them for relaxation and fun, but, like,

23
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,260
this is my daily life.

24
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,629
So it's not really fun.

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,819
It's all I know.

26
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,500
I, I'm pretty much Stockholm Syndrome for the security industry.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,620
So, anyway, we want to talk about Schneier's new book,

28
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,180
which is titled Click Here To Kill Everybody.

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,379
And then the subtitle is Security and Survival in a hyper connected world.

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,160
And it just came out not long ago.

31
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:33,019
So it, it's kind of exciting to read it quickly and then,

32
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,480
and then have a quick chat about it.

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:37,519
Well, in fairness, it's not a big book. It's 200 pages

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,970
with 100 pages of references.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,559
Yeah, 244 I think is what it came, came at

36
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,819
on my Ereader. So, so let's do this.

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,680
What are your like, like, what's your two minute thoughts

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,800
-- on this book?
-- My, well, my, my 32nd thought on this book is quite simply that

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,279
we've attached everything to computers

40
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:03,690
and all of those computers are on the internet

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,089
and

42
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:08,449
all of those computers are not very secure.

43
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,339
So we've gone from a situation where, you know, if you wanna go mess around, say,

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,960
uh, well, let's say you want to turn the gas off at a power plant.

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,380
Well, it used to be that you had to like, slop down there and turn a valve physically,

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,839
you know, and, well, that, that's expensive, right?

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,970
Why not attach a motor to that valve and, you know,

48
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,750
let somebody remotely press a button.

49
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,960
Cool. That's, that's

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,949
nice.

51
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:35,800
Well, why not have that button pushing attached to a computer so,

52
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,250
you know, some central control room can do it.

53
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,199
That's a long 30 seconds.

54
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,850
Yeah.

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,419
But basically, I mean, that's the premise of the book is we've done all this stuff.

56
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,169
We've connected all this crap up. And, uh,

57
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:49,779
well, security is like today, you know, I was driving my kids to school and

58
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,889
somebody is, you know,

59
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:53,419
holding their phone up in front of their face while they're driving,

60
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:57,669
we make things safe only because we have to. Right. We don't do safety first.

61
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,630
Yes. And, and that's kind of touched on here as well.

62
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,429
There's, I mean, I mean, so the beginning of the book is

63
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,110
kind of you are here

64
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,309
where,

65
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,830
and there's nothing,

66
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,660
I don't think there's anything that, that's super new

67
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,720
if you're paying attention in this,

68
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,050
in, in the beginning part.

69
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,539
-- Well,
-- I think part of it is just how it's, it, it,

70
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,250
it's one of those things that's crept up like everybody has a cell phone now.

71
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,089
So, for example, I just bought some Amazon Dots because

72
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:29,660
I give up like I, I carry a device that can record me 24 7 anyways.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,619
So I'm just gonna scatter some more of them around my house and at least I'll be able to

74
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,789
tell it to add stuff to my grocery list without

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,350
having to haul my phone out of my pocket.

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
Sure. Sure.

77
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:41,479
The degree of computer control is

78
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,940
somewhat new and, and especially around, you know,

79
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,970
well, it's not new. If you've been paying

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,529
cars

81
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,720
and, and hang on, let's, let's,

82
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:55,750
we're getting way in the weeds too fast. Let's, let's cover the book.

83
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,350
The beginning talks about kind of where we are today.

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
And if you've been paying attention,

85
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,910
you aren't going to necessarily learn anything new.

86
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,460
However, I will say Schneier

87
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,229
has a very nice writing style. That's easy to read and easy to understand his, his,

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,199
his superpower other than growing an awesome beard

89
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,800
is explaining things in a way. Most anyone could understand.

90
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,480
I could give this book to my parents.

91
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,959
Well, you can explain to normal people

92
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,950
exactly.

93
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,869
Like I would feel comfortable giving this book

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,170
-- to my parents
-- and even to politicians.

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,100
That's, that's the key right? Is

96
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,170
I feel like this book,

97
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,910
-- every policymaker needs to read this book,
-- there's like 100 and 50 books,

98
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
every policymaker needs to read.

99
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,230
And that's,

100
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,309
you know, that's part of the problem where we are, right?

101
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,859
Is the world is just so hideously complicated.

102
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,670
My guess is we're lucky if most of them read the comics

103
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,519
on Sunday.

104
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,519
-- Uh
-- I'd be, I would, I would say we'd be lucky if they read it all anyway.

105
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,410
And then kind of the second half of this book talks about some

106
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,059
of the what are some possible solutions to all of these horrendous problems?

107
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,329
And fundamentally,

108
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,290
I think what it comes down to is Schneier

109
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,320
says

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,079
we have to regulate

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,250
-- everything. Well,
-- all the economic incentives are against being secure.

112
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,049
They totally are.

113
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,649
And he's actually quite clear and honest about that,

114
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,170
which makes me really happy because I think people always pretend,

115
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,170
oh, if you're not secure

116
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,540
then you're going to lose money. And the reality is no, you're not.

117
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:25,109
I'll stop using Equifax. Oh, wait, I can't opt out of Equifax.

118
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,609
Right.

119
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,410
And in fact, he, even,

120
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,730
he Equifax comes up in the book of the fact that there were all these

121
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:33,450
hearings on it and the only law that was passed about Equifax was one that,

122
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,410
that makes it so you can't sue them.

123
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,649
Like what,

124
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,119
-- what just happened?
-- Well, they have good lobbyists and regulatory

125
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,839
count. Exactly.

126
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,410
Exactly. Now, now I have one serious complaint

127
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,619
about this book that we should get out of the way immediately

128
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,480
and I'm going, this is a huge spoiler.

129
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:52,910
So if you haven't read it and you want to, and you want me to write the book for you,

130
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,000
you should stop,

131
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,489
stop listening right now.

132
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,760
He only uses the word Blockchain once

133
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,570
in the whole book on page 233 I think it is. So, it's almost to the end.

134
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:07,399
So, what's your specific complaint that he only used it once? That's all.

135
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,109
No, I'm just being an idiot.

136
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,350
I would sort of agree in the sense of I,

137
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,920
I feel like Blockchain is going to be one of those just

138
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,230
underlying technologies that we'll all take for granted in 5 to 10 years

139
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:20,630
and obviously I'm biased because my job title is Chief Blockchain Officer.

140
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,269
But, you know, I feel like it's like the web, right?

141
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,149
I feel like Blockchain is where the web was in 95. And that, yeah, we,

142
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,350
we, we, we can talk about Blockchain some other day actually, in all seriousness.

143
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,859
I'm, I'm pleased by how UN

144
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
this book is

145
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:38,230
where he could have like, tore it off all about hackers and Blockchain and A I and,

146
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,540
and big data and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,089
It doesn't matter what technology we do because

148
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,480
the economic incentives remain the same and,

149
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,570
-- and
-- right, and I, I think that's, that's what I like about this.

150
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,459
Right? It's not

151
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,320
like Equifax is going to move to a Blockchain

152
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,420
and somehow be incentivized to protect our data.

153
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,940
They literally got a law passed so that they don't have to. It's just that simple.

154
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,239
-- Like I, I don't know how else to say it.
-- It is. It is, it's

155
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,350
all in all,

156
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,279
I guess my, my kind of

157
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,640
what my suggestion here is,

158
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,440
it, it is worth reading if you haven't been paying a lot of attention,

159
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,839
even if you haven't.

160
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,239
I think it's worth reading just as a way to better understand

161
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,720
how to talk about some of these things to normal people.

162
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,559
And I think most importantly is,

163
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,359
uh we should all buy a copy of this and mail it to our senators and,

164
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,940
and hope somebody who works for them,

165
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,420
reads the freaking book because I think it could do them a lot of good.

166
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,609
Now, now,

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,019
II, I must say though,

168
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:37,820
and here's the thing I realized while reading all about this because,

169
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,510
because Bruce spends a lot of time talking about regulation

170
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,339
and kind of how regulation works and what's going on.

171
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,910
And, and the thing I think I'm, I'm starting to disagree with is he,

172
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,390
he keeps talking about having like,

173
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,260
one central regulating body for all of computer security.

174
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,820
And, and I don't think I agree with that anymore. II, I did.

175
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:00,750
I used to but I feel like we've reached a point where, for example, like,

176
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,890
let the FAA regulate computer security of airplanes,

177
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,519
let the Department of Transportation regulate the security

178
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:11,000
of automobiles. Right? Like, why should we have one central authority?

179
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,440
-- What about the
-- things across boundaries, like drones?

180
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,350
Well, in, in what do we do about things like that today?

181
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,679
Are drones an FAA problem or a privacy problem? Like, are they a local

182
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,299
problem with respect to privacy or are they an FAA problem?

183
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,950
Because we've actually had cases now in Canada and

184
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,339
the US where, you know, drones have been up of up,

185
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,519
there was a drone apparently reported here at about

186
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,469
four or 5000 ft in the air that almost,

187
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,469
you know, the west jet plane had to, like,

188
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,190
yeah, they, they saw a drone at like four or 5000 ft up in the air.

189
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,140
And so the uh the National Transport Safety Board is, um, is investigating, I mean,

190
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,179
but good luck with that.

191
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,570
Well, and there's always going to be some level of overlap. Right?

192
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,190
There's all of these regulating bodies always like the FDA, for example, I'm,

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,770
I'm sure is involved with the EPA on certain things.

194
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:57,580
-- I
-- would
-- hope so.

195
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,989
And, and I was going to say, I think, I,

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,809
I don't know that we necessarily need one

197
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,049
central regulatory body for all things computer,

198
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,690
but we do need a high degree of cooper operation,

199
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,549
you know, because like,

200
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,710
you know, I have experience of this within the CV board,

201
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,299
we're trying to federate and make hierarchies to control, you know,

202
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,429
like for example,

203
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,330
ideally medical devices, you know, cars, aerospace, open source,

204
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,150
but these things all overlap

205
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,979
oftentimes quite a lot

206
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,664
and the and the concerns overlap, for example, self driving car,

207
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,544
there's clear safety concerns, right?

208
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,275
If somebody can remotely hijack that self driving

209
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,515
car and drive into a crowd of people,

210
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,804
that's, that's a law and order, you know,

211
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:38,155
that's a terrorism related thing potentially

212
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,344
and not just public safety anymore.

213
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,815
But then there's also on the sort of softer side, there's like, well,

214
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:45,224
the self driving car has a bunch of sensors and cameras.

215
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,500
What about the privacy of that data? Right?

216
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,880
Does it drive down the street recording your face

217
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:51,489
and uploading that to Google?

218
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,510
Is that allowed, is that blocked?

219
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,919
-- So
-- today privacy isn't regulated in the United States very well.

220
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,400
It's not regulated very well anywhere and we've just gone through GDPR.

221
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,599
-- I think
-- GDPR might have potential.

222
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:07,520
And, and this is something that, that one of the chapters, I think chapter 1010,

223
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,349
9 or 10

224
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,880
talks about GDPR a bit in this book

225
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,929
and

226
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,940
it, it's still too early, I think to, to answer a lot of questions.

227
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,830
But I feel like if, if you look at something like GDPR,

228
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,619
GDPR is an overarching piece of legislation

229
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:22,859
that affects

230
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,020
everybody,

231
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:28,119
-- all all industries, all businesses,
-- right? Anybody interacting with Europe,

232
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,460
either in Europe or from outside of Europe.

233
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,909
-- And
-- I feel like in there are certain things

234
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,210
like like privacy is an easy one to pick on

235
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,390
where you can say this just this affects everybody,

236
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,630
right?

237
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,130
Because this is really about the people.

238
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,489
But then if we start talking about something like securing automobiles,

239
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,469
now we're getting fairly specific and, and the thing I keep thinking of is

240
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,799
the problems that you're going to have,

241
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,690
securing computers in cars are different than

242
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,750
the problems you're going to have securing

243
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:59,059
light bulbs

244
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,909
and that's different than securing my phone

245
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,919
and, and there is some overlap,

246
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,869
but I think the fundamentals are going to be different enough,

247
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,429
trying to lump them together is going to make us fail.

248
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm going to disagree a bit

249
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,229
for two reasons. Number one on the technology side,

250
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,070
most of these things are running the same software they're pretty much the

251
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,780
whole IOT at this point is running Linux with some busy box.

252
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
So from a technology perspective, they're,

253
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,380
they're a lot more similar than they are different, right?

254
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,049
You have this thing, it has a Linux kernel, it

255
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:33,159
has a bunch of IO devices that it controls and takes data from.

256
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,710
And it also typically is attached to the internet so it can

257
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:36,880
at a minimum,

258
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,000
send data and also accept commands like turn the light switch on and off.

259
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,500
And then for more of a sort of a, I guess a procedural or like a process point of view,

260
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,619
these things are essentially as much as we like to pretend they're not,

261
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,770
they are a general purpose computer running a specific app,

262
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,859
like all those ATM S running Windows 95 or XP.

263
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,900
And they just happen to be running an ATM app and be hooked up to a, you know,

264
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:04,799
a little cash dispenser machine thing

265
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:08,219
inside the machine that, you know, will spit out $20 bills if you have it,

266
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,739
-- send the right IO commands
-- it.

267
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,960
It, it is true.

268
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,450
And, and so here's, here's what I'm,

269
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,309
I'm fighting with myself with my brain right now and

270
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,289
I haven't landed necessarily on one side or the other,

271
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:21,169
but I'm, I'm still leaning towards

272
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,140
uh not being too general.

273
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,289
But like

274
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:28,979
if, if you look at say engines, right? Gasoline engines,

275
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:32,299
you can find them in everything from small RC

276
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,919
cars to lawn mowers to automobiles to even,

277
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,530
well, we won't say gasoline because we could, let's lump in, you know, locomotives,

278
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:40,770
right?

279
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,489
-- Like locomotives have diesel engines,
-- let's say hydrocarbons. Sure.

280
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,849
And even airplanes in that respect could, could fall under that if we, if we wanted to

281
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:49,950
and

282
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,429
we don't have like

283
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:56,750
AAA Hydrocarbon Engine administration or something. Right.

284
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,429
We, we basically say airplanes, you figure it out, train people,

285
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,469
you figure your problems out car people,

286
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,710
you figure your problems out lawnmower guys, we don't care, whatever,

287
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,510
partly agree with you in the sense of there's,

288
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,869
there's some vastly different failure scenarios.

289
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,950
Um So for example,

290
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,190
between a light bulb and a self driving car, right?

291
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,390
A self driving car can clearly and simply be used to run over people.

292
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,030
That that's a problem, right? Because,

293
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,690
well, let's face it.

294
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,690
People already do that with their own driving cars because they suck at driving

295
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,289
or, you know, they're bad people conversely with a light bulb,

296
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,400
I can definitely create a

297
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,219
not totally unreasonable corner case where not having

298
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,909
it work could potentially be life threatening,

299
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,989
but it's a corner, you know, you got to work at it, right?

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,710
It's not like a self driving car where to

301
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,489
create a scenario where it kills somebody who's like,

302
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,169
yeah, no, that's like that's a normal thing today, right?

303
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:44,950
Cars do that

304
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,590
and, and so I think there's a bit of a difference there.

305
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,549
Well, a great example being there's that lovely video of, um,

306
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,520
this ferry that like lost propulsion as they were pulling in

307
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:56,169
and, you know, it slams into this concrete quay,

308
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:56,840
you know.

309
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,250
You know, well,

310
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,229
you lost power so you can't throw it into reverse

311
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,109
so you can't stop because it's not like ships have,

312
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,669
you know, brakes while they do have a brake.

313
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,780
It's called, put the engine into a verse,

314
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,340
you know, but it's, it's an active thing.

315
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,549
It's not like a passive thing, you know, like in a car for the brakes to fail,

316
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,659
you got to work at it,

317
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,840
like you have to work at it and, and in trucks,

318
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:16,429
they're designed so that if they do fail, they,

319
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,640
they go on same in trains, right?

320
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,289
Because we were, you know, large, heavy objects

321
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,479
moving with no brakes or it's bad,

322
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,070
it's just bad that, that's what I hear.

323
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,000
For example, a scenario where, ok, well, I can turn the engine off.

324
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,260
Well, like in a car.

325
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,030
Yeah.

326
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,080
You know, you do that to somebody on the highway that's, uh,

327
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,239
you could really cause some problems but you do that to

328
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,099
like an oil tanker coming into an oil processing facility and,

329
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,989
you know, uh I hope they have enough tugboats to

330
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,104
it, right. So

331
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:45,905
what I'm saying is, there's, there's

332
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,344
sort of the ease of creating a failure scenario that is like really,

333
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,544
really expensive and impacts quality of life and, or, you know,

334
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,034
kills a pile of people.

335
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,075
There's a big difference between your IOT light bulb

336
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,635
and your IOT car and your IOT super tanker.

337
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:02,174
Right. Exactly. But at the same time, like I said, fundamentally,

338
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,659
the Dirty Secret is they're all running the same software by and large.

339
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,020
It's just sort of, the application running on top is a little bit,

340
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,260
you know, bespoken, custom tailored and,

341
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,179
and that's kind of on the one hand why I think,

342
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:13,940
you know,

343
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,489
when I read these things like carrier grade

344
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,419
Linux and automotive grade Linux and I'm like,

345
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:22,070
well, fundamentally what they want is they want Magic Linux that just doesn't fail,

346
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,299
you know, like they need their five nines of reliability because, you know,

347
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,099
they need the phones to work for 911 or they need the car to work because you're,

348
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,979
you're on the highway doing 100 miles an hour.

349
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:31,840
Right. Right.

350
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:37,099
And, and ok, so I'm going to tie this conversation kind of back into the, we, we, we,

351
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,090
we're approaching book territory again

352
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:40,349
and,

353
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:40,489
oh,

354
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,460
yeah, book review. Right.

355
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,250
Right. We're, we're talking about a book. That's right. Well done.

356
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,890
Uh, so one of, one of the things

357
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:52,169
that that's talked about in chapter nine is, is, you know,

358
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,890
finding and fixing vulnerabilities.

359
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,250
And I feel like this is kind of related is

360
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:02,989
you are correct that all of the software is basically the same at this point.

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,359
-- Well, open
-- source one man,

362
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,690
it totally did.

363
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:06,929
And that's great

364
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,419
because now we only have one thing to fix thankfully by and large, like we have a linen

365
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,849
and not 17 different things

366
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:17,130
-- and,
-- but I guess here's, here's the way I keep thinking about this is

367
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,710
you can lump, say,

368
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,059
fixing vulnerabilities and let's say open SSL all together

369
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,919
and say we should care about open SSL,

370
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,940
you know, and we should,

371
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,150
but I, I feel like

372
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,200
that's, that's like caring about the supply chain. Right.

373
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,309
-- It very much is. Yes. it's like steel quality. Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly. That

374
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,669
you want to make sure you're getting what was advertised because otherwise that,

375
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,630
that's exactly what I was going to talk about is the fact that, like,

376
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,989
let's say the government is ordering military vehicles,

377
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,309
they're going to say the steel has to look like this

378
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,539
and then it's really up to the suppliers to figure that out.

379
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:55,179
Right.

380
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,770
You're not, we don't have, like the national steel board saying, well,

381
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,409
there might be,

382
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,760
but, you know, saying all steel must be of this quality.

383
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,229
It's like, no, there's, there's different levels.

384
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,910
-- Well, there's, there's standards, there's different standards.
-- Right. Right.

385
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,500
And, and, and much like steel, there's different,

386
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,130
there's people that want software that,

387
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,368
you know, moves fast breaks things and,

388
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,449
and that's cool because they're a service provider

389
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,209
and then there's, there's vendors like,

390
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:24,579
we're guaranteeing that this will work for 13 years with API and A B I Compatibility.

391
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,348
So you can build an accounting system that sits on top of this

392
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,209
and

393
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:31,295
we promise it won't break for 13 years and if it does break,

394
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:35,834
you can yell at us and we'll fix it and, and those are both valid use cases.

395
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,334
Right. Right. E exactly.

396
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:40,685
You know, some people need brittle steel and some people need very ductile steel.

397
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:41,185
-- Right.
-- Right.

398
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,614
Exactly. And I, and I feel like this book is trying to,

399
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,415
it's trying to put everything in the same bucket.

400
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:51,494
Well, I think from a procedural point of view, it kind of does because we, you know,

401
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,494
as much as we'd like things to be different fundamentally,

402
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:58,040
we from a minimum perspective, all this iot stuff,

403
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,780
we really want it to work otherwise.

404
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,069
Well,

405
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,969
-- that's a cost if it stops working and either it gets bricked or denial of service
-- and,

406
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,930
and ok, but here's,

407
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:10,280
here's what, what I think makes it all different is insecurity.

408
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,689
We have historically had the attitude of perfect or nothing

409
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,239
and, and perfect just means it's a fancy word for nothing.

410
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,390
So nothing wins and we basically fix nothing.

411
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,579
And we say, oh, if we can't do that exactly correct,

412
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,000
we just shouldn't do it or we end up

413
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,579
blocking projects because we can't get them completely correct.

414
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,680
And I feel like trying to put all of this stuff

415
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:32,349
together in the same bucket is saying perfect or nothing,

416
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,209
right? We already have nothing like,

417
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:40,719
and, and this is where I feel like if we say automakers go figure this freaking out

418
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,989
in and some of them might fix some of the open source,

419
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,469
some of them might write their own stuff.

420
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:50,479
Some of them might go completely off reservation and do something crazy. Who knows?

421
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,430
Well, here's a thought.

422
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,670
Maybe we should, for example, have a regulation saying that you have to do

423
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,910
attack modeling of your product

424
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,000
-- and release that
-- publicly. Are they doing that in meds?

425
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:02,510
No.

426
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,770
Oh Lord. No,

427
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,469
no dude, there's no problems in meds.

428
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,670
And if you say otherwise, what do you

429
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,369
uh No, I feel like the meds

430
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,319
people are actually starting to move in the right direction.

431
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,599
-- Yeah,
-- some of them are coming around but it's going to be wild. But

432
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,420
for example, let's hypothetically say

433
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:20,680
you have to release as part of your like ul Well, so we have the idea of, you know,

434
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,000
underwriters laboratory and like the uh the CS A,

435
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,560
the Canadian Standards Association, not the CS A I work for.

436
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:26,420
Um

437
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,500
you know, we're basically like, for example, they, they,

438
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,239
they audit things and check things to, you know, for example,

439
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,500
if you plug this into your house, they ain't gonna burn your house down,

440
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,780
which is a nice quality to have an electrical equipment.

441
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,189
But for example, let's say you need to attack or threat model your device. And

442
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,000
a great example being remember the nest thermostats that require internet access

443
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,260
to like make your house hot and I think they change that.

444
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,199
I'm not sure, but

445
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,790
I will never buy a nest thermostat unless I know

446
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,410
for guaranteed 100% certain that if my internet goes out,

447
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,739
I still get to have heat in winter.

448
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,410
Right, because I live in Canada. So that's, that's a bit of a concern.

449
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,219
And so, for example, having a, having that threat model would at a minimum,

450
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,630
let me make a slightly better decision as to, you know.

451
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,939
Ok. So what happens when this device loses internet access? Can it,

452
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,150
does it still have basic functionality,

453
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,640
you know, or does it completely crap itself and stop working?

454
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,660
Uh And that's actually, that's something that, that's in this book as well,

455
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,439
is a refrigerator, right?

456
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,680
If your refrigerator loses internet access,

457
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,819
like it shouldn't spoil your food and that

458
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:26,760
one's really easy to understand or the thermostat

459
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,339
if internet goes out, don't let the house freeze and also don't make it, you know,

460
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:34,030
a billion degrees inside that would kill people.

461
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,420
Like

462
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,074
a example is I'm pretty sure my Amazon Echo is useless without internet

463
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:42,435
because doesn't it send all the voice commands back to Amazon for processing?

464
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:47,055
I'm pretty sure it does. I think it has hardware in it to listen for. What is it?

465
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:47,505
Hey, Alexa

466
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:48,775
or whatever,

467
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,015
but beyond that

468
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,155
it doesn't do.

469
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:53,635
So if I don't have light switches and I'm depending

470
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:55,314
on that thing to turn my lights on and off

471
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,305
could be a problem.

472
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:00,699
-- If you don't have light switches, you totally deserve what you're going to get,
-- uh,

473
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,839
I'm a paraplegic in a wheelchair.

474
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:06,469
That's fair. Ok. So, no, I don't have light switches and I have this Amazon Alexa

475
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:09,219
with this IOT lighting system that now lets me control my house.

476
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,030
That is cool.

477
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:11,660
You know,

478
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,349
and that's something we often forget about is

479
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:17,380
there's a lot of people legitimately in this world that have, you know,

480
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,540
very different abilities than we do.

481
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:19,989
Like,

482
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,109
um, you know,

483
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,469
one of my sons is high functioning autistic and I have no idea

484
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,050
how I'm going to teach him about password security because it just,

485
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,109
he doesn't care.

486
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,410
He just flat out like

487
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,989
he just, I don't think he knows what a secret is.

488
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:34,050
It's just

489
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,160
not, no, like straight up, it's, it's in a way, it's beautiful, but at the same time,

490
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,550
like,

491
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,550
I, I worry about people taking advantage of him, you know,

492
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,949
because he just doesn't kind of get

493
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,229
privacy or secrecy to the world and his brain is an open book, you know,

494
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,390
that, that's fair.

495
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,229
You know, as I get older, I like the idea of being able to tell my house or better yet.

496
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,430
I don't want to have to tell my house.

497
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,979
I want my house to sort of vaguely know where I am and turn the damn lights on.

498
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,430
So I don't fall down the stairs.

499
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,339
I, you know, I think that's a reasonable thing to

500
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,890
now we have a threat model while just walking down the stairs. Turn the lights off.

501
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,880
Now, now,

502
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,699
now we accidentally murdered Kurt over the internet.

503
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:17,180
Right. Generally murder doesn't imply accidentally that would be manslaughter.

504
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:18,935
But yeah,

505
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:21,555
but no, I mean, that's, that's an example of where, you know,

506
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:23,425
for a normal bodied person.

507
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:25,334
Yeah, whatever deal with it, turn the lights off and on,

508
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,135
but not everybody can do those things and not everybody's given that choice.

509
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:31,425
What if you're renting? And that's just how that place is. You know,

510
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:32,625
that's true.

511
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,635
I'm using Airbnb more now

512
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,479
because quite often it's a lot cheaper than a hotel.

513
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,020
And it's more interesting, you know, we stayed in this new

514
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,979
condo. It's a, it was a round condo kind of built on stilts next to a freeway.

515
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,920
So that way you didn't have to like, stare at the side of the freeway,

516
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,849
but you actually had a view

517
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,479
and it was like each condo apartment, whatever was kind of like a large slice of pie.

518
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,359
Very cool design.

519
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:54,880
And, you know,

520
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,530
it had an internet connected door lock thing because

521
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,099
that way they can just send you the code

522
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,719
and you go into your airbnb now. Am I a fan of that? No, God, no.

523
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:03,680
But you know,

524
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:08,319
like every hotel I've ever stayed at that door lock is centrally managed by the hotel

525
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,310
and they can create cards to access it for anybody housekeeping, who knows?

526
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,329
And that's just the way the world is.

527
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:15,449
You know,

528
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,739
I can no longer rely on these door locks being

529
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,979
-- secure in the sense of like I trust that's
-- fair.

530
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,449
So I, I guess there,

531
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:25,579
there's one other important point in the book that I want

532
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,099
to mention and I want us to discuss a bit is

533
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,699
uh uh there is a chapter about when policy can go wrong.

534
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,459
And a lot of it is dedicated to the encryption backdoor debate.

535
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,959
And of course, the book takes a very hardline stance.

536
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,500
-- Oh God.
-- And we're going through that

537
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,459
again, it never, it'll never end.

538
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:47,579
Uh So the book takes a really nice stance of this is a bad idea and it can't be done.

539
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:51,900
And I do appreciate that Bruce doesn't try to be like,

540
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,000
maybe this isn't something that we could do.

541
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,540
But, and to be clear when we say it can't be done,

542
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,540
we mean it physically can't be done without

543
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,449
completely compromising the security of all the encryption,

544
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:01,819
right?

545
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:02,579
That's

546
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,290
so we're not saying it can't be done like, oh, you know, like

547
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,584
racism is bad. We shouldn't do racism.

548
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:08,265
No, we're saying like,

549
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:12,025
physically you can't do this without completely compromising

550
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,814
this version of reality and how encryption works.

551
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,704
-- Like it's just
-- physics and stuff.

552
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,194
Yeah. Math, I

553
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:18,525
guess

554
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,305
-- that Pesky, math physics
-- is math.

555
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:25,545
You know, maybe we should just legislate math to be different. I don't know.

556
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:26,625
Yeah. And, and,

557
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:27,785
and a lot of,

558
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:30,790
but the problem is a lot of lawmakers, you know, don't

559
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,489
seem to know or care about that.

560
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,729
And, uh, well, and this, you know, a lot of things like environmental law and stuff.

561
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:38,619
I've seen some environmental law where it's kind of like, but

562
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,040
that's not how rivers work. You know,

563
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:43,790
water flows downhill. Yeah.

564
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,989
Or like things where they've legislated and, uh, yeah, whoops,

565
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,229
we kind of screwed that up.

566
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:52,469
Well, and I guess this is where I want to end it and is

567
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,890
kind of, you kind of hit on it about legislation is

568
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,410
there's two ways legislation happens.

569
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,670
You have lobbyists and companies

570
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,969
that write it,

571
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,459
give it to the legislatures and say pass this bill

572
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,619
and half the time these guys probably don't even

573
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,989
know what's in it because these things are phone books

574
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,420
or

575
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:16,819
there's some sort of public outcry because something is happening and,

576
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:22,290
and the example I'll use there is like OSHA, the, the worker safety in factories.

577
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,420
Right?

578
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:25,515
Well, worker safety everywhere where people work, I mean,

579
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,645
and put links to Reddit OSHA because that, that's a gong show.

580
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:29,375
Oh, man, that

581
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:30,834
-- is crazy.
-- It makes me

582
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,265
so grateful to work indoors.

583
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,204
Right. Seriously.

584
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:34,714
But anyway,

585
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,364
the point is that's an example where

586
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,285
actually the lobbyists didn't want these changes.

587
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:42,814
And there was, there were enough humans who said, like this is nuts,

588
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:43,915
we need to fix this.

589
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,244
And, and I guess this is the problem with,

590
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:48,125
with computer security

591
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,204
is

592
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,479
until something horrible happens to make people care.

593
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:57,520
And I don't mean horrible, like your bank account got stolen.

594
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,140
It's gonna have to be endemic.

595
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,199
-- I mean,
-- like, like,

596
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:04,349
like a building fell down or a bunch of people were killed sort of thing here.

597
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:04,910
-- Right. Or
-- like

598
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,160
-- a dying from self driving cars. Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

599
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,680
It's going to have to be crazy

600
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,790
to make people care and let's face it. The companies behind this stuff,

601
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:18,829
they don't want to fix this, they don't have any incentive,

602
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,300
they want to keep it the same.

603
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,890
So they aren't going to write anything to get this done.

604
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,949
And so fundamentally,

605
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:30,339
the only way we're going to see this change coming through government regulation

606
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:34,030
is when the people get mad enough to say fix it now.

607
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,250
And I think we are a long way from that happening.

608
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:42,030
So I on the radio this morning, there was an ad for

609
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:48,060
like before you dig uh call us to locate the underground power lines. Please.

610
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,750
You know, this is a message from the Alberta. Uh what was it?

611
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,709
The Alberta Electrical Transmission Council. And it's,

612
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,270
yeah, like just we don't care, we do it for free,

613
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,739
but just for the love of God before you start putting holes in the ground,

614
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,839
like let us come out and make sure there's no big power lines there because

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,800
it happens, right?

616
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,650
We, we had an outage uh like two weeks ago where yeah,

617
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,060
somebody was digging and hit a high,

618
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,010
a high voltage power line, you know, downtown

619
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,560
because well, yeah,

620
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,280
that's what happens when you just start randomly digging holes.

621
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,410
So, you know, simple stuff like that where it's,

622
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,650
we have a solution and a framework to deal with it and people still mess it up.

623
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,979
So, yeah, I know you're right until things get like literally,

624
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,489
I'm not sure even 100 people a day being killed by self driving cars would be enough

625
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,099
because I think that's about the death rate from regular cars in the US right now.

626
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,349
Higher than that even.

627
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,189
I feel like I looked this up and it was, it was scary how many it was.

628
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:43,364
Oh, actually, uh, ok. So in 2010, in the US, 5.4 million

629
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,224
collisions crashes,

630
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:51,484
30,000, 296 of them with fatalities killing 32,999 people.

631
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:54,484
So, yeah, just that's about what, 9085 a day,

632
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,640
about 100 a day. That's

633
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,829
and injuring 2.2 million.

634
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,420
That's a,

635
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,680
that's when, and, and, you know, and you know, we're not talking to stub toe

636
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,229
in a lot of cases, you know, we're talking some pretty serious injuries

637
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:11,949
and that's not enough to make people care.

638
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,530
And I think that's the standard,

639
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,010
you have to realize basically what whatever is going on is going to

640
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,300
have to kill more than 100 people a day before people care.

641
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,560
Something like over

642
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:21,829
a,

643
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:24,189
I think it's a half now in Canada of all

644
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,300
car collisions now or because people are on their phone.

645
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,479
I, I have no doubt.

646
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,819
And it was probably something else before that.

647
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:30,939
Right. It's,

648
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,859
anyway, I guess

649
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,130
I, I'm, I'm happy to close with this. It, it's a good book.

650
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:40,750
I, I would suggest anyone could gain value from reading it

651
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,680
and I would highly suggest if you are a manager

652
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,630
type who maybe doesn't follow the news as closely as,

653
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,680
as you could

654
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,810
read this book because I think you gain value of it

655
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:54,630
and we should all buy a copy for our senators.

656
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,949
And yeah, when you're done with it, I give it to your parents.

657
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,540
They, they'll like it too. I bet.

658
00:28:59,829 --> 00:28:59,890
So,

659
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:02,579
II I think realistically the only,

660
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,890
like you said, things have to get so bad that they get bad enough for people to care

661
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:11,300
or we need like a Ralph Nader style champion to maybe get this,

662
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:16,300
-- you know, head us off at the pass before it gets so terrible
-- because maybe, maybe,

663
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,040
I mean, I, I attribute Ralph Nader to stunt hacking and

664
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:20,880
it,

665
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:27,550
but, but he was, he was riding a wave of disaster. It's not like he, he didn't create a

666
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,750
problem and let's face it.

667
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,880
A lot of stunt hacking is creating a problem and then trying to

668
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,800
kind of do something with it.

669
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,010
Whereas Ralph Nader didn't have to do that.

670
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,400
-- I,
-- I disagree because with stun hacking that,

671
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,589
that you're just the messenger with the bad news.

672
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,540
That that was it

673
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,560
a Cherokee or whatever was always could be hacked and monkeyed with to, to drive,

674
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:47,949
you know.

675
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,650
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah. All right.

676
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,170
Well, we'll, we'll talk about stun hacking another day.

677
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,089
We're, we're out of time, so. All right, cool. Well, thank you, Kurt.

678
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,130
Thank you everyone for listening.

679
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,530
You can go to open source security podcast.com, get a link to the show notes.

680
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,329
I don't know if we'll have show notes uh, linked to the book at least.

681
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,910
And if something you can use the Pound Os S podcast,

682
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,430
-- hashtag to hit us up on social media and Kurt have a fantastic rest of
-- your day.

683
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,000
-- You too, thanks everybody. Thanks
-- everybody. Bye bye.

684
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,290
So the bank now has like a voice security thing and I'm like, no,

685
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,229
I absolutely don't want that.

686
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,959
And she's like, I'm like,

687
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:35,030
because there's like hundreds of hours of recordings of my voice on the internet

688
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,069
because I do a podcast

689
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,910
and I'm absolutely certain somebody can chop them up to be like, hello, my name is

690
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:47,469
and I authorize you to send all my money to Russia. Thank you. Goodbye.

691
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,660
Right. Like for sure, all those words are there.
