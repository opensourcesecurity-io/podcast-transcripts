Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,439
Kurt Siefried and my partner in dealing with

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,510
the outfall of decisions made 25 years ago.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,920
Josh.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,500
-- Oh,
-- my

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,860
goodness. I know. Right. So we're gonna, we're gonna talk about CD E today.

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,659
CBE has been

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,290
in the news, let's say for the last what, two or three weeks probably

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,010
and is not there for a good reason.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,569
-- And there's a lot of misunderstanding.
-- Kurt.

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,598
-- Has it ever been in the news for a good reason? I don't think so. Probably
-- not.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,889
I mean, it does suffer from the typical security problem of if you do your job. Right.

12
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:40,845
Nothing happens. But I think in this case, they're doing a lot wrong

13
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,095
and it is systematically broken and there's not

14
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:46,034
a lot of understanding about any of this

15
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:50,125
and I think to be clear, it's, it's actually more subtle than that.

16
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,724
It's not that they're doing things that are wrong

17
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:56,005
because wrong sort of implies intentionality.

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,630
They're doing things that are wrong because the world changed and CV E did not.

19
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,489
I mean, that's still wrong. I'm not, no, don't, don't do that.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,239
I just, I don't want to, I don't want to make this like a moral argument.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,269
-- It's more of a technical
-- wrong. Ok. Fine. Technically wrong.

22
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,080
Technically correct is the best kind of correct.

23
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:14,699
-- So, technically wrong must be the worst kind of wrong. Ok.
-- It is.

24
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,129
It is actually because,

25
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:16,870
yeah.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh,

27
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,260
my goodness. Straight

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,629
up.

29
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,650
So let's just start out with the reason CV E has gotten most of

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,510
the attention for the last couple of weeks is because there was an ID

31
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:31,400
that ended up filed against curl.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,510
That basically isn't a security vulnerability. No one talked to curl.

33
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,639
A random person

34
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,760
got the ID. It looks like they might

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,709
be going through old commit messages or something.

36
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:45,169
And it was what, a 2020 ID, if I'm remembering correctly, I could look at it.

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,029
The tab is literally in front of me, but I won't.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,620
And then post Chris QL had basically the exact

39
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,489
same thing happened to them like a week later

40
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,449
and there's blog posts and links, I'll put in the show notes to kind of all this stuff.

41
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,970
And fundamentally the thing, the reason we're talking about this now

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,010
is

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,190
no one seems to grasp how we got where we are today.

44
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,190
And very few people understand how this works.

45
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:10,619
And the thing that really kind of set me off was there was someone on

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,880
linkedin basically did a nice write up of kind of some of the mess.

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,669
But then they, they hand waved away the solution and I was like, look,

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,610
you can't hand wave away a solution because the fundamental problem

49
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:26,490
here is CD E and NVD have zero accountability or transparency.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,320
And they were like, oh, no, no, they're transparent and have accountability.

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,899
I'm like, oh, no,

52
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,429
I was on the CV E board and I didn't even know what was going on half the time.

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,559
That's just it. Right. There's, there's so much wrong with it.

54
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:41,513
It's, and it's a lot of it is basically because it's a,

55
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,042
it's a 25 year old program. Right.

56
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:48,363
So, ok, first of all, let's lay down some basics who pays for CV. Well, ok,

57
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:52,363
-- it's complicated but fundamentally it's
-- the US government, it's not complicated.

58
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:56,822
The Department of Homeland Security pays for the Miter Corporation,

59
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:59,283
which is a nonprofit, the Miter Corporation.

60
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,276
They're a defense contractor. They're a US defense contractor.

61
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,705
Yeah, they do about 4 $4.5 billion a year. Go to the,

62
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,395
uh, to the GOV spending, uh, what is it? Spending.gov?

63
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:11,416
And look for what Miter does for them and it's all over the place. Like it's, it's

64
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,356
bioterrorism all the way to cyber

65
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,865
anyways. Miter has a cybersecurity mandate,

66
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,085
right. So they run a number of programs, they run

67
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:20,046
CV. ECWE,

68
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,925
I forget the rest of them.

69
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,755
There's like a million things and there's like attack,

70
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,065
the Attack framework is part of this.

71
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:26,746
They do. Miter does a lot of good work.

72
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,565
Mind you, like, we're going to crap on them a lot.

73
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:29,550
But I think

74
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,600
Miter in general is a net positive for humanity.

75
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,589
And see,

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,860
that's why I want to get away from this moral wrong argument because it's more, it's

77
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,520
miters kind of in a rock and a hard place

78
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,250
situation and they're dealing with the government and they're anyway,

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,690
so back to this. So the DH S pays for this. Miter runs the program

80
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,880
and they run the program like it's 25 years ago, which is 25 years ago.

81
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,500
It made sense 100% for Miter to just run the thing and do it their way

82
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:02,110
because he didn't have a massive information, security community like we do now.

83
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,589
That's right for, for sure. 100%. It was,

84
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,649
I mean, back when Steve

85
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:07,570
Steve Christie is a person who kind of,

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:07,899
it

87
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,699
was the inception of much of this.

88
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:13,130
He was the only person talking about this at that time,

89
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,800
like literally the only person.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,809
And so basically the US government rightly so well, and again,

91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,988
we can't talk about the US government,

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,359
look at some cohesive whole that behaves rationally.

93
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,970
Elements of the US. Government

94
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,769
understood that, hey, we run software, software has security flaws.

95
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,290
We need to track those security flaws and deal with that.

96
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:33,890
How do we do that?

97
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,579
Well, if we track each vendor separately at each department level separately,

98
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:39,350
that's not gonna work.

99
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,450
So we need to centralize it's the many to many CV

100
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,309
E is trying to solve the many to many problem of many

101
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,790
bug producers to many bug

102
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,630
six consumers.

103
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,470
And it's the only database that does this freely unavailable.

104
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,579
There's a lot of private

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,390
-- ones.
-- They were the only database that did this freely unavailable.

106
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,380
Yeah, there was OS V DB for a while but they went, they closed up shop and went private.

107
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,309
There's a couple now we'll get to those maybe at

108
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:04,649
the end.

109
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:04,929
And

110
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,799
this is part of the problem is there's not even within the CV E program.

111
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,609
There are CV numbering authorities

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,570
and they're different. There's commercial ones, there's project ones,

113
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,850
there's miter who's the CV E CV,

114
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,339
numbering authority of last resort and handles

115
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,809
what we call the retail assignments.

116
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,130
So that's where you

117
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,290
go, like their shop front.

118
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,010
Right. What is it? CV, form.miter.org or something?

119
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,290
-- It's CV
-- e.org now and there's a link there.

120
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:30,850
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they changed it. Right.

121
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:34,950
And you, you know, you, you fill out a form saying give me one CV, E, please, sir.

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,390
And in theory if there's AC N A for that software, they, they ship it off to the CN A.

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,649
-- No,
-- they don't, they don't,

124
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,230
they tell you there's AC N A and it's up to you to go find them.

125
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,809
-- Oh,
-- sorry. Yeah. Yeah,

126
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,619
that's right. It's very obnoxious.

127
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,230
-- Yeah, they
-- don't, I, I keep forgetting that.

128
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,989
Yeah, they have a list of CNAs and they're like, good luck,

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,230
go contact them and some of the CNAs are not easy to contact because

130
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,070
again,

131
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,380
well, without going into a tangent, one reason a lot of places become AC

132
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,369
is to control the flow of CV S with respect to the product.

133
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,730
So they can basically say no to it.

134
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,839
OK. OK. Hang on before we get into the technical details.

135
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,290
I want to back us up and I want to talk about the structure of CBE CV E we just said Mir

136
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,690
is basically the organization in charge. But then CBE also has a board

137
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,910
-- which is ineffective and useless.
-- It's completely ineffective.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,329
It's lifetime appointments.

139
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,850
-- And
-- I say that as a member, former member and former member

140
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,600
quit, I

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,390
resigned.

142
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,859
That's

143
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,549
true. Well, resigned, quit, whatever.

144
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,170
But it's,

145
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,890
these are lifetime appointments and that is like the worst thing you

146
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,549
can do for any organization is just stick people on something.

147
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,309
There's no fresh blood. No, it's, it's very old thinking.

148
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,390
And a lot of these people on the board are not like hip and new in,

149
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,940
in the world of cybersecurity.

150
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,130
They exist in a space that's literally 20 years old now.

151
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,200
And so, OK, I want to set that as,

152
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,140
as the first chess piece that helps explain everything going

153
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,760
on is just the fact that the CBE organization is

154
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:03,040
not current. We'll say the way they operate is very 1990

155
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,440
there is zero accountability or transparency into what goes on.

156
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,519
So when you end up in a situation like curl did. There's almost nothing you can do.

157
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:12,279
And, and

158
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,649
to put it bluntly,

159
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,709
this is part of fundamentally how miter

160
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,859
is structured with respect to the US government

161
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,809
is the US government pays for this. They

162
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,100
answer to the US government, they don't answer to us,

163
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,609
they don't answer to the public.

164
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,450
That's also true. That's a good point.

165
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,850
They do have accountability.

166
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,489
It's just not the sort of accountability we expect or need or want.

167
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:31,940
That's,

168
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,339
-- you
-- know,

169
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,160
it's the same kind of accountability. Lockheed Martin has

170
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,089
to a bunch of senators.

171
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,170
-- Lockheed
-- Martin doesn't care what I think. That's exactly.

172
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,170
They really don't.

173
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,339
There's a lot of challenges with the CV program but,

174
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,820
but fundamentally part of it is people also like,

175
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,450
people don't even get the source of CV, correct.

176
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,489
They say, oh, the national vulnerability database. Well, no, that's not.

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,079
-- Let's explain what NVD is.
-- NVD

178
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:00,290
is not CV E no NVD

179
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,619
consumes the CV database.

180
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,279
They enrich it and in the past they would enrich

181
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,160
it and then have their data that they would ship.

182
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,470
Now, in theory, they, I think they're also

183
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,190
shipping their data back to the head and CV database.

184
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,709
Uh And the two main enrichments they do are C pe which is common product enumeration.

185
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,649
So that's like so

186
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:18,859
o

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,350
version six or, you know, Red Hat Enterprise version nine, whatever.

188
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,390
I think it's platform.

189
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,739
No, it's common product because it's, it's, it's application platform,

190
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,630
whatever hardware and then the second thing they do is the CV SS scoring.

191
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,109
And for example, here's a thing, most people don't understand

192
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,520
NVD must

193
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:38,200
take a worst case scenario approach

194
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,359
to assigning a CV SS score

195
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,957
because they don't know how the US government uses the software necessarily.

196
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:47,229
For example, at Red Hat, we would say things like, oh Samba, you,

197
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,158
you can't expose file sharing to the internet.

198
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,018
That's insane. You

199
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,119
just can't and we would score it as local network, right?

200
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,388
Whereas NVD would have to say, well,

201
00:08:56,489 --> 00:09:00,528
-- yeah, that's, that's how it should be.
-- Show Dan disagrees with you.

202
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,208
Yeah, exactly.

203
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,818
Show Dan dot IO. Look for uh dot gov

204
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,268
IP space and port 445.

205
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:07,158
Right. Yeah.

206
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:07,708
Right.

207
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,479
So, and that's,

208
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,609
there's a lot of these misconceptions about how this whole thing operates like,

209
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:15,150
oh my, my favorite is well, but they, they validate the CV S.

210
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,280
No, they don't,

211
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:18,609
they can't like when Schneider

212
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,309
Electric does a CV, I, I don't have a bunch of Schneider

213
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,590
Electric relays and PL CS to test it on.

214
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,469
And I don't have the time for this. Like I assigned somewhere between six and 8000 CV.

215
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,429
Si lost count at some point. I used to have the data.

216
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,159
People seem to think I validated them.

217
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:31,690
Uh

218
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,469
Right.

219
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,219
-- There's no way you can
-- not.

220
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:34,739
No,

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,700
no,

222
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,750
I literally would like make sure the CV request was reasonably somewhat sort of San

223
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,349
-- and maybe ideally linked to a code commit and That's
-- right.

224
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:46,739
And, but this is where transparency becomes an important factor in all of this.

225
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:50,090
-- And I was open to feedback,
-- right. Well, that's just it like the github

226
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,859
data. Github's database is currently the best that exists on the pause.

227
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:54,789
What is the github

228
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,380
-- database? So we talking
-- about

229
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,869
the vulnerability database, github

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,049
-- has a vulnerability database.
-- We're talking about GH SAS now see

231
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,539
-- the GHS A
-- data.

232
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,945
And here's another problem is where's the actual CV database?

233
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,744
And the answer is it's on an internal miter system.

234
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,025
Well, what you see on github

235
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,155
is a essentially not the source of truth. It is a

236
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,405
if you look at the github

237
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:17,195
logs,

238
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:17,455
you

239
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:17,765
mean

240
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,424
you mean the CBE database stored in the github

241
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:23,505
repository,

242
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:24,385
which sort

243
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:28,434
-- of the CV E list repo,
-- right? It's not stored in the github

244
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,234
repo so much as it's published there.

245
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:32,604
Because what happens is they essentially,

246
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:33,820
if you

247
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,849
basically, if you go to this github

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,599
repo slash CV project slash whatever and try to commit to the database,

249
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,440
do a poll request something, the answer is no.

250
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,400
What you do is they do a poll request

251
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:49,419
and that data is then ingested every hour to some back end miter system. You know,

252
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,099
God knows where

253
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,340
I do know it was written in Pearl back in the nineties by Steve.

254
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,979
Uh Well, what else are you going to write in the nineties? Right?

255
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,580
Um Probably still chugging along in Paarl because I know every

256
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,840
time some unicode got in there it would just cause havoc.

257
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:03,840
It's still bad.

258
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,380
Yeah.

259
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,380
So anyways, they, once an hour they pull data out of

260
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:10,809
github, do some stuff on the back end and then push it back out,

261
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,549
plus whatever else they got through the CV form or

262
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,770
through the private whatever.

263
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,570
There's,

264
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:18,909
they're, they've been trying for years now to like,

265
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,059
go to like an API model and to kind of,

266
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,989
to, to put it on uh simply to use it correctly

267
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,710
because they're not using it correctly right now.

268
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,250
They're using it as a publishing platform, not as a development,

269
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:33,599
actual collaborative platform. These details do matter because these details

270
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,570
what they can do that

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,299
I wanna stop us because I feel like

272
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,679
there's way more, it is a giant mess and it's way messier and way giant than I thought.

273
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,169
So let's just focus, let's walk through this particular curl CD E

274
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,570
and we can explain what happened along the way and how this happened

275
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,590
because this is the part I don't think everyone understands.

276
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,729
So as far as we know, and this is also a lot of this

277
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,669
is hearsay and conjecture.

278
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,809
It's relatively safe conjecture because I've been through this, we've been,

279
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,950
this is not our first rodeo.

280
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
It is.

281
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,530
But I'm saying like there is no

282
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,489
transparency to this process. This is any the only reason curtain and I,

283
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,760
the only reason Kurt and I know what's happening behind this curtain is because

284
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,719
we got to see behind one of the curtains for a period of time.

285
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:27,869
-- We did it a couple dozen or 100 times. A lot
-- of times. But there's still other things.

286
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,000
We don't know a lot of other things and there's probably very,

287
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,799
there's probably less than 10 people on the planet

288
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,440
who actually know the answer to this stuff.

289
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,590
Like honest to goodness. So,

290
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,210
so here's what happens. There's a, A curl CV E.

291
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,549
So someone

292
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,559
apparently went to Miter and said, hey Miter,

293
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,530
I want a CV E for this curl issue

294
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,619
and they gave Miter the data. OK?

295
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,940
Miter issues A CV E.

296
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,580
That's not unusual at all.

297
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,530
You can go to Miter's Web form and say I want a CV E for

298
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,919
this thing and if there is no CN A which there isn't for curl,

299
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,900
they will say here's a CD E and then they add whatever information you gave Miter

300
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,039
Tweet, the CV E and Bitter does.

301
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,919
They will probably click some links and make sure

302
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,640
like you're not going to porn sites or something,

303
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,619
but they aren't gonna like

304
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,760
read the links and then look at code and things like that, right?

305
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,159
They're basically just gonna say, does this look mostly correct?

306
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,395
And that's basically what I would do is I would ideally, I,

307
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,825
I would often push back and say I need a, I need a,

308
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:32,554
I need a link to either the code commit or to the like where the code is bad because

309
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,705
the vast, like for open source, at least the vast majority of bugs,

310
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:39,145
once somebody points out to you what it is and where it is, it's like, oh yeah. Yeah.

311
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,304
Ok. Yeah, you should fix that

312
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:44,744
-- like a
-- pothole. This is a legitimate integer overflow, right?

313
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:48,375
It is an integer overflow like, but there are lots of integer overflows.

314
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:50,924
Some of them are security bugs. Some of them aren't OK.

315
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:59,049
OK. So this CV E goes into the CV E data set which then means NVD brings it in

316
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,489
and NVD,

317
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,859
they add a CV SS score. OK.

318
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,080
Now, Kurt and I have talked,

319
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,820
it just look at the archives like we have talked at length.

320
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,979
What's wrong with CV SS and there is much wrong with it.

321
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:15,309
But again, NVD sees integer overflow in curl and they're like holy crap.

322
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,330
This is probably bad, right? Because they don't really know the context.

323
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,400
They don't really understand curl, right?

324
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:25,580
And now mind you, no one has talked to curl so far at all.

325
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,729
-- So NVD gives it a very high score.
-- Well, and in fairness curl

326
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,770
is hard to get a hold of like that guy

327
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,429
straight up. I think he lives in the middle of nowhere and has no internet.

328
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,969
I don't know,

329
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,849
he has internet, he publishes Curl

330
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,520
and he's on Mas

331
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,690
-- on all the time. I don't know, I don't know.
-- I'm being sarcastic, I'm pointing out.

332
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:43,130
OK.

333
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,489
But there, there's lots of open

334
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,130
-- source people that live in the middle of nowhere.
-- But the point is like a lot of open

335
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,849
source projects are actually

336
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,729
not that hard to get a hold of. Some are slow to reply.

337
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,239
-- But
-- curl at the same time, here's the thing.

338
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,229
Given the current structure of NVD and CBE,

339
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,830
you cannot expect them to reach out to every open source project.

340
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
-- Every time a vulnerability is filed,
-- I would agree.

341
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:10,960
-- However, for certain things like curl that run on everything on the planet,
-- maybe,

342
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:11,390
maybe.

343
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,320
-- Ok, I won't,
-- there's

344
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:12,460
a

345
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,299
library on everything on the planet

346
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,750
and even off the planet.

347
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:16,320
Yes.

348
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:22,580
-- Yes. Yeah. On other planets.
-- So I think maybe an exception could be made.

349
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,049
OK?

350
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:23,760
I'll give you that.

351
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,510
So anyway,

352
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,809
so NBVD gives it a very high score and then

353
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:30,330
obviously everyone starts talking about it because they're like,

354
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,039
what's going on.

355
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,809
And of course, a lot of people are yelling at Curl because they're saying curl,

356
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,929
why are you so dumb?

357
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,190
-- And
-- they find out by people like emailing them

358
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,659
and yelling at them and their issue tracker.

359
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:38,989
Not exactly.

360
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,530
And, and here's the thing I don't, I don't buy is

361
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,179
it's not that hard to have a pattern of regular expressions like curl dash star

362
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,799
and his email address

363
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,330
-- and just have a simple fire off a note.
-- No, I don't think that's the answer.

364
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,130
-- The answer is proper transparency. Oh, no, no,
-- it's not the answer.

365
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,840
-- Yeah, that, that is not the answer. So
-- don't, don't even suggest a terrible fix.

366
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,039
Like that is not a solution for what is

367
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,289
-- currently a completely broken system
-- to be clear.

368
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,919
That is not the fix. I'm just pointing out

369
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:13,440
for them to have not contacted curl at all is the bar is so low to contact and curl that.

370
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,599
-- Again, it shows how broken this is.
-- I'll leave that story in because you're not wrong

371
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,119
but

372
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:18,869
technical,

373
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,299
you are technically correct. So anyway, now,

374
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,159
now Daniel goes to basically, he sends an email to CV E saying this is ridiculous.

375
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,200
You need to pull this out

376
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,179
and here's a question. Um No pause.

377
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,619
How do you send an email to CV?

378
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,469
-- Well,
-- you don't, you have to use their terrible form,

379
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,969
-- I think
-- because there used to be CV at miter.org.

380
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,989
But now you get a bounce back saying don't contact us here.

381
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,179
There's basically no good way to contact them, right?

382
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,830
So he sends a message to CV E basically saying this is not a security issue,

383
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,900
please reject it

384
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,059
and CD E replies back with

385
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:49,770
no,

386
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,530
and it's not like you know who you're talking to. It's signed like

387
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,260
the CV. What did, what did he say,

388
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:57,859
the CV E assignment team?

389
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,049
And

390
00:16:58,409 --> 00:16:59,609
I don't even know who that is.

391
00:16:59,909 --> 00:16:59,929
I,

392
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,049
-- I don't even
-- know.

393
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,608
That's what ticks me off about CD E is an enormous amount of what they do.

394
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:07,439
Like when they tried to fire me. It wasn't signed by people.

395
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,989
Also, there's, I'll put a link in the show notes about the story when,

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,699
when CV E tried to get me fired from my job.

397
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,089
Well, they also made threats against me in the DWF and the blah, blah, blah.

398
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,569
It should also be clarified. These people do not like Kurt and I

399
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:19,939
not

400
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,098
at

401
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:20,510
all

402
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:24,829
-- at all which I I wear is a symbol of pride. I will add.
-- Yeah. And

403
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,540
one thing to be clear too is Miter is big enough that like, yeah, there's

404
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,599
even within the CV E I OK.

405
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:31,140
Storytime,

406
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,430
this is maybe a decade ago is when I managed to get Miter CV E project to move into, get

407
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,530
even within the CV E

408
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,119
team at Miter,

409
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,579
there was a kind of a 5050 battle going on of should we

410
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:46,310
make github the source of truth or continue to use our back end?

411
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,449
And unfortunately, the back end won out because I think

412
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,380
it makes it easier to justify funding it to the DH S.

413
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,390
If it's like in a ma

414
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:52,790
database,

415
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,989
it's control github.

416
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah.

417
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,650
But even within

418
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,890
I know within Miter's CV E team,

419
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,719
there are like there were the people that were more pro

420
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,369
open source basically and

421
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,780
open source in the sense of turning this into

422
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,170
an open source project versus the very regressive.

423
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,560
Not like this is a, this is a budgetary line item that we're going to milk

424
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,020
that

425
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:16,660
that's it.

426
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,500
And

427
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:17,660
so

428
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,170
that's the thing within Miter and the team.

429
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,930
It's, there's big enough and there's enough politics going on. But

430
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,770
like, even Miter, some of them hate you and me and some of them are like,

431
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,930
I wish Kurt had won. That's probably true.

432
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,449
Straight up. I had one of them tell me,

433
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,270
Miter

434
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:31,729
doesn't

435
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,979
hate us. CD E doesn't like us. There's a huge difference. Miter is a giant company.

436
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,449
-- Even within CV E, there's people that hate us and like us,
-- whatever. Ok.

437
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:42,300
Anyway, ok, we're, we're off on too many tangents. Ok.

438
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,189
-- Well,
-- but this is part of the problem is that this is,

439
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,469
this isn't an open source project.

440
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:47,959
This is

441
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,650
a government funded thing

442
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,079
that's run by a quote unquote

443
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,719
nonprofit corporation.

444
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,760
So now, so, so Daniel asked meter to reject this meter

445
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,089
says, no, he asked NVD to resort

446
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:01,859
it.

447
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,599
Right?

448
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,420
And again, like

449
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,369
NVD scoring is not like some open transparent thing. It's a magic black box.

450
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,119
You can at least have an email address. Thank goodness.

451
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,729
Well, and I know for a fact, I don't know now, but I know back in the day they,

452
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,890
it was subbed out to a defense contractor.

453
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,849
-- It very well might be. I have no idea. No, no,
-- no, no, it was

454
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,670
100% sub to a defense contractor back in the day.

455
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,290
-- No,
-- I mean, it was, I don't know if it still is.

456
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,510
-- I think
-- they brought it in house because they just realized how much they were paying

457
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
for something that was not high quality.

458
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,859
It doesn't matter. It's, that is an unimportant detail.

459
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,040
Again. Well, but again, it shows how broken it is.

460
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,729
Why, here's a question,

461
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,689
why is NVD scoring this and not, you know,

462
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,069
the people who own the software

463
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,400
or why aren't they at least giving the people

464
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,089
that own the software the chance to score it?

465
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,150
Right. And then the answer is because their process is 25 years old

466
00:19:54,459 --> 00:20:00,010
and the whole project is designed as a funnel as a 25 year old work process.

467
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,359
And they don't, for example,

468
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,800
here's what's wild to me.

469
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,489
You think at some point after issuing a couple dozen cvs for curl,

470
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,619
they would have like approached him and said like, hey,

471
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,849
let's make you AC N A and like have you handle this?

472
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,219
It's possible. They did.

473
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:19,859
-- And he said no, because being AC N A adds cost for little value. Uh
-- actually, no,

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
-- it adds cost for negative value.
-- OK?

475
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:24,479
But anyway,

476
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,630
so Daniel does say in his blog post that there he's going

477
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,160
to become AC N A just to deal with this BS,

478
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,770
which is

479
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,150
ridiculous.

480
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,780
And again, this shows how broken is the only way to interact with this program

481
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:40,849
is to become a full fat CV numbering authority. There's, there's zero

482
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:44,989
and essentially your two options are become a CV numbering authority or

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,829
-- join the board and join the board is you
-- can't join,

484
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,390
you can't join the board.

485
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,060
You can only,

486
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,319
yes, you can if you are a big enough CV,

487
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:53,920
numbering authority with enough political clout.

488
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,109
-- Like, say Microsoft. Well, that's
-- just it. Right. Right.

489
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,869
So the answer is basically your, your,

490
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,540
your entry and access to CV is either not at all.

491
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:01,709
Go

492
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:06,939
-- way or you have to literally jump all the way up.
-- Yeah, it's 0 to 100.

493
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,479
There's nothing in between. Exactly.

494
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:10,439
-- And this is obviously one of the
-- problems and

495
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:11,979
that's something I tried to fix and failed at.

496
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,430
-- Sorry, it's not
-- your fault.

497
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,800
Uh, so anyway,

498
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,630
so he emails MV DMV.

499
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,410
D does rescore it but he says it's not a vulnerability

500
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,150
at all and they rescore it to a 3.3 I believe,

501
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,829
-- which they at least got back to him and they did something.
-- It's like,

502
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,310
it's like 3.6 and

503
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,219
not so bad, not so great.

504
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,430
I mean,

505
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,670
it should have been a zero but whatever, whatever. I mean, this is again,

506
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,989
who, who scored it? Why did they score it the way they did? We have no idea

507
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,069
-- it
-- should have been

508
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:41,949
like the GSD does

509
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:45,050
-- an informational with a score.
-- That's just it.

510
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,250
There, there, there is a concept of informational and you can make the argument that

511
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,800
under some completely bizarre set of circumstances.

512
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,810
This is a concern you might have because it can create some network traffic.

513
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,729
But fundamentally

514
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,969
this is like,

515
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,089
uh,

516
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,599
I stuck a fork in the outlet and stood in a bucket of

517
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,739
water and then turned on the light switch sort of like just no,

518
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,890
no one does that.

519
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:10,369
More importantly, it's like what the, the one kernel person wanted is.

520
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,170
They want informational tracking of all of this so that they can say, look,

521
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,949
every time we use this type of

522
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:20,290
C data structure and memory, it results in a flaw, right?

523
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,449
-- That is a different conversation. We will talk about that some
-- other day.

524
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,660
But see, that's the problem is

525
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,849
CV E air quotes here only does real vulnerabilities.

526
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,400
-- Well,
-- that's what they tell people, but it's,

527
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:34,250
-- it's full of tons of garbage
-- 100%.

528
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:35,199
And that,

529
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,699
that's one of, I mean, that's one of the other,

530
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:42,800
I guess urban myths around CV E is there's this perception that if it has a CV E ID,

531
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,550
it's an actual real vulnerability.

532
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,709
But the reality is, I bet you

533
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:52,150
80 plus percent of this data isn't ever vetted by anyone except the submitter.

534
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,709
I mean, I worked at security firms prior to Red Hat. Uh We,

535
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,650
no, uh the open source stuff we kind of looked at briefly but like close source stuff,

536
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,520
how you,

537
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,349
you can't vet Hitachi data systems product bla unless you show him

538
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,089
a copy of that thing and it's like a million bucks.

539
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,969
Also a quick thing. There's a couple of misconceptions here.

540
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,859
Number one, you can only have a CV, if you have an actual vulnerability.

541
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:13,579
Well, obviously not, you can have a CV

542
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,979
to put it bluntly, you can have a CV. If somebody assigns a CV,

543
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,959
that's it.

544
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,109
You don't have to have a code patch, you don't have to have exploit code.

545
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,930
You don't have to have exploitation in the wild.

546
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:26,329
You straight up just have to have this looks enough like a problem or,

547
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:27,410
and,

548
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,469
and this also a lot of people are focusing on the

549
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:32,550
open source world where you actually have at least some degree of

550
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,719
transparency and knowledge about the code and what the heck's going on.

551
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:39,589
-- But I have seen CV S issued for close source stuff where it's kind of
-- like, OK, here's,

552
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,859
here's a good example.

553
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:43,930
So let's say I and this used to happen all the time.

554
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,510
I'm a security researcher, I find a problem in,

555
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,849
let's say Microsoft was super notorious for this.

556
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:53,219
And I'd say I found a bug in, in IIS and Microsoft says, nope, not security

557
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,800
and then I could be like, I think it is security.

558
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:01,520
And now you get into some sort of argument with Microsoft and you can go to CV E as the

559
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,319
researcher and say I found this vulnerability.

560
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,329
Microsoft says it's not a vulnerability.

561
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,560
I want a CV E and that creates a whole weird like flow chart of madness.

562
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,020
But if, if you can convince the CV E people, oh

563
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:18,030
actually, uh so that flow chart.

564
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,880
So some of that stuff used to be properly documented in the CN A guidelines.

565
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,030
-- Version three. It was taken out in version four
-- II. I haven't read them in a long time.

566
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,089
It doesn't surprise me.

567
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,170
-- Yeah, that's
-- anyways, I'm just going to read this and this isn't some hypothetical.

568
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,489
This is just uh sorry. The word you want to search for is unknown. OK.

569
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:38,170
-- So this is from 2023 yesterday.
-- From the time of recording.

570
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,099
Yeah, from yesterday, the time recording

571
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,670
a vulnerability comma which was classified as critical comma has been found in

572
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,229
Yong

573
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:45,550
Gu

574
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:45,709
ya

575
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:46,670
dash

576
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,579
NC up to 2023 0807. Period.

577
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,229
This issue affects some unknown processing of the file, print template file serve.

578
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,859
Lett Java,

579
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,150
the manipulation of the argument file path leads to path traversal.

580
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,750
The attack may be initiated remotely.

581
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,160
The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used

582
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,390
the identifier V DB something something was assigned to the vulnerability.

583
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,430
So that's a perfect example of the vulnerability database assigned this as AC N A.

584
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:08,869
OK.

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,349
-- Do you see any useful information here?
-- No, no, certainly not, not really.

586
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,319
And then there's a link to a PDF and G out

587
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,449
exciting.

588
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,880
But OK.

589
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,300
So here's the problem

590
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,010
-- and no, but here's the, this is an example of a good high quality unknown CV.
-- Of

591
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,109
course, they're all high quality.

592
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,449
-- What was that one
-- you found that was like 20 or 30 characters long in the description.

593
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:28,540
Oh

594
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,250
-- my goodness. And it was like
-- in the SQL

595
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,969
-- error exists,
-- it was something like that.

596
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:34,180
It was,

597
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,170
it looked like they did like a copy and paste but

598
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,500
only copied like the 1st 2.5 words and pasted it.

599
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,089
And here's my favorite thing is the CV D description used to require things like

600
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:46,069
a product and a version and uh what it is and where it is.

601
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,140
And so I literally have like a Python script that just did a fill in the blank

602
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,540
and it was better.

603
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:51,540
But now

604
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,270
they don't actually even require the product name or version

605
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,900
in the description because that can be in the links.

606
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,260
So now is the beautiful part is CV, is a database

607
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,459
that is fundamentally not machine consumable because a lot

608
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,109
of the data is in that free form text,

609
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,829
which maybe A I can read now.

610
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:08,839
But essentially you have to click on all the links to

611
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,729
read all that stuff for it to be any use.

612
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,689
And this is where companies like I defense and eyesight came in is we would do all that

613
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,180
-- and then turn it into an XML feed that was actually machine readable,
-- right? OK.

614
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,390
So here's where I want to finish this up

615
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,469
because we've already spent like 20 some minutes talking about

616
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,300
all of the problems and there are many,

617
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,989
-- but that's
-- the point people think that this is some machine that works smoothly,

618
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,150
you know,

619
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,170
it's this Rube Goldberg contraption that's 25 years old and falling apart.

620
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,680
It is, it's falling apart. I agree with that 100%.

621
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:38,579
And I think there's still too many people who either don't understand

622
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:41,020
or are, are misled purposely.

623
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,579
Maybe there are people that only look at a few CV S A year. They don't look

624
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,560
hundreds or thousands.

625
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:50,589
Here's the thing I want to focus on is the transparency and accountability aspect.

626
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,900
Let's look at, I'm going to use github

627
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,020
-- as the example because I've been working with github's data quite a bit lately.
-- OK.

628
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,040
Pause when you say you're talking about the github

629
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,329
Security Advisory github's

630
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,369
-- vulnerability
-- database. OK?

631
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,229
-- So the GHS A database, the
-- CV E data in github is that is CV ES data that is not github

632
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,390
data. When the word

633
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:12,589
github, I'm literally talking about github, the organization

634
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:16,670
-- and that's fair because
-- this and one comment. So you uh the github

635
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,589
security Advisory Database is

636
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,890
-- CV data. So basically all databases are CV
-- database. The github

637
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,790
data

638
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,709
is

639
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:29,300
the collection of GH SAS which like projects can file using github.

640
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,589
There's an option to file a security vulnerability, right? And they import

641
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:35,869
the miter CV E data

642
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,079
and they, well, they actually they,

643
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,619
they pull in NVD data as well because they have those

644
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,119
-- CV SS scores
-- CV data and NVD data are still different.

645
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:44,689
They are,

646
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,719
they are

647
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,489
and then they

648
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,290
github

649
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,920
enriches the data for the particular ecosystems. They care about. So like Python

650
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,390
and Ruby and Java and there's a handful of this stuff, right?

651
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,040
And then they add version information,

652
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,560
they add a bunch of stuff and then it goes

653
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,800
into their data set which is conveniently stored in github,

654
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,089
this

655
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,040
JSON files.

656
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,560
And then here's what happens.

657
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:09,579
So let's say I'm working with this data and I find a problem.

658
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:10,989
I can submit a pull request to github

659
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,619
that says here is and they have a very nice web form you can fill out.

660
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,199
And

661
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,599
so I

662
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:16,010
submit,

663
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,290
I submit a pull request. Well, I fill in the web form.

664
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,079
Let's say it submits a pull request

665
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,270
and then there's discussion about what, what's going on and in some cases it's just,

666
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,199
oh yeah, you're right.

667
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:29,500
You missed a link or, or this version was off by one or whatever

668
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:30,930
and that happens all the time,

669
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,010
but sometimes it's a little more confusing and

670
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,969
discussion has to happen where it could be.

671
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,890
I found this. I don't think this is a vulnerability for these reasons.

672
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,849
Here's my supporting evidence because if I show up and say, hey

673
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,550
github, this isn't a vulnerability.

674
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,410
They're gonna say

675
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:49,319
prove it. Like show, show us, show us your homework, we want to see, right?

676
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,000
And they do this all the time where they'll be like I,

677
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,699
I need more evidence like give me more

678
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,560
and so then you provide more and they might say yes, you're right or OK,

679
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,369
I see what you're saying.

680
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,060
But I disagree for this reason and there is a discussion in public

681
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,599
so anyone can go look at that discussion and say here is why

682
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,000
-- this particular thing looks the way it does
-- and not just

683
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,400
look at it, they can participate

684
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:13,209
for sure.

685
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,560
No, no, no. That's a huge thing because

686
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:22,020
I see discussion of CV ES on hacker news on Mastodon.

687
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,579
Now, I would have said on Twitter, but I,

688
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,290
that's dead. Wonderful, high quality discussion of CV S

689
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,800
and that data dies there.

690
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,439
It doesn't go back to the database. And that makes me very sad.

691
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:36,640
And, and so this is part of, I think what

692
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,319
infuriates me more than anything is

693
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,560
in the CV E world. I, so I do a lot of work with this data at anchor

694
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,800
part of like the sift and Gripe Universe in our product.

695
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,000
And I go out of my way to send changes somewhere else whenever I can. And I would say

696
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,469
more than 50% of the time I ask CV E to fix something.

697
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,949
They, they give me the thing.

698
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,170
Like I, I, I'm serious, like

699
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:06,790
it's everything from, no, we don't care or go talk to the CN A over here or whatever.

700
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,689
It's not that it's, again, you're ascribing sort of uh a reason.

701
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:14,839
It's no, it's, I remember the story about V and V MS.

702
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:17,074
My Children don't belong together with the IBM mainframes.

703
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,704
And basically, there's a quote from the story where it says is basically,

704
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:22,375
it's like watching a semi truck towing a double wide

705
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:25,895
house trailer run over a moped on the freeway because,

706
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,555
you know, changing lanes would have been too much work.

707
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:31,324
-- It's nothing personal. It's just sorry, I, I splatted you.
-- No, it's not personal.

708
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:34,415
I, no, I totally get that. I'm not saying it's personal against me.

709
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,364
It's just, this is the way the machine works.

710
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,535
Anyone who would like, I have sent them data before where they were like

711
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:42,880
like versions X to X and I was like, look,

712
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,130
here's the actual advisory from upstream that says this version is where it starts.

713
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,410
This version is where it ends. The data in your pros description is wrong

714
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,930
and they came back with, we didn't assign this.

715
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:57,969
You have to go talk to someone else and I was like effort. I don't even care.

716
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,500
So you know what I do, then I go to github.

717
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,810
I do my type

718
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:01,079
tye

719
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,469
thing in their little form. They say, oh, hey, you're absolutely correct.

720
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,910
-- Except holy cow.
-- But the problem is that

721
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:13,060
-- what people perceive to be as the source of truth for CV is wrong most of the time it
-- is.

722
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:16,150
And this is where I, I mean, I'm telling, you know, anyone listening,

723
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,890
if you are doing any work with vulnerabilities, just start using the github

724
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,339
data. Like for real, you would, you're a fool not to, it's easier to consume.

725
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,290
It's easier to consume. It's easy, you can update it.

726
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:29,560
So anyway, here's the thing that infuriates me.

727
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:32,530
-- So I do all this research on a particular vulnerability,
-- right?

728
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,930
And that knowledge dies in your head.

729
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,650
-- Well, it doesn't
-- anymore because I send it to get,

730
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:39,435
but you get, the point is like, I remember at Red Hat, we would keep

731
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,314
enormous quantities of

732
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:42,694
milk cook in Godzilla.

733
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:46,935
That way anyone coming after us could look at what we had done to say.

734
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,864
Why did you mark this as won't fix?

735
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:52,135
-- Why did you mark this as critical
-- or stuff with customers?

736
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,015
-- Right.
-- It's not just for customers and even for me,

737
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:58,295
like, I don't remember what I did yesterday.

738
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:01,015
I can't, there's too much data.

739
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:04,015
You know, this is the thing that

740
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,579
is missing 100% missing from the vulnerability universe is just the fact that

741
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:11,729
like if Daniel didn't write all this stuff down in a blog post,

742
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:14,020
would anyone know he'd done any of this stuff?

743
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,359
Not

744
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:17,510
at all, not at, not at all. There's zero records of this.

745
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,989
There's zero public conversations.

746
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,369
No one knows even now that it's been updated,

747
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,689
let's say he didn't write it down and things just magically changed in CV E and NBD.

748
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,609
No idea why no one would know Daniel did it.

749
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:33,089
We could think like, oh, someone must have sent them a correction who knows.

750
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:33,750
But

751
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,285
the thing it could have been me, it could have been you.

752
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:40,114
-- It could have been Dave and
-- you know what's funny, I've done that before. For, for NVD

753
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:46,444
is I have sent NVD updated C CV SS scores and said actually, if you read the advisory,

754
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:48,415
it specifically says this,

755
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:52,405
so we should be rescore it as this and they've accepted it.

756
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:55,635
No one knows, I sent it. No one knows where the score changed.

757
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,954
The score just changed like holy cow.

758
00:32:57,964 --> 00:33:02,954
-- That is bananas
-- and it, it does blow my mind that these like large,

759
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:06,430
like basically the majority of the world relies on this data

760
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,800
set because it's the only public data set that's available.

761
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,069
It was and like a lot of data sets, it's kind of OK. Not terrible enough.

762
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,479
And they think it's good enough and they think it's fine

763
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,640
but they just do.

764
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,760
And I think part of the challenge too is a

765
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,089
lot of people don't work with this data at scale.

766
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,760
They only look at a few products or they look at, you know,

767
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:26,689
yeah, like log for log for shell, right?

768
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:28,829
-- Lots of people
-- probably looked at that.

769
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,849
I've actually had what I love is when, when people tell me no, Kurt, you're wrong. CV.

770
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:36,770
Does validate CV S and I'm like, oh, I know, I know, I'm like, even

771
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,770
like it's physically impossible to do this,

772
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,170
right?

773
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:46,989
Like there's stuff in the CV database that is like, it's like a nuclear reactor.

774
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,670
-- Like you can't go buy one and try it out.
-- So here's the problem.

775
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,670
So we're ranting about CV E and we're

776
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,609
declaring it fundamentally broken on countless levels.

777
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,869
And so

778
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:00,420
it is conceivable that CV E will say, hey, Josh and Kurt, those guys are idiots.

779
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,349
Just don't listen to them.

780
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,189
Right.

781
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,689
Well, they probably will. But you know what I mean?

782
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:06,510
Like, that's what they've been saying for 10 years.

783
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,478
-- This
-- is, what is it, is it, um, um, Brand

784
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,389
Dole's Law, right?

785
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,350
Which is, it takes like magnitudes more effort to refute that type stuff. And

786
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,580
if someone, if, if, if someone who is part of CV E or someone who works with CV E says,

787
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,070
oh yeah, all the data is validated.

788
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:22,239
How do you prove it?

789
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,259
Isn't even, we can't prove it's not, I mean,

790
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:26,839
you can look at the evidence and it's pretty clear but like,

791
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:28,039
you know what I mean?

792
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,478
-- There's so many examples of it being wrong.
-- Well, sure.

793
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,618
Well, we know that, but how would anyone else figure that out?

794
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:37,789
Well, that's, well and more to the point, why am I gonna go bother?

795
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:41,079
Like I used to go through the CV, data set and correct it because that was my job,

796
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:41,438
right?

797
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,368
Yeah, I remember doing that all the time

798
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,458
when I was at like eyesight and eye defense,

799
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:48,018
I would send in so many corrections.

800
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,579
Uh Like nowadays, why would I spend time going through the CV?

801
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,289
Data set to prove that's wrong? Because I've done that. I go to the GST.

802
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,499
Um What is it in the tools repo we have that CV,

803
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:01,809
post mortem where I went through and did some simple checking of stuff

804
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:02,429
and found

805
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:06,780
-- hundreds or was it 1000 major errors?
-- Right. Right.

806
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,360
-- But here's the thing I do this all the time.
-- Kurt.

807
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,659
And I, no, but my point is,

808
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:13,790
or I could spend time drinking beer and playing with my kids nowadays.

809
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,709
-- Well,
-- ignoring that. Look, your, your, your comparison is not correct.

810
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,100
I, my job is to have good data for a vulnerability scanner.

811
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:26,570
And I used to try to work with CV E and I've given up like I can work with github.

812
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:27,580
No problem github

813
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,060
is a source of truth as far as I'm concerned because

814
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,100
they listen,

815
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,399
it's a, it's a project that isn't a,

816
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:36,260
a scary black box that no one knows what's going on.

817
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:38,469
You can send them suggestions like

818
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,320
it is.

819
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,110
It's not as open as I wish it was. I, I wish it had more of a, a like

820
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,620
I, I guess open source project deal to

821
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,534
where there was more because like github, fundamentally, it is their data.

822
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:53,165
-- They get to make the rules which is fine right now.
-- But part of it is

823
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,175
there's the chicken and egg problem of it can't be a true open

824
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:58,564
source project because there's not enough people to be involved in it.

825
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,834
-- And I agree with that. That is definitely part of
-- the

826
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:01,875
-- problem.
-- You know, it's

827
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,750
it's kind of like Os V, it's like, why is the file form out this way?

828
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,850
Well, because Oliver made it that way. Why did he make it that way?

829
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,379
-- Because like, nobody was around to help him.
-- That's what he needed.

830
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,379
It solves his problem.

831
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:15,070
Yeah. And same thing with like, like why is the CV? Jason that way?

832
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,209
Well,

833
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:18,439
because that's what Kurt needed and Kurt asked the board and community to help.

834
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,110
Nobody did.

835
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,590
So Kurt did four versions in like six months and like, or a year and,

836
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:27,459
and then I had what the solution that I needed and well, sorry y'all

837
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,679
right. Right. No, IE Exactly.

838
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:30,620
But it's better

839
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:31,405
XML.

840
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:35,784
There were people that wanted XML and I held the line there. So you're welcome.

841
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,584
I can completely see.

842
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:41,705
And I would, I would bet you that conversation would happen again on the CBE board.

843
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:45,784
Uh It did happen multiple times after the CV E went to Jay Z on,

844
00:36:45,794 --> 00:36:48,344
there were people that kept pushing for J XML for,

845
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:49,004
I'm

846
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:49,574
not

847
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:49,715
even

848
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:49,885
sure,

849
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,554
not even a little surprised. There's, well, why? Because

850
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:54,705
whatever

851
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:55,564
anyway,

852
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:59,064
so we've been ranting for nearly 40 minutes now

853
00:36:59,364 --> 00:36:59,925
and

854
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:04,209
I want to end this on a positive note because I don't want

855
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:07,669
to just have us bashing CD E and telling everyone it's crap,

856
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,669
-- even though it is,
-- I think you're right.

857
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,649
The the most immediate best initial step people can take,

858
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:14,989
go consume the github

859
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:18,370
-- CV data from GHS A help
-- them make it

860
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:18,989
better.

861
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,780
Yes and well, and that leads to the second step, which is,

862
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:25,110
you can like, like and subscribe, leave comments below,

863
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:28,139
right? You can do that. Whereas with TV, it's like,

864
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,290
good luck.

865
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,719
That's right. If they give you the finger and tell you to go away,

866
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,679
that's

867
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,379
it. Like there's absolutely nothing else you can do about that.

868
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,419
Now, at the same time there, you could file a

869
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,860
change, data request to github APR and they could tell you absolutely not,

870
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,810
we're not taking this

871
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,080
and you don't have a lot of recourse at that point,

872
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,570
which is one of my complaints like github

873
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:50,270
is the final arbiter in that

874
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,104
context.

875
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:54,965
You can have a discussion, but at least it's done in public

876
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:56,165
where they can say github

877
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:58,564
can say absolutely not. We will not take this

878
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:01,534
and there's a public record that you can then say, OK,

879
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:03,405
this discussion needs to happen.

880
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:07,564
Let's have a discussion about this because there is a place to have a discussion

881
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,229
that does not exist in the CD E or NVD world.

882
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,229
-- And that is a problem that is a huge problem
-- that

883
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,540
also leads then to what we did with the GSD,

884
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,300
which is the name spacing because here's a fundamental problem,

885
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,280
there cannot be a database with a single source of truth

886
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,370
because as a very simplistic example,

887
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,929
your bug

888
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,320
-- might be my regulatory requirement.
-- Yeah, for sure, for sure. Absolutely.

889
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,760
And that happened all the time too with like your,

890
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,129
your Samba example where Red Hat would say don't use Samba on the internet.

891
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,010
-- We're calling it.
-- And even simpler,

892
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,070
remember every time the Department of Defense would come to

893
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,169
us with those root can shut down the system.

894
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:47,790
And we're like, yes, that's the

895
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,770
-- yes and really
-- its job.

896
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,090
But from the department of Defense's point of view,

897
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,280
-- that is a legitimate problem
-- and, and that happens.

898
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,290
And so there's always the context

899
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:04,030
or my other favorite is there will be times like a sequel injection would be

900
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:06,889
incredibly important for a particularly library.

901
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:10,110
If it's used as a web app versus I'm using

902
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,580
a local thing that's reading, you know,

903
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,350
a config file that root put in place like that's a very different situation.

904
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,469
And so there's always going to be context around that. But again,

905
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:21,979
this is where

906
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,760
having a, a secret private

907
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,790
club

908
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,149
that's supposed to try to maintain this, you can't have conversations,

909
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,340
you can't have a discussion.

910
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:34,250
Again, I don't think it's so much that they want to keep this secret is just,

911
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,570
that's fundamentally how defense contractors operate.

912
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:36,820
I

913
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:37,060
agree.

914
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,600
And look,

915
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,360
it's just their culture. Here's the other issue of it

916
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,239
is

917
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,250
it's not.

918
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,120
And there are probably a lot of people who want to open it, but they,

919
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:49,395
they don't know how and quite frankly, they, they can't,

920
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:52,935
this has been running the way it's been running for so long, like by definition,

921
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:54,435
if they could fix these problems,

922
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,975
they would have by now because this is problems that have been

923
00:39:56,985 --> 00:40:00,945
plaguing these projects for a decade or more at this point,

924
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,034
this is not new,

925
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:04,084
it's just people are starting to notice

926
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:07,594
because I think vulnerabilities are becoming more mainstream

927
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:12,834
and there are just a lot more of them, right? Like there, this is what happens

928
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,334
when things get bigger,

929
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:15,554
people notice.

930
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:16,314
Yeah.

931
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:17,274
And I mean,

932
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:18,125
yeah,

933
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,439
part of it is the world has so fundamentally changed, the scale has changed

934
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,000
all these things. Like people need to be able to discuss this stuff somewhere.

935
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,540
That is

936
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,949
-- it, it, it has to be open source.
-- Well, no, no, no,

937
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,260
no, there has to be like an official

938
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,570
community in place to discuss this because

939
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,379
having random side conversations on Mastodon,

940
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:42,669
oh,

941
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:45,790
Daniel writes a really great blog entry and there's really

942
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,290
good comments or there's a great hacker news thread.

943
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:49,750
No, I'm sorry. That's

944
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,250
not good enough. No, no, for sure.

945
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,310
And that's one of the reasons I moved it into github

946
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,610
is I was hoping

947
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,469
not only would the source of truth be github,

948
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,189
but then there'd be the issues and the discussions there.

949
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,709
And if you go to the,

950
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,689
the CV E project github,

951
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:05,560
it's, it's, it's a frigging.

952
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,370
There's, there's not even tumbleweeds, it's that dead, right?

953
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,020
Like anybody files an issue or does APR they're

954
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,919
told to go away basically and use the form

955
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,810
and that's part of the problem is, so at least github

956
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:17,070
gets that right. With the

957
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,949
github, GHS, a data set,

958
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,669
you can go talk there, you can file issues, you can say, hey, blah, blah blah. Right.

959
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,320
Right. That's right. And that,

960
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,370
and that

961
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,909
there has to be official places for these discussions

962
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,510
because you can't ask people to be like,

963
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,409
oh, there's this really good threat on mast on.

964
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,169
-- So you should follow these seven people. And
-- that's,

965
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,939
oh, I know, I know. And now I want to add one last point long term,

966
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,889
we need some sort of like neutral worldwide

967
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:44,000
organization to fundamentally wrangle all of this.

968
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,350
And I know there have been like Mark

969
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,419
Ky said at one point, the UN should do it. Mark Curvey

970
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,649
is a guy who created O

971
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,889
api don't know if the UN is the right place. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't,

972
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,879
but it needs to be something like a nonprofit or a foundation

973
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,199
or some NGO type is and is the UN an NGO?

974
00:41:59,209 --> 00:41:59,729
I don't know.

975
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,840
-- Anyway.
-- No, the UN is very much a governmental organization.

976
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,469
-- It's,
-- it's all the government organization, you know what I mean?

977
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,679
Like that is what we need. And we also, I want to say we also need

978
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,439
-- significantly more funding than we have for this
-- and it's never going to happen.

979
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:14,995
No, I

980
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:15,794
think.

981
00:42:15,955 --> 00:42:16,455
No, no,

982
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,625
I'm not saying we have enough funding ever.

983
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,205
I'm just saying we need more than we have today.

984
00:42:20,294 --> 00:42:22,425
And I'm saying this is, this will never happen.

985
00:42:22,594 --> 00:42:24,905
I think it might. I think I'm, I'm hopeful.

986
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:28,824
I think if we can get enough people talking loudly enough to the right people,

987
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,995
I think it is conceivable because Kurt,

988
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:33,584
all it would take is the US government in the eu to each

989
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:36,895
dump like $10 million into this which they can find under the couch

990
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,149
and this problem is going to,

991
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:41,669
well, now we'll have the problem of how to spend the money.

992
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,510
You know what I mean?

993
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,110
Sorry not to go segue but you,

994
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,229
you and a lot of people always focus on the supply side of these vulnerabilities.

995
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,620
And I've always thought the demand side is the place to go. So for example, requiring

996
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:56,959
-- proper labeling or something, I think it would be better.
-- You are correct,

997
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,760
the demand side will help drive the demand side will drive supply.

998
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,179
And that's why we need the people using this data,

999
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:07,159
have to be complaining to their politicians and their governments

1000
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,370
to go fix this.

1001
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,969
The government is not going to fix this by itself,

1002
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:11,649
right?

1003
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,120
That we need the people trying to consume this data.

1004
00:43:14,129 --> 00:43:18,050
And unfortunately, I think we exist in this universe where people just think oh,

1005
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,989
the data is crap.

1006
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,209
Oh Well, like it doesn't have to be crap. Github

1007
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,179
is proved, it doesn't have to be crap. And github

1008
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,209
is doing this

1009
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:27,090
with a hilariously tiny team,

1010
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:31,850
but they also get to leverage the power of the community to amplify their work.

1011
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,729
And that's the thing,

1012
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,520
like, we don't need a government doing all of the work.

1013
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,800
We need a government coordinating the work.

1014
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,560
You know what I mean? And that's the thing, that's the thing

1015
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,879
-- that just eats me from the inside. It turns
-- out project management is hard.

1016
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:48,520
Who knew, who knew that was true.

1017
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,199
And that's one thing I really respect,

1018
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,489
I don't know if you've been actually tracking Daniel on Maston.

1019
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:52,919
But

1020
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,373
one thing he does is every time there's a new committer,

1021
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,012
he celebrates that there's a new committer to

1022
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:59,623
curl and he's celebrating the fact that his

1023
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,433
contributions to curl as like the percentage of

1024
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,363
the whole is shrinking and it should be.

1025
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:04,792
Yes,

1026
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:04,972
I,

1027
00:44:04,982 --> 00:44:06,923
I was about to say I have a suspicion that that

1028
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:09,822
is the sign of the ultimate healthy project where somebody like

1029
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:10,883
Guido Van Rossum or Lina Toral

1030
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:12,792
is literally able to

1031
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:14,145
step aside.

1032
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:14,785
Yeah, that's

1033
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:15,726
for sure.

1034
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,166
-- The train keeps going and
-- that has to be the way it's

1035
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:21,345
done because if you have like one person or organization in charge,

1036
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:22,736
you have a serious problem.

1037
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:25,025
-- So OK,
-- welcome to the open source world

1038
00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:28,666
there. Does that does happen and that is problematic.

1039
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,065
That's a different discussion we're not having today.

1040
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:33,266
So I guess all in all my closing thought

1041
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,110
is if you're working with vulnerabilities, please, please please use the github

1042
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:39,669
data and go help.

1043
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:44,080
That is it? That's my only request and your life will get better if you do that.

1044
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,919
And to be clear, helping doesn't mean you have to do a lot.

1045
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:51,139
Literally, even just complaining in a public place where it's captured is helpful.

1046
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:56,300
-- Yes,
-- it's a start for sure. Yep. Absolutely. 100% just filing a bug complaining.

1047
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,175
Having a discussion. You can do that there.

1048
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,524
They, like they have a github repository.

1049
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:05,395
You can go to and open an issue that says, I think we should do this

1050
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:09,955
and they might say no, but that's ok. That's at least a discussion.

1051
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:11,294
Well, let me put it this way.

1052
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:15,864
If you go to github.com/github/advisory dash database,

1053
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:20,965
47 issues, 42 poll requests versus let me just pull up the uh

1054
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,560
um hang on a second. Where is it? Because they keep moving stuff around. Uh Here we go.

1055
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,149
The version 5,

1056
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:33,419
14 issues, no poll requests. And let's see, the CV list is

1057
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,590
14 poll requests, no issues

1058
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:43,179
and the poll requests are all uh the issues are, wow. Ok. 2022.

1059
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:44,459
Yeah, some of these are kind of old.

1060
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:45,870
-- We
-- know that that's not

1061
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:47,510
a surprise like there, it's non response.

1062
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,899
It's basically, it's again, back to the whole dead zone.

1063
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:51,149
It's a dead zone.

1064
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,570
That's right. All right. Anyway, go ahead, github.

1065
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,300
Well, more to the point. Github

1066
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:56,810
will let you help. Yeah.

1067
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:57,830
Right. Well, they're excited

1068
00:45:57,939 --> 00:45:57,969
for

1069
00:45:58,129 --> 00:45:59,139
you. Don't really have a choice.

1070
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,179
No, I'm serious. Like,
