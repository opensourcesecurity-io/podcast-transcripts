Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:11,689
Curtsy Fried and my partner Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,170
All right. I'm excited. Beyond words. Today, we are joined by Fiona Kroen

3
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:19,549
Burger who worked for the Sovereign Tech Fund.

4
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,739
Thank you so much for joining us today.

5
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,969
Thank you so much for inviting me. I'm very excited to.

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,780
Fantastic. Ok.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,780
Let's just kick it right off and tell us what the

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,580
Sovereign Tech Fund is for anyone who might not know.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,500
Sure.

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,060
I'm going to explain it to your listeners, I guess,

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,319
who know a couple of things or two about open source.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,669
Sure.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,099
Sure.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,900
The Sovereign Tech Fund is a program that is funded

15
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,575
by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

16
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:49,694
It was started last year by me and a couple of other folks

17
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:54,314
that have been active in open source funding for quite some years and the

18
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:56,455
goal of the Sovereign Tech Fund is

19
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,634
to sustainably strengthen the open source ecosystem

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,380
and the way that we do that is by supporting open source infrastructure,

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,580
the maintenance improvement,

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,739
all those things that open source infrastructure needs means libraries,

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,800
protocols, inventions, programming languages,

24
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:16,150
developer tools tools that are needed for using programming languages.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,580
Um Yeah, and our overarching goal is to establish that

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,430
open source infrastructure is seen as something that

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,220
should be sort supported by the public.

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,930
OK, I love this. And I want to add,

29
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:32,970
I think a very important point about the work you've done is

30
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:37,260
if you look at a significant amount of other open source funding,

31
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,959
it falls under the category of what I like to call things.

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,860
A smart person thought was a good idea.

33
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,779
Whereas you have a PDF on your website, that's 55 pages long,

34
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:51,190
that details all the work you did to get up to this point,

35
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,809
justifying your decisions and laying out a plan.

36
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,269
So like you folks have done your homework here.

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,319
Yeah, we certainly did. And

38
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:01,400
I mean, we started last year, we started popping up on people's radar,

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,669
but we've actually been working on this for the past two years.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,929
So two years ago, I was working at the Open Technology Fund, my colleagues,

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,559
they worked at the prototype fund before,

42
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,750
which is a German open source fund as well that supported innovative prototypes.

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,360
And at Open Technology Fund,

44
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:20,509
I was supporting open source projects around internet freedom.

45
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,330
And there was also the core infrastructure fund that was one of the

46
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,330
few funds out there back then that

47
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:28,869
actually explicitly supported open source infrastructure.

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,380
And then in 2020

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,580
unfortunately,

50
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,570
the Open Technology Fund was almost shut down

51
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,550
by the Trump administration for various absurd reasons

52
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,369
which made the,

53
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:42,339
I would say, let's say the sort of global community realized

54
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:42,839
it would

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,720
suck big time. If one of the few funders or let's say the only funder who supports all

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,669
missiles infrastructure disappears,

57
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:52,139
we should create a bit more redundancy in the field.

58
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:55,720
And so we already had a couple of open years for that matter.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,270
At the same time,

60
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,679
Germany also had the presidency in the European Council and

61
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,940
had this big term dish of sovereignty pushing for that.

62
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:05,619
And we thought,

63
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,639
well, if we do push for a term like that,

64
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,190
we want to get involved and push for a specific

65
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,979
meaning around open source um individual possibilities of choice.

66
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,139
And um

67
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,820
and

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,289
you know, things like preventing vendor lock ins and you know,

69
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,589
push for a certain meaning of digital sovereignty.

70
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,759
So there were a couple of things,

71
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,059
there was a very specific window of opportunity that enable us to ask for funding,

72
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,479
providing this feasibility study.

73
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,990
There was

74
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,089
also

75
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:32,990
done just

76
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:37,365
in time for the elections in Germany and the coalition negotiations.

77
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,216
So, and since our current government thinks open source is really important,

78
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:44,886
our feasibility, I guess came in really handy and um you know,

79
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,246
pushing for a certain concept for an open source

80
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:51,285
fund that is focused on open source infrastructure.

81
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:55,686
And I think it was two months later, three months later, that look for j happened,

82
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:56,645
um

83
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,615
We had nothing to do with that,

84
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:02,322
-- but it helped, it helped significantly,
-- I think. Yeah.

85
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,981
Log for J was very much a we've been telling you so

86
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:06,102
please listen

87
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:06,401
very

88
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:06,742
much.

89
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,292
Yeah, absolutely.

90
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,281
And by the way, this is going to happen many,

91
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,302
many more times and those are just the beginning.

92
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,621
This is the tip of the iceberg.

93
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:14,492
Um

94
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:18,611
Yeah, I guess doing politics with fear is usually not our style, I

95
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:22,002
guess in this case, we've been warning and we've been saying

96
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:25,622
there is a huge lack of funding for these kinds of projects.

97
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,342
Um And there's something that we need to do about it.

98
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,250
So

99
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,220
like Josh mentioned you,

100
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:33,880
so there's a 55 page PDF which I actually recommend people read.

101
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,839
One thing I found shocking is your budget is actually

102
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:38,760
really efficient, right?

103
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:42,320
Like you basically have a budget of just a hair under â‚¬10 million of which

104
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,049
like 7.5 million is for funding

105
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,200
like and then

106
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:50,600
uh material costs for grant recipients is 1.1 million.

107
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:51,399
So like

108
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:55,429
what is that? 86 and a bit 86.5% of your funding

109
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,309
actually goes to doing useful things, which to me is shocking, right?

110
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Like I because you read about a lot of nonprofits or

111
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,760
foundations that are not as efficient as how we say.

112
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,149
But one thing I didn't see is

113
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,160
in the list of

114
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:09,760
like,

115
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,079
do you have a framework or a a published process for how

116
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:17,350
you pick your projects because the projects you've picked make sense,

117
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,071
like curl Open B GP D open MLS for on the infrastructure side.

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,191
But for example, FORTRAN package manager, I mean, like a, I'm like,

119
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,591
FORTRAN has a package manager.

120
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,260
I mean, I guess it does. That makes sense.

121
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,911
But like how do you out of the

122
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,401
I'm gonna say millions, yeah, millions of open source things.

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,390
Like how do you pick literally

124
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,460
those nine?

125
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:39,401
Sure. First of all, thank you for calling us Efficient.

126
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:42,091
As you can probably imagine as a German, I love to hear that.

127
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:46,040
But then also um that's a very good question. So how do we pick projects?

128
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:46,911
Um

129
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,062
I would say we have a,

130
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:52,742
we have two different mechanisms that we are using one of the support mechanism.

131
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,471
The other one is a push mechanism. So

132
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,191
actually, I think

133
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:58,432
when this episode launches,

134
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,571
there should be an open application ready on our website that is kind of like,

135
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:04,592
you know, classical open application

136
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,832
that is going to be on a running basis and people can apply and pitch their

137
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,291
ideas or the technologies that they are working

138
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:13,272
on or even technologies they're not working on,

139
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,863
they know a suitable implementation partner. They say this is actually in need.

140
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,673
This is very critical and there's a certain sense of undersupply.

141
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:24,273
Um And then we have a team, we have reviewers so pretty classical funding mechanism.

142
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:26,183
The other one that we have is that we have a

143
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,592
scouting mechanism.

144
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:30,233
That means that we are actively asking for recommendations

145
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:33,173
in the field with people who are themselves,

146
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,993
members of communities of practice people that are experts or active in

147
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:40,513
the field to recommend us and tell us about projects that are currently

148
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:41,213
need.

149
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:43,604
Um So that's one way how we are doing this scouting.

150
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:45,634
Then the other one is actually also research

151
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:50,033
um listening to those open source security podcasts that are out there,

152
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:50,993
but then also, you know,

153
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:54,753
reading articles and then there's actually a bunch of research.

154
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:57,914
Um So there are a couple of lists out there. I'm happy to

155
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,713
drop you a couple of links.

156
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:02,993
Um later today with lists that are, you know,

157
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:07,644
the 100 most critical projects that also have a certain sense of under undersupply,

158
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:11,954
those that have immeasurable the most dependencies in a certain field.

159
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:15,195
There's also a growing body of research out there

160
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,535
of people who are trying to develop metrics that

161
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,795
enable us to do some optimization in that regard,

162
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:23,464
you know, having scripts that we can run over github, for example,

163
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:26,954
to identify those repositories or technologies with the most dependence.

164
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:31,864
So, so we also look at those and create them along like certain criteria that we have.

165
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,994
Is this something that we can justify in the public interest?

166
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,476
Because that's our mission with,

167
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:40,085
with tax paying money and you know, being representatives of the public.

168
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:44,515
But then we also look at is there a certain sense of undersupply is underfunded.

169
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:48,256
We usually get in touch with people. Um We then have to.

170
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,756
So the way that we do is we identify technologies,

171
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,925
then we identify who's the person behind that.

172
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:54,675
Is there a person? Hopefully? Yes.

173
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,746
And if there's a person, we get in touch with them,

174
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,015
it was the same last year with a pilot project.

175
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,226
We knew Carl, we knew that Daniel was doing a lot of good

176
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:03,566
work for the community.

177
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:04,717
Um And

178
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:07,807
then we got in touch with Daniel and we asked Daniel actually.

179
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,016
So how are you doing? What's the current status?

180
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:14,166
And these conversations are actually so interesting because they show that

181
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,036
whatever you understand,

182
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:20,816
the dimension of being under supplied or in need is

183
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,927
so versatile depending on what project you talk to,

184
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,296
it can be the classic.

185
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:29,476
I'm this one random person in Nebraska or anywhere else that

186
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,997
I, I never got any money for this or,

187
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,518
but I'm working on this thing that's being downloaded

188
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,518
billion times every month or it could be,

189
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:41,518
we are not enough people, we need money to pay our incident responders or it can be,

190
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,468
I actually have a lot of commercial customers, but they will never pay for this,

191
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:47,687
which is I have 100 and 33 uncas

192
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,588
bugs.

193
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,468
I actually need to do the work and go through these

194
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:54,867
or even better. I have to remove things from my co

195
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:56,718
there's a lot of bit rod, I have

196
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,919
to remove features because it's been growing. And

197
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:00,598
so, you know,

198
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,919
having these conversations and basically

199
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,328
scoping conversations to understand what

200
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,119
is our role as sort of a public interest customer.

201
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,679
And then we do the scoping, we have another review with a review panel and then we

202
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,398
basically commission the work to be done

203
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:19,068
just as I say, is that something that you can publish? Because I

204
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,679
would love to read

205
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:23,958
those conversations or summaries of them or something? Because

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,299
like that is something that

207
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,619
Josh and I have talked about where it's just

208
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,539
you can't say what does open source need because that's like saying,

209
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,539
what do people need?

210
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:33,960
Like,

211
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,489
well,

212
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,359
yeah,

213
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,070
-- it's complicated. There's, there's a bit of variation.
-- A

214
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,609
lot of them need money, right? But then what goes beyond money?

215
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,809
Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's like asking what people need.

216
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:45,679
Well,

217
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,270
I want to point something else out that I think is really

218
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,049
cool you're doing and I think it's really important and not something

219
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,739
I've ever thought of before.

220
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,130
And I'm curious, I, well, I should say I'm curious,

221
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,669
I suspect I understand why you did this.

222
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,429
So you on slide nine of this presentation,

223
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,390
you

224
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:07,719
break apart who's using, you call them o open digital based technologies.

225
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:12,090
OD BT S is used all over the presentation which I can't ever remember what that

226
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,390
means and I keep reading them like it's

227
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,510
something important but you have two categories,

228
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,590
you have re users

229
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,780
and then you have kind of the the maintainers and the contributors

230
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,690
and I've never heard the term

231
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:26,359
reuser used before. But I think that's,

232
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,289
that really makes a lot of sense because that is very much how open source works,

233
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:30,489
right?

234
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,890
You've got the people building it and then you have the

235
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,729
individuals kind of consuming it in a way and that's what Reuser

236
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,179
stands for. And

237
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,719
I would love some insight on this concept because I think it's very powerful.

238
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,340
So what we're focusing on,

239
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,270
as I think I mentioned before with the open with

240
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,070
the sovereign tech Fund is really the the core infrastructure,

241
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,039
the core technologies,

242
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:55,219
but they're actually not user facing but actually developer facing

243
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,909
because we've been in open source funding for a long time.

244
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,919
I've been in open source funding,

245
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,219
I think for seven years and we've seen

246
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:03,349
a lot of funding programs coming out for technology

247
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,466
or open source and specific

248
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:09,637
and they always have a very heavy bias towards innovation

249
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,416
towards application.

250
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:15,656
There's usually a topical framing around it that favors application.

251
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,927
So I want to say on the application

252
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,427
layer, but that's wrong because also

253
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,156
model is wrong. But

254
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:27,427
so what we are really focusing on are those tools that are at the core of many,

255
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,684
many more technologies that are being used to build technology,

256
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:34,403
like the Fortune package manager, for example, like curl many many times.

257
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:37,153
And those are the things that we are focusing on because

258
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:40,624
the existing technologies out there those that are more on

259
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,424
a technical level that are under like under all these,

260
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,124
let's say, shiny and interesting applications out there.

261
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,773
The maintenance of these is usually something that funding programs or

262
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:53,804
mechanisms because they have their own logics don't usually support.

263
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,033
And as link

264
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:59,570
seen that we've all seen the result of that and it's a problem that has many,

265
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,950
many roots and causes.

266
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,611
And I think the fact that fans have been so focused

267
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,401
on innovation and applications is one part of the problem.

268
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,791
Well, I think it's safe to say, measuring this is hard

269
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,810
to put it bluntly. No and

270
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:15,710
no. But for levels of heart that most people don't understand

271
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,630
because like me and Josh have been at the coalface, you know,

272
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,950
digging the open source nuggets out.

273
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,909
Um

274
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,909
That's like defining or figuring out what the critical path is.

275
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,239
I mean, it's much easier to say like, hey, look at this N PM.

276
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,809
It's downloaded 10 billion times a week.

277
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,739
Let's fund that because it's popular, right? And it's easy to sell to people.

278
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:38,340
Like uh FORTRAN is a great example of a lot of people think FORTRAN is dead.

279
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,090
And I'm like, oh, I have some news for you,

280
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,640
you know, like, remember in COVID where the state of Jersey, New Jersey was like,

281
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,640
we need fortune programmers by Friday to fix

282
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,460
the welfare system where it's going to collapse.

283
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,219
Have really,

284
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,500
-- I didn't know that
-- that happened like a few like they literally

285
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,440
put out an emergency call for programmers to fix the system,

286
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,400
right? Because

287
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,710
so

288
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,479
-- we can't not send those checks out. Just
-- quite one quick info about the fortune.

289
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you know why we chose it? Did we add that to the description?

290
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,119
Um

291
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,400
So FORTRAN, there was an article two years ago, I think by someone who said,

292
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,080
listen,

293
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,309
everyone climate catastrophe is real and everyone

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,440
who's working on it is using fortune.

295
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,659
So climate modeling.

296
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,700
My mother did her thesis on river flow data and she basically did the back of the

297
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,890
envelope math and it would take her four years to do it on a mechanical calculator.

298
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,700
Or she could spend like two years learning

299
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,679
FORTRAN and like one year running the data.

300
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,440
So my mom learned FORTRAN

301
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,299
like way back in the

302
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,559
oh jeez like late sixties, early seventies because

303
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,789
well, yeah, and

304
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,760
to this day like I worked for the flood forecasting center.

305
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,059
They were running a US Army Corps of Engineers program written in

306
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,419
FORTRAN

307
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,559
to simulate river flows like it's

308
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,609
it's in the climate space that well,

309
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,859
what else are you going to use for massive numeric?

310
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:00,530
Because I mean, you're basically, you're imitating the earth, right?

311
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,500
You're emulating the earth with all those

312
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,950
different things that are happening on earth,

313
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,359
like a climate like atmosphere, water, air

314
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,070
and foster

315
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,719
was actually great for that. And many people switched to Julie,

316
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:13,125
but Julia can do all the things that fortune is doing.

317
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,346
And there's actually pretty, the reason we were thinking about supporting Julia.

318
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,346
But then we switched to fortune because there's actually

319
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,625
a very active fortune community that wrote a paper,

320
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,745
I think two years ago or so and said we are

321
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:28,306
committed to reviving the community to making fortune easier to use.

322
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,435
So we figured

323
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,325
supporting the work on the package manager and making it easier to

324
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,306
use is actually going to benefit so many people out there.

325
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,385
And I think it also makes them,

326
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,445
you know, kind of like the very

327
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,142
nice case about let's improve the existing

328
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,252
stuff out there rather than putting more money

329
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:47,271
to the new stuff. But actually figure out how to support what's there and needs help.

330
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,541
That's amazing. Oh, that's so good.

331
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:55,401
So fun fact for everyone when I was in college, I went to college in from 1997 to 2001.

332
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:58,062
And I had a friend who was a meteorology major and he came

333
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,382
to me one day and said they're making me learn this stupid language.

334
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,132
I need your help.

335
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:05,392
And it was a FORTRAN book and I'm like, wow, I was horrified at the time,

336
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,231
but now it's like,

337
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:11,049
yeah, I get it like it was really good at math and they needed it to do math. But ok,

338
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:11,669
ok,

339
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,429
I everything you just described,

340
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,710
I feel like it's so obvious now that someone says it out loud

341
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:22,380
about funding this kind of foundational core technology and the maintenance of it.

342
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,830
And the thing I keep spinning in my brain

343
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,799
is the topic of the last couple of podcasts,

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,369
like critical infrastructure has been a part of it in

345
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,950
comparing a lot of open source to critical infrastructure.

346
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,469
And I feel like there's parallels here because

347
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:40,750
the government maintains roads and roads are kind of boring. Right.

348
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,840
There's, you don't see a lot of new and interesting hype around roads.

349
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,039
I have bad news for you.

350
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,880
So when we built our new Anthony Hee

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,250
ring road around the city,

352
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,590
they did one section using and using a new experimental concrete technique.

353
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:57,280
Yeah, it hasn't worked out. They're gonna pave it

354
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,070
but there is,

355
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,590
but that's

356
00:15:59,809 --> 00:15:59,869
something

357
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:00,429
went

358
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:00,950
wrong.

359
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,539
It's just not suited for our climate

360
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,349
and that's, and that's like a lot of things is,

361
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:09,929
you know,

362
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,460
a technology that works well in one place may not work well in another place.

363
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:18,299
But so I would just strongly disagree. There is actually new, like,

364
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:21,650
uh go watch youtube on the new forms of concrete with the

365
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:24,364
enforcement stuff they're doing and the plasticizers and stuff.

366
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,065
-- It's actually kind of fascinating.
-- But

367
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,974
I'm sorry about that kind of crucified

368
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,184
that it's a niche

369
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:29,965
that

370
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:31,125
it's a niche

371
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:31,825
proving the

372
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:33,244
care about. Exactly.

373
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:37,164
So, I would say that there are amazing things going on in a lot of this stuff but it's,

374
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:40,505
it's so niche and crazy that like, nobody knows or cares or,

375
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:44,025
and back to what the last episode where Tomas was talking about,

376
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,085
like to even

377
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:50,669
to get involved to like, make a code, fix the level of expertise needed is just,

378
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:52,590
it's amazing, right? Like,

379
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,109
and, and I think

380
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,309
with your like, funding of these foundational things,

381
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,650
I assume it's going to the people that are already there.

382
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:01,570
And II,

383
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,089
I can't help but think that's a major part of what we need

384
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:07,589
to do is to kind of cultivate that existing talent and knowledge.

385
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,430
Absolutely. I mean,

386
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:12,646
just one thing I want to do to add what you said before.

387
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:13,396
So

388
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:18,036
what we're doing is for many people, incredibly boring. It,

389
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:18,546
it

390
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,386
doesn't matter to them and you know what it shouldn't.

391
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:22,467
But we keep saying

392
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:24,036
the most,

393
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:25,516
the biggest success story we can talk about

394
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,246
the work that we're doing is nothing happened.

395
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:28,817
I

396
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:29,557
found were

397
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,847
no luck for Jay happened. No, cbes for

398
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:37,697
zero days, one day, two days, you know, and I mean, this is about preventing

399
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:42,673
right in the way that our attention politics work usually, you don't get a lot

400
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:43,183
of,

401
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:47,793
you don't get a lot of props for preventive care, preventive work,

402
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,644
care, work in that regard.

403
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,864
So it's true that I think this is tricky and in addition to I think

404
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:58,134
those are really technical things that we are doing. Um

405
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:02,703
It's really technical stuff, it's really hard to people, for people to explain.

406
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:09,281
I mean, if you understand why OB GB D might be important or curl or a wire guard, then

407
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:12,120
when people understand that it makes total sense,

408
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,140
but you need a certain level of technical understanding and knowledge

409
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,360
to really be able to understand the importance of it,

410
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,100
then also make good decisions.

411
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,551
Yeah,

412
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,651
I want to follow up on what you just said though.

413
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:25,380
So you're talking about this is boring and obviously it's often

414
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,840
easy for us to fund exciting new cutting edge things.

415
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,081
But

416
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:34,660
how are you taking what we've just defined as boring foundational important work

417
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,500
and going to your funding sources and saying this is boring foundational work,

418
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,189
please give us more money to do more of this boring foundational work.

419
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:47,609
Like is that a receptive message or how are you wrapping this up in a way that, that

420
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,780
I guess piques the interest of the policymakers?

421
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,290
Yeah, that's a very good question and it's been tricky.

422
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,459
I'm actually surprised until today that this worked

423
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,619
that there have been people in the ministry and

424
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,270
the people that have been supporting us

425
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,310
that really understood what we're talking about.

426
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,209
But I think as soon as you start talking about the fact that

427
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,770
for everything that people care about these days, it may be innovation

428
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,449
may be disruptive innovation, science cars, I mean, Carl is built into cars and

429
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,699
so you know, that works well here, I guess.

430
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:22,479
So I think as soon as you're able to make the translation work, it works. But also

431
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,280
I think

432
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,780
as I said,

433
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,000
there was a very specific win of opportunity because um there was this

434
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,819
term digital sovereignty is being used in Europe a lot in a,

435
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,300
in a fundamentally different sense

436
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:38,930
than in the US from what I know. So here it really is now about enabling

437
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,920
yes companies but also administration,

438
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,270
the public individuals to make conscious and informed choices

439
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,050
and use open source.

440
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,890
Like open source is very much at the center of what we understand is the

441
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,660
sovereignty.

442
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,449
And it's not like let's build open source in Germany for Germany,

443
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,579
but it's actually about, you know,

444
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:58,660
creating a fruit tie and a good basis and

445
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,829
foundation for innovation to be actually even possible.

446
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,900
And yeah, I guess I really have to say that lock for J

447
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,030
like after

448
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:06,959
I think after lo

449
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,390
for J all those things happened, that should have happened after heart, please,

450
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,750
because back then people already understood

451
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,390
but

452
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,199
and some things happened and I want to give a lot of credit to that.

453
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,849
But I think on a more foundational level, on the state level administration level,

454
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,900
not even enough things have happened.

455
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,689
And I think those the mix of otf being almost trashed, then the

456
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,660
sovereignty presidency of Germany and the European Council.

457
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,969
And then also as you know, pushing for this concept and trying to lobby for that,

458
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,020
I think was,

459
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,859
yeah, lots of fortunate events happening

460
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,699
somewhat at the same time and also the election of course,

461
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,739
and I have to say two years ago, when we started working on this,

462
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,319
almost three years ago, we started drafting concepts,

463
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,989
writing the feasibility study asking like looking

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,550
around who's able to support this.

465
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,729
There weren't a lot of funders or anyone,

466
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,500
there were a couple of people that there was Ford Foundation doing great work.

467
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,010
There was otf um

468
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,319
there were a few other funders of the Sean Zuckerberg initiative,

469
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,819
a couple of that are supporting open source infrastructure,

470
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:09,260
but so much has happened since then.

471
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,430
So it's way more talk about it.

472
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:15,229
It's more on the agenda, like it's also on a state level, it's more on the agenda,

473
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,750
for example, for the uh for also for the US government in France,

474
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,369
it's becoming more of a thing in Germany.

475
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,650
We're definitely talking about it.

476
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,969
So I got to say Germany and our digital politics are

477
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:29,069
not really something we are renown for in the world.

478
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,060
Like why would be,

479
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:34,099
but I think it's kind of cool that now Germany is actually doing something where

480
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,079
like for once we're ahead of the wave, you know, and we're kind of surfing it.

481
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,790
So I think that's really cool. And

482
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,319
we always said the Southern

483
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,339
Tech Fund. So for this year, we have a total funding amount of 11.5 million

484
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,050
and we might get more next year, but it will never be the solution, right?

485
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:53,420
But what we'd rather like to see is that we

486
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,780
are pushing for a narrative and understanding for open source infrastructure

487
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,469
that will be copied by others. And that will rather lead to

488
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:01,750
a

489
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,910
different understanding of why this is important.

490
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,219
And we are strongly pushing for

491
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,630
the n

492
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:10,290
there's a term in Germany called

493
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:10,949
Dasso.

494
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,609
Interestingly, it doesn't really translate to English.

495
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,439
It's the understanding of the state being,

496
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:23,150
it's the job of the state to provide fundamental services that are important for

497
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,459
a society to work and for us to live a worthy life with each other

498
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:32,410
that is providing water, electricity, education, health infrastructure,

499
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,260
and that is called

500
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:33,800
Davao.

501
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,520
And we are pushing for open

502
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,439
source infrastructure as something as

503
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:37,869
digital.

504
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:38,400
Da

505
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:39,630
Di

506
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:40,619
Da

507
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,180
Zaga.

508
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,849
And that doesn't translate because we still argue

509
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,319
if we should have that in the United

510
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,939
States,

511
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,750
that's what I thought a little bit

512
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,719
speak for the US.

513
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:53,660
So here in Canada, it's actually part of the British North American Act of 1867

514
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,219
Peace Order and good government

515
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,000
that is in Canada.

516
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,130
What we, that is our fundamental view of government so very different than the US.

517
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,290
Yeah, absolutely. I have to give props my co-founder,

518
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,199
Adriana go. She's definitely the policy expert here and she's been

519
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,589
working with political stakeholders for a long time. And we realize at some point

520
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:16,270
and you know, that's kind of the,

521
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,640
here's an interesting

522
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,920
thing to think about

523
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,349
the Sovereign tech Fund where we support open source infrastructure.

524
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,199
We are pushing money into a field and

525
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,079
an ecosystem that is inherently not sustainable.

526
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,500
What do we do about it? This I know I'm making a bold statement here, but

527
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:36,290
see, there are people out there who are taking care of open source components. Um

528
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,060
They do that often in their free time, they are not paid for it

529
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,989
and

530
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,630
they should be able

531
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,910
to say, fuck this, I'm out of here whenever they want to.

532
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:53,199
So what we can't do is just push the money into this field, give it to people.

533
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,189
We want to support people.

534
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,530
And I think volunteers are always going to be a part of a vital and healthy open

535
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,579
source ecosystem.

536
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,099
But we figured at some point, we have to think in a bigger sense and think about

537
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,209
what happens.

538
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,959
So funding is also inherently unsustainable where

539
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,260
we provide money and then we're gone,

540
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,709
we might provide a lot of money and then we're gone in five

541
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,329
years when the next or in three years when the next election happens.

542
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:14,699
So

543
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,209
what are we going to leave as an understanding and

544
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:19,430
more overarching narrative for the world when we leave?

545
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,260
And that is establishing that.

546
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,569
And as my co

547
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:22,890
founder,

548
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:23,869
Ariana always says it

549
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,619
that at one point, we are not going to talk about like with agriculture,

550
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,560
we don't discuss every year if, if we're giving money to

551
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,030
a to agriculture, but just how much

552
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,479
and the same should happen for

553
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:39,239
infrastructure. And that is sort of the overarching goal that we have by doing this.

554
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,160
No, I was actually um

555
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:45,910
I've never heard anybody say it explicitly that open source is not sustainable.

556
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:51,180
And I'm not sure I disagree because I, I know a friend of people literally, yeah,

557
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,260
carrying it on their backs in their spare time,

558
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,699
especially with a lot of this boring foundational stuff.

559
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,739
That is, it's, I mean,

560
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,079
like monetizing open source is hard and monetizing foundational

561
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:04,609
open source is damn near impossible in my experience.

562
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:06,630
But to this, that's, that's a

563
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:09,300
Yeah, like nobody says, let's cut the, you know,

564
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,390
do we have to spend money on defense this year?

565
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,060
Do we have to spend money on agricultural subsidies this year?

566
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,780
Do we have to spend money on health care or the roads?

567
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,319
Yeah, of course. I mean, unless the country goes to a very bad place,

568
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,010
the question is how much

569
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,189
um but

570
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,160
in line with that one thing you mentioned is,

571
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:26,810
and I was just thinking about this. So

572
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,530
and I don't know if you can answer this but are

573
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,969
different countries sort of needs around this foundational open source?

574
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:36,020
All that different because like for me looking at this

575
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,020
list like open B GP D and open MLS,

576
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,130
like you, you can't have internet without those period.

577
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,530
Like you just, you,

578
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,989
it just doesn't work literally uh same thing with

579
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,689
curl like you want to talk to the internet.

580
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:48,130
Well,

581
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,530
you need curl.

582
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,655
Is there actually that much of a difference?

583
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:56,324
Between say a Western European nation and an Asian nation and some, you know,

584
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,574
country in Africa like,

585
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:58,104
oh,

586
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:03,464
-- you mean in terms of who's using it
-- like as to what they would find important or need?

587
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:04,405
No, I

588
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:05,204
mean,

589
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:08,375
I kind of often might depend on like a

590
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:12,765
larger political philosophical framework they have and kind of the

591
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,295
decisions they make. But I would say no.

592
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:18,795
And that's the reason why we always said we are not funding open source

593
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,520
in Germany. We are funding

594
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,010
source

595
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,709
where it is being done because it is being used by everyone.

596
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:28,729
And it also benefits the Eu and Germany because it is being used worldwide.

597
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,800
I mean,

598
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,880
when you look at, for example, we are also supporting Ruby Gems and Bandler.

599
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah, you bet everyone's using it.

600
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,260
So we, so we are also not making any

601
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:44,699
sort of national statement about what kind of open source we're supporting.

602
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:47,699
And I think we know that this just doesn't make sense,

603
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,055
make more sense on the application level.

604
00:26:50,064 --> 00:26:53,314
For example, what open sources the administration using um

605
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:56,464
hopefully not a different one than everyone else, but probably they are.

606
00:26:56,494 --> 00:27:00,525
So it probably makes sense to focus on specific products. But since we're,

607
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,295
you know, supporting the foundations of that,

608
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:09,824
-- there's no point in saying we have a specific interest in this or that
-- that feels ungo

609
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:13,675
like to me, I feel like every time I see funding happening,

610
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:16,994
it's all about we're going to keep it in country, we're going to fund

611
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,890
German or us or

612
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,930
whatever people.

613
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,709
And

614
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:24,790
how did that go over when you went to

615
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:27,540
whoever's writing your checks and said we want

616
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,150
to fund people no matter where they live.

617
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,030
Well,

618
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,479
I guess we were able to successfully explain what this was about.

619
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:40,109
And, you know, the thing is with the pilot round, it was also hard for us to foresee

620
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:44,875
where the projects will be that we support. We weren't quite sure. And also with the

621
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:47,555
open application that we're launching next week,

622
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:51,364
I have no idea at this point how many applications we're going to

623
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,885
get from where I did a lot of contingency planning for five applications,

624
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:58,035
50 or 500 if you're up for reviews, let me know.

625
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,819
So

626
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:04,079
it's really hard to tell and I think we all know the problem,

627
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,500
but we all have such a limited view

628
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,170
of what's out there.

629
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,540
I could ask you right now,

630
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,089
what libraries do you know out there that are

631
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:12,719
really in need and you probably know they are,

632
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:15,900
but you might not be able to tell me exactly what it is because

633
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,010
not a lot, that's the thing. Not a lot of people know about these, right. Sometimes

634
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,270
libraries are even butted up in other libraries.

635
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,540
So even developers never know about the existence and importance of these.

636
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,124
So it's been hard for us to

637
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:28,073
identify this.

638
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,563
There's one thing that I want to note though we had nine projects on the P

639
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:33,634
round and I think it was six of them

640
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,083
or five of them actually had a fiscal host.

641
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,313
I want to state very,

642
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:43,124
very clearly that fiscal hosts or fiscal organizations are such a vital

643
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:44,884
puzzle piece of an,

644
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,004
of a healthy open

645
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:47,473
source ecosystem.

646
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,323
-- Explain what a fiscal host is.
-- Sure,

647
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:51,784
I'd love to um

648
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:53,718
fiscal wholesale organizations

649
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:58,588
that are basically doing the back office work for an open source project.

650
00:28:58,598 --> 00:28:59,267
Many times,

651
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:02,828
they either hire people and employees and open source collective is

652
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:05,488
actually they are launching a program where they're able to just

653
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:08,387
hire developers for a certain amount of time so they can

654
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:11,708
be hired and work on things instead of being a freelancer.

655
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:15,128
So some fiscal hosts, they really just do the processing of invoices,

656
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:19,072
they're responsible contract partner who signed contracts with you

657
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:23,232
and who do all of the back office work. Because for a lot of open source projects,

658
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,832
it's not what they should be doing maintainers, right? They should be writing,

659
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:30,511
right? No, one of us wants to do it. So there are fiscal halls and organizations.

660
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,212
It's sometimes it's foundations. Um It could be a

661
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,761
sting in Netherlands can also be in a

662
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:36,521
in

663
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:37,771
Switzerland.

664
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:40,092
So sometimes it's people who are already working there but are

665
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:42,421
working on open source in their free time or something.

666
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,302
They really just hire people, they do sub

667
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:45,676
attracting.

668
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:49,046
Um and those are really, really important. I would love to see more of that.

669
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:51,336
And most of them I think are currently in the US

670
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,715
because I think

671
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,196
significant funding for

672
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,725
source technologies

673
00:29:55,885 --> 00:30:00,026
that has traditionally been more present in North America than in Europe.

674
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:03,426
And other places, I would really love to see more of this because I think

675
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:05,715
it's sometimes a make or break decision that an open

676
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:09,676
source project can actually grow and receive funding

677
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:11,395
if they have an organization in their back

678
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,900
related to that. I'm curious because

679
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,439
there are projects obviously that have a lot of

680
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,489
people and are big and kind of healthy.

681
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,170
But

682
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,619
by the numbers, basically,

683
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,430
the majority of projects have less than a developer, right?

684
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,050
Like I've, I've met people who are like, oh,

685
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,489
I maintain like 400 ruby gems and I'm like, good God, like how,

686
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,959
you know, it's like those people that have 12 Children.

687
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:34,430
And I'm like, how do you even remember their names?

688
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,430
So I'm wondering like, what,

689
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,920
how again it kind of goes back to people are different and have different needs. But

690
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,729
I guess,

691
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,280
yeah, the scale issue of like there is

692
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,310
a completely different reality for an organization that has

693
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,969
10 people who can actually return your emails and

694
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:51,119
a

695
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:55,349
person who is maintaining 400 libraries and also has a full time job.

696
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,270
Like, how do you even begin to talk to them and let alone help them?

697
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Like,

698
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,680
so for

699
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,036
experience, I can tell you

700
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:07,485
sometimes it's a large foundation that just never responds, sometimes it's

701
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:12,336
an individual that never responds. So uh that seems to be a common denominator here.

702
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:12,645
But

703
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:13,725
um you know,

704
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:18,985
that's kind of our job is when we identify technology um that fits our remit,

705
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:20,235
we get in touch with people.

706
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,225
And that sometimes means means to be just research, who's behind this,

707
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:23,651
look at the

708
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,812
github repository, we look

709
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:29,982
who had the most contributions. Um Sometimes there is for program languages.

710
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:30,432
For example,

711
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,722
there are sometimes foundations in the back that we can talk to

712
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,972
usually have a very good overview over the field in the community.

713
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,621
Um And then we get in touch with people and sometimes,

714
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,722
yeah, you have a conversation and they're like,

715
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,822
you know what I actually

716
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:43,781
um

717
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:47,641
the community is in a sorry state. I don't really have the time to do this.

718
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:52,031
This is too much work. I I would love to get your support but we can that has happened

719
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,739
um because things need to be figured out.

720
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,380
Then there are others who, you know,

721
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,699
can just be a contractor and actually really happy that they

722
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,339
can focus on this project for a certain amount of time.

723
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,420
And then there are others who say I can't do this right now, but

724
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,180
there's,

725
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:09,130
but we sometimes identify a suitable organization that could host

726
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,540
them for a while or just provide the sub grants.

727
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,199
Um

728
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:16,130
and something that we've been that I thought was found really,

729
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,400
really important and I wanted to make sure it is as the Sovereign Tech Fund

730
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,800
needs to cater to the diversity of actors in this field.

731
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,959
So we need to be able to support individuals. Um GMB Hag

732
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:32,030
501 C threes or companies limited in the US.

733
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,199
Um And we are currently able to do that because we commission work,

734
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:36,390
we don't provide grants.

735
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,589
So I

736
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,439
there's

737
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:41,935
I learned a lot about German procurement law that I, I never wanted to learn.

738
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:42,974
Big

739
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,454
surprise German procurement law. It's hard,

740
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:47,214
but

741
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,454
we were able to sort of find ways so we could

742
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:53,165
provide contracts to people in the most flexible way possible.

743
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:55,895
So no matter where they are, no matter what kind of organizational type.

744
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:58,535
And I think that's extremely important because

745
00:32:58,854 --> 00:32:59,125
we,

746
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:00,055
you

747
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:01,234
and I,

748
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:05,354
we know there are very very diverse actors in this field that whoever

749
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:09,204
is a maintainer that can look very different who's responsible for technology.

750
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,819
So one thing you just mentioned that I hadn't really thought

751
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,300
about is so not only do you um essentially provide funding,

752
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,020
but

753
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,930
it sounds like you're also doing a bit of market making saying so for example,

754
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:22,939
you reach out to somebody and it's like, OK, maybe we're not a good fit for you.

755
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,500
But hey, Bob over here,

756
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:25,500
you know, they,

757
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:29,099
maybe they're a good like, is that something that you're actively doing?

758
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,930
-- You
-- mean as finding maintainers or people who want to work

759
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,383
-- on something or finding other funders,
-- for example,

760
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,532
if you reach out to somebody and you can't help them, but you know,

761
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:40,133
somebody that can help them, introducing them to each other, for example.

762
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:43,843
Yeah. And I think we would love to do that more in the future.

763
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:47,012
So what we're doing is sort of also a matchmaking, right?

764
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,672
We find a technology, I realize that

765
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,363
maybe the person who is working on this is the right

766
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,723
person we should support and provide a contract for her.

767
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:54,233
That's it.

768
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:58,052
But maybe it also makes sense for them to get some help from

769
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,166
someone who,

770
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,046
I don't know, a security art would be a classical thing to sponsor for.

771
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,026
But maybe in the future,

772
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:07,286
they might also need an agency or a company that's

773
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:10,176
actually using the stuff and who are able and willing

774
00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:12,824
to, you know, fund this. And

775
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:14,186
I think

776
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,045
so I've been,

777
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,145
we keep pushing for this narrative that the

778
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,804
government needs to be part of the puzzle.

779
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,364
But at the same time, we're not saying that

780
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:24,978
there should be only the government or other actors should,

781
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,759
you know, be removed from this field.

782
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,759
But actually, we think there should be more actors in this field who are, you know,

783
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,148
commonly like um together taking care of this ecosystem.

784
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:37,868
So I think companies are an even bigger piece of the puzzle here.

785
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,148
Um And we would love to explore more ways so we can also work with companies, help them

786
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:47,004
to find a landing space and figure out models and support those,

787
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:49,985
maybe do match funding, maybe they can hire someone

788
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:52,995
to work on this because as you said before,

789
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:55,455
sometimes there's less than one person working on a

790
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:58,395
thing and that's definitely the worst case scenario.

791
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,294
And what do we do then? Right. And,

792
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:03,754
and just to close this, I personally think that,

793
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,219
yeah, we can try finding someone but

794
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:09,379
there's a lot of work, there's gradually more money,

795
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:11,120
but there's definitely not enough people.

796
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,899
And I think that's the big,

797
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,520
how would you say it in English, Achilles, Achilles

798
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,020
Heel,

799
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:17,199
Achilles

800
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,580
Heel, and the big breaking point of this entire thing

801
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,340
is the lack of people I would say slash community growth, health.

802
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,020
So I think that is one of the biggest security risks that we are facing in the future.

803
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,825
Your agency providing funding is important, but

804
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:36,666
like a lot of government agencies that help people do so by

805
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,766
matching them to community supports or programs or have you considered,

806
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:41,105
you know,

807
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,926
taking this two year tech degree so you can level up and

808
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,186
be a better person and pay more taxes and get a job.

809
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,105
Um And it seems to me like, and that's a especially in the open

810
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:52,186
source world, like I, I couldn't even begin to do that

811
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:53,065
effectively.

812
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:54,166
No way. No. How

813
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,145
and it seems to me like that would be some

814
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,271
that could be massively important and

815
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,221
impactful without requiring disbursement of money.

816
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,132
Right. Obviously you need a staff to do it. But

817
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:05,382
yeah, I've like, literally never thought of that.

818
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:06,691
And as far as I know,

819
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:09,312
like you're the only group I've ever heard that's officially really doing it.

820
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:13,231
Great. Yeah, we're trying to, because you also mentioned this earlier.

821
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:14,352
We're trying to,

822
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:14,892
um

823
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:17,872
when we have a little bit, we're currently a little bit busy,

824
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:19,721
but we're trying to write down a lot of

825
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,231
the learnings and communicating them and do some,

826
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't know, maybe

827
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,479
let's call it funders exchange and education,

828
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:30,399
but also be more public and vocal about the things that we hear and see and learn

829
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:31,870
that are needed. I think,

830
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,399
you know, we can provide money, we will always provide money and contracts.

831
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,000
But there's,

832
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,010
I think a fund becomes interesting when you think beyond money and like,

833
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,739
what is it that we can provide besides the extra money?

834
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,159
Is it

835
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,209
upskilling? Is it connections?

836
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,929
Is it doing something, you know, changing political narrative?

837
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:51,199
So these things are being more seen and more folks are more aware

838
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,179
um

839
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,209
getting more funds

840
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:54,814
in the field. Um

841
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:59,074
You know, maybe also changing the way that companies are approaching this.

842
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:02,074
Um I think there are already so many interesting approaches out there

843
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:02,995
um with

844
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,395
Opos. But then also

845
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:05,274
I think,

846
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,004
and it's something that I hopefully in the future,

847
00:37:08,014 --> 00:37:09,594
I can wrap my head around a little bit.

848
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:12,574
Um How do you create landing space for companies

849
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:15,725
in open source communities after anything that's happened.

850
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:17,114
And um

851
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:19,399
you know, I, I think that's, that's something to deal with.

852
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,169
And then there are a lot of companies that I think

853
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,979
there are developers or even managers who want to contribute to open source,

854
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,250
but they just don't know how or they just really can't

855
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,600
because the processes don't allow it. So I think there are a lot of

856
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:30,830
open

857
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:33,370
questions. I think generally the Sovereign tech Fund,

858
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,229
we are quite lucky in that sense that

859
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:40,000
we always said we are an iterative program. We're doing something new.

860
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,320
We are going to learn, we're going to iterate our programs, our offers our actions um

861
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:47,040
depending on what we hear and see.

862
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:47,820
Um

863
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:51,040
But currently we still definitely have more open questions than

864
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,489
answers and we're trying to tackle one after another.

865
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:57,169
That's awesome. I'm just going to end it there. I was going to let you,

866
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:00,590
well, we'll put show notes for links to all the things,

867
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,929
but I can think of no better way to end this show than that.

868
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:03,639
And I think the,

869
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:08,570
I can't say the word iterative change.

870
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,050
It's been Kurt's laughing at me.

871
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:13,669
It's been one of those weeks, but this is,

872
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:15,889
oh my goodness, Fiona, this is so amazing.

873
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:20,070
I mean, hats off to you and all your people for the work you're doing. This is,

874
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,110
it's not very often

875
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:24,969
I hear about a government program that I would say is going

876
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:29,750
to truly transform anything but especially open source where I think there's been

877
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,669
a historic lack of collaboration,

878
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,719
but this one feels different.

879
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,419
And so I want to just literally thank you

880
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:39,649
for the work you're doing because it is amazing.

881
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,989
Thank you so much. I'm so happy I got to talk about it.

882
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:43,969
And

883
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,370
yeah, I want to close with. If you hear something, you see something let us know.

884

885
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,820

886
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:51,949

887
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,050
we are open for recommendations.

888
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,600
There's also an application platform that's open for

889
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,310
everyone so we can't hear and see everything.

890
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,610
So if you do, please let us know.

891
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,540
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

892
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:03,780
And,

893
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,620
and we'll have to have you back on in a couple of months

894
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:08,060
and you can tell us all about how the application process went.

895
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,239
Which II I can't wait, I can't wait. It's gonna be so exciting.

896
