Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast

1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,380
episode 25 also known as the silver anniversary with myself,

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,350
Kurt Siefried and Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, Kurt, how are you?

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,229
I am excellent. I'm over my kid's bug.

5
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm not

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,600
so a for me.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,639
Oh, man, I, uh, this time of year anyway.

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,139
Anyway, so I apologize in advance for sounding more silly than usual

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,430
as I have a, a terrible head cold right now.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,189
But

11
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:34,560
I

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:34,840
guess they

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,080
go

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,310
back to

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,889
school on Monday.

16
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,759
-- I'm
-- assuming they do go back to school and no doubt they

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,470
will pick up new diseases to bring home and give to me.

18
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:49,669
I know. I know. Anyway. So, uh, ce S was last week.

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,290
Yeah. Yeah, I have to admit tv's got dinner.

20
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,240
That's an understatement. But

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,470
there were some pretty sweet ones.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,909
Yeah. You know,

23
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,200
here's the deal, I guess is

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,900
that stuff is really cool. But I think we're at a point. It's just like,

25
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:08,769
yeah, it

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,650
took you so long. I mean,

27
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:12,879
that's kind of what I feel like.

28
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,580
-- I
-- feel like buying a TV. Now consists of

29
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,260
go spend 500 bucks.

30
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,989
-- Right.
-- That's it. That's all I got like,

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,069
-- and make sure it's like maybe four K, I don't know. Right.
-- Well, I got a four K TV.

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,029
Uh, I don't know, maybe six months ago. I, I didn't even plan on it. Is

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,959
I basically walked into Best Buy and I,

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,690
I went there because I wanted to look at things and make sure II, I was, I found the TV,

35
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,040
aesthetically pleasing

36
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,760
and various other things.

37
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:41,269
-- Honestly,
-- that would be a criteria. Now, does it match your furniture?

38
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:41,489
Right.

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,650
Well, and some of them are really freaking ugly. Like, I mean, let's just face it.

40
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,449
But, but anyway,

41
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,330
I ended up going and I looked at them all and I just

42
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:51,290
found the one that essentially had the most features I was interested in and

43
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,849
that's the one I bought and yeah, it was like 500 bucks. I mean, crazy.

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,690
-- Yeah,
-- I remember when TV. S like big TV. S used to actually be expensive

45
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,970
and they weighed 7000 pounds.

46
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,379
I, yeah. No, I, at one point had a 32 inch. Uh,

47
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,279
I,

48
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:08,809
I did

49
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,789
sorry, excuse my language but wow,

50
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,509
that thing was, yeah, it's huge.

51
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:19,580
Oh, man, I remember moving a 32 inch TV, with, with the C RT and I bet it weighed,

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,520
oh my goodness. It must have been like 300 pounds. It was so freaking heavy.

53
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,509
It took two people.

54
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:26,059
It was,

55
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:29,029
-- you better not like set it down sharply or?
-- Right.

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,130
-- It's just not gonna work
-- that too.

57
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,339
That too. Ah, the times they are changing.

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,789
So, so moving on from, from there is,

59
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,059
I feel like the single most interesting thing

60
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,339
that came out of CE S

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,100
is that everything is connected to the internet now.

62
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,679
Like everything they had a freaking hairbrush man that had Wi Fi on it.

63
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,240
Oh, the hairbrush that listens to the sound as you comb your hair

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,940
-- and then recommends like expensive beauty treatment stuff.
-- That's right.

65
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:59,539
That's right.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,570
I saw that. It was,

67
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:05,300
yeah, I I'm kind of envious to be honest because I don't really have hair anymore. But

68
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,000
that that's a good point.

69
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,479
You don't have any hair so you clearly don't need this this device. But

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,559
I guess the way I look at this is

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
on one side,

72
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,899
I get that everything's going to get Wi Fi.

73
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,500
In fact, I,

74
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:26,320
I read a new story of LG basically said every appliance we make is going to have Wi Fi

75
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,339
and

76
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,300
I understand it's kind of the inevitable conclusion.

77
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,000
It's kind of like how every toy now it takes batteries,

78
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:34,720
whether it really needs it or not.

79
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,750
And

80
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,220
another part of me thinks like, why are we doing this? This is, this is madness.

81
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,570
I have an answer for you.

82
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,240
And it goes back again to extending monopolies and lock in,

83
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,649
right? If I sell you a hairbrush,

84
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:54,460
whatever, if I sell you a hairbrush that requires connectivity to my servers

85
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,250
to provide the value add,

86
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,990
I can now either charge you monthly for that value A or I can,

87
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,660
for example, essentially control,

88
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,320
you know what beauty products are being recommended to you.

89
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,639
You know,

90
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:12,410
that's a bad example because the airbrush will still work if I never turn on the wi

91
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,839
fi.

92
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,520
-- Well, so
-- will my nest smoke alarm, for example,

93
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,440
it'll still warn me my house is on fire but it won't tell my phone

94
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,178
which is a crime.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,959
Well, you know, it's, it's kind of useful, right? Because I don't have to worry like

96
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,600
it's like all these security systems, right? Like I want a security system that,

97
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,179
you know,

98
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:32,059
ideally will do two things. One tell

99
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,980
people who will ultimately tell the people with guns like the police to like,

100
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,260
please go help this guy.

101
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,380
Number two, I would like it to tell my phone,

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,269
right? Because I mean, let's face it, right?

103
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,200
The phone is an extension of self nowadays, right?

104
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,079
Everybody carries a smartphone in their pocket

105
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,109
or they're just a ludite or

106
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:48,350
they live out in the woods

107
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,160
-- and don't have, you know, cell reception
-- or maybe all of those things.

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,230
Yeah. So

109
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,089
I, you know, that's the thing, right? How do you differentiate a hairbrush? Right.

110
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,279
We've had a hair brushes for if memory serves.

111
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,239
I remember seeing one in National Geographic,

112
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,190
you know,

113
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,109
they, they're

114
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,269
-- paleolithic or whatever time,
-- thousands of years,

115
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,000
at least probably tens of thousands and let's

116
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,690
face it like fingers were the first hairbrush,

117
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,130
right?

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,540
So, you know, and I'm making air quotes here. How do you like

119
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,049
add value to the product? How do you make it better? Right.

120
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:23,010
Like the wheel, you know, clearly rubber, rubber wheels are better because they,

121
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,679
-- they absorb shocks and you don't like lose your teeth
-- and you know,

122
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,649
what would make it even better is if we added Wi Fi to those rubber wheels,

123
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,660
we did that

124
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:31,049
kind of,

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,440
I know, I

126
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:32,709
know

127
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,170
the wireless, uh

128
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,779
the wireless

129
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,160
pressure

130
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:36,390
set

131
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,420
things

132
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,299
which, you

133
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:38,640
know,

134
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,570
kind of useful.

135
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,420
No, no, we should explain that though. For people who don't know

136
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:47,820
is in basically any wheel on a car today.

137
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,320
It has a little wireless sensor inside of it that

138
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,040
it basically measures the amount of air pressure in the,

139
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:55,839
in the tire.

140
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:56,799
In that way

141
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,559
when

142
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,959
the air pressure gets too low, it turns on that little light on your dash that says,

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,269
you know, hey fool go put some air in this tire

144
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,980
and you know, that saves lives.

145
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,839
Yes, it does. And I, I have no problem with that.

146
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,920
And in fact, for what it's worth,

147
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,910
I really don't have a problem with putting Wi Fi in a hairbrush.

148
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,200
I mean,

149
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,269
it's a bit comical in a lot of ways, but I think it's just kind of,

150
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,959
it's the nature of the universe today.

151
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,170
But the thing that scares me is I feel like we're rushing into this Wi Fi revolution

152
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,920
without the correct tools to actually make sure it doesn't turn into a Wi Fi mess.

153
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,950
Well, I think it's actually worse than that because I suspect a lot of these places

154
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,950
don't have a good idea or a business plan yet.

155
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,709
So, let's put in the infrastructure in the form of, like,

156
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,670
let's make this thing wi fi capable,

157
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,779
then we'll figure out what to do with it.

158
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,899
Like, really, that, that's probably fair.

159
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,190
And there, there's additionally, the, the thing that always keeps me up at night is

160
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,750
how are

161
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,670
nobody updates this stuff? And it's gonna be

162
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,519
exactly

163
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,299
updates

164
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:01,750
to it.

165
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,380
Yeah,

166
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,440
but are they gonna have enough storage space to

167
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,010
actually download an update and then swap it?

168
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,299
Storage is cheap?

169
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,079
It's not, yeah, but

170
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,959
it's not that cheap, man.

171
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:16,019
I, I don't know what these hairbrushes cost or, I mean, are they battery powered?

172
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,910
-- Like how does that even work?
-- I assume so, regardless it doesn't really,

173
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,649
could they be static electricity powered now, that would be awesome.

174
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,029
You know, they're not,

175
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:24,940
you know, they're not.

176
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,000
But here's the thing too is these devices are,

177
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,299
and this is part of kind of the Wi Fi revolution disaster.

178
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,769
That, that worries me is

179
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,230
let's face it. All of this stuff runs Linux,

180
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,339
right?

181
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,549
All of it is full of open source.

182
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,040
A

183
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,690
lot of it is probably all open source

184
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,309
where there's minimal stuff added by the manufacturer.

185
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:52,790
And as you and I both know very well open source. It has plenty of security flaws in it.

186
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,109
And if nobody's ever updating it,

187
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:01,549
what the heck is gonna happen in like 10 years when every device in your house has

188
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,829
more than 100 security flaws because nobody has ever

189
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,709
updated any of the firmware that's running it.

190
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,350
I mean, I guess the good news is,

191
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,950
is that you'd have to have two things take place

192
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,290
for like a worm or something to really work is

193
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,839
number one, the worm would have to have a way to get into your network because I mean,

194
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,510
the good news is,

195
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,829
but they all phone home, Kurt, all this crap is gonna phone home

196
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:27,260
assume for a moment that, that is quote unquote secure

197
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,829
-- P OS or SSL, right.
-- Get those air quotes back up. Yeah, exactly.

198
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:30,869
Yeah.

199
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,900
Like, let's ignore root certificate stores on a hairbrush. But,

200
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,058
well, in fairness we do root certificate stores now on cables,

201
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,650
like on, you know, those, um,

202
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,969
what you might call it the Apple cables, you know,

203
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,030
because they don't want you plugging

204
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,359
garbage cables

205
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,669
and, and you know, it turns out right, like go, uh, that,

206
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,909
that Google guy that does those USB C cable

207
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,809
reviews as it turns out.

208
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,489
Yeah, there are cables out there that will fry your devices.

209
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,239
So as much as I hate Apple for making me, like, spend

210
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,909
like three or four bucks on like

211
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,460
cables that are, you know, rated to whatever specification on the flip side, I,

212
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:06,590
I get it because, you know,

213
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,479
Apple doesn't want to have to deal with returns because

214
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:11,510
somebody bought a 50 cent cable because the reality too is

215
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,460
I don't think the Attackers are going to be doing man

216
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,650
in the middle between say a device and its mothership.

217
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,010
Now, what will happen though,

218
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:22,150
expired domains? Right? Uh There was actually uh

219
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,950
I want to say

220
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,109
-- that a
-- router

221
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,669
one of the

222
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,869
and it had like a it had a, a URL for set up,

223
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,380
still not clear on how you go to a random URL to set up your local router but whatever.

224
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:34,359
Um

225
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,510
And yeah, Benoy

226
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,739
lapsed. Oops.

227
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,919
Uh so if you know, a bad guy had registered it and like done a site,

228
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,669
scrape of the other site, I mean,

229
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,539
yeah, you know,

230
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,799
uh they could have harvested all these routers essentially taken control of them.

231
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,859
And, and so this is part of the problem and I think we,

232
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,419
we like to disregard

233
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,419
man in the middle attacks right now

234
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,049
just because let's face it man in the middle is really hard to do today.

235
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:00,940
But

236
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:06,460
as more and more of these devices start doing more and more things,

237
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:08,739
it it may become more plausible

238
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,830
because let's face it if you can take

239
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,159
over someone's wi fi hairbrush and start spamming,

240
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,500
you know, the internal network and pretending you're the router now and,

241
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,340
and all the other devices start going through.

242
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,890
Now, we have a plausible man in the middle scenario. So I think

243
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,859
today it's impractical, but I,

244
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:28,559
I suspect it could become a significant threat in the future

245
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,700
depending upon how this all evolves.

246
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,750
Well, we've already had a case where it happened with, um, of all things,

247
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,650
Heinz ketchup.

248
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,549
They had a QR code on their bottles going to some contest or recipe or, you know,

249
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,289
some site like that.

250
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,349
We'll have it in the show notes,

251
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,080
uh the domain laps.

252
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,830
So some porn spammer bought it and, you know, Voila,

253
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,260
you got little kids pointing their parents' phones at a bottle of ketchup.

254
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,559
And

255
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,190
yeah, anyways,

256
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,039
so I, I personally have actually, uh,

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,919
there's a, there's a project called CWE the Common Weakness Enumeration database,

258
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:02,520
I want to say.

259
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,919
And so the idea is to catalog all the vulnerability types that we have like buffer,

260
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,590
overflow, buffer, underflow, buffer,

261
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:12,239
overread all these things and how they're different and have examples and you know,

262
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,559
information about them

263
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,919
and I've, um, they're revamping it and looking at some new ones and,

264
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:18,940
and one of the ones I proposed actually was

265
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,960
the domain name expired lapsed or was otherwise

266
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,369
let go. Right. And that's a problem now, right?

267
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,770
Like these routers had like printed on them,

268
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,409
go to www.something.com to like configure your router.

269
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,989
You, you can't update that short of like sending stickers out to people,

270
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,010
you know, like a QR code on ketchup. You can't

271
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,890
update it like short of pulling the product off shelves or something.

272
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,200
And so this whole domain name thing drives me nuts because it's, you know,

273
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,049
it's not hard to, like, not let domain names lap.

274
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,719
-- No, no, no,
-- no, you,

275
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,890
it's very hard because the problem is in any moderately sized organization,

276
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,830
there's probably a group

277
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,059
that buys domain names and

278
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:05,020
they do it for a reason because they don't want every employee,

279
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,489
you know, yanking out the credit card and all of a sudden the company has, you know,

280
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,890
12,000 domains.

281
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,380
And so there's probably some process in place.

282
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,539
And the problem is that the the organization that printed the QR

283
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:17,940
codes didn't properly communicate with the

284
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,260
organization that purchased the domain,

285
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,059
right?

286
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,179
I totally see how this can happen.

287
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,179
I think, you know,

288
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,169
ideally they should be like using like a domain

289
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,770
shortener dot whatever their top level domain is,

290
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,289
you know, point to that because they'll always control that.

291
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:35,830
But yeah, like you have these yahoos go out and like go out and buy

292
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,349
whatever domain for whatever thing. But

293
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,270
anyway, so

294
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,950
I think man in the middle, here's the thing.

295
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,890
The thing to remember about man in the middle is

296
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,500
for a target attack, it makes sense, but for a mass attack,

297
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,229
it's a total pain in the butt

298
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,169
unless

299
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,659
you can redirect a whole bunch of people to you

300
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,219
right by, for example,

301
00:12:55,229 --> 00:13:00,080
grabbing an expired domain or uh what's happened in the past is people have grabbed

302
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,690
um there were all those hacks taking place with people grabbing unused IP space,

303
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,169
remember?

304
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,750
And so essentially like, ok, so the way the internet works, uh, well,

305
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
one of the ways it works,

306
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,969
you have IP addresses, right?

307
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:15,859
And there's these big blocks and some of them belong to organizations that,

308
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,450
for example, have gone bankrupt and just ceased to exist.

309
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,380
And these people then impersonate these organizations and say, oh, I, I am old

310
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,140
company.com or whatever.

311
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:27,799
Uh We haven't talked to you in a long time, but we're totally fine.

312
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,330
And by the way, could you please,

313
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:33,340
you know, transfer ownership of these IP addresses over to

314
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,299
Bob at evil.com or whatever.

315
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:41,960
Um You know, and then they can potentially redirect a whole bunch of traffic that is,

316
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,460
you know, still pointing there or whatever.

317
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,369
Um So I think this domain name thing is going to become a big problem.

318
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,289
Just don't like the man in the middle thing works best.

319
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,479
I think this is why state level Attackers use it, right?

320
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:55,640
Is because they can do it up like the ISP level, right?

321
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,890
They can go to the local National ISP and be like

322
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,440
redirect www.facebook.com to like our site or else?

323
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:04,280
Sure.

324
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,859
The thing I'm kind of wondering is what other

326
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:09,669
ways than say domain name expires and stuff?

327
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,010
Are people going to use to redirect these massive blocks of traffic? And

328
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,960
actually this leads to

329
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,559
another topic

330
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,929
uh related that was in the uh the show notes today.

331
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:27,849
So yeah, there's the, the showdown NTP abuse where they stole a bunch of,

332
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,650
I shouldn't say they stole. It's this one's complicated. Really, isn't it?

333
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:36,630
So there's this idea of these pools of servers, right?

334
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,320
So there's like a pool of NTP servers for

335
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,010
-- um
-- Well, there's np.org which is

336
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,669
kind of the special pool because some, I mean,

337
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,169
some organizations like Microsoft runs their own NTP POOL.

338
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,390
They don't trust the public NTP servers for the reasons we're going to get to in just

339
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:55,520
a

340
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:55,929
moment.

341
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,750
So yeah, there's these public pools, for example,

342
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,809
for various operating systems like Debian Linux or Fedora Linux or whatever.

343
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,250
Well, they all basically use the same pool. Now it's just NTP pool.ntp.org.

344
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,619
I mean, it used to be, there were separate pools for various like distributions and,

345
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,229
and operating systems, but these days it's pretty much all the same.

346
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:15,950
Yeah.

347
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:21,270
Um they, they still have that layer of abstraction in, in case one of them goes crazy.

348
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,030
But anyways

349
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:26,239
so long story short, there's NTP servers that people run

350
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,229
and these are nice people

351
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,039
and they can, if they're super nice, say, hey,

352
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,609
I would like to be part of this NTP pool and

353
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,479
provide my services for free online because I'm just so nice,

354
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,140
right? And you know, it's, it's a wonderful public service.

355
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,909
A lot of people do these things. Um

356
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:42,940
So Showen

357
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:46,750
which is a database of devices on the internet

358
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,099
essentially with I PV version four.

359
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,400
It's very simple. You have two to the 32 addresses. It's about 4 billion addresses

360
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,789
with a modern scanning engine like Z

361
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:57,320
map

362
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,229
or uh mass scan.

363
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:05,030
You can basically scan the entire internet for say port 80 or port 443 or

364
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:08,590
-- whatever in like 10 to 15 minutes.
-- It's ridiculous now.

365
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,200
Yeah, it's

366
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,590
because you can like rent an Amazon web server or something with

367
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:15,020
so much bandwidth that you can just do this in 1015 minutes.

368
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,140
And

369
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,229
I remember when those dudes in the nineties did this like for the first time and they,

370
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,799
they sold a map.

371
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:19,934
I

372
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,304
I bought the poster.

373
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,614
I had it hanging on my wall for a long time and it was like,

374
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:28,765
it was crazy to think about someone scanning the whole internet, right?

375
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:29,335
And

376
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,215
it took them like weeks

377
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,284
and yeah, now it's 10 to,

378
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:39,575
but with I PV version six, you have two to the 128th addresses, which is like,

379
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:39,914
what is that?

380
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,655
More particles than in the whole

381
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,695
everything. A lot of addresses.

382
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,614
I think someone once told me that you could

383
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,375
give every six inch square on the planet Earth

384
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,880
-- its own IP address with I PV six.
-- I think it was a lot more than that.

385
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,719
It might be.

386
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:59,559
But uh regardless. So with I PV version six, you just can't

387
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,780
scan everything

388
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:01,280
yet.

389
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah,

390
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,160
give it time. That's true.

391
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,680
So here's the question.

392
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,589
How do you get a list of I PV six addresses that you can then scan and tell people like,

393
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,060
hey there this router or there's this port open or whatever.

394
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,589
Well, if I was a smart guy,

395
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,150
I would think about maybe running some sort of

396
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,020
service that many of these devices would connect to periodically

397
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,189
and maybe query some sort of information such as accurate time.

398
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:28,949
Yeah,

399
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,910
and NDP is a perfect example of this because

400
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,199
it's automatic. It is the one service that most operating systems.

401
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:41,500
Well, most devices let's face it like, like anything that connects to the internet,

402
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,500
the vast majority of it will query pool.ntp.org, right?

403
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,150
Like routers, like hairbrushes, whatever toasters TV. S they're all gonna use it.

404
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,900
And so what happens is if you end up using the showdown NTP server,

405
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,979
you get scanned by them like a few seconds or a few minutes later,

406
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,020
right? And you know, just a port scan.

407
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,469
And so what's really fascinating to me is about

408
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,550
it was last year somebody pointed this out

409
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,520
and nothing happened as far as I know

410
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,719
what is going to happen. I mean,

411
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,109
are they

412
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:14,689
doing the

413
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,449
pool?

414
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,160
-- Did they? I don't know
-- they didn't. That's what I mean, nothing happened.

415
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,530
They

416
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:23,819
do, they know which ones are showdown servers.

417
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,670
So they were using a showdown dot IO like the

418
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,699
actual NTP server they were hosting had their showdown dot IO

419
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,579
-- domain name attached to it.
-- So they weren't really, I mean,

420
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,709
they weren't being sneaky. Right.

421
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:39,140
They were, they were basically not pretending they weren't themselves.

422
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:42,770
Yeah. And then you would get scanned by Rock dot Scan six dot Show

423
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:43,630
dot IO.

424
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,800
-- I,
-- well, let's face it as well is

425
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,339
you can't hide behind

426
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,959
I PV six and pretend that you're safe because

427
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,699
while it's not practical to scan it today,

428
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,640
it's gonna be practical to scan it someday.

429
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,459
The reality is if your, if your device is online,

430
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:03,780
it's somebody's going to poke it at some point

431
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,780
and then they're gonna scan it.

432
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,300
And, you know,

433
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,530
if you have like a remote administrative service open with

434
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,800
no password uh or like a password of 1234.

435
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,260
-- Yeah, you're probably gonna have a bad time,
-- right?

436
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:17,300
And that's kind of the lesson, right?

437
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,349
Is that I PV six doesn't give us any added security.

438
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:21,599
I mean,

439
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,819
it does make showdown's life harder as they try to catalog the entire internet.

440
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:31,410
But fundamentally, if you think you're more secure because of I PV six,

441
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,319
you are going to have a bad time.

442
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,630
In theory. Actually, I PV six makes she's

443
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,810
life a lot easier

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,180
because end points are connected directly to the internet.

445
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:46,170
One of the dirty little secrets is with I PV four network address translation

446
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,229
-- NT has become a fact of life
-- because

447
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,969
you should have a firewall man.

448
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:56,439
I mean, like my router firewalls, my I PV six gift stuff correctly,

449
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,079
which I was very certain to test

450
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:01,800
because I know it can go horribly wrong.

451
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,430
Stupid question. What happens when you have an I PV six device, like a light bulb that

452
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,510
can't be firewalled without breaking.

453
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,550
What do you mean it can't be fired with it?

454
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,709
For the sake of argument.

455
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:15,140
You can't firewall it, say for incoming connections because of some

456
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,910
stupid way they wrote the software,

457
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,189
don't use it.

458
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:18,670
Yeah.

459
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,000
Well,

460
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,140
and that's going to work for your normal people buying this stuff

461
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,229
-- from
-- Lowe's normal people can enable incoming traffic on their fire.

462
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,949
-- Well, they're not going to want it to,
-- right?

463
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,630
But that's, that's my point. Basically

464
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:32,540
a long term I PV 61 of the,

465
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,000
one of the goals of I PV six is to encourage end to end connectivity without, you know,

466
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,410
network address translation,

467
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,520
right?

468
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,869
And that ultimately will make sure everything is online,

469
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,000
including your hairbrush, your your blue.

470
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,400
You know,

471
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,250
that's what got me was these light bulbs

472
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,439
at Lowe's were Bluetooth enabled with mesh networking,

473
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,540
not Wi Fi.

474
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,030
-- So Bluetooth, which
-- Bluetooth mesh or one of the other

475
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,900
-- IOT style network
-- specifically said Bluetooth mesh.

476
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:01,979
I

477
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:03,589
wonder if that's a thing.

478
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,020
Well, stupid thing.

479
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,900
If I have to build Bluetooth into a light bulb anyways to talk to your phone,

480
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,020
why not just do the mesh networking over Bluetooth?

481
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,280
I don't

482
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:12,689
know

483
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,400
enough about this to say if it's a practical thing to do.

484
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,000
Well,

485
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,900
Bluetooth is a very device to device networking

486
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,780
protocol though it's not like a lot of

487
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,520
these mesh networking protocols are designed for more

488
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,469
of the kind of Wild West style,

489
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:30,359
just throw data into the air and something else will send it along.

490
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,170
I just checked uh Bluetooth,

491
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:33,589
Bluetooth

492
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,079
special interest group has a

493
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,770
technology road map for mesh networking, for

494
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,300
faster mesh networking. Sorry.

495
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,859
So they already have mesh networking now. They want it to be faster.

496
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,239
So yeah, that's the thing. Well, and it makes sense, right?

497
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,050
Like why would I want two communication protocols built into a device?

498
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,900
Well, it's two chips as well and two chips cost twice as much as one

499
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,359
and power consumption.

500
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:58,599
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, that's true.

501
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,040
And Bluetooth, that's a pretty nice job of low power these days.

502
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,670
-- I'm pleased with
-- it.

503
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,630
Yeah. And it's, you know, 240 ft range.

504
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,339
Yep. Yeah.

505
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah. Nice and far. That's good. That light bulb can see the garage that way.

506
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:13,189
So,

507
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:16,089
until it starts arguing with your door knobs.

508
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,300
-- Give it time, man. Give it time. It's the,
-- I am seriously predicting.

509
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:25,560
Ok. I'm gonna make a prediction for not for 2017 for the next five years.

510
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:26,020
At

511
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,040
some point

512
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,150
we're going to see some form of therapy

513
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,170
counseling slash network fixing

514
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,520
for mesh networking when like your light

515
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,709
bulbs stop getting along with your doorknob.

516
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,099
-- So
-- like

517
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,489
one of your

518
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,209
depressed,

519
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,810
-- well, there just doesn't want to talk to them.
-- Maybe they called it a name.

520
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,079
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,500
Um, or oh,

522
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:52,250
or a vendor blacklisted it. Right. Remember. Uh,

523
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,530
-- so actually
-- a

524
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:58,680
vendor blacklist, a light bulb and we send in a therapist to talk to it about it.

525
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:02,119
I predict that this will happen and it will probably be

526
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:06,770
-- itself A I backed with maybe Amazon mechanical Turks to handle the
-- hard case

527
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,430
mechanical Turks. No way. This is, this is all Alexa,

528
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:10,510
right? Like Alexa,

529
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,619
please go tell the doorknob that everything's ok.

530
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,469
Right. And then, then it can buy a doll house on the way. Right.

531
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,040
Yeah.

532
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,260
But I mean, you know, like if,

533
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,420
if you think that all these like look at the current problems we have with networks,

534
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,880
right?

535
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,420
Like why do people think that's going to be

536
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,359
any different than with the IOT?

537
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,619
It will be

538
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,300
worse because you're gonna have a million devices.

539
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:42,020
Well, it's not even about the buttons. I mean, buttons are relevant.

540
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,099
It's more the idea of le let's face it.

541
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:50,400
Most houses or most residences will say probably have what,

542
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,540
10 to 20 devices talking to Wi Fi today.

543
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,939
And if you live in an area that isn't the middle of freaking nowhere,

544
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,699
the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum is unusable. Right?

545
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,719
-- Oh, yeah.
-- No, I had to II I

546
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,859
still have a 2.4 gigahertz network for older devices but

547
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:09,770
everything

548
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:10,729
gigahertz

549
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:10,910
because

550
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,599
I think one of my neighbors

551
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,569
must have a bad microwave or it's just the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.

552
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,790
Is that saturated for like the surrounding two. No,

553
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,810
it's not. The

554
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,500
microwaves operate in the five gigahertz range. For what do

555
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:24,859
they,

556
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:26,160
yeah, they, they're pretty high,

557
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,380
but more importantly is

558
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,189
the 2.4 gigahertz range is just so filled with garbage. Now.

559
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,660
I mean, you got to think everything from Bluetooth

560
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,780
to the, the wireless phones, like, like the,

561
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:39,449
the non

562
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,300
wired telephone I have, right? Like my, my, yeah, deck. That's it.

563
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:43,989
Uh,

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,280
like all this stuff is sitting in the 2.4 gigahertz

565
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:51,300
range plus the fact that like I can see 20 networks

566
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:52,810
all around me.

567
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,869
It's crazy. So actually funny enough is there's a hotel

568
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,589
I find myself at more often than not

569
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,439
and

570
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:06,560
they w whatever setup they have in the hotel for Wi Fi literally every

571
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:11,760
channel in the 2.4 gigahertz range is in use by one of their networks.

572
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:15,579
And so, and it's not even like the 1611 type set up.

573
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:18,280
No, no, every freaking channel has some

574
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,319
things sitting on it and you like, I've got my little Hutu

575
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:24,560
device that I like to carry with me and, and set up my own little network.

576
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,339
It does not work because there is so much noise.

577
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:27,599
I

578
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:31,290
feel like somebody should explain how these wireless networks actually

579
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,849
overlap and work they're using.

580
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:34,140
Well,

581
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:34,339
I

582
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:34,609
have no

583
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,130
idea

584
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,030
if anybody's using anything but 16 and 11

585
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,250
outside of France.

586
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,540
-- But
-- the thing is most of this gear picks its own, uh, uh, network.

587
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,699
I've only ever seen stuff, pick 16 or 11.

588
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:47,599
I, I

589
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,670
-- bet stuff, picks
-- lots of

590
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:50,689
dumb stuff

591
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:50,869
out

592
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,030
there.

593
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,099
I guarantee there's,

594
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,660
I know there's, well, this isn't even that. Right.

595
00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:00,300
This is clearly something was set up to literally pick every single network ID,

596
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,579
every one of them in the wireless channels. And so it's madness.

597
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,130
But, but so here's the point though, right, here's the point is

598
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,599
everything is getting Wi Fi

599
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,520
and the IOT is on fire,

600
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:13,439
but

601
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:16,310
it's, it's a madhouse as well, like

602
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,660
nobody's in charge. And so it's just crazy

603
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,979
when you look at everything going on and, and

604
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,420
anyone can basically do whatever they want.

605
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:30,060
The only ray of hope I can think of is directional antennas. However, having

606
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,739
-- said that that's
-- not a ray of hope,

607
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,339
it's literally a ray, we just can't see it.

608
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,920
But

609
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:35,599
no,

610
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,010
I was just gonna say that doesn't work with a lot of

611
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,900
the IOT because a lot of the IOT moves like a hairbrush.

612
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,310
Right. Right.

613
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,890
Like, like traditional network devices tend to be like physically static, right?

614
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,939
Like they sit on your desk or it's a Wi

615
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,329
Fi access point or it's, you know, whatever, right?

616
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:55,949
Your TV, your apple TV, that like is staple to the wall.

617
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,430
But like that's the thing, right?

618
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,500
A lot of the IOT is about, you know,

619
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,010
these are things that are moving around or like sitting in your pocket or like your,

620
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,339
uh, what you might call it, your Fitbit thing, you know, monitoring your

621
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,530
steps and your, how many, uh, what

622
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:10,579
call it, how many stairs you climb up and down.

623
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:10,949
Yeah.

624
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,500
And so, you know, here's like, yeah, I mean,

625
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,939
those things are just gonna spam all over the place and, and that even,

626
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,199
well,

627
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:20,449
that assumes that you even have space to put a proper antenna on that poor thing.

628
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,010
Right.

629
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,380
Um,

630
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,650
I kind of really want to take one of

631
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,540
those hairbrushes apart and see what's inside of it,

632
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,280
-- you know? No, seriously. Right. Like is it like a chip? Is it a board? Is
-- it,

633
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,000
it's not a board, it's probably a battery in, in a sock?

634
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:33,479
I mean,

635
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:37,439
that's what it's gonna be and I imagine it probably has minimal storage space.

636
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:38,280
Oh uh

637
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:43,479
sock for those of you that didn't capture it. Si think he meant system on a chip.

638
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:44,229
Not natural,

639
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:49,050
-- not an act battery in a sock.
-- Uh That would work too. You could hit someone with it.

640
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,369
That was actually my first mental image.

641
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,569
Uh Yeah, that, that was not mine.

642
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,219
I mean, five gigahertz is the future, I guess.

643
00:27:57,229 --> 00:28:00,050
-- And then
-- followed by it doesn't matter because five gigahertz is

644
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,239
gonna get full of crap too in the near future.

645
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,209
I mean, that's just the reality of it doesn't matter where we put this stuff,

646
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,250
it's gonna, there's,

647
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,119
there's just gonna be so much junk using Wi Fi that Wi Fi is going to become unusable.

648
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,239
The good news is we're talking

649
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,603
about 60 gigahertz spectrum long term

650
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:21,662
-- and that will give us enough bandwidth and spectrum
-- to until we use it all.

651
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,633
-- Well,
-- yeah, fair enough like

652
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,483
um I've heard people talk about what's called like smart dust.

653
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,442
So the the idea being that you literally get a

654
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:33,753
computer and sensor package and battery package and solar panel package

655
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:38,776
so small that it fits into like a speck of uh uh like a speck of sand essentially.

656
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:42,196
And then you can do things like just like mix it into concrete and like

657
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:45,676
certain percentage of them will be on the top of the concrete and they can

658
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,576
report how worn down that piece of concrete is.

659
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,975
So like for a road or a sidewalk, right? Like

660
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:54,326
the idea being that these computers and sensors and wi fi networks

661
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:57,115
and solar panels and everything get so cheap that we basically,

662
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,316
you know, spend like, I don't know, like a buck a kilogram on them, right?

663
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,755
And just have millions of them

664
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,209
and put them in everything or whatever, you know,

665
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,609
like put them in your food and they take

666
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,839
pictures of your intestines as they roll through whatever

667
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,319
-- sounds fantastic.
-- It's already happened. You can buy

668
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:11,790
a

669
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,969
that's a camera and it will,

670
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,030
it takes pictures of your intestines every like 10 seconds of

671
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:18,020
I've

672
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,599
heard of these

673
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,770
in the medical community. But can I as a consumer acquire one of these.

674
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,319
What does Amazon say?

675
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:27,939
Amazon

676
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,089
-- says yes,
-- Alexa

677
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,810
buy me a pill to watch my poop.

678
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:34,430
-- It's called a
-- pill cam colon procedure.

679
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:34,959
-- A
-- pill

680
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,030
cam colon procedure.

681
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,130
You can go buy one.

682
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,890
I love it.

683
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,670
I love it. We live in the future, Kurt. This is why everything should have Wi Fi

684
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,589
right here.

685
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,219
It comes with a double camera. I just looked it up. That's great.

686
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:51,189
So you can see where it's going and where it's been.

687
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,959
-- Well, that makes sense.
-- Of course it does, does it have Wi Fi though?

688
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:55,689
If it doesn't have Wi

689
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,290
Fi, I'm not

690
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,829
interested,

691
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,959
you know why it doesn't have Wi

692
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,170
Fi power source, but as soon as it can consume.

693
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:01,170
That's

694
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:01,619
-- true.
-- And,

695
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,790
and here's the beauty,

696
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,400
there are medical devices that can consume glucose as their energy source already.

697
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:12,410
But then it's going to become self aware and it's going to control me. Right.

698
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,439
It's, I've seen enough

699
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,680
the difference.

700
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,790
I, it would probably be a better life.

701
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,780
I don't have to make decisions anymore. Everything would be great.

702
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:26,280
Well, you would just, it would be like that. Uh oh, what is that thing in, in cat

703
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,880
feces, the toxoplasmosis, whatever

704
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:32,359
that essentially makes us think that we're like happy and joyful.

705
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:33,609
It's just, we're like being

706
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,209
-- turned
-- you into a crazy cat person.

707
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,469
Well, basically, yeah, I mean,

708
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:38,209
to be

709
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,359
-- what you are right. You've got what, like four cats or something
-- I have, I have No,

710
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:43,520
no cats.

711
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:44,810
Yeah. No.

712
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:45,829
Um, no, my, uh,

713
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,349
one of my cats went to a friend's place and then my other

714
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,739
cat went to my parents where she hangs out with my sister's cat.

715
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:59,150
-- I see. I see. So you had a zero can household?
-- Yeah, I have no pets. No cats. No carpets.

716
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,260
-- Nothing. It's quite nice. It's very dust and hair
-- free.

717
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,349
Uh, yeah, that's the worst part of on animals is all the hair,

718
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,660
which I guess soon we'll just have IOT vacuum

719
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,930
cleaners that will take care of that for us,

720
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,699
which I guess you can kind of get, you've got the roombas or the I

721
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:15,239
robots or whatever the heck they're called.

722
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:20,050
-- There
-- are, I have seen a video of a cat being vacuumed and the cat did enjoy it.

723
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,579
I, the cat I used to own did not enjoy that.

724
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,189
-- So
-- you vacuumed your cat.

725
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,310
I tried to vacuum the cat. It didn't work. It was a very hairy cat

726
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,589
and, and my dog for the record also didn't wanna be vacuumed.

727
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,530
You've just reminded me of a very important

728
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,339
point and something we forget about a lot,

729
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:45,589
especially when we start talking about putting wifi on every device on the planet

730
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:46,219
is

731
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,880
even if this stuff has it. What is the actual threat? Like, what's the

732
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:55,540
threat surface or? I'm sorry, what is the attack surface

733
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,800
of this device and of the

734
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,839
environment it exists in

735
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,479
and for like a hairbrush,

736
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,400
it's probably pretty low and I doubt there's

737
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,310
really anything serious that can go wrong.

738
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:05,640
But

739
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,170
yeah, whatever I

740
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:08,770
still

741
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,119
maintain

742
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,349
vs

743
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,560
has no monetary value.

744
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:13,430
The people

745
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,479
they're gonna find something else to do with, with all this crap. But

746
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,459
ok, so let's,

747
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,349
and, and

748
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,069
Botnet

749
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,050
is,

750
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,510
is the thing, right?

751
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:25,430
Botnets are bad. Ok,

752
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:31,939
I get that. But most of this stuff is going to be behind a firewall. And so a Botnet is

753
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,790
a much lower problem on the scale of what could go wrong.

754
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,569
Right.

755
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,859
Largely it's,

756
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,979
it's for me, what my concern is, is somebody,

757
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:45,540
you know, if you told me about ransomware 10 years ago, I would have laughed,

758
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,709
but now it's like, oh

759
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,760
two years ago, we laughed

760
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:49,079
that

761
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,109
funny anymore.

762
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:50,540
Yeah.

763
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,660
And, and my concern is, you know, yeah, like you said in the last show,

764
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,569
somebody's going to figure out some new business model involving

765
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:59,099
my devices that I'm not going to be happy about.

766
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,989
Yes. Which I guess so. Here's where I'm going to also bring up that the FTC actually

767
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:10,099
just announced a prize for securing the consumer IOT.

768
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,880
And I think you get like 20 grand

769
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,579
if you submit an idea to them and they like it and they

770
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:18,020
decide it's the winner for securing all these devices in a home.

771
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:18,900
And

772
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:22,199
it, it's a really interesting

773
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,380
and I think correct way to think about this problem

774
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,420
because instead of telling the device makers, you have to do it right.

775
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,540
Which they never will.

776
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,660
They're saying,

777
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:36,180
how can we add a device to the network or how can we do something

778
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:39,560
on the network in the environment to make things better?

779
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:42,880
Which I think is completely the correct way to look at this.

780
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,229
It's interesting actually the, uh, I just checked it's

781
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,400
for automatic iot patching.

782
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:50,560
But what does that mean? Right. I mean, you are

783
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,630
patch devices, right? You aren't gonna patch them. That's,

784
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,010
that's no secret.

785
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,729
The prize plot is up to $25,000 with 3000 available for each honorable mention,

786
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,359
blah, blah, blah.

787
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,550
But

788
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,569
they just talk about

789
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,130
minimal.

790
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,630
Yeah, will help, quote,

791
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,239
help protect consumers from security vulnerabilities caused by out of date.

792
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:09,320
So

793
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,110
that doesn't,

794
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:13,989
that doesn't mean patching, right? That, that doesn't mean a patch.

795
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,000
See, here's my thought, here's my simplest thought

796
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,060
man in the middle device because people who don't patch

797
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,310
their software generally don't do uh SSL or TLS correctly.

798
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:23,820
Well,

799
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,159
haven't you read any of the news about the antivirus

800
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:29,750
man in the middle fiascos that have been going on?

801
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,719
Like anyone who man in the middle stuff,

802
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,000
he

803
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,629
doesn't do it correctly either.

804
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,610
Yeah. Well, ok, so for those of you maybe not familiar with

805
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,320
so many networks,

806
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:44,458
uh and uh especially on financial uh organizations generally speaking, they

807
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,399
want to look at all the network traffic, including encrypted network traffic.

808
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,590
Um So what they do is they have hardware devices running software

809
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,438
that will essentially act as a man in the middle attacker.

810
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,000
And the way they do this simply is they install their own custom root certificate

811
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,790
on the end points like your phone, your desktop, whatever.

812
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,219
So that, you know, when you go to say walmart.com,

813
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,620
the man in the middle device actually talks to walmart.com securely

814
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:14,030
and then talks to you and pretends to be walmart.com.

815
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,479
The problem being that's exactly what state level Attackers do

816
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,469
and that's exactly what a lot of places like Google,

817
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:23,510
Facebook and those guys are exactly trying to prevent,

818
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,070
right.

819
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,300
So they do things like certificate pinning and like a variety of other

820
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,139
mes methods to

821
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,139
prevent these attacks from working. Now,

822
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,770
the majority of browsers,

823
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,080
if you have a custom root certificate installed will

824
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,979
allow that to override things like certificate pinning.

825
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:44,060
I suspect that may change long term because

826
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,889
the reality is the state level Attackers,

827
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,919
you know, they're getting better, they're buying better gear,

828
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,209
they're buying better software.

829
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,209
My personal take on this is if your security posture relies on

830
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,030
behaving in the same way as like a state level attacker,

831
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,709
chances are that's not gonna work long term because it's

832
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,500
going to be something that people block or otherwise well,

833
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,929
essentially secure

834
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,989
so that you're,

835
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,679
it no longer works,

836
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,639
right? And so with these like TLS and SS SSL inspections,

837
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,870
yeah, with an out of date device obviously that will probably work because you know,

838
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,810
these things are not super super secure,

839
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,469
but anything that is reasonably up to date or, you know,

840
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,320
you buy in five years and rightly so probably

841
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,949
freak out when it sees the network doing that.

842
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:28,300
Now. You know, what exactly can an IOT device do to freak out?

843
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, actually that's a good question. Right.

844
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,929
Unless you register an email address with it,

845
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:33,030
I would,

846
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,310
I would bet you that the vast majority of

847
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,550
these devices aren't going to do proper certificate checking.

848
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:42,320
And so you can probably man in the middle of them quite easily.

849
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,129
But I still think that fundamentally, I

850
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,479
if you're a man in the middling someone,

851
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:51,510
you're probably at best making a lateral moves for security,

852
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,550
you aren't making it better and you're probably making it worse,

853
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,340
right? I mean, that's just the reality of that situation.

854
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,590
You're ticking off a check box

855
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,139
that says, yeah, we can see all network traffic on our network

856
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,949
in some cases. That's exactly what it is.

857
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:11,550
And I'm also not going to say that compliant security is a bad thing. It has its place.

858
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,469
I, I wrote a blog post about this a while back where

859
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,750
if you think about security as no security, compliance,

860
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,070
security and real security,

861
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,510
real security is really expensive and hard to justify compliant security is

862
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,360
kind of in the middle where some of it makes sense.

863
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,090
Some of it doesn't.

864
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,110
But if you don't do it, you don't get to exist in the business world.

865
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,290
And so people are willing to do compliance security

866
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,739
is what we need to do is do a better job of making sure that the compliant

867
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:39,949
security that is mandated is meaningful and works as

868
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:42,550
opposed to check the box because we said so

869
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,719
I agree.

870
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,080
And I think part of the problem there though is,

871
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,510
is no matter what set of rules you come up for with compliance, security

872
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,360
people will,

873
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:53,560
there's always some group of people or companies that will think

874
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,120
it's cheaper to game the system than to do it properly.

875
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:59,429
But that's ok. That means they've made that risk decision

876
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:02,159
and if they want to game it, that's fine.

877
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,750
But it's on behalf of somebody else, potentially like me,

878
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,479
the poor schmuck buying their product.

879
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,600
Maybe. I mean,

880
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,040
well, that's the case with IOT. Right. That's the problem with IOT is

881
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:13,830
I'm buying stuff.

882
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,389
It's not like I can update this or,

883
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,790
-- you know,
-- we, we know the IOT gear is garbage. Right. We just know it is.

884
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,110
And so

885
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:27,790
right now I think that's kind of acceptable and in fact, I don't even know

886
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:31,729
anybody regardless of technical skill level who thinks

887
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:34,060
any of this IOT stuff is secure.

888
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,189
They're buying, they know it's crap but they think it's neat.

889
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,790
So they hook it up to their network.

890
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,570
Well, I, I'm actually gonna go in further and this might offend you,

891
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,510
but I'm ok with this stuff being garbage

892
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:50,080
because quite frankly, it, it's gonna last for five or 10 years max part of it is,

893
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,189
I might actually get a real benefit from it.

894
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,010
For example, like my nest smoke alarms or my, uh,

895
00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:00,330
my, my bathroom scale that, like, essentially logs my weight and body fat.

896
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,550
And then I have like a nice,

897
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,899
like, jiggly. Exactly.

898
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,310
Yeah, it shows me this nice wiggly line that's trending up or down

899
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,290
and more to the point, like,

900
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,550
even if it does join Adidas

901
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,129
Botnet or something, it's such a low cost to me.

902
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:21,070
But quite frankly, I don't really care and that's horrible. And I hate that

903
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,100
we, well,

904
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,580
we discussed this a couple episodes ago where we

905
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,590
discussed the the kill switch in IOT devices,

906
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:28,030
right?

907
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,280
But so here's the deal is you're not wrong

908
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,860
in the things you say.

909
00:39:33,209 --> 00:39:35,010
But there's also

910
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:38,500
we need incentives for people in manufacturers

911
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,820
to do the right thing because I'll use

912
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,709
le let's pick on public health, right? Where

913
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,860
you can't sell expired food,

914
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,439
you know, you can't sell known bad food

915
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:55,439
is a great example here where

916
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,979
there are certain public health rules that must be followed

917
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:04,149
and if you don't, you're going to get in trouble. And as a consumer,

918
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,120
you,

919
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,899
you care enough because let's face it, man.

920
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,040
Would you buy expired fish that looked rotten

921
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,550
personally? Right?

922
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:16,860
Nobody would. Let's face it. Right.

923
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,020
There's

924
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,739
there,

925
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,879
there's levels to this because one of one of my favorite pastimes actually is,

926
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,419
is my wife is horrified by this.

927
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:23,659
But

928
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:28,159
when I find something in the fridge that's like, well past its its use by date,

929
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,879
like I'm gonna eat some of that and see what

930
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,510
happens and I never get sick for what it's worth.

931
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,280
Uh I never do

932
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,939
the bread that we buy in North America.

933
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:39,830
-- At least that lasts like what, two weeks out on the shelf
-- more than that man.

934
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,169
So I actually,

935
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,530
some time back I wanted to teach my kids about mold.

936
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,149
And I said here,

937
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,979
let's just put a piece of bread in this plastic baggie and put it on the window sill

938
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,000
and after like a month, it was still a piece of bread.

939
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,129
And I'm like, sorry guys store bread. Let's eat this, you know.

940
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:01,270
Yeah, there's actually an Australian chain of bakeries here called Cobb's Bread.

941
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,639
And they have to put stickers on their thing and they, they tell you

942
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,330
like, you have to eat this bread within 2 to 3 days or it will go bad.

943
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,989
And I'm like, well, duh, of course it will. And she's like,

944
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,739
I'm like, wait, do you do people not know this?

945
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,050
And she's like, yeah, no, people don't. They come back and complain.

946
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:21,530
I, yeah, I didn't realize how long it would last. And, and for what it's worth.

947
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,889
I love making bread. It's one of my favorite things to do.

948
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,209
So I'm, I'm quite familiar with how real bread works and

949
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,199
how long it doesn't last,

950
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,239
which is also crazy when you think about it because, I mean, back in the day

951
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:37,330
that's why people made bread every day because you had to make it every day.

952
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,300
And also if you had food, you would eat it because,

953
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,090
like, what else would you do with food? Right.

954
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,870
I don't know. You let it go bad and throw it away.

955
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,510
That's what, that's what we're gonna do with it.

956
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:48,590
Yeah. Well, and that kind of leads us back to the IOT, right?

957
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,149
If we're at that stage of the IOT where let's make stuff

958
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,429
and throw it away.

959
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,830
-- Like, let's see if it works or doesn't work, but we
-- don't throw it away.

960
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,260
I mean,

961
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,179
think about how many tablets are out there that

962
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:04,030
are running versions of android that are so old.

963
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,429
It hurts to think about.

964
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,870
I remember this guy who put his son five workstation online

965
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,669
and

966
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:11,989
let it get attacked.

967
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,699
He actually advertised it and like,

968
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:16,189
nobody knew what to do with it because it was so old.

969
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,020
All

970
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:20,209
I don't know if OK, now this is going back a ways.

971
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,310
-- You're going to remember this root
-- shell.

972
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,370
Oh man, root

973
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,300
shell. I remember that.

974
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,189
How

975
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,590
long ago did that die?

976
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,169
-- Is
-- it dead? I don't

977
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,429
-- know,
-- dude, root shell went away. Like

978
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,659
uh because I used to use it like on a weekly basis.

979
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,239
Shell technologies.

980
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,840
No, it's, that's not them.

981
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,080
Uh It's also two R's.

982
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,370
Um But Roel

983
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:40,770
D

984
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,370
used to be.

985
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,610
-- Yeah,
-- don't click that you can

986
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,209
read.

987
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,020
I can't.

988
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:46,620
Yeah.

989
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,449
So, um rel.org, I think it was.org or maybe.net.

990
00:42:51,129 --> 00:42:53,629
It was like, it was essentially this collection, a

991
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,719
curated collection. No less of exploits. Kind of like Packet Storm.

992
00:42:57,729 --> 00:42:58,919
-- It was a
-- very nice

993
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:02,469
list. Oh, it was very well done and you know, it went away.

994
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,080
And so here's the reality, right? If you want to find an exploit for, say

995
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,580
they say, oh, hey, here's Windows 95 21 22 years old now.

996
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,860
Good luck finding that, right? Like Google hopefully can find it. But,

997
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,500
you know, fundamentally, I mean,

998
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,639
there used to be so many exploits running around for these things,

999
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:21,669
but they've all disappeared off the internet, you know,

1000
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,580
-- due to Bit Rod or
-- whatever they might be on archive.org.

1001
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:25,600
Uh

1002
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,090
Well, well, but, ok, so here's the thing is

1003
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,659
you are correct

1004
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:33,979
about things like root shell from back in the day.

1005
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,229
And in fact, the root shell website is in archive.org,

1006
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,389
but I don't think the exploits are.

1007
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:39,120
But whatever,

1008
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,399
here's the thing though is

1009
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,750
we didn't have git back then. We didn't have github

1010
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:46,739
back then. We didn't have metas

1011
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,750
back then.

1012
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,169
Thanks to something like

1013
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:54,270
metas, you're going to be able to exploit basically anything produced

1014
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,750
in the last 10 years well into the

1015
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,830
future because those exploits will never go anywhere.

1016
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,340
And even if they take them out of the G

1017
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:01,989
repo,

1018
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,429
there's still the history.

1019
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,260
So I guess the solution then is to use Windows 95 for all of our IOT devices.

1020
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,439
-- With
-- that is totally the solution.

1021
00:44:12,729 --> 00:44:13,340
Yes.

1022
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,689
-- Yes. That's right.
-- I

1023
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:17,879
-- think we fixed it.
-- You heard it here, folks? Windows 95.

1024
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,520
I want the 25 grand

1025
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:21,790
or whatever the prize is.

1026
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,149
Yeah, you tell that to the F I want you to submit this to the FTC.

1027
00:44:25,169 --> 00:44:26,800
And I want to see what happens.

1028
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,360
I suspect they hit the uh the delete key.

1029
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:32,000
I would hope so.

1030
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,399
It's yes.

1031
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,729
Anyway,

1032
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,790
but I guess at the same time. All right.

1033
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,449
So it,

1034
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:39,520
this is just such a weird problem and we don't

1035
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,370
have a very good analogy for any of this yet.

1036
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:41,719
But

1037
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,919
it, it almost reminds me as well of

1038
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,959
if I look at Roku,

1039
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:48,979
I'm gonna pick on these guys. Well, I'm not gonna pick on

1040
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,060
Roku

1041
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,750
is a company that makes like one of those little boxes you plug

1042
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,120
into your TV and you can watch like Netflix or Amazon or whatever.

1043
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,439
-- Really? That's a shame. I really like
-- my Roku.

1044
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,270
-- I, now that I think about it, I've heard about them, but never.
-- So

1045
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:04,860
here's the deal is the TV.

1046
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,729
I have actually, I bought a TV with Roku in it because I like Roku so much.

1047
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,600
That was actually one of the things I was looking for

1048
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:13,080
and I have a Roku that is

1049
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:14,879
freaking ancient.

1050
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,060
I mean, I've had it for, I bet more than five years and it still gets software updates,

1051
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,479
I mean.

1052
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,189
Right. So

1053
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,449
that,

1054
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,739
yeah, seriously.

1055
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,510
-- Are they just
-- backwards compatible? Hardware wise?

1056
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,280
I have no idea what they do or something.

1057
00:45:28,419 --> 00:45:32,610
I'm not. Well, in part of it too though, like, let's, so let's face it, it, it plays

1058
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:38,120
movies. Right. And TV, it doesn't need to be some crazy complex.

1059
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,100
Let's keep it updated to the cutting edge. I mean, let's face it too.

1060
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,459
Like my chromecast is, I bought one of the first generation chromecast.

1061
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:45,689
I still get updates to that.

1062
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:47,250
-- You know,
-- I thought

1063
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,350
what about a device or a series of devices that get software updates.

1064
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,620
But for example, the older devices get, you know,

1065
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,469
limited updates with maybe only core functions.

1066
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:57,189
Here's the,

1067
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,090
here's the deal,

1068
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,889
ignoring this, ignoring that idea because you're not wrong, but

1069
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:05,510
there are always going to be companies that make good stuff and

1070
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,489
take care of it and there's gonna be companies that it,

1071
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,489
it's just garbage.

1072
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,340
And that's not unlike today when you buy basically any product

1073
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:13,500
because

1074
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,780
literally any product on the market,

1075
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,620
there are good ones and there are garbage ones and I know when I buy the garbage one,

1076
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:22,159
that thing's gonna fall apart in like two months.

1077
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:25,870
But I'm making the decision that I would rather spend $5 on this

1078
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:29,330
piece of crap instead of $20 on something that I'm gonna die with.

1079
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,179
You know.

1080
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,520
-- Well,
-- and part of the challenge though, especially with the IOT is well, twofold,

1081
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,419
number one, there's a lot of new players in the market that have no track record.

1082
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:39,409
And for all we know they're the next Apple or

1083
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:41,729
Google or they're out of business in two months.

1084
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:46,520
And the second problem I have is that even assuming that exists,

1085
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,879
where do I find that information?

1086
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,239
Like consumer reports,

1087
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,320
thankfully did, finally did a review of the Macbook and

1088
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:54,550
won't endorse them.

1089
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,429
Which? Ok. Good, good to know because apparently the battery,

1090
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,669
but here's the most fascinating thing about that.

1091
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,649
Nobody's set up to replicate the results.

1092
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:05,750
Nobody's been able to authoritatively replicate the results and say

1093
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:11,350
they're full of bunk and they're wrong or? Wow. No, they're completely correct.

1094
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,429
This is crazy

1095
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,050
because apparently the deal with the Macbook pros and the consumer reports test

1096
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:19,129
is they, they essentially open the Macbook

1097
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,870
and they have this like test suite that like loads web pages

1098
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:24,409
and does a bunch of other stuff and they like measure when

1099
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:25,719
the battery dies

1100
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:28,949
and they were getting results of like eight hours and

1101
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:31,590
two hours and then like six hours and yeah,

1102
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,010
like no, read the, put it in the show notes because it's completely insane.

1103
00:47:35,629 --> 00:47:37,270
It literally makes no sense.

1104
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,850
And like I said, the challenge is, and this is even a simple test of like,

1105
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,909
go buy a Macbook and like stick some software on it and then let it

1106
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:44,969
like, run,

1107
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,919
you know, like and plug it in to recharge it and then let it run

1108
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,139
and nobody can replicate this.

1109
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:51,860
What do you

1110
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,139
mean?

1111
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,090
What do you mean? Nobody can replicate it like they just haven't been

1112
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:55,379
able to

1113
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:55,790
or

1114
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,679
when people try this, what do they get?

1115
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:00,919
-- Well,
-- they don't have the software to do it or whatever.

1116
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:02,719
-- I don't
-- know, write your own damn software.

1117
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:06,560
Um And, and for what it's worth, if anybody wants to send me a Macbook,

1118
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,169
I will gladly replicate this test.

1119
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:14,439
-- I have no doubt,
-- but essentially nobody's able to replicate these results

1120
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,229
in a way that either says yes, this is confirmed true or

1121
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:18,760
no,

1122
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,979
they're like full of bunk because when we did it like battery life was like 15 hours,

1123
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:24,860
14.9 15.1.

1124
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,860
You know what I mean? Like or whatever, right?

1125
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,459
My fear with IOT is like, how do I, you know, for example,

1126
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:32,770
I find some combination of like my light bulbs won't talk

1127
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,429
to my other light bulbs won't talk to my chair.

1128
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,260
That's when you bring in your IOT counselor

1129
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:41,919
and they sit down with the devices and they, they share,

1130
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:44,830
I think the problem is over sharing.

1131
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,040
-- Maybe,
-- maybe it is, maybe it is, maybe,

1132
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,250
maybe we all have to share our feelings a little less.

1133
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:50,250
Uh

1134
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,919
IOT we keep talking about IOT.

1135
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:56,250
We're going to have to rename this like the IOT Security podcast. At some point.

1136
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,719
I think

1137
00:48:57,189 --> 00:49:01,459
here's the dirty truth by number of devices. IOT is the future

1138
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,659
-- it is
-- the

1139
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,080
insects

1140
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:03,889
of the,

1141
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:06,850
I think it's the present. Kurt. I mean,

1142
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,629
look

1143
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,679
for all the tablets and the phones and the routers and the TV.

1144
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:13,330
S and just, it's craziness.

1145
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,889
This is true. My kids have four devices currently.

1146
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:20,620
If I think about my house,

1147
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:23,979
I bet I've got 20 plus devices on my network

1148
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:26,840
right now and maybe four of them are computers.

1149
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:28,149
Maybe.

1150
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,270
No, this is true. I have two

1151
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:36,629
desktops. Air quotes, Mac minis and a, and a two laptops, three laptops. So, five

1152
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:40,469
traditional computers and everything else is phone tablet

1153
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:43,129
or like my bathroom scale or

1154
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,469
-- Lord
-- knows what else. And

1155
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,760
-- game consoles and TV.
-- S

1156
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:47,120
even

1157
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:47,439
thought

1158
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:47,810
-- of
-- that.

1159
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,429
Yeah. Right. You think about that? I mean,

1160
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,800
like my house has three Nintendo Ds

1161
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:51,989
s

1162
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,350
they all,

1163
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:54,899
yeah, they've

1164
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:58,260
got like an app store and stuff. You can, you can buy stuff.

1165
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,639
Yeah, it's quite nice actually.

1166
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:01,699
-- You think about,
-- you know,

1167
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:04,570
I, I've actually been meaning to buy a Nintendo because

1168
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,280
I have fond memories of them as a child.

1169
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,310
You know, the Nintendo entertainment system class.

1170
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,830
You can buy the mini if you can find one

1171
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,949
if you do buy two and send one to me because

1172
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:16,520
I can't find one.

1173
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:21,820
Yeah, I think part of the solution will be to have just simply put some, uh,

1174
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,570
some people like consumer reports and,

1175
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,129
well, no, I, no, let's not even pretend we know what the solution is.

1176
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:32,159
Here's what I think, I think what the F DC is doing. This, this prize,

1177
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:33,580
this is great.

1178
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:36,750
This is what we need to do because it's gonna make people start

1179
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,610
thinking about this stuff in strange new ways because these are strange,

1180
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,699
new problems

1181
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,810
that need strange new solutions.

1182
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,050
The old ways don't work.

1183
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,120
It's essentially the bug bounty and

1184
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,600
the reality is, yeah, we, we were at the point where the experts have,

1185
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,870
I don't want to say failed us, but certainly haven't made things awesome.

1186
00:50:55,449 --> 00:51:00,360
They, well look, let's face it, man. Is the people who are the experts today

1187
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,120
aren't going to be the people who are the experts of tomorrow.

1188
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,139
And

1189
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:04,959
right,

1190
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:07,919
we need a new crop of people who look at

1191
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:11,479
this stuff in new and interesting ways because the people,

1192
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,550
the, the things we learned and the things we went through,

1193
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,899
-- most of that knowledge is becoming worthless and we will talk about
-- it.

1194
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:23,270
They say it's not just worthless, it's actively dangerous. Like the fact that I,

1195
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:26,719
you know, I, I run into people that still think you can have a network perimeter

1196
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:31,489
when like people have, you know, phones, tablets,

1197
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,830
-- bathroom scales and like the cloud all mashed together
-- or

1198
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,270
the fact that most of your employees have telephones,

1199
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,050
you know, VPN into the network that they walk out of the door with every day.

1200
00:51:44,659 --> 00:51:46,489
I mean, no, and that's,

1201
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,429
that's a whole nother conversation. Obviously. It, it is what it is. Right.

1202
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:55,120
-- The future is now that I think is the problem,
-- the future is

1203
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:56,979
-- now
-- the future is now.

1204
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:57,739
And

1205
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,100
unfortunately, I don't think we're ready for it yet.

1206
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:03,560
It will get there. Right.

1207
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,050
And that's, you know, that's part of it too,

1208
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,449
I guess is we complain and we lament and we,

1209
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:11,189
hey, people weren't ready for the industrial revolution for the 1st 100 years.

1210
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:11,590
Right.

1211
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:11,850
And,

1212
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,239
and people weren't ready for the internet for a

1213
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,229
very long time and they still might not be.

1214
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:16,270
But

1215
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:17,280
the

1216
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,340
point

1217
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,070
is

1218
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,629
this will get figured out.

1219
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,110
I am confident

1220
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,399
and, and if you want to

1221
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,750
accuse me of making a prediction, this is it.

1222
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:30,310
I am confident

1223
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,229
in humanity's ability

1224
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,870
to overcome the obstacles placed in front of it.

1225
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,929
That is my eternal optimistic part of me that I never let out.

1226
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:43,350
But I'm going to for this one second here.

1227
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,219
-- I
-- would, I would agree and just say it, it, it's, it just may not be pretty,

1228
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:48,639
but it often works

1229
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,870
and, and you know that. Right. Exactly. Right.

1230
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:55,310
It, how we get to where we go is messy and crazy and bizarre.

1231
00:52:55,544 --> 00:52:57,155
And you look at like

1232
00:52:57,784 --> 00:53:02,854
the birth of democracy across the planet, which is potentially in jeopardy now,

1233
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:03,354
but we won't

1234
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:03,725
get it.

1235
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:09,574
That's just it. Right. It, it wasn't clean and nice. It's still not clean and nice.

1236
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,725
It will never be clean and nice. And this is

1237
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:16,165
the same thing with us solving these iot problems. It's gonna be messy.

1238
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:18,135
It's gonna be weird. It's gonna be hard

1239
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:18,989
and

1240
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:23,909
anyone who tells you no, or it can't be done or just, you're wasting your time, like,

1241
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:26,939
ignore those people because the world has always been

1242
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:29,300
full of the naysayers and you know what,

1243
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,629
so far they've basically all been wrong

1244
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:33,830
and that's just the way it is.

1245
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:36,260
It does remind me of all those end of the world predictions

1246
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:39,129
one day they're gonna be right, you know,

1247
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:40,810
of

1248
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,250
the universe.

1249
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:46,120
Absolutely right. Someday I'll be like, you're glad you listen to me. Right.

1250
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,719
It, it is what it is. You know,

1251
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,239
it,

1252
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,800
I'm confident we will figure it out.

1253
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,320
And in the meantime, you and I will complain at length

1254
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,580
about all of the things wrong with Iot and putting Wi

1255
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,770
Fi and everything as we eat our breakfast cereal with our

1256
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,489
IOT spoons and the,

1257
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,219
and the

1258
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:06,530
anti

1259
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,489
tremor spoons

1260
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,219
I, I have and they're very cool. Actually. That

1261
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,929
to me, I almost cried. That was so amazing. Yeah.

1262
00:54:13,129 --> 00:54:17,199
-- Yeah.
-- Well, I mean, so that's a great example of technology doing amazing things.

1263
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:17,510
And

1264
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:22,060
you know what if, if all of the crazy before now hadn't happened,

1265
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,540
you couldn't build something like that.

1266
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:24,510
And so

1267
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,750
imagine what the future is going to build with.

1268
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,889
What we think is crappy wifi hairbrushes today,

1269
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,780
right? And, and that's just the way it is.

1270
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:36,449
So, all right, let's, let's, let's take it home, man. I'd say

1271
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,110
the,

1272
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,750
the crazy list of things we've talked about will be in the

1273
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,270
show notes which you can find on open source security podcast.com.

1274
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,989
You can hit us up on Twitter. You can use the Hashtag Pound Os S podcast

1275
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,870
to let us know what you think or, or leave a message or whatnot.

1276
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:58,060
And if nothing else, I guess happy end of ce S Kurt,

1277
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,850
I guess the moral story is go

1278
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,939
on spoons,

1279
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,120
go along on spoons. That's right. All right, folks. Until next time, take care.
