Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 175 with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,880
-- Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh
-- Pressers.

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,279
How you doing, man?

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:14,689
I,

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,110
I think I'm actually finally over whatever that head

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,670
cold thing was that I had for two weeks.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,250
You know, I feel the same way.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,780
I was remarkably ill for the last couple of

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,729
podcast episodes we recorded which I do my best

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,379
to make sure it doesn't come through when I

10
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,069
take out all the horrible noises we're making.

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,510
But yeah, I actually like,

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,979
I've slept through the night for the last couple

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,645
of nights and I'm not coughing and making terrible noises

14
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:35,784
all day.

15
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:40,224
-- I mean, there's still
-- some, my one son is so congested, like, and this is him,

16
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:43,944
like standing up being awake and it just sounds like ouch.

17
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,604
It's just the poor guy.

18
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:46,985
You gotta love it, man.

19
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:50,275
So anyway, I'm glad we're better by as better as we're going to get

20
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:51,665
at

21
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:52,174
this

22
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:52,604
age.

23
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:54,264
The ravages of old age

24
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:56,665
anyway. So it's new man.

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,330
Well, so it looks like criminals have finally caught up with technology,

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,970
-- but when it comes to car thieving,
-- I would disagree with that.

27
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:04,769
I think

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,410
we are noticing criminals have beaten us yet again,

29
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:12,489
which they always do because by definition, that's how defending works.

30
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:12,889
Yeah.

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,480
Well, I mean, there was a, there was a kind of a, ok, so,

32
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,720
basically stealing cars used to be pretty easy because you

33
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:21,735
just smashed a window, jammed a screwdriver into the ignition

34
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:22,834
and twisted.

35
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:24,775
Right. We've all seen the movies. Yeah.

36
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,644
And, and that's actually, I mean,

37
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,855
basically that's what the key in your car does

38
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:31,775
is it turns and completes an electrical circuit.

39
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:31,955
Right.

40
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:34,154
So you've got your first position, which is what, like your accessories,

41
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:35,644
like you control on your radio and lights

42
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:38,735
and then you turn it all the way and it'll crank the,

43
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:41,095
the engine and try and start the engine. Right.

44
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,175
If you live in Canada and you forget to plug your car in,

45
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:45,175
you know, that, that can be a bit of a crash

46
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:45,855
sometimes.

47
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,639
Right. Right. It doesn't always happen.

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,290
I was quite shocked to find out that they sell cars without block heaters in the US.

49
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,440
But then, you know, I guess in Florida that makes sense.

50
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,989
I've never owned a block heater and I live in

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,470
one of the colder regions of the United States.

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,059
I've never seen a car that doesn't have a plug on it

53
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,959
because you live in like the freaking Arctic Circle, man.

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Well, anyways, so the thing is you just,

55
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,259
you know, it's not like you need to pick that walk,

56
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,300
you could just jam a little screwdriver in there and twist it right.

57
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:15,199
So, ok,

58
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,289
car manufacturers came up with actually what I think is a pretty

59
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,679
solid effective system, uh the ignition interlock.

60
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,429
And so basically your key has a little computer chip in it that is

61
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:28,649
interrogated by radio

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,169
and it sends back a code and, and that's it.

63
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:35,210
So basically now you can still twist the lock and like,

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,100
or pry it or pick it or whatever.

65
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:41,332
But the ignition interlock is going to kick in and, and refuse to start the car. So

66
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,292
like you can't start the car, which generally means you can't steal it.

67
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:49,113
That's the idea. Yes. And, and that has worked really well for a while.

68
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:52,453
And of course, people, you know, well, and here's a great example in Canada,

69
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:53,912
you know, a lot of people for some reason,

70
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,742
want a remote car starter so they can start the car,

71
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,632
let it warm up for five or 10 minutes, you know, blow

72
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:58,212
hot air

73
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:01,585
defrost a bit and then get into the nice toasty car and drive to work.

74
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,365
I remember the one time, uh, the last time I got home from a flight,

75
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,175
I had to sit in my car for five or 10 minutes

76
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,166
in the parking lot waiting for my car to warm up because

77
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:12,376
breathing in my car was enough to fog up the windows. Awesome

78
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,876
remote car starters obviously need a way to sort

79
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,356
of bypass this ignition interlock to start the car,

80
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:20,410
right.

81
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,570
By definition, you can't start the car.

82
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,839
So they basically do the same thing.

83
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,610
You know, they have a little radio fob, uh, it tells the car, go start the car goes.

84
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:29,759
Do you really want me to start?

85
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,089
Like, I need you to kind of answer this little secret radio query and the key fob goes.

86
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,399
Yeah. Yeah. No, I really meant it. Start the damn car and the car goes. Oh OK.

87
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:38,679
And

88
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,830
the,

89
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,889
the thing is there's a really

90
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,210
conceptually simple attack here which is

91
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,490
typically

92
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,850
the key fob,

93
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,210
the attacker can't interact with it because the key fob is in

94
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,490
your pocket or in your purse or in your dress or whatever.

95
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,550
Right.

96
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,210
And by definition, if they can interact with it, they'll just steal it and run.

97
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:55,910
Right.

98
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,289
And,

99
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,729
and it should also be noted that this is extremely common in newer higher end cars.

100
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,169
Obviously the target market for car thieves

101
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:08,009
where you don't even have keys anymore.

102
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,910
It's all the fobs where you just like my father's car, he walks up to it, it unlocks,

103
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,119
he gets in, he pushes a button, it starts and he leaves.

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,738
No, there's, there's literally now that we have the microchip,

105
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,850
there's literally no physical reason to have the key

106
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,459
other than that's how we used to do it.

107
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,570
Right. Right.

108
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:29,049
It's just that simple. So, yeah, so, but, but through the magic of radio,

109
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,220
you can

110
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,420
extend a radio signal who knew by, uh, well,

111
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:36,320
I think every electrical engineer on the planet knew that.

112
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:37,290
Right.

113
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,250
But, you know, you know, but nobody ever listens to them. So it's fine.

114
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,750
So basically the Attackers have discovered you just, basically,

115
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,059
it's not even a replay attack. It's a relay attack. So you basically have a,

116
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,049
so a device that listens to the radio signal and

117
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:56,290
boost it and, and relays it on which I mean,

118
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,529
-- we've been doing that in radio for well since ever
-- forever.

119
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,269
Right? And it should also be noted that it sounds like in most of these attacks,

120
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,450
the keys are near the front door

121
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:07,929
of a

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,570
wall or somewhere close to where the thieves can go.

123
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:16,579
It's not like they're just standing next to your car and picking up the keys

124
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,535
bob from 100 yards away, then it starts

125
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,934
well, and, and in theory though, to put, uh, to be clear, they,

126
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,265
in theory could do that if they had a

127
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,975
strong enough amplifier and a high quality enough receiver,

128
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:29,885
in theory, they could

129
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:34,274
inverse square law would make it really difficult just easier to stand next to it.

130
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:38,345
The, the background noise probably would drown that signal out

131
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:43,494
after a couple of feet. Is my suspicion or meters for you. Civilized folks.

132
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,089
Well, yeah, inverse square law. It's a heck of a thing.

133
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,850
Um, essentially it says that, you know, your radio

134
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,920
anyways

135
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,130
so long and the short of it is, is that Attackers have figured this out. And

136
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:59,049
the thing is this is something where I can build this device

137
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,690
and I can teach you how to use it in about,

138
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,049
I don't know, a minute, maybe 30 seconds,

139
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,890
-- maybe two minutes if you're not listening. Right.
-- Right.

140
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,260
So here's,

141
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:12,309
here's my take on this is you sent me these links and said we should talk about this.

142
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,359
And the first thing that popped into my head

143
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,970
was this is just the nature of the,

144
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,279
the cat and mouse game of adversary versus defender

145
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:25,114
where a new technology or a new something exists.

146
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:30,165
And there's always going to be a certain group of people that find ways to abuse it.

147
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:33,644
This has been true of telephones and radio and television.

148
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:34,424
-- I wouldn't
-- say

149
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,704
abuse it so much as exploit it because they're

150
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:39,325
not abusing it in the sense of doing something wrong with it.

151
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,505
They're, they're literally doing what it's meant to do.

152
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,079
I would call it abusing it because

153
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,529
you're operating outside intent of that technology.

154
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,339
Right? I mean,

155
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,950
email with phishing. You've got

156
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,709
text messages now with people sending, goodness knows what,

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,910
telling you to send them itunes gift cards.

158
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,970
I've gotten so many refunds from my cell phone companies.

159
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,899
That's amazing. Like I am just rolling in money now. It's awesome.

160
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,459
That's right. I have all those gift cards pretty soon. I'll be

161
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,260
when that,

162
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,880
when that Nigerian money comes back to me.

163
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,589
But

164
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,920
that's right.

165
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,279
I mean, this is the nature of,

166
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,799
I guess, opportunistic criminals.

167
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,320
They,

168
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,140
they find something they can exploit and they exploit it

169
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,760
and then the industry has to catch up behind them

170
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,410
because while you could argue, oh,

171
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,510
they should have known someone could replay this radio signal.

172
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,350
The reality is when they came up with this, this technology, probably what,

173
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,720
1015 years ago,

174
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,720
the ability to do something like this was well

175
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,239
outside the skill set of your common thief.

176
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,359
I remember when I first heard about software defined radio and I was like, wow,

177
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,519
that's, that's black magic.

178
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,220
It still is.

179
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:51,579
Yeah.

180
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,510
But I mean, and, you know, now I bought one a

181
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,450
couple of years ago for, I think it was like, $15 or something.

182
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,119
So you bought like the SDR thing, the little dongle that can also pick up digital TV,

183
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,130
like the nice ones.

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,350
There's something called the hack RF.

185
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,010
That's probably one of the better ones on the market.

186
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,920
It's like 500 bucks, which is, if you're looking to get into SDR,

187
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:11,429
you can do it for the really cheap ones.

188
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,989
They're really fun.

189
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:14,975
If you want to do anything actual legitimate, you need to spend like, 500

190
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,704
bucks, which is not cheap. But if you're stealing an expensive car that's free.

191
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,244
Yeah. Well, more to the point is successful. Right.

192
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,225
Yeah. Right. Right.

193
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:22,515
You know,

194
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:25,204
and what's funny is always anytime we talk about

195
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,075
this RF ID or chip signal or anything radio.

196
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:28,984
I'm always reminded of,

197
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:34,104
I got my nexus pass for travel and it comes in a copper foil lined sleeve

198
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,250
and it explicitly says to store it in there and to only take it

199
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,109
out when you're using it and then put it back in the copper slate.

200
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,489
And this is, this is something from the US government, right?

201
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,859
This isn't a bunch of crazy. This isn't, you know, me buying an RF ID blocking wall.

202
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:49,440
This is,

203
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,880
you know, I went to the airport answered a bunch of questions, waited,

204
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,119
what was it like four weeks and got this card in the mail.

205
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,280
-- So
-- actually, you remind me I have AAA kind of tangential topic.

206
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,210
So my ts a precheck had come to

207
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,510
and I think it's every five years you have to re up this

208
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,539
and last time, the first time I got it, which was the last time

209
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,840
I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and go sit in a little room

210
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:14,940
and get asked a bunch of ridiculous questions and scan my fingerprints and you know,

211
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,609
all the hoopla

212
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,070
and this time

213
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,869
they sent me to a website,

214
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,880
I filled in some stuff. I answered all these silly questions

215
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:27,239
and hit submit and they were like, congratulations. Your ts a precheck is updated,

216
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:27,859
but they've already

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,820
got all your biometric.

218
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,140
They do and everything.

219
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,359
But I'm like, wow, that's still like, that's surprisingly efficient

220
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:33,969
for

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,299
the government.

222
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:35,909
Honey,

223
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,989
I just got an email a few weeks ago for my nexus.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,690
I need to actually bring my passport the next time I go to the airport because

225
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,200
they're basically going to want to

226
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,559
take the biometric data off of my passport and tie it into my Nexus account.

227
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,919
And so it's the, the,

228
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,219
you know, for those of you who don't know if you have an RF ID enabled passport,

229
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,280
which if you have a passport,

230
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:00,760
that's I'm guessing less than five or 10 years old you do.

231
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:01,440
There's

232
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:07,109
copies of your like a digital copy of your face is stored on that chip in most cases.

233
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,940
Exciting. Think about it, right?

234
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,090
Because that's like, you know, every time you see this passport shenanigans,

235
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,080
what is it they're doing in movies, they're always cut, you know,

236
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,109
with an exacto knife,

237
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:18,780
cutting off the photograph and gluing a new one in and you know what I mean?

238
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,570
I would, I would think

239
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,539
that

240
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,479
the better way to do this is to just have a number on the passport

241
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:28,549
and then like have a database somewhere.

242
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,729
That means network connectivity. That means you have downtime.

243
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:36,020
That means also you got to remember this. Who do you have access to that database?

244
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:40,979
I don't think anyone's port of entries work without network access

245
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,549
anymore.

246
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,349
Uh They still do.

247
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,059
Yeah.

248
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,650
Yeah, I mean, you're going to be there a while maybe, but the reality is I,

249
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,260
I personally would have done the same way I would

250
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,989
build this so that even with the lights are out,

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,700
you can still do it with a flashlight.

252
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,289
-- But you can't, if you have a flashlight that r, that RF ID chip has
-- no,

253
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:57,530
I mean,

254
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,840
you can still look at the documents, you can examine them,

255
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,099
you can look at the guy's face with the,

256
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:01,650
yeah, whatever,

257
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:03,570
-- whatever. I'm not going to argue with you.
-- But, um,

258
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:07,320
so anyways, it's, but it's interesting to see this March forward where,

259
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,489
what they officially sent an email essentially is this is,

260
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,599
it's not a security reason they're doing this.

261
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,789
It's a convenience issue because I know one

262
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,200
thing is I hate touching those fingerprints,

263
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,559
scans, right?

264
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,000
Because you got to put your hand down on the little glass plate

265
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,280
and kind of wobble it around so it can like get a good

266
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,919
copy of your fingerprint.

267
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,219
And I'm just thinking like,

268
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,109
-- where's the hand
-- sanitizer?

269
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:26,280
Oh,

270
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,169
I'm sure people have washed their hands thoroughly

271
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,260
and there's no fecal matter on those scanners.

272
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,809
I'm sure they're clean as,

273
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,380
I mean,

274
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,030
it would be nice if they just had like a little cover,

275
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,130
you could put over it with the UV light to sanitize it.

276
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,890
But whatever the, the, the, the facial recognition thing is is faster. And so

277
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,590
because even with the automated

278
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,070
kiosk, uh you know, once going through Toronto, man, there was a line

279
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:51,739
like even for the automated stuff because it was just so crazy busy.

280
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:56,010
Yeah, I, I believe that. I do love the Canadian passport scanners though.

281
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,530
They have, like,

282
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,210
the whole machine lifts up to your height and then takes your picture.

283
00:11:59,219 --> 00:11:59,609
It's like

284
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,039
this seems unnecessarily ridiculous.

285
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,539
Oh,

286
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:06,169
not out here. I had to, like, kind of half squat to get

287
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,169
to see

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
when I was in Toronto. Like a month ago.

289
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,090
Toronto gets the nice stuff. Edmonton is, you know, we're a backwater.

290
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:12,849
I understand.

291
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,669
I, I'm in a similar situation where I live does not get fancy things anyway.

292
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,289
Anyway, we're off in the weeds.

293
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,179
The act of criminals being opportunistic.

294
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,520
-- Well, criminals do attacks that are easy. I
-- would say high return on

295
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:26,979
investment.

296
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,049
You know, it has to be safe and it has to be easy.

297
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,409
Like those two guys that robbed that cultural museum in Germany and

298
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:35,679
took off with something north of maybe a billion dollars in artifacts.

299
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,419
You don't rob Fort Knox. Fort Knox is surrounded by grumpy people with guns,

300
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,580
right? And contrary to what we learned in James Bond

301
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,200
there, you know,

302
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,830
you can't knock them all out with sleeping gas and then rob the place.

303
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,049
I'm shocked to learn. That's not true.

304
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,340
But I mean, no, you're absolutely right. You don't, you don't rob

305
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,190
somewhere that's well protected because that's hard.

306
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,510
You can easily if all you're doing is opportunistic crime.

307
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,250
Like

308
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,155
the flip side though.

309
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:08,575
There are the, the high there is that magical movie level of high end criminal So,

310
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:12,155
one of my favorite car theft is the head of Mercedes in Germany.

311
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:17,104
Had a custom Mercedes obviously with like all the features, you know, bulletproof,

312
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:19,835
all the anti-theft stuff and it got stolen

313
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,780
and they're pretty sure some Russian wanted it and ordered.

314
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,299
Right. And that happens also.

315
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,650
-- But,
-- but that's,

316
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,900
you know, the 0.00001% of crime.

317
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:32,099
Well,

318
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:35,080
and I think it's also important to realize that when

319
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,190
you are the explicit target of a well funded adversary,

320
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:40,940
there is nothing you can do.

321
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,835
Not even well funded if they're motivated to be mean to you.

322
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,116
I like, I'll be,

323
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,726
how much money would it take for me to fly

324
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,796
down there with a monkey wrench to where you live?

325
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:50,676
A couple of 100 bucks probably.

326
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:51,205
Yeah.

327
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:51,755
You know,

328
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,556
you don't need to be well funded if you're willing to go fly somewhere and get,

329
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:55,765
potentially get caught.

330
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:56,116
However.

331
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:56,726
No, no.

332
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,455
But it's, it's more complicated than that,

333
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,786
I think because let's say you come to try to beat

334
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,856
me up with the monkey wrench and I'm not here.

335
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,981
-- Now, what do you do?
-- I just wait at your house till you come back.

336
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:09,692
And what if I'm not coming home for a week? Are you going to sit here for a week?

337
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:12,211
No, you're gonna get bored, you're gonna leave and then you'll be like,

338
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,132
do I want to spend another couple of 100 bucks to

339
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,531
fly to Wisconsin and beat Josh up with this wrench.

340
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,731
-- Like, how bad do you want? I wasn't
-- gonna beat you up with it.

341
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:19,932
I was gonna threaten you with it.

342
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,812
Well, that's even dumber. I mean, at least get your money's worth while you're here.

343
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,929
But I mean, for real, right?

344
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,989
Where if you say, like,

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,260
I will literally give you as many resources as you

346
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,179
-- need to accomplish this task versus
-- most of these things.

347
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,849
Don't take that, you know, a week of your time, five grand

348
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,500
and you could basically visit anybody on the

349
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,419
planet and probably get up in their face.

350
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:42,549
Yeah, except if they're gone, then you've just wasted five grand.

351
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,900
And do you, how many times can you waste five grand before you?

352
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,325
Like, I don't really feel like flying to Wisconsin this week to try to beat up Josh.

353
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,364
I bet you do it twice

354
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,434
and then you'd be like, all right, I give up Josh runs. Right. Right. Exactly.

355
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,434
Whereas if you're funded by the Russian mob and they're gonna be like,

356
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,405
you have as much money as you want to fly to

357
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:01,744
Wisconsin as many times as you want to beat him up.

358
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,844
You're gonna be like, oh sweet, like I'm in

359
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:04,525
right.

360
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,020
Anyway.

361
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,340
Well, it was also interesting with all this car theft, at least in Canada.

362
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,020
So let's say you actually steal a car in Canada.

363
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:14,510
Right.

364
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,820
Let's say you steal like a real nice, you know, Ford F 150 truck worth about 60 grand.

365
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,409
Ok.

366
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,099
-- What do you do with it?
-- I assume you have to get it out of the country because

367
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:24,330
the

368
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,260
-- repair shops won't take stolen parts.
-- Yeah, that's the easiest way, basically.

369
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,809
Uh, I also saw this really cool documentary where, what they do is

370
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,409
they go to an auto records yard and they get basically a record

371
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,590
frame but with valid VIN numbers

372
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:42,049
and essentially take it apart and put everything on the new frame.

373
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,539
-- Don't, all
-- the parts have ID numbers also though.

374
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,419
Yeah, but the person you're selling it to isn't checking those

375
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,210
database.

376
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,059
That's probably fair.

377
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,909
You know, when they take it in for servicing,

378
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,039
they'll find out that like everything in there is stolen.

379
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,659
But that's, you know, that's tomorrow's problem for somebody else.

380
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,619
But, yeah, they're finding that these things go out of the country, you know, in,

381
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,239
well, ship containers obviously

382
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,380
because you can't mail a car, I don't think.

383
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,030
And even if you do, you still have to wrap it.

384
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,650
It occurs to me that, you know, you think at ports of entry,

385
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,520
you see them scanning outgoing cargo and making sure it's legit.

386
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,000
So you have to imagine

387
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:16,729
that it would be relatively easy to catch because either

388
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,309
I, well, it's not like you're going to hide your car shipments in

389
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,830
a shipment of outgoing toilet paper or something. Right.

390
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,770
You might, I mean, this is how smuggling works they have.

391
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,280
I mean, again,

392
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,650
these are criminals are opportunistic where they have found ways to game the system

393
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,909
to get them what they need.

394
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,690
And actually, it's, it's funny you bring this up because I,

395
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,190
I recently watched the movie Lord of War

396
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,150
and it's about Nicholas Cage as an arms dealer.

397
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,710
And it's actually a fascinating movie.

398
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,669
I didn't know this because I never actually watched to the end. But it says,

399
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:46,880
uh,

400
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,030
like these events are based on true stories

401
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,929
and there's a surprising number of parallels,

402
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,059
I guess to real world arms dealers from various

403
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,419
uh decades

404
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,070
that, that this has been a thing and well, it still is a thing.

405
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,299
But anyway,

406
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,799
one of the things that, that I,

407
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,960
I chuckled at was all the bribing he did of all the

408
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:07,118
people when he was smuggling his weapons into the various countries.

409
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,520
And like

410
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,630
that's the thing, man,

411
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,979
when, when you work with someone like that,

412
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,239
what you're actually paying them for is they know who to bribe and how to bribe them,

413
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,479
right?

414
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,760
Some people you might bribe with candy, some people you might bribe with money.

415
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,400
And again,

416
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,319
this is that opportunistic criminal attitude of they,

417
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,920
they figure out how to get it done and they get it done

418
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,128
and then the, the authorities,

419
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:30,208
the defenders have to play catch up and you have to figure out, all right,

420
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,619
how did they do it this time?

421
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,438
How do we stop this from happening? And look, I'm not gonna lie

422
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:35,798
in most of the cases,

423
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:38,458
if you go to someone working at a port that's probably not making

424
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,678
tons of money and you give them a bag full of cash,

425
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:42,048
they're probably gonna be like,

426
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,338
I'll let this one go.

427
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,050
Yeah.

428
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,329
Yeah. No, it's, um, it's hard to defend against that.

429
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,790
Especially in countries that are less wealthy,

430
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,619
it's impossible to defend against that because, like,

431
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,150
in that instance they're attacking human nature

432
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,900
and you can argue.

433
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,069
Well,

434
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,510
we need to start putting RF ID tags and everything

435
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,500
and computerizing everything and tracking everything and to a degree,

436
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,510
you can do some of that.

437
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,530
-- I
-- mean, this is one of the major pushes for electronic currency in a lot of uh,

438
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,479
jurisdictions,

439
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:08,760
right?

440
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:09,910
But

441
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,380
uh, it will make corruption and bribery

442
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,939
much harder in that. It can be tracked centrally.

443
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:17,699
I mean,

444
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,760
I always love that. People talk about this, but look, the reality of it is

445
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:26,810
the United States $100 bill is never going to go out of circulation.

446
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:27,489
In fact, you can,

447
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,550
you can take $100 bills from 50 years ago and bring them to a bank and cash them in.

448
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,250
And most most nations will like,

449
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,550
expire their currency after a certain period of time because they say, ok,

450
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,989
if you haven't traded in old money by this day, like

451
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,030
too bad.

452
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,560
So sad you lose.

453
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:44,680
Whereas the United States have never done that.

454
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,349
And that's why it's obviously the, the choice

455
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,339
-- of criminal organizations.
-- Well, it's also a heck of a stable currency compared to

456
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,359
-- that.
-- Exactly.

457
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:53,569
That's,

458
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,609
that's important.

459
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,670
-- I'm sure part
-- you can't use Bitcoin for this.

460
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:58,890
That's

461
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,729
right. I mean, seriously.

462
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,550
But like, that's the thing, man, I don't think you can talk about, oh,

463
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,949
we need to move to all electronic currency and all this stuff.

464
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,696
But the reality. Yes.

465
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,706
-- Oh, to be clear,
-- I'm not a proponent of that. I'm not for that.

466
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,666
I'm just saying that that's where some of those countries are headed because

467
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:16,145
tax purposes, corruption purposes, just general whatever.

468
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,536
-- But
-- like at the end of the day,

469
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:21,985
if the United States is still letting people carry around bags of $100 bills, like

470
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:25,975
-- it doesn't matter.
-- This is this. I knew it was high but this is amazing.

471
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:30,345
Well, number one of all the currency, us, currency in circulation.

472
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:31,296
What

473
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,462
percentage of that do you think is $100 bills?

474
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:35,521
Oh, I bet it's like 30 or 40%?

475
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:38,302
-- 77. 0, no kidding?
-- Wow.

476
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:42,121
Now what percentage of those bills are overseas?

477
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,442
$100 bills? I bet 40%

478
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:45,982
80

479
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:49,112
80%. Holy crap. Let me ask you a question.

480
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,832
You live in work in America when the last time you saw $100 bill or used one?

481
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:56,112
-- Uh,
-- I run into a couple a year actually.

482
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,430
Right. Like Canada, we run on twenties. The whole economy runs on $20.

483
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,839
Usually what we have here when you have a 50 or 100 they're a pain in the butt and, like,

484
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,300
every now and then someone will give me one for some,

485
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,020
whatever reason they owe me money or something.

486
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,959
It's like, oh, crap. What am I going to do with this?

487
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,949
Yeah, I go to the bank and I, I,

488
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,650
yeah, I get a couple, you know,

489
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,219
I'll get hundreds when I travel because I just

490
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:17,800
don't want to carry a big wad of twenties.

491
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,560
But, um,

492
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,000
but fundamentally that's the only, like,

493
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:26,030
the number of times I see and touch 100 or a $50 bill here in Canada is literally, yeah,

494
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,359
it's like once or twice a year.

495
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,400
-- So
-- my funny story there is the first time I ever went to the UK,

496
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,510
I go to the bank and I'm like, oh, I need some pounds.

497
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
They said, you know, how much do you want?

498
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,430
I'm like, I don't know, a couple of 100 pounds and they gave me all fifties

499
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,109
and I didn't think anything of that

500
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,099
except I get there and everyone's like,

501
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,239
we're not taking that.

502
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,319
Like, nobody would take my money and I'm thinking this is a pain in the butt.

503
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,959
Well, it's kind of comical that the only people that really want to use the big bill,

504
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,439
the big currency bills are, are criminals because, you know,

505
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,020
they can't be carrying around a stack of $5 bills.

506
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,150
-- That's right.
-- That's right.

507
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,949
And conversely they're probably also the only people that regularly

508
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,280
check and know how to check these things for authenticity,

509
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,459
I believe.

510
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,630
You know, that's always one of the terrors I have too is, like,

511
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,310
someone gave me $100 bill and then you bring it into the bank and they spent, like,

512
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,270
inspecting it and it's like, oh, if this thing is counterfeit, like,

513
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,739
what do I even do, you know?

514
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,260
Yeah, I'm out 100 bucks. Exactly.

515
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,180
Yeah.

516
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,890
Yeah,

517
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,439
it's whatever.

518
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:19,739
I mean,

519
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,854
the thing that I think it boils down to

520
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,694
is most criminals are not creating new attacks.

521
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:24,795
Like,

522
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,785
I'm always amazed when I watch those Defcon talks

523
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:29,614
where these people are talking about elevator security or

524
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:33,724
car RF ID security or, you know, all the research they've done.

525
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:38,334
It's just, it's amazing and it's, it's literally one person, you know, spare time,

526
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:41,829
maybe a couple 100 hours spread out over a year. Right.

527
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,400
And they, they get some amazing work done, some results done

528
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:45,290
and,

529
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,099
yeah,

530
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,079
there's no way criminals are going to do that because if they could do

531
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,780
that they would just get a white collar job making a lot more money

532
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:54,380
in many cases. Yes. That is exactly correct.

533
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,780
There is probably very little money to be made in opportunistic crime.

534
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,859
I'm sure there's a lot of money that can be made in organized crime,

535
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:03,500
but that's obviously a whole another

536
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,849
can of worms.

537
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,979
I, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:09,219
And then now at the same time I don't want to

539
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:12,819
blame the people doing the research as somehow making things worse

540
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,420
because

541
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,619
I think if they didn't do it, someone else would,

542
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:17,790
well, we'd stay there.

543
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,900
We'd still be having cars with no microchips in

544
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,500
the keys and you just jam a screwdriver.

545
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:24,449
You know, uh, what is it? The yellow wire in most cars?

546
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:28,890
The ignition wire is yellow and the other one is that I want to say blue. I have no idea.

547
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,390
I was just watching some videos on this.

548
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,189
The guys monkeying around with their vehicle immobilizers and whatnot because

549
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:37,270
it's not like there's some encrypted circuit between your battery,

550
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,910
your ignition switch and other stuff.

551
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,099
Like it's just a bunch of dumb wires and dumb relays.

552
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,469
Uh Probably I know, I know like nothing about cars.

553
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:48,040
You know, this isn't an Apple iphone where memory is encrypted and everything's,

554
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,119
you know, there's a security enclave.

555
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:51,959
Don't laugh.

556
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:54,449
I would not be shocked if Tesla or one

557
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:57,079
of those things have some sort of security enclave.

558
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,380
Tesla is a corner case. I think you'll agree that

559
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,119
respect to technology in cars. Right. Right.

560
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,569
And I mean, actually they're probably a good example though.

561
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:08,390
So if you stole a Tesla, what do you think would happen? Let's say you could steal it.

562
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,359
II, I imagine they've been stolen in the,

563
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,020
but my understanding is they basically have like GPS tracking and all of them.

564
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,489
-- Yeah,
-- they have, they have remote blah, blah,

565
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:16,810
blah, as

566
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,030
soon as you called up and said, someone stole my Tesla.

567
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,969
They'd be like, oh, there it is. Shut it down and then drive it home like, you know.

568
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,599
Yes. Ok. Well, the numbers are going up so in 2011, guess how many Teslas were stolen?

569
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,810
2011.

570
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,780
10

571
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:30,630
one

572
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,449
one.

573
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:34,290
-- Yeah.
-- And then six in 2013,

574
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,849
9, 15 in 2014, 9 in 2015,

575
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:43,849
28 in 2016, 57 in 2017 and 23 from January to May of 2018.

576
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:44,880
0, and

577
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,589
yet almost every stolen Tesla over these years has been recovered.

578
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,839
All except for three and I'm assuming those three stolen Teslas ended up in a lake or a

579
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:53,489
river or something.

580
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,430
They're in the lake

581
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,869
because one interesting thing with Tesla is I was watching some

582
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,790
uh some right to repair videos and they were talking about Teslas and

583
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:02,989
there's no secondary market for Tesla parts.

584
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,420
Like if you want to repair your Tesla yourself, not go to the dealership,

585
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:08,510
you basically have to go buy junk Teslas

586
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,079
-- and strip the parts out.
-- I believe

587
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,329
that and even that is

588
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,020
-- almost impossible to get a hold of.
-- I mean, so there, there's two sides to this.

589
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,000
First of all,

590
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,599
I think the people buying Teslas are going to be

591
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,780
the kind of people who bring them to the dealership because

592
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,920
that's just it, it's less work.

593
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,050
Well, I also feel like the problems that a Tesla is gonna have,

594
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,260
are not simple mechanical problems.

595
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,319
It's

596
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,790
subtle pain in the butt.

597
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,040
I mean, look, think about a, a gas car.

598
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,800
It has what, probably several 1000 moving parts.

599
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,599
At least. I think it's more than that.

600
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,859
It's, it's going, it's an enormous number and Teslas have

601
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,640
a dozen. Probably, like, they've got the four

602
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,494
motors on the wheels and you've got the

603
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,805
doors and the windshield wipers and then like,

604
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:51,714
what trunks?

605
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,915
I don't know. It's, it's a very small number though.

606
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,005
And so you're right when something goes wrong,

607
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:00,805
it's probably not a motor that's actually broken.

608
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:03,834
It's the computer under the driver's side door behind

609
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,064
the other computer taped to the top of the,

610
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,265
the floor or something.

611
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:08,925
Right. It's not something

612
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:10,244
you're going to see

613
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,310
normal mechanics operating

614
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,219
and religious. This one interesting

615
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,150
note is in 2016, at least the recovery rate for stolen vehicles was 58.4%.

616
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,030
-- That is, that is shockingly low to me.
-- Well, no, I think that's correct.

617
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,310
-- 40% of stolen cars just,
-- well, my guess is that

618
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:33,599
the ones they recovered were probably primarily kind of that.

619
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:37,209
I'm a kid, I'm stealing a car and I'm taking it on a joyride situation. Right.

620
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:40,469
Like, for example, I'm sure given the cold weather is here now

621
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,130
where you live,

622
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,050
the news people and police are saying stop leaving your car running

623
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,979
with the keys in it because someone's going to steal it.

624
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,329
Right. Which of course, we, we all still do.

625
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:53,380
So, one of the most popular stolen vehicles in Canada is the Ford F 150 pickup truck.

626
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:58,550
And I know anecdotally from uh two people that have had their stolen,

627
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,040
they stole the pickup truck, not to steal the pickup truck,

628
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,630
but to go steal a trailer of equipment.

629
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,170
Right? So they basically stole the pickup truck

630
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,069
and then use that to actually go steal a trailer of, you know, whatever was on it

631
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,760
and then, you know, the car ends up abandoned and trashed somewhere else

632
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,500
and that's recovered then.

633
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:17,060
Yeah.

634
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,729
Yes. That's funny.

635
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:19,329
And in fact, I,

636
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:22,489
I have several relatives who had their cars stolen

637
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,229
some because they left them running in the winter

638
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:28,670
where someone took the car on a joy ride and then they found it, you know,

639
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,510
later that day, parked in some parking lot, somewhere out of gas

640
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,469
and

641
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:33,989
it,

642
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,989
I, I get that right.

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,420
And my guess is the 40% that aren't recovered are

644
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,010
probably primarily like legitimate car thieves that are looking to

645
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,949
steal a car for parts or whatever it is. They do because let's face it.

646
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,689
No one's gonna steal a car and they keep it,

647
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,089
that's just not how this works. Not really. No.

648
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,359
Yeah, that would be dumb.

649
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,689
So, anyway,

650
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,430
uh, right. We, I know we focused on cars more than I'd hoped to in this, this instance.

651
00:26:56,439 --> 00:27:00,770
But I, I feel like just kind of to to sum everything up all in all is just,

652
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,280
this is how adversaries work.

653
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,140
Adversaries by definition are always going to be a

654
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,300
step ahead of the defenders because by definition,

655
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,359
you're defending against an adversary.

656
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,260
If there's no adversary, you're not defending,

657
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:15,599
right? That's just that is the nature of it.

658
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:18,689
And so I think there's always going to be opportunistic criminals.

659
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,229
There's nothing we can do about that. And

660
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,599
as long as there are people which again, like rooting for the machines to take over.

661
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,119
But as long as there's people,

662
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,949
this is the way it's going to be because most of these opportunistic criminals

663
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,640
are taking advantage of weaknesses in people

664
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,729
more so than weaknesses in technology.

665
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,949
Well, I mean, if you have

666
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,219
somebody leaves their car running with the keys and short of having

667
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:43,989
like face ID to unlock the car and let them drive it,

668
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,550
you know, having some insane level of biometric security.

669
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,839
Uh, you, you can't,

670
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,739
you just can't fix that problem.

671
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,530
Yeah, that is correct. Yep. Yep.

672
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,489
Actually, if you want to know what really ticks me off. So, the,

673
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,469
our, our newer car, we have a Toyota minivan

674
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,739
and I can't start it and then exit it

675
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,270
and lock the doors with like the clicker.

676
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,849
They won't do it. You can only lock the doors from the inside with the button.

677
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,089
As soon as you open the doors,

678
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,500
it won't re lock them because obviously they don't

679
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,530
want you to lock your keys in the car.

680
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,609
But it's like it's freaking freezing. And I want to start my car in this parking lot.

681
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:19,530
Well, even my car does that. I have to, I, like, get in my car, start it,

682
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:23,229
lock the doors, like, click the locker to lock all the doors,

683
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,839
then open the door which unlocks it, push the button down and slam it

684
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:27,699
or I can use the key to lock the door.

685
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:28,520
But yeah, it's,

686
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,000
and I think that's a reasonable trade off for making

687
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,410
sure you don't lock your keys in the car.

688
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,699
I don't think I can do that even, I feel like I tried that. I'll have to try that again.

689
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,099
But yeah, and in fact, for what it's worth, like my, my pickup truck,

690
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:41,969
which has numerous mechanical problems because it's very, very old.

691
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,300
I've locked the keys in that thing running more times than I can count.

692
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,900
And I just, I, I have like a key hanging, it's in my desk

693
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,920
just, I know, not everyone knows.

694
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:52,709
I

695
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,680
feel like if somebody's rooting around your desk in your house,

696
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,920
the fact that they're looking for your car key is the least of your words.

697
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,560
-- Exactly.
-- Exactly.

698
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,439
But I mean, yeah, for real, like,

699
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,000
it's such a problem I have because for whatever reason,

700
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,810
like every now and then I'll start it and shut the door and like,

701
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:09,099
the auto lock enables.

702
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:12,430
Now, granted my auto lock is, it only works about 2% of the time.

703
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,199
But

704
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:13,969
I

705
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,810
don't, I don't think it's supposed to lock when I shut the doors either, but, like,

706
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:17,670
it doesn't happen enough.

707
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,119
I really care.

708
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,280
But like the one time it does it's like, oh, crap,

709
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,260
I did it again then I gotta go for the key.

710
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,060
But anyway, anyway, this is,

711
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,349
we're, we're in a rattle. All right, man, I'll give you the last word here.

712
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,060
What are your final thoughts on all this?

713
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,869
-- Uh
-- Keep your keys inside your house away from the door or window?

714
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:35,150
Uh

715
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,930
Sure, that seems like fair advice.

716
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:40,520
I mean, it, it again, eventually,

717
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,020
I expect auto manufacturers will solve this with technology.

718
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,400
But yeah, in the meantime,

719
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,510
just don't put your keys by the front door.

720
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,040
And I think honestly, that's probably good advice in general

721
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,079
because

722
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,689
if somebody is entering your house unwelcome,

723
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,790
is that a word?

724
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,280
Uh But if someone's entering your house,

725
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,810
they're probably gonna come in the front door and it's like, oh, look,

726
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,719
the keys are right there.

727
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:00,949
I'll just take these and go.

728
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,079
So even if it's not a wireless key f

729
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,930
All right. Anyway, wonderful. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
