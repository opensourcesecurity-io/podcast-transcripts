Hello and welcome to episode 100 and six

1
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:09,439
of the open source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,119
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,890
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,920
How are you doing, Kurt?

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,159
-- I'm doing really well.
-- Well, that's cool.

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,940
That's cool. I, I hear data is the new oil. Huh?

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,559
Yeah, pretty much.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,340
Or possibly toxic waste.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,270
Oily rags.

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,059
I like what doctor

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:30,129
said

12
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:33,909
about his comparison to Mark Zuckerberg's Empire is

13
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,139
a pile of oily rags in the garage.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,869
Are

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,970
we talking about data in oily rags?

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,900
Well, I mean, Facebook is just a giant. Well,

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,049
actually I was, I was about to say Facebook is a giant data breach waiting to happen.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,209
But no, that's not true because it already has happened. It's just

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,799
the companies that

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,169
conducted the data breaches paid for access to the data.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,029
So it's technically not a data breach. They're a customer.

22
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:01,770
It's a good racket man.

23
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:02,709
Yeah.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,940
You know, like uh somebody was pointing out that, yeah, I mean, it

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,519
is interesting that we arbitrarily um

26
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,690
define like, oh, a data breach is bad but hey,

27
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:16,430
selling all that information to some third party who then may sell it on.

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,040
That's fine. Um,

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,709
this actually came up, they were talking about, um,

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,830
Canadian and US border security and how

31
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,860
the US, of course, would like certain information, uh,

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,029
on Canadians from the Canadian government.

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,970
And of course, the guy was saying, you know,

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,709
once we give this information to the US government,

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,980
we have no control over what happens to it

36
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,669
or what is done with it.

37
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,769
Right. Good, bad and different storage, whatever.

38
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:42,529
So we need to be careful with that because, you know, once you give it away it's gone,

39
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,449
like you can't get

40
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:44,769
out, you can't control it.

41
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:48,610
And that's how I feel very much about, you know, linkedin and Facebook is

42
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,449
I've tried to minimize what I put in those things,

43
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,709
but I know other people that have like

44
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:58,639
-- literally dumped their lives into it.
-- Oh man, some people are crazy. I agree.

45
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,629
Well, it's also worth noting the real reason kind of this came up is

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,370
there was another fitness app

47
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:05,989
that

48
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,470
had an incident

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,660
-- and
-- again,

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,649
not an incident.

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,770
It's just, you know, they collect all this data and they didn't secure it very well.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,589
Yeah, that's true. That's true. And, and basically the issue is that

53
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,660
if you look at some of this fitness tracker data and you

54
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,669
see like someone running circles in the middle of the desert,

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,710
-- that's probably a military base, for example.
-- Right.

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,570
Well, and what's more interesting is like there's enough correlation,

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,820
these things are accurate enough now that like you can correlate

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,250
which building they're coming in and going out of and,

59
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,809
you know, so they had cases.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,690
Yeah, of like these Dutch intelligence officers jogging from, like,

61
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,089
work to their house, which, I mean, good for them for staying in shape but

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,529
maybe not so good for, like, recording all of this and then

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,419
giving it to some random, well,

64
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:51,990
not really random but giving it to a third

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,229
party website that may or may not protect it,

66
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,320
may or may not sell it.

67
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,970
Who knows? Right.

68
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,750
Right. Right. Oh, serious, because I've been thinking about bring your own device

69
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,130
and traditionally, I thought about bringing your own device in the context of like,

70
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,559
I want to bring my own phone and check my email from it.

71
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,839
And that was kind of traditionally how we think it would bring your own device.

72
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,630
But now, no, that's wrong. Like a person wearing a fitness tracker.

73
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,720
Well, they've brought their own device to work now

74
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,029
they're not going to interface it to the work network most likely. But

75
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,460
for example, it is tracking

76
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,270
where they are throughout the day

77
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,270
to, uh, you know, pretty reasonable degree of accuracy.

78
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:29,669
And

79
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,360
that information,

80
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,139
for example,

81
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,990
could be used to correlate what meetings or when they

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,029
go to meetings or when they go on lunch,

83
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,880
who else in the building they're talking to, you know,

84
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,960
all sorts of interesting things from a privacy aspect, especially if you want to,

85
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,860
you know, especially if it's an advanced persistent threat where somebody is,

86
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,960
like, actually targeting that person or that company.

87
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,210
Right. Right.

88
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,160
And so, I mean, I remember back in the day, remember the Furby, the original Furby,

89
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,309
you know, the NSA banned it because the furby, uh,

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,039
it learned by recording snippets of language and

91
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,410
then playing them back and mingling them together,

92
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:03,690
you know. And so

93
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,360
the Ns A's view on that is, well,

94
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,050
it's a recording device so it's not allowed on the premises which,

95
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,380
you know, everybody's like, oh, you're so paranoid, you're so crazy.

96
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,610
And now it's like, well

97
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:12,729
that Amazon Alexa,

98
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,238
that emailed out a chunk of conversation to a random contact in the ladies

99
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,279
address book. It's kind of like, oh. Right.

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,390
Hm. Yeah.

101
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:22,378
Yeah.

102
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,278
So I'm, I'm really beginning to wonder about this whole,

103
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,398
bring your own device to work.

104
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,098
Like, you know,

105
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,598
it's gonna have to be like prisons where like all

106
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,139
the phones get locked up when you go in,

107
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:33,079
-- in a little cabinet or whatever. No,
-- no, it's not. And, and this

108
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:33,259
is,

109
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:34,598
people aren't going to put up with that.

110
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,098
Right. Right. No one's no one's going to do that.

111
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,868
This is something I think about a lot.

112
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,778
And actually you and I were discussing on signal about this earlier is

113
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,140
we, you know,

114
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:49,059
the saying today is data is the new oil where people viewed all this data

115
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,260
as some vast resource that they can mine and extract value out of and,

116
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,750
and I feel like

117
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:57,779
data is nuclear waste

118
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,739
where we think it's keeping us warm,

119
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,829
but the reality is it's slowly killing us and we don't even realize it.

120
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,980
And, and I feel like

121
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,730
we, we talk about like bring your own device and, and what's going to happen,

122
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:10,730
what's the future of this?

123
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:11,660
And II,

124
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,170
I have a very strong suspicion

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,329
that

126
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:19,809
the only solution is going to be regulation. Like GDPR is a great example of this

127
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,809
and

128
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,329
what people track and what they do

129
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:28,359
is going to be regulated at some point because let's face it,

130
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,730
these companies are never going to do it right on their own.

131
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,489
I'm, I'm totally comfortable saying that

132
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:37,640
the really fundamental problem though is for a lot of these devices to have value.

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,989
They have to do things that are

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,579
intrusive from a privacy perspective to a degree. Yes.

135
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,019
Well,

136
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,119
but like my cell phone has to talk to base stations and

137
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,450
let them know where it is so I can receive incoming calls.

138
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,480
Yes. You know,

139
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,970
my fitness tracker,

140
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,420
it has to track my heart rate because that's the whole point of the damn thing.

141
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,260
You know,

142
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,890
ideally, you know,

143
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,470
especially if it's like a jogging related biker or whatever thing, you know,

144
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,369
I really do want it to track my location to

145
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,609
a high degree of accuracy because then I can correlate

146
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,049
my movement speed with my heart rate with, you know, that part was uphill,

147
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,500
that part was downhill,

148
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,630
you know.

149
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,559
So by definition,

150
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,130
that level of detail is that's a lot of data that's potentially dangerous

151
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,010
and, and there's just no way around it.

152
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,220
Well, let me rephrase, there would be in theory a way around it, you know,

153
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,570
having the device, keep it locally and only put it on your

154
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:28,869
thing.

155
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,190
Of

156
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:29,660
course, that's

157
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,100
out of the

158
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,420
question.

159
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,619
That's out of the question. I mean,

160
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:32,989
no, it

161
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,799
won't happen. It would be a disaster.

162
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:36,529
Right. It's,

163
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,059
I,

164
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,089
and I see some of this happening with IOT

165
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,609
where they're talking about edge computing and it's more,

166
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,519
obviously, it's not for privacy concerns.

167
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,309
It's more for just,

168
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,239
um,

169
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,630
for example, coalescing the amount of data being sent back because, you know,

170
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
you might have some remote site

171
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,850
that has a really slow link or, you know,

172
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,149
you just don't want to be sending all the data back all the time.

173
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,029
It's just like it's still 25 degrees inside.

174
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,649
Ok. Now it's 25.5.

175
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,700
Right. You don't need a temperature measure every five seconds.

176
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,630
Just tell me when it changes or

177
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,269
when you catch fire or whatever.

178
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:09,350
But

179
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,529
yeah, I,

180
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,660
but I think the real thing is, is that, well, it's like testing and driving. Right.

181
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,339
We've, we've been railing against, you know, oh, you shouldn't text and drive,

182
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,989
you shouldn't watch movies or play video games while you're driving and

183
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,070
that ship has sailed. It's done. People have decided they're gonna do that.

184
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,579
Despite the penalties and fines

185
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,089
and the reality is like, yeah,

186
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,619
outside of very few environments, people are not going to give up their,

187
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,679
their cell phone, their smartphone, their smartwatch, their fitness tracker,

188
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,420
their,

189
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,059
and I don't think we should expect them to,

190
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:39,869
outside

191
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,500
of a very few

192
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,570
constrained corner cases, like, say maximum security prisons,

193
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:45,390
people that work there.

194
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,109
That's,

195
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,070
that's about

196
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,380
it.

197
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,140
That's different.

198
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,339
I think that the most important thing to consider in all this and,

199
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,260
and the thing that I really think about a lot is that

200
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,570
it is easy

201
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,820
to say this is bad and we shouldn't do this and we shouldn't track it.

202
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,529
But like you said,

203
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,209
people want the data

204
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,890
and texting and driving is a great example. Everyone knows it's terrible for them.

205
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,179
Everyone still does it.

206
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:15,450
The solution though wasn't to make people stop texting and driving.

207
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,510
The solution was to make people stop driving,

208
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,839
which is a non intuitive solution to the problem.

209
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:24,489
Because when humans were trying to address this,

210
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,179
the primary means of addressing it wasn't

211
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,059
saying let's just stop letting people drive.

212
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,880
The solution was how can we make people stop texting and driving? Right.

213
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,058
Which is totally wrong. I feel like all this.

214
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,260
Exactly. And we can't

215
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,179
and all this data we have is exactly the same story we can't say, oh, Facebook quit,

216
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,580
quit tracking on my data because look it, it's,

217
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,380
it's totally their empire of oily rags and they're getting 1 to $2

218
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,469
a year from every user and they aren't going to stop doing that.

219
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:54,809
Right.

220
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,090
And so the question is, how do you solve these problems going forward

221
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,080
in unique ways

222
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,130
that don't involve anything from the past

223
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,429
because whatever we've done in the past doesn't

224
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,320
-- work and it isn't going to work no matter how much we want
-- it

225
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,369
to.

226
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,650
Not even that, it doesn't work.

227
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,330
It's just, it doesn't apply to this newer version of reality.

228
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,539
You know, it's, it's like bringing sharp rocks to

229
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,330
-- like a race car track,
-- right?

230
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,710
-- Like, throw them at the cars.
-- Yes. But, yeah, I mean, the world is

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,780
like, I've now gotten rid. I'm down to one server in my house and it's a Raspberry pi,

232
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,869
you know, I've, I've gotten rid of all my desktops.

233
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
My rule now is phone, first tablet, second

234
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,270
laptop. If it has to be a laptop. Like, I'm

235
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,190
not this week, but next, next week I will actually,

236
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,570
my goal is actually to spend an entire week working off my phone

237
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,919
and my tablet if I have to and not allowing myself to touch one of my laptops

238
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,289
and I think it'll actually work.

239
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,690
Are you going to use a keyboard of some sort?

240
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,369
Oh, yeah. Good Lord. Yes.

241
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:57,890
Yeah.

242
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,309
Keyboard.

243
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm not insane.

244
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:00,650
Yeah. With,

245
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,159
without a keyboard. That sounds

246
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:06,929
super painful. But I mean, it looks like I should really, it shouldn't be that bad.

247
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,090
-- That's
-- cool, man.

248
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,500
Yeah. So I, I don't know.

249
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:10,809
I,

250
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,729
part of me wonders if we'll just end up redefining the

251
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,520
problem like privacy and what is privacy so that the,

252
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,049
you know,

253
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:20,400
yeah, it just doesn't exist anymore. All that data we have about you. That's,

254
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,349
that's just no, it's like my credit card.

255
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,880
I, I used to be really concerned about the security of my credit card.

256
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,840
Then I hired a local contractor to do something at the house

257
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,630
and he takes credit card as payment.

258
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,429
And what he does is he took my credit card physically from me.

259
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,099
I thought he was going to like,

260
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:38,080
whip it through like a phone stripe thing or square or whatever.

261
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:42,359
No, he like, puts it down his clipboard, puts the, the triplicate carbon paper form,

262
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,299
receipt thing over it

263
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,330
and like buffs it with his pen to get the imprint of the number.

264
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,640
And I'm kind of like, oh, that's kind of old school whatever. And

265
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,700
then he flips my card over and writes down the CV V code.

266
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,109
Yep. Yep.

267
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,570
And I'm like, that's really not what's supposed to happen but you know what?

268
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,359
Who cares

269
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:02,419
-- exactly. That's exactly right. Who cares?
-- I kept an eye on my credit card statement.

270
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,119
If he's planning to use it for nefarious things. He is apparently patient

271
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:08,849
and yeah,

272
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,400
he, he isn't going to and

273
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,179
this is something I think about sometimes because when you

274
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,570
and I were growing up there was no Facebook,

275
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,590
there was no anything right.

276
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,489
We had email. That was cool.

277
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,219
And now every single young person has

278
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:28,890
a million horribly inappropriate but not Facebook,

279
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,289
-- but
-- just

280
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:31,609
right.

281
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,309
They all have terribly inappropriate pictures of

282
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,669
themselves plastered all over the internet.

283
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,190
Right. And they all have it.

284
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,309
If you don't have it, you're a weirdo and

285
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:42,770
your

286
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:43,549
pictures

287
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,450
in them.

288
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:45,590
I

289
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:45,950
was reading

290
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:46,909
somebody was pointing out,

291
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,190
especially with facial recognition becoming better and better.

292
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:53,969
It's going to be really hard in the future for, you know, spies, false identities.

293
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,549
Like

294
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,299
it's going to become increasingly hard because there's that,

295
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,479
you know,

296
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,549
where, where are you? I mean, I guess we'll have to use the Amish.

297
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,809
Like they're the only people without Facebook profiles reliably.

298
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:07,369
Uh

299
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:10,349
Actually, so it's funny you mentioned that there was,

300
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:14,109
there was a book I read a long time ago called Project Mince Meat.

301
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,320
And it was about this operation during World War Two where the

302
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,489
allies hid documents on a body and dumped it in the water.

303
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,119
And one of the things they actually did

304
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:28,320
is they gave the the fake person

305
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:31,770
a history in a back story and they like had,

306
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,080
they had one of the people pretend to write

307
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,419
letters to and from other people as this guy

308
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,859
and like they did all this work to give

309
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:41,440
them kind of fake backgrounds and I had a suspicion

310
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:47,260
that it isn't going to be harder to be a spy. It just changes the dynamic of it.

311
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,630
And in a lot of ways it might actually get easier because now if

312
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,570
you're able to create these fake profiles and keep them going for a while,

313
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,690
you have

314
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,200
an immense tool you can use and say, look, I'm not a spy.

315
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,869
See, I've got Facebook going back 23 years

316
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:03,559
and they're like, oh, crap,

317
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:04,929
the problem being that they,

318
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,809
they pull up some picture of you with a different name attached to it

319
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,239
or the computer does,

320
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,229
-- you know?
-- That is true. Actually, that is a very good point.

321
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,659
And, and that's the thing, like we, we already have those systems.

322
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,510
Well, China, for example, is, you know, working very hard to,

323
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,000
to deploy that system to catch criminals

324
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:24,830
at train stations on the street, you know, uh,

325
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,349
the cops with the augmented reality glasses.

326
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,289
So, yeah.

327
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,809
Uh yeah, I, I think it will definitely, I mean, just everything will change

328
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,150
but just like everything has fundamentally changed over the last 2050 100 years.

329
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:45,320
I'm going to hope we don't view China as our Bell weather for privacy.

330
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,440
Right.

331
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,919
Well, like I said, I, I think privacy,

332
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,419
I think the problem might be solved by redefining the problem and,

333
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,729
and kind of to some degree, defining it away

334
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,400
-- to a degree.
-- I do think you're right.

335
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,140
I, I have a suspicion. You're correct

336
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,559
to a degree though.

337
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,159
I think there's still some of the problems you look at some of the things like what,

338
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,159
what Facebook

339
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,359
has done.

340
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:09,599
And

341
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,320
I think it's safe to say nobody wants to live in that world.

342
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,500
-- Right. Where,
-- where you can

343
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,929
get a choice on this.

344
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,789
We do.

345
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,849
I, I think we do right where

346
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:27,030
the, the, the ability of Facebook to target people and what they're doing with it is.

347
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:28,150
-- But
-- we've had that

348
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,330
question

349
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,710
with choice point and with all these other companies that, you know, collect

350
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,590
information on people for marketing purposes like that,

351
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,150
that's been a thing now for decades,

352
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,330
right? So,

353
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:42,090
uh like soaps on afternoon TV,

354
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:43,869
you know, aimed at housewives.

355
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,409
Uh I knew a guy that was working for a start up. This is like 1520 years ago

356
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,159
that was based on your,

357
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,479
uh it was a for a set top box.

358
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,530
So they would know what you were watching and when you were

359
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:56,340
watching it and kind of how you were watching it like volume and

360
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,880
if your channel surfing and stuff and based on that, they were,

361
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,239
they were able to determine who was watching quite reliably, like male, female,

362
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,570
approximate age,

363
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,679
things like that. They, they couldn't

364
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:07,940
surprise

365
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,159
me at all,

366
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:10,780
you know.

367
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,960
So there's just the reality is especially for marketing,

368
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,950
there's just too much value there potentially for like,

369
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:19,820
not, well, what's the old phrase?

370
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,219
You know, uh like half my marketing money is wasted. I just don't know which half

371
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,000
right.

372
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,739
And so, you know, if you can increase

373
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:33,859
click through or customer interaction rates by even single digits

374
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,719
that for most companies is a huge amount of money.

375
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,059
You know, I was at a music festival on the,

376
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,580
on the weekend that was sponsored by a real estate developer, you know,

377
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:47,469
for some new housing development on a fake lake or whatever.

378
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,349
And it's like if they sell even one

379
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,780
more house because of that sponsored music festival,

380
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:52,229
they'll

381
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,460
totally break even.

382
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,099
Oh, I'm sure

383
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:56,340
I have no doubt.

384
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,200
Definitely.

385
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,830
But, but I, I guess here's where

386
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,469
my, my thinking keeps coming back to

387
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,950
regulation though

388
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,039
is

389
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,309
if we leave this up to the market,

390
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,250
it will not solve itself because the market doesn't want it to solve itself.

391
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,080
Well,

392
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,940
the majority of the market doesn't want to solve it because the

393
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,030
majority of the market wants to make money off of it.

394
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,030
Right.

395
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:24,179
And the people that do want to solve it are, are generally trying to apply sort of

396
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:25,630
old timey thinking

397
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:26,760
like

398
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,669
GDPR is a great example.

399
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,400
You have to protect the data, you have to delete it if they ask, you have to, you know,

400
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,359
these are things that

401
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,880
are, it's the thinking of 1020 years ago

402
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,599
-- and,
-- and some of it makes sense, but I agree.

403
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,690
Are they going to protect the data they'll try? Are we still going to have breaches?

404
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:43,679
Absolutely

405
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:44,909
right.

406
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:50,840
PC ID, like every major credit card breach has been at a PC I complaint company.

407
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:53,880
Yes,

408
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:58,489
I agree with that. I agree with that. 100%. But I think some of the,

409
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,530
the fundamentals behind GDPR are not a terrible thing,

410
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:05,510
that's for sure.

411
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,189
Right.

412
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:10,729
I agree 100% with that. Right. I have no doubt.

413
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,949
But let me ask you this.

414
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,130
Do you think GDPR will fundamentally actually protect people's privacy and data?

415
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,260
No,

416
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,199
exactly.

417
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,219
It, not, not in the way it exists today.

418
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:25,219
But here, here is what I'm hoping GDPR has the effect of,

419
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,520
I'm hoping things like GDPR make people understand what's

420
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,900
happening because now when there's a data breach,

421
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,219
you have to tell people.

422
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,109
And so when people start getting emails up the wazoo

423
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:43,390
because their data has been stolen by who knows who is 700,000 times,

424
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,500
they might start saying hang on here, what's the deal? Right?

425
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,150
And so I think that has potential.

426
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,760
I think some of the ways GDPR wants to anonymize certain data has potential.

427
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,170
I mean, a great example is

428
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,339
everybody has

429
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:03,510
tons and tons of logs from people using their website, right?

430
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,219
And the way GDPR basically says is you can track this, but you can't track who it is.

431
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,829
If you are able to track who it is, you need to then be able to

432
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,130
honor or request of somebody to remove it.

433
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,140
You know,

434
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:24,020
that was, that's my understanding and that's one of the

435
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,939
problems with GDR is everybody's got a different understanding of it.

436
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,630
Yes. Yes, indeed.

437
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,800
So my understanding,

438
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,869
we can still try it. We just have to be willing to remove it if somebody asks.

439
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,910
Right. Well, that, that's part of it.

440
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,829
There's also storage of a personal identifiable information.

441
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,229
There's,

442
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,119
there's like a million things and whatever it

443
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,750
doesn't really matter because like we said,

444
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,589
it fundamentally isn't going to make a difference by itself.

445
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,910
My hope is it's just the first step in a long path

446
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,189
to having some semblance of, of sensible data privacy in the universe which

447
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,089
I don't know what that's going to look like. I'm not going to pretend I do.

448
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,349
But what I do know is the way a lot of these organizations are treating

449
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,349
data

450
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,189
is terrifying today because like I said,

451
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,984
it's not oil, it's, it's like spent nuclear fuel.

452
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:16,474
Well, there, I mean, when there's no downside to pollution, guess what?

453
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,395
-- Right. People pollute. Right.
-- Oh, that's perfect.

454
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:21,435
That's a perfect analogy, man, because

455
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:22,214
you're right.

456
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:26,354
Like Facebook is literally like throwing spent nuclear fuel into the street

457
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,810
and they're like, not my problem doesn't matter. Right. And it isn't their problem.

458
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,510
Well, it literally isn't their problem until like,

459
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,410
the Cambridge Analytica scandal happens.

460
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,640
And

461
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,540
-- as far as I know
-- there's been out there.

462
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,069
Exactly.

463
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,530
-- Yeah. Nothing of substance has occurred.
-- Right. Right. Exactly

464
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,219
is going to occur. Right.

465
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:47,689
-- Like what Zuckerberg showed up, he testified before Congress,
-- didn't,

466
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,729
he also refuse to testify before the British

467
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,609
-- House of, I
-- don't know if he ever went.

468
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,410
I know he was, he was saying he wouldn't go and he sent somebody else.

469
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,170
I don't know if that happened or not.

470
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,489
But, but the point is right

471
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,609
this,

472
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,660
they know they don't have to care.

473
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,770
They knew they just had to tough it out for a little while

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,979
and we would stop caring because the next circus story would appear,

475
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:14,739
which is we're about 20 deep at this point

476
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,380
and

477
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:19,854
nobody even remembers who came, which Analytica is or why we care.

478
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,255
Pretty much.

479
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:23,364
Speaking of new things. So

480
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,005
Bor it's a uh

481
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,724
uh it's an online um

482
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,375
Cryptocurrency exchange thing.

483
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,635
Oh, good.

484
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:32,935
Well, let me just read it.

485
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,859
Uh This is not today today but anyways

486
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,989
earlier today at approximately 0000 UTC Bancor experienced a security breach.

487
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,880
We take this incident very seriously, which is

488
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:45,410
probably

489
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,660
-- true
-- because

490
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,420
the actual

491
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,390
00

492
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,250
UT

493
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,699
C

494
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,444
every resource to resolving it,

495
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:53,875
getting the network back online and tracking down the criminals involved.

496
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,114
So yeah, they actually had to shut down their stuff and their

497
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:58,885
anyways, uh the details of the breach are still being investigated,

498
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,864
but we wanted to update the community with the facts that we have so far,

499
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:06,244
a wallet used to upgrade some smart contracts was compromised.

500
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:11,145
So for those of you that don't know some cryptocurrencies uh like Ethereum,

501
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:13,464
for example, support the idea of smart contracts.

502
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,364
And so a really simple example of a smart contract would be

503
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,640
Josh agrees to sell me his couch for 100 crypto coins

504
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,189
and so we put a smart contract that basically says that, that says essentially,

505
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,349
you know, he will sell me his couch for 100 crypto coins.

506
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,119
When I take receipt of the couch poop, the money goes to his, you know, wallet

507
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,199
end of story,

508
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,920
right?

509
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,930
And it's, you know,

510
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,339
it's an IOT couch pretty much. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Who's it?

511
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:41,040
It does, it has, um, but sensing technology

512
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,060
so it knows who's sitting on it.

513
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,489
And um,

514
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,410
so yeah, so patent that

515
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:47,780
probably already is.

516
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,310
But in the Blockchain,

517
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,910
yeah,

518
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,290
smart contracts can obviously contain flaws because they're kind of

519
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,709
software and software is kind of prone to flaws.

520
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,050
Ok. No, it's more important than that though.

521
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,239
Smart contracts are almost all turn complete.

522
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,329
And if you have a turn complete smart contract, there is like by definition,

523
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:09,530
an infinite number of security flaws in your smart contract system.

524
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,050
Well, the halting problem and the will is actually execute and

525
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,969
it cannot be secured.

526
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:15,699
Yeah.

527
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:16,020
And,

528
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,819
and more to the point like business logic is

529
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,939
messy enough with courts to help enforce it.

530
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:22,459
When it goes sideways with smart contracts, you generally

531
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,939
don't have that option right now because it's gone, it's gone.

532
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,719
So anyways,

533
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,660
um,

534
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,890
they did manage to snake about a million

535
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,300
bucks worth of some Cryptocurrency called NPXS uh

536
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,050
about 25,000

537
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:37,119
Ethereum, which is about $12.5 million

538
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,420
and 3.2 million BNT. That's the

539
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,459
bor one worth about 10 million.

540
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,599
So the BNT they could obviously freeze,

541
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,140
which they did.

542
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,339
However,

543
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,599
uh the other two are like gone,

544
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,060
right? Because like that's how cryptocurrencies work. It's like

545
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,609
while it went to this wallet and it's gone.

546
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,849
Now, what they are trying to do is,

547
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,890
is work with other exchanges to essentially make it harder

548
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,170
for whoever has control of those coins to,

549
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:08,099
uh spend them to, you know, tumble, like to essentially clean and wash them and so on

550
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,050
and

551
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,609
you know, depending on

552
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:13,930
how many people are willing to help them with this, that may or may not work.

553
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:17,699
But what I find really fascinating is that,

554
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,969
you know, this was an attack

555
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,859
against a Cryptocurrency against an exchange using

556
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:28,459
like the Cryptocurrency itself, its capabilities,

557
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,089
the wallet and the smart contracts,

558
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,290
not like

559
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,290
this is what it sounds like.

560
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,849
You know, it doesn't sound like they broke into the website or that they fished,

561
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,180
you know, a senior admin and got a password and you know, whatever, right?

562
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,849
This was an actual

563
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,520
flaw within the,

564
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,099
the Cryptocurrency and its smart contracts and all that stuff itself.

565
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:51,819
Ok?

566
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,479
I mean, this isn't the first time this kind of happened though,

567
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,709
didn't Ethereum have this problem where they had to

568
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:59,579
-- actually fork the Blockchain and
-- that was no,

569
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:02,660
what happened there is they, the dow the distribute autonomous

570
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,630
organization, whatever that is called,

571
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,540
had

572
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,420
these, this implementation of smart contracts.

573
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,339
And they're like, well, that's how the dow is going to work.

574
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,540
You know, people can vote on what the dow does and blah, blah, blah,

575
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,199
and we'll never roll it back. It'll just keep moving forwards.

576
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,670
And of course, somebody clever found a flaw in the smart contract and, like,

577
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,640
sucked down like all the monies.

578
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,229
So, of course, they're like, well, yeah, remember how we said we would never like,

579
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,459
roll this back and fork it.

580
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,109
That's what exactly what we're doing.

581
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,160
So they did that and they essentially hard fork Ethereum. So the one stream

582
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,849
you have the stolen money situation and the other stream, the clean stream, you,

583
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,780
you rolled back before that and well,

584
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,739
tough,

585
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,530
right? That's just how that worked.

586
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:44,060
But what's interesting to me is, I mean,

587
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,180
this was obviously like you said, these smart contracts are turing complete,

588
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,589
right? There's been well, a great example. Crypto kitties,

589
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,060
right? Have you heard of crypto kitties?

590
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,380
I have no idea what you're

591
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,699
-- talking.
-- This is so stupid. It's true.

592
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,099
-- So
-- sweet. Crypto

593
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,410
kitties are

594
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,199
digital cats. It's a, it's a,

595
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,310
it's a Cryptocurrency.

596
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,089
Uh And the premise is,

597
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,969
is you have these adorable little cats that are like different colors,

598
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:14,579
different shapes, they have different abilities and powers

599
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,170
and you breed them together.

600
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,109
Essentially you do financial transactions to breed them together and stuff to

601
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,010
make more crypto kitties and you collect them and it's like trading cards

602
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,819
and you can get special powers and stuff and obviously you can

603
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:26,339
spend real money on this and so on and so forth and,

604
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,420
you know, I mean, that's the whole point of these things, right?

605
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,160
Is that you have this incredibly complicated

606
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,160
thing called Blockchain. And then on top of that, you're slapping a currency.

607
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,849
So we're already into like two extremely complicated levels of technology.

608
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,930
And then on top of that, yeah, you slap on t

609
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,239
complete smart contracts

610
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,359
which also conveniently

611
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,790
enough in many cases,

612
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:51,810
do not have the ability to be. Um

613
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,060
what's the word I want to use

614
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:54,699
to be like

615
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:00,599
uh replaced or superseded or negated? Like once they exist, they exist, you can't,

616
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,199
I mean, that would defeat the purpose of them, right? If you could,

617
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,359
-- that would be part of them
-- in any way.

618
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,180
I mean, you can update so in some of these ecosystems,

619
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,400
you can update the smart contract and sort of,

620
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,839
you know, we're not going to use the old one anymore, right?

621
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,589
The old one, all the transactions that went through it are valid, but

622
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,719
that old contract can no longer be used.

623
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:23,780
-- I
-- mean, I'm, I'm sure there could be ways to accomplish that if you really wanted to,

624
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,680
but I I'm not aware of any of that due today.

625
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:27,239
It's

626
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:28,760
more to the point.

627
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,000
Even if you have that capability,

628
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,800
you still have the problem of a bunch of like broken smart contracts,

629
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,199
fooling around waiting to be exploited.

630
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,910
You know, we're back to the software problem of yay,

631
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,949
we can patch security fixes and ship out updates.

632
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,030
Great. Awesome. Everything's still on fire.

633
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,420
But with no, with Cryptocurrency,

634
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,630
you can't ship out updates in many instances

635
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,859
because if you have to change the fundamental work

636
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,510
-- of the Cryptocurrency,
-- well,

637
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,310
what I meant was replacing these flawed smart contracts with

638
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,469
newer smart contracts so that you only get exploited once.

639
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,250
Right? And then you replace the smart contract with the smarter one,

640
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,280
but then you're back into whack a mole territory,

641
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,130
right? And that's, that's not how you win a game.

642
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,520
I hate smart contracts.

643
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,660
I, I think the, the idea in theory is great, but in reality, I,

644
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,160
I don't see smart contracts working anytime soon.

645
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:15,040
I think it'll work.

646
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,469
This is another one of those places we need like a fundamental breakthrough in

647
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:20,719
just technology.

648
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,069
Well, I think what will happen is smart contracts will work,

649
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,140
especially within more sort of private controlled Blockchain.

650
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,439
So for example, you could have,

651
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:30,699
um like Walmart has a Blockchain for food safety

652
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,939
and they could have smart contracts executing within there.

653
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,560
The difference being is, you know,

654
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,425
they have a very good idea of who their suppliers are and who

655
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:38,454
they're dealing with.

656
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,645
And if somebody dicks around with their smart contracts, you know,

657
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:43,344
they're going to sue them in real life or whatever.

658
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:44,165
Right. Right.

659
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:49,185
And, and that's, that's very different because in a lot of instances, I think the,

660
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:52,224
the selling point of Cryptocurrency is the

661
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,739
-- anonymous nature
-- and that's something I think

662
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,800
you're conflating is Blockchain with cryptocurrencies.

663
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,060
Yes.

664
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:02,670
Cryptocurrencies are a very big example currently of how we're using blockchains.

665
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:05,270
But I've been doing some research and there's like

666
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,180
a ton of real world blockchains and products,

667
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:10,619
like the Swedish government using their language.

668
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,959
It's about

669
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,439
Cryptocurrency,

670
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,329
like,

671
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,250
well, I mean, I guess the good news is, what is it?

672
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,609
Half of all cryptocurrencies fail in the first four months.

673
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:22,280
So, you know, with that kind of death rate, hopefully things will get better,

674
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,640
I guess.

675
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,250
No, no, it won't.

676
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:31,810
Oh, man, I don't even know what to say to Dan. I guess part of me isn't surprised.

677
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,329
And another part of me says

678
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,329
why

679
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,849
just anyway,

680
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:37,959
whatever, whatever it doesn't matter.

681
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,750
All right, man, I think, I think we should get ready to call it.

682
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,670
You got any, you got any parting thoughts,

683
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:43,729
cash

684
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,050
under the mattress.

685
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,130
It's probably your best bet at this point.

686
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,569
No, you don't earn interest on cash, buy gold, right?

687
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:53,439
Gold,

688
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,579
gold keeps up with inflation. Generally it's a better investment.

689
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,900
There we go.

690
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:01,849
So anyway, if you're going to bury, bury anything, don't bury cash, bury gold.

691
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,469
There.

692
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:05,410
