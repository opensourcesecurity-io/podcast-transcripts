Hello and welcome to episode 32 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,979
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:12,829
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,140
32 5 bits wide.

4
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:15,500
How

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:15,899
exciting.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,129
Yeah,

7
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:20,620
it's, uh, only about 3000 more to go.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,979
Right.

9
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,239
That's right. That's right. How exciting.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,840
So, how you doing, Kurt

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,600
better, better getting a new cold. So,

12
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,759
this podcast should sound ok. But the next one, I'll probably sound like I'm dying.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,150
Well, we're in RSA. I imagine we'll do some recording there next week and then

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,950
we'll probably sound like we're dying anyway from

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,770
not sleeping and being around the conference.

16
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:43,419
In which case,

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,549
we'll all catch some terrible disease and bring it home to our families,

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,880
which will be the best.

19
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,540
The thing I love though is it's San Francisco.

20
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,209
So the humidity for me because I live in Edmonton where, like, we,

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,389
we don't have humidity.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,889
It's just not a thing here. Like

23
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,970
you can drop wet clothes anywhere you want and they're dry in an hour.

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,950
So every time I go to San Francisco, like within an hour of being there, I just,

25
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,970
my sinuses feel amazing.

26
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,690
I bet your hair frizzes all up too. Right.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,309
-- I don't have
-- hair.

28
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,400
Right.

29
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,290
Awesome. No, it should be fine. It'll be good. Nice and cold.

30
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:15,629
Oh,

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,199
yeah.

32
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:17,809
Right.

33
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,150
Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, do I even bother to pack a jacket?

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,199
-- I'm looking at the forecast.
-- You know what?

35
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,389
I made that mistake one time going to San Francisco.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,889
In fact, it was in July and I bought a coat

37
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:32,690
and it's sad when you're buying a jacket in San Francis.

38
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:37,349
-- Weirdly cold, damp, microclimate. Yeah,
-- it's wild, man.

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,290
It's crazy the way it works. Absolutely.

40
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,069
In fact, I, I remember I was in,

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,129
in Florida one time in February and I brought only shorts and T shirts

42
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,849
and I had to buy all new clothes because it was the coldest February,

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,769
I think in Florida history while I was there.

44
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,360
What, what? Ok. Just for reference. What does coldest February in Florida mean?

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,730
-- It was
-- like the near zero Â°C slightly above only.

46
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,339
It was,

47
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:01,029
it was,

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,069
it was cold.

49
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,059
It was very cool.

50
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,089
Yep. Yep. It was crazy, man.

51
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,288
Yeah, I think last night was minus 27 with a wind chill.

52
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:10,690
That

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,919
terrible weather.

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,539
It

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,750
is gross.

56
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,979
All right. So

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,820
I think the most interesting story I ran across last week was about randomness.

58
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,110
Yeah, I think, um, well, should we,

59
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,360
should we roll to check if we're going to talk about it?

60
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,979
-- Yes, let's roll for initiative, shall we?
-- Ok.

61
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,899
18. That's a terrible initiative.

62
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,039
So, uh, you can go first.

63
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,839
-- Uh, I'm gonna have to believe that you rolled an 18.
-- That's true.

64
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,529
You have no idea what I rolled. I should have lied and said I rolled a one.

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,839
Yeah,

66
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,449
it's part of the beauty of random numbers. Right?

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,740
And is the dice fair?

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,380
Did I roll a dice or did I just, you know, throw my pen out here? Who knows?

69
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,440
Nobody knows.

70
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,479
It's like you've seen that Dilbert cartoon where, where he's in,

71
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,460
I think he's in hell.

72
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,339
And there's the random number generator who just

73
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,179
keeps saying four over and over again.

74
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,289
Well, and that's, you know,

75
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,690
and that's a great example because technically speaking,

76
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:09,389
that could be true randomness. But the problem becomes

77
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,160
when you talk about security and

78
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,100
as a subset of security, when you talk about cryptography,

79
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:22,270
you suddenly move into a whole pile of requirements for random numbers where

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,940
we're not gonna talk about it because it just gets horribly complicated,

81
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:26,869
horribly fast.

82
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,350
-- Whatever,
-- man, we should totally talk about it. Let's do this.

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,639
Let's start with the slot machine story.

84
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,470
OK.

85
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,929
So the, and OK, so I'm not 100%.

86
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,070
I've, I've read this story, but I'm still not 100% clear on

87
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,850
the random number generator in the slot machines. Now, this is the part I'm on

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,509
II, I actually,

89
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,259
I know some things about this due to a variety of

90
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,770
conversations I had off the record as well as reading various

91
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,350
Nevada Gaming commission documents.

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,589
I don't know why. But I became obsessed with slot machine, random numbers

93
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,309
at one point.

94
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,380
So I know a whole bunch about this strangely enough.

95
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,410
So, finally my useless knowledge has value.

96
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,270
Nice.

97
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,449
Yeah, I've read a little bit and I have to admit, like,

98
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,750
if you look at what their requirements are from, like a security perspective,

99
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,750
they're, they're pretty solid.

100
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,059
Like, uh,

101
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,710
my understanding is you have to file the source code online with them and you have to,

102
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,399
um, you have to file.

103
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,670
Ok. So anyways, the deal is,

104
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,608
um, people are going to casinos

105
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:22,468
and playing the slot machines and winning

106
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,269
just under $1200.

107
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,329
The reason for that being apparently

108
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:29,088
is if you win more than $1200 at a slot machine,

109
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,028
it now requires a human interaction to do some paperwork for the winnings,

110
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:33,359
for

111
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:33,699
taxes.

112
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:34,479
So, yeah,

113
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,688
-- for taxes,
-- the story is even crazier than that.

114
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,269
Well, so, and they, they're looking, you know, they're like, what?

115
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,940
So the way slot machines work in the

116
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,149
modern world is they're like all networked together.

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,279
And you basically as a casino say, like let's, let's, uh,

118
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,070
let's take like 3.7428% away from the punters and then like dial

119
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,339
that back at 5 p.m. to get more people in the door,

120
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,739
right?

121
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,839
So you, they literally have like a dial to adjust the, the odds, which, you know,

122
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,579
statistically speaking, over time

123
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,230
that works.

124
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,019
And so what they noticed was,

125
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,739
is that their slot machines were paying out like

126
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,630
a whole lot more money than they should be.

127
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:07,440
Right.

128
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,690
Like,

129
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,369
statistically over a period of time they should

130
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,029
do X and they were doing something different.

131
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,760
So, being a casino they pulled their surveillance tapes.

132
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,640
Right, because they have video cameras everywhere. And I,

133
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,260
yeah, and, and let's face it. Right. Data storage is so cheap now you can't,

134
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,130
you know, it'd be stupid not to keep a couple of years of data. But anyways,

135
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,670
and they pull these tapes and watch them and watch them and watch them

136
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,829
and they found these people um

137
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,980
that would basically play at the slot machine for a

138
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:36,809
little while and use their uh phone to like,

139
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,850
do something

140
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,519
and then they'd leave the slot machine and come back a

141
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,149
few minutes later or whatever and then they'd play and like

142
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,070
win

143
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,269
pretty consistently.

144
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,589
And so

145
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,820
uh through various investigation and going to like rental

146
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,600
car records and a whole bunch of other stuff,

147
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:54,869
they managed to identify one of the guys involved and um arrested him

148
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,549
and well, so as I understand it, the long and the short of it is

149
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,149
the person plays at the slot machine for a little while and

150
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,250
uses their phone to record the output of the like the,

151
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,070
the spins.

152
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,160
And when I say spins, I'm talking about like a video

153
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,640
image, you know, showing like a roll, uh a roller spinning,

154
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,230
they then upload this to some guys in, what was it? I think Saint Petersburg,

155
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,220
we'll say,

156
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,429
we'll say Russia

157
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,160
who I guess, then analyze this and then send back uh essentially,

158
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,549
like they know what this,

159
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:28,170
they can determine the state of the random number

160
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,709
generator and thus predict what's going to happen.

161
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:35,019
And, and this is where it gets, I mean, where I'm really impressed is, for example,

162
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,380
um they then tell the person like

163
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,609
when they're playing again, when to, you know,

164
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,859
hit on the machine with a quarter second, advance notice,

165
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,440
which is basically human reaction time.

166
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,079
And so then these guys, you know, basically consistently win or, you know,

167
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,760
have a much, much better advantage of winning.

168
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,119
And, um,

169
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,510
obviously this is like all kinds of illegal according to various gambling laws.

170
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,809
But, you know,

171
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,600
apparently the deal is that it see in my first reading of these stories, I assumed

172
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:04,549
that

173
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,700
they had hacked the machines or they put somebody in to modify the source code.

174
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,190
But apparently that's not the case.

175
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,839
It sounds like

176
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,040
the perpetrators

177
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:17,079
have figured out how to predict

178
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,839
the output of the random number generator inside of the slot machine.

179
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,279
Yeah, which I mean,

180
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,980
is entirely believable because let's face it right

181
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:26,309
when people start doing random number generators things,

182
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,429
uh, they quite often will do it wrong for just values of random numbers,

183
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,019
let alone security numbers, let alone well.

184
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,529
And luckily this isn't cryptography,

185
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,559
-- but this is a security application of numbers
-- in

186
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,519
cryptography.

187
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:38,744
True,

188
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:39,385
true.

189
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:40,934
Yeah. Well, and a perfect example. Right.

190
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:41,325
Because like,

191
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,864
true randomness means you would have say a string of 100 fours in a row at some point.

192
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:49,005
-- It is conceivable that that would happen.
-- Yes.

193
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:52,674
And obviously that would be a terrible thing to have happen to a casino machine.

194
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,035
You know, when somebody's playing it and

195
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,804
has a, has a good idea that this might happen.

196
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,285
Right. Right. And I suspect that's exactly the case.

197
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:07,265
So let's start here. Computers suck at random numbers.

198
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,220
Right?

199
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,380
Because math in general is very predictable. If one plus one

200
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,369
didn't always equal two.

201
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,850
Well, the world would be a mess.

202
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,320
Well, the real challenge too is, um,

203
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,459
so like the dirty secret is like Linux, for example, not just Linux, basically,

204
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,190
all the things

205
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,799
rely on some sort of random what's called entropy.

206
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:34,450
So, basically random sort of noisy data that can't be predicted or,

207
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,210
or even if you do have a set of it, you can't, you know,

208
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,969
um, find patterns in it. Really? Right.

209
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,140
It's just, it's like one of those, it's like a faucet dripping, you know,

210
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,780
at certain levels of water flow, it'll drip like once a second,

211
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,880
then it'll become chaotic and random and then it'll go back to being, you know, like,

212
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,260
like just a stream of water if you crank it up high enough, right?

213
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,340
And you kind of want that in between state where it's like unpredictable and,

214
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:55,099
and random.

215
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,020
Um, but the problem is on a computer, you know, where do you get

216
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,690
unpredictable random data?

217
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,299
And so in the past we've done things like, oh, you know,

218
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,179
the user typing and using the mouse and

219
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,849
events off the network and the, the hard drive doing stuff.

220
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,530
But, you know, especially like a slot machine, for example,

221
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,049
doesn't have a keyboard and a mouse hooked up to it.

222
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:13,640
I hope

223
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,729
it doesn't, it does have humans

224
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,340
pushing buttons.

225
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,590
Yeah. And you really probably don't want to rely on them for their source of entropy.

226
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,270
OK. So, but here's the deal is

227
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:26,729
in the computer universe, there are something called pseudo

228
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,229
random number generators and the intent behind this is

229
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:33,890
that they aren't actually producing random numbers per se.

230
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:41,130
It's a mathematical algorithm designed in such a way that you feed it a seed or input

231
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,780
right to start it off

232
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,700
and then it generates a string of numbers that may as well be random.

233
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:48,590
OK?

234
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,460
And now

235
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,260
if your random number generator,

236
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,659
if you can observe the output

237
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,960
and determine the internal state, basically the current seed

238
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,900
that is an insecure random number generator.

239
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,190
And that sounds like what happened in the case of these slot machines.

240
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:06,940
Yeah.

241
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,200
Part of what I'm wondering is like,

242
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,020
did they use a seed that is not big enough because it's kind of like passwords, right?

243
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,390
Like if you have a banking website and they only allow like a four

244
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:17,960
letter password.

245
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,390
You know, it doesn't really matter how good a password you try and pick.

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,520
I only have to guess, you know, a couple 1000 passwords to

247
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,299
and I can brute force it, you know.

248
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,739
And that's what I'm wondering with this seed. Like, was it a 32 bit seed?

249
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,700
-- Was it like for all we know, like a letter?
-- Well, it doesn't even matter.

250
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,729
The seed size, quite frankly, is even borderline, irrelevant to the discussion.

251
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,390
Because so, so the way it works in a lot of PR NGS

252
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,219
is

253
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,359
you input your seed, whatever.

254
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:49,559
And then every time you make a call to the random number generator,

255
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,989
it does some sort of math internally and it returns you a value.

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,280
And

257
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:57,669
ideally what happens is it doesn't give you the whole value.

258
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,690
What happens is say it'll generate a 32 bit number

259
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,950
and it will give you 16 bits

260
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:03,950
-- out of it,
-- right?

261
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,909
-- And keep 16 for generating
-- the essentially as part of the,

262
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,419
the new seed for the next call.

263
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,590
So you don't want people to be able to observe the

264
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,510
entire state of the random number machine as it were,

265
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:14,750
right?

266
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,590
And that, that's the intent. Exactly. And not only that when you're dealing with

267
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,390
something like a slot machine,

268
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:21,630
ideally,

269
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,010
you don't want it to be that you're only asking

270
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,429
for a random seed every time or I'm sorry,

271
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,849
a random number every time someone pushes a button or pulls the handle

272
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:33,369
you want it to be generating random numbers constantly.

273
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,530
And it,

274
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,340
it sounds like they may not have been doing that correctly

275
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:42,010
in this case because if there's some level of predictability,

276
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,299
you have a problem. Right.

277
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,190
That's the whole point is that the pseudo random numbers are unpredictable,

278
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,869
which means they're as good as random.

279
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,150
Yeah, I, I know I've looked in the past for test suites

280
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,830
to determine is the output of this thing,

281
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,630
random number generator or pseudo random number generator.

282
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,549
Is it

283
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,890
actually random? And is it actually random for the purposes of security?

284
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,599
And then worse? Is it actually random for the purposes of cryptography?

285
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,799
And as far as I know, we don't really have any such test suites.

286
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,659
No, there is there, there's a great one actually.

287
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:15,309
Yeah.

288
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,419
Yeah, there's a couple of them,

289
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:19,289
but the one I really like is something called die harder.

290
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,059
There was a test suit called die hard and then obviously somebody took

291
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,080
it and made it better and it's called die harder now and it,

292
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,789
you can feed it like literally gigabytes of randomness

293
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:33,109
and it will conduct a ton of tests over it,

294
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,469
looking for statistical anomalies in your random numbers and, and funny enough,

295
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,820
and this is part of it too when, when you run these tests,

296
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:44,169
it is expected that some of them will fail because if it's truly random,

297
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,940
there will be outputs that aren't statistically random, right?

298
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,070
So, but what happens if you for example,

299
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,809
take your random number source and then run it through like AES

300
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,210
to block encrypt it to even further mungle. You know, munge, the data

301
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,969
does would, for example, has,

302
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,090
have you tested it with like say like what should be bad input

303
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,320
mangled sufficiently? Does it pass?

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,849
I, I mean, in that case,

305
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:12,380
it probably would because if you're doing something like AES encryption,

306
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,900
it's designed to and, and I'm

307
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:15,549
so really

308
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,200
that's basically what a pseudo random number generator is, is you take a,

309
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,700
a known input something good and easy.

310
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,700
And then you put it into something, say like AES

311
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,619
and

312
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,429
it just keeps mangling itself as it produces

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,219
output and you take some of the output and

314
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,140
shove it back into the input and you end up with kind of a feedback loop.

315
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,940
One of the problems you get if you kind of do

316
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,059
that and you have to be smart about your algorithm.

317
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,619
And in fact,

318
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,690
if you have a series of books called The Art of Computer Programming by uh Donald

319
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:42,979
Knuth,

320
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,099
he spends quite a lot of time talking about randomness.

321
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:49,140
But one of the issues you get is any time you have kind of that feedback loop,

322
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:51,340
you will eventually repeat

323
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,890
where the this the machine will kind of reset itself and

324
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,489
start over from the beginning and output the exact same outputs.

325
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,390
And so obviously, one of the challenges

326
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:04,460
is to make sure that mathematically your algorithm can run for, you know,

327
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,549
I don't know, a couple million years maybe before it kind of loops.

328
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,340
And it is believed, for example, that the Linux kernel pseudo

329
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:16,059
random number generator could run for thousands of years before

330
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,609
it would have a loop of constantly output cryptographic.

331
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,140
Well, I shouldn't say cryptographic but rather uh secure random numbers.

332
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,010
Yeah.

333
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,179
So it's, it's a crazy topic, man and it's super,

334
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,489
super hard to get this right as we see and

335
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,900
I would expect slot machines to be better than most.

336
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:34,099
We.

337
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,700
Are there any good libraries for this or is it like a case of roll your own?

338
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,820
Because that's like we see this in the crypto world all the time with like

339
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,809
an even simpler example, like go connect to a remote host over TLS

340
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,559
and the vast majority of people get it wrong.

341
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,830
If you're rolling your own random number generator, you probably have issues.

342
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,909
I mean, this is just like rolling your own crypto, right? This is really hard to do

343
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,169
now, I don't know what kind of operating system a slot machine runs,

344
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,369
but I would assume

345
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:09,530
they should be able to rely on the operating system for a statistically random

346
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,989
number generator that they can use. And now it is conceivable they can't

347
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:17,530
do to various regulations because I know like when you're

348
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:20,289
dealing with a slot machine is uh especially in Vegas,

349
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:24,179
the, the Nevada Gaming Commission has very strict requirements about how it works.

350
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,890
And what it does

351
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,349
and you have to give them copies of source code so they can review it and there's,

352
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,830
there's all these rules.

353
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,010
And so it would not surprise me if

354
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,710
the random number generator was rolled by somebody.

355
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:40,229
And now additionally, so it is the way the story works.

356
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,390
The slot machines that were reverse engineered were

357
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,989
commandeered in Russia, reverse engineered.

358
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,869
And there are some of the same machines in Las Vegas,

359
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,030
which means you're dealing with a machine

360
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,570
that has been shipped to various places on the globe,

361
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:56,289
right?

362
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,650
And anytime you're dealing with

363
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,590
various,

364
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,419
we'll say multinational

365
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,820
organizations such as this, it,

366
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,960
things can get difficult because everyone has their own rules.

367
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,059
But fundamentally,

368
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,270
if you can

369
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,229
view

370
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,390
the output of the the wheels on a slot machine and determine its internal state,

371
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,900
there is some crazy problems going on and you

372
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:24,039
are obviously using a terrible random number generator.

373
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,630
Well,

374
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,830
and the thing is it doesn't even have to

375
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,400
be a terrible random number generator just has to,

376
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,440
you know, even a 10 or 20%

377
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:31,760
advantage

378
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
is enough.

379
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:33,659
Oh, yeah. No.

380
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:34,039
But I mean,

381
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,119
what I'm saying is like even a subtle mistake is

382
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,479
enough for the bad guys to win in this case,

383
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,609
you know, and that's part of the real problem, right?

384
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,059
Um You know, blackjack's always my favorite example, right?

385
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,760
If you play it clean, the house has a slight advantage.

386
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,820
If you card count wrong the house now has a 20 to 30% advantage.

387
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,000
And if you card count correctly, you now have like

388
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,320
an advantage in the single digits,

389
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,309
like, have fun with that.

390
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:05,160
This is, this is why I will never card count because it just sounds miserable.

391
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,510
I, I agree. It, it's a lot of work and, well, not only that, I mean, what's the real

392
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,329
payback here? All right.

393
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,880
Well, no, no, but I

394
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,229
mean,

395
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:19,420
I'm never gonna be betting enough money to really make a difference.

396
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,390
And so I view kind of petty gambling as, you know, entertainment,

397
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,829
not as I'm going to make money doing this because, I mean, let's face it,

398
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,989
like getting a job and working will often pay better.

399
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,694
Yeah. Sort of gambling scam.

400
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:36,655
Well, it's, it's happened in the past though. Uh, for example, uh, yeah, here we go.

401
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:42,244
Um, there was a, um, a Toronto, uh, I believe it was a professor anyways.

402
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,214
He, um,

403
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,094
found a pattern in the scratch lottery tickets

404
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,704
because so scratch lottery tickets obviously again,

405
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,324
used, like,

406
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,540
they use some sort of random number generator to not

407
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,329
only generate these tickets but then they have to,

408
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,050
you know, make sure that they have a certain amount winning and not winning.

409
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,319
Right?

410
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:57,000
Because you don't want to, like,

411
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,000
generate a million winning cards out of a million cards.

412
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,500
Zero

413
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,170
winning cards. Right. That's called fraud at that point.

414
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,969
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So,

415
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,010
um, he found a pattern in these cards and he was able to, like,

416
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,189
actually go and look at the cards and be, like, I'll have like, that one,

417
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,410
that one and that one and that one.

418
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,310
And it's funny because he phoned the Ontario Gaming commission and they're like,

419
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:16,489
yeah.

420
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah, whatever. Crazy guy.

421
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:21,650
So he actually, like, went out with the OL G apparently. And, um,

422
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,069
he's like, let's go to, like, a gas station, buy a bunch of cards and, like,

423
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,079
they'll all be winners and he did that and the old G guy basically pooped himself,

424
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,780
you know, and they had to recall the game.

425
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,890
But now at the end of that article even, he says that if he, if he did this, like,

426
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,449
as his job, he would make less money than he does as a professor.

427
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,819
Yeah, that's the thing.

428
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,869
Yeah, he was like, I could make max about 100 150 grand a year doing this.

429
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,089
-- I don't
-- think it's even that because I doubt

430
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,109
your professors are making 100 and 50 grand.

431
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,550
I think it was like an incredibly paltry amount

432
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,000
and it's a lot of work.

433
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,160
Let's face it because you have to keep

434
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,369
going to different gas stations and buying lottery

435
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,359
tickets and figuring out which ones win and

436
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,410
which ones lose and then scratching them off.

437
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,609
And

438
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:01,430
it's,

439
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,890
it's one of those instances where, like, the crime just doesn't pay.

440
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,270
So, but I'm wondering with these, see, one of the things I'm really wondering.

441
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,329
So, I'm assuming these lottery machines, like,

442
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,489
what's the deal on software updates for them?

443
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,270
Uh,

444
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,310
you mean slot machines?

445
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,670
Do they get software updates? Like, is there,

446
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,069
do you like? So I know a bunch of these things are based on Linux.

447
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,910
Do they get like a yum update with, you know?

448
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,829
No,

449
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:24,949
no, they don't.

450
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,750
I mean, no, no, you got to think this is like an industrial control application,

451
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,900
right? Where

452
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,310
things

453
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:31,729
get.

454
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,229
-- So
-- let's face it. First of all, first of all,

455
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,469
when you have a slot machine on the floor with

456
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,910
a button or maybe six buttons,

457
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,900
you're not kind of the threat model. There is different

458
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:47,459
than if it was on the internet, right?

459
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,020
I mean, let's face it if there is a slot machine with a public IP

460
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,050
but you're doing something terribly wrong there. Ok.

461
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,560
Let's just start with that.

462
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,859
And so

463
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,199
these things unquestionably will receive updates for various reasons,

464
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,680
but it's obviously well understood and it's gonna

465
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,420
be rolled out in a controlled manner.

466
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,260
It's not like, oh, hey, it's, you know,

467
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,939
Wednesday night time to update all the slot machines.

468
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,479
No, no, there's a reason for it. Right.

469
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:15,989
And, and people are gonna understand what's happening, why it's happening.

470
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,739
It doesn't make sense.

471
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,510
You know, it's like I said, it's just like industrial controls where

472
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,949
if you have a temperature sensor, let's say on a machine,

473
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:25,270
you're not gonna willy nilly update it, right?

474
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,569
You're gonna wait for the machine to go down and then you're gonna be like,

475
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:29,689
does this make sense?

476
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:30,790
Do I need this?

477
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,109
-- And you might not? Right.
-- You might, because the other problem is, is, um,

478
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,810
some of these things,

479
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,750
are they using random number generators that are tied to the hardware?

480
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,140
Maybe

481
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,459
it is

482
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:45,250
conceivable that some of them are.

483
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:48,310
I, I don't, that part isn't totally clear to me

484
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:48,969
because I

485
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,349
know

486
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:53,130
-- you remember
-- back in the day A MD came out with that, um

487
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,250
They came out with a hardware-based R and G based on thermal noise within the CPU

488
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:58,660
and it was able, you know,

489
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,530
or Intel has their um oh

490
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,150
jeez, I'm forgetting the name of it. RD. Rand,

491
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,469
you know, uh that then aes encrypts it and shoves out like,

492
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:10,349
what is it like 10 gigabits per second of random data or something if you really want?

493
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,430
Right. Well, it should be clarified that the,

494
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:18,390
these internal hardware, random number generators are,

495
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,060
the trick is, and I, I think this is probably true of when you're dealing with,

496
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:24,189
with like a slot machine.

497
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,589
It's,

498
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,979
it's difficult to prove them

499
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,000
right or wrong sometimes because they could be broken

500
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:31,859
and

501
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,079
you don't know.

502
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,180
-- Right. Well,
-- speaking of broken, uh I don't know if you saw yesterday

503
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:39,680
um Intel's Adam C 2000 processor family

504
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:43,520
has a, like a defect in the timing circuits. And so like,

505
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,680
yeah, I'm a little annoyed because I own one of these.

506
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:45,859
Like,

507
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,609
I have a PF sense firewall here that

508
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,270
apparently might break itself if I reboot in about

509
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,410
a year.

510
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,199
So I'm a little bit annoyed.

511
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:54,729
I mean,

512
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,250
-- that's
-- a feature planned obsolescence.

513
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,900
I would assume that these places are rolling their own,

514
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:01,989
uh,

515
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,449
crypto and not relying on the operating system for that exact reason you just

516
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,910
stated is that they can sort of then say that they control it more

517
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:13,189
and perceived control is, you know, better. Right. Even if it is terrible.

518
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,910
Yeah, that's, that's probably fair.

519
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,510
And this is something that's really hard to get, right? Random numbers are hard.

520
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:24,130
Does G Lipsy not have a slot like slot, you know, random underscore slot.

521
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:25,439
Uh G

522
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,140
lib C just added actually, no, no, they, they just added a

523
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,599
system call on the version that came out a couple of days ago. In fact,

524
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:32,859
that's

525
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:33,140
true.

526
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,609
No, it's not the hardware stuff. It's the kernel based,

527
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,930
right? And, and so essentially where the kernel gets

528
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:45,395
its entropy and randomness from is up to the system administrator to decide because

529
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:46,074
like you said,

530
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:50,895
you've got the Intel and a MD hardware-based providers which you can use,

531
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:55,175
you can add cards to your systems that add randomness, you can

532
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,494
-- do nothing.
-- There's actually a website you can get randomness from

533
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,584
-- uh
-- which one, the lava lamps.

534
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:01,680
No,

535
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:04,400
there's like an actual website that will return random

536
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,630
data for the purposes of use with cryptography.

537
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,339
And I don't know if it was a joke or legit.

538
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,599
-- But it's, there,
-- there are,

539
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:12,750
there are various things that do that and I would be hesitant to trust any of.

540
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:13,780
It's

541
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:14,060
probably

542
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,280
not.

543
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,250
Right.

544
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,040
It, it depends what you need it for. Right. In some cases it could make sense.

545
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:21,760
In many cases. It could not.

546
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,420
Well,

547
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,180
I remember back in the day there was a website that would use

548
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:30,380
lava lamps to generate entropy and it had webcams set up taking pictures

549
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:32,040
-- actually
-- random.

550
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:37,329
I assume they are, they look fairly random and he had like 10 of them or something or

551
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,609
like a whole bunch of them on a wall.

552
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,280
And like he had this all automated because like a lava lamp,

553
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,109
you're supposed to turn off for eight hours a day or something like that.

554
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,510
And so various lamps would turn on and off and then I, I think it was,

555
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,130
the picture was taken through like a prism or something.

556
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,689
So it even messed up the image even more. And,

557
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,589
and he did all this crazy stuff. Generally speaking,

558
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,800
it sounded relatively secure.

559
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:03,880
-- But
-- a perfect example of this is uh the enigma

560
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,920
machine that the Germans used in World War Two,

561
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,199
right?

562
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:10,199
It had, it had the, it had a um so they basically had two main

563
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,280
um

564
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,390
systems. It had the rotors

565
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,719
and the rotors had like basically 26 letters on each

566
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,630
side and they were like randomly wired to each other.

567
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,479
So like on one side, A was on the other side, it was R and like B to Q and whatever.

568
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,060
And so there were three of these rotors originally

569
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,400
and then four and then I believe at 1.5.

570
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,420
Um And so the rotors would also rotate.

571
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,959
So essentially, every time you sent a letter through it would,

572
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:39,160
you'd get whatever response back plus, then it would rotate the uh rotor once and,

573
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,479
you know, once that rotor had rotated 26 times,

574
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:44,900
then the next rotor would rotate once and, you know, so on with the third one

575
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,310
and then there was also the shucker

576
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:49,109
board, the like sticker board, which was

577
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:51,189
you manually plugged like

578
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,459
letters together using wires.

579
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:56,109
And so there would be like a day code for the stucker board like, you know,

580
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,880
today QSP and RS,

581
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,709
whatever,

582
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:03,349
despite all this apparent randomness and mathematically like it

583
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,469
on paper was like, you know, 10 to the some obscenely huge number.

584
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,589
But, you know, there were some subtle flaws in it that allowed the allies to do

585
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,699
crypto analysis and build the bomb machines

586
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:19,420
that could then brute force the, the codes for the day.

587
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,900
So

588
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,099
I,

589
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,880
and so it looks great and they added all these

590
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,150
because what's interesting is the Germans actually got this design.

591
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,579
It was a Swiss commercial design originally, right?

592
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:30,660
The Swiss guy did it for commercial,

593
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,260
you know, companies to use, like to send, you know, secret messages, you know,

594
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,209
like go by IBM stock or whatever.

595
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,349
Um and they, you know,

596
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,579
and they took it and they, like,

597
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:41,180
made it more complicated because that's one

598
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,750
thing I've noticed with a lot of security

599
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,829
people will add complexity and be like, oh,

600
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,589
it's better now because there's like more steps involved.

601
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,239
-- And
-- uh,

602
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:54,209
yeah, you know, so like, uh a great example of that being two factor authentication,

603
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,869
we can easily complicate authentication and add stuff to it.

604
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,109
But

605
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:02,119
it may like my great favorite being my bank has multiple factor

606
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,979
authentication in the form of I have multiple passwords with them,

607
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,819
right? They have my secret, they're known as a secret question.

608
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,300
Well, and it technically is multiple factors, but they're all the same type.

609
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,339
So they all have the exact same failure scenario which is somebody like

610
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,630
watches me type it in or somebody sniffs my keyboard or whatever, you know,

611
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,510
but one attack will get all of them.

612
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,069
-- Ok.
-- But let's go back to enigma first. And the

613
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:29,150
topic of randomness is

614
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,459
the enigma itself

615
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,530
was

616
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,819
pretty good.

617
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:34,780
The

618
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,329
problem,

619
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,959
the problem wasn't really the enigma.

620
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:41,810
The problem is the Germans sent the weather report every single,

621
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,280
like very German of them, right?

622
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:45,780
Every day, same thing.

623
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,900
And so the allies had a message

624
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,520
-- they could, they were looking for,
-- they had a known plain text attack, right?

625
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:52,819
Because yeah,

626
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:55,680
this guy started the weather report at the same time with Heil Hitler and all that.

627
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,319
But even without that,

628
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,430
they, the allies still would have been able to crack it.

629
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:03,119
-- It just would have been much, much harder.
-- It would have been different.

630
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:06,430
I don't think they would have had near the rate of success they did.

631
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:06,619
I mean,

632
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,239
they reached a point where they were cracking the code for the day by lunchtime.

633
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,989
Right. That would not have been the case. Had there not been,

634
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,410
you know, known plain text

635
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:17,329
or

636
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:19,260
even with them,

637
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,880
like cracking the day code from a week ago and reading

638
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,640
all those clear text messages would still be hugely helpful.

639
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,760
Yes.

640
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,800
And so this brings us back to the slot

641
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,520
machine now is if you're doing randomness correctly,

642
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,599
even if people can figure out what the random

643
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,479
number is inside of the random number generator,

644
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,800
it shouldn't be valuable to them.

645
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,040
And this is even more crazy than that

646
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,839
because this isn't just the internal random state.

647
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,959
This is seeing something on the outside which, you know, every,

648
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,810
every time you use some randomness,

649
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,599
you should essentially be shedding some bits is the idea.

650
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,339
So you, you know,

651
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,500
the the random number generator doesn't return all the

652
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,160
bits and then if you're doing something with it,

653
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,160
you wouldn't return all, you know what I mean as it's as it's going along.

654
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,829
And so I would expect by the time

655
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:04,479
it makes it to

656
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
the end user,

657
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:10,829
you, I would, I would think you've gone from say 32 bits to like six,

658
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:11,630
right?

659
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,989
And if you can figure out the random state from that

660
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,109
you have a seriously broken generator.

661
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,719
Yeah. No, it's well and well, and actually I'm gonna s

662
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,479
technically disagree with you on this.

663
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:27,270
I mean, you may have a valid generator but you're using it wrong.

664
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,130
That too is possible.

665
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,189
No, I'm, I'm gonna say no, if you can

666
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,410
predict the internal state of a random number generator,

667
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:40,439
it is a broken generator by design. And I'm just going to categorically say that.

668
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:44,349
-- So
-- you're saying the generator internally should already be hiding and masking

669
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:45,140
-- part of the output.
-- So,

670
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,150
so essentially we're not allowing people to do dumb,

671
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,510
like even if they do do dumb things, the generator itself will be like, no, I,

672
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,689
I've already internally accounted for that.

673
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,510
If I collect a gigabyte of random data from the Linux kernel,

674
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,310
you know, dev you random

675
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,670
and I give it to you. You should not be able to figure out what the next bit

676
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,709
or I'm sorry

677
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,229
the next bit. Yes, you 50% chance of guessing. But the next bite

678
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,349
that comes out of that generator, right? You should not be able to do that.

679
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,069
If you can do that. That is a broken generator.

680
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:19,949
No, I'll agree with you on that.

681
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,660
And I mean, I guess it really boils down to is, you know, how much of this

682
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,290
is sort of happening within the generator and how much is the

683
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,540
generator passing stuff to the application which then does stupid stuff.

684
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,140
It's probably a combination of everything

685
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:32,739
right

686
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:37,400
now. We always assume sort of that. Oh, they made a mistake.

687
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,000
But how do we know this wasn't malicious.

688
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,199
I, I wouldn't say it's impossible but I would guess it was

689
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,430
an accident.

690
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:51,040
I think the vast majority of problems like this are accidents.

691
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,000
I suspect this is true. But,

692
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:57,729
uh, at the same time I, I mean, the people writing this stuff, I, I

693
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,989
would go to Ockham's Razor and say that no,

694
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,390
they're not so smart that they're maliciously doing this.

695
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,530
It would be like, no, they're,

696
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:04,900
they took comp sign and they're good at

697
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,989
comp sci but they're not good at random numbers

698
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:11,339
and that just people are people and this is where we ended up, you know,

699
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,130
much like, you know, every time we build a bridge that falls down,

700
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,349
like the engineers really didn't mean for that to happen.

701
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,170
That's right.

702
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,949
So I've been watching disaster, uh, documentaries again. Some really bad ones.

703
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,640
I just really small flaws.

704
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,459
Like they painted over the cracks so they couldn't

705
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,640
visually inspect them and then like 50 years later,

706
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,520
oops, it fell down.

707
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:33,319
Right. That what a great idea guys,

708
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,000
-- it'll
-- be,

709
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,719
you gotta paint the bridge so it doesn't rest.

710
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,839
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you do.

711
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,459
I, I won't disagree with that,

712
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,079
but it's damned if you do. Damned if you don't

713
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,560
know.

714
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,560
Uh, I guess maybe the moral of the story is they should all buy a di somatic.

715
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,219
What is it? Di somatic?

716
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,689
-- This
-- guy built this crazy mechanical machine that rolls a bunch

717
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,010
of six sided dice like a million times a day.

718
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,300
Right.

719
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:59,939
-- It's got the most beautiful, horrible
-- noise.

720
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,300
It is fantastic.

721
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:05,099
It was not only did you ever see that the dice wear out rather quickly, actually.

722
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:05,890
Yeah.

723
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,380
Yeah, I was, uh, II, I don't remember if I saw a video or I read a thing about this, But,

724
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
yeah, he was talking about the long,

725
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,349
well, you gotta think as you roll a square, dye

726
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,380
it round around. Right.

727
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,339
And so eventually it becomes nearly unusable because it's so rounded

728
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,310
because I know casinos, like, regularly, like,

729
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,880
I think on a daily basis or even more change out their cards and their dice and,

730
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,400
-- you know,
-- oh,

731
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:30,459
man, they change them constantly.

732
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,459
I mean, so the last time I was in Vegas,

733
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,699
actually I bought a bunch of cards and dice because they,

734
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,609
they sell the old ones in the shops

735
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,979
and it's, it's fun, you know, I,

736
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,380
I love casino dice because they're so big and cool looking

737
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,449
and in theory they are perfectly balanced.

738
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,430
Right? So they

739
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:44,650
say,

740
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,699
but no, no, it's, uh, they have rules about when they change the dice and, like,

741
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:52,410
if you roll, I think every time when you're playing craps you roll, uh, 21 snake eyes,

742
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,290
they change a dice

743
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,540
like every time.

744
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,359
Yeah. Yeah.

745
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,689
And there's, there's a bunch of rules. Well, I mean, I get it right.

746
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:01,280
They want, they want to keep the dice moving because none of this is perfect. Right.

747
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,069
I'm sure they're doing,

748
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,599
probably trying to palm

749
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,750
the dice and swap them and God knows what else.

750
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,099
Yeah, I'm sure it happened.

751
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:10,689
Well, you're gonna get your legs broke but it's conceivable.

752
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,729
It's conceivable if somebody tries. But, I mean, practically speaking,

753
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:15,939
if you change the dice constantly then it's just

754
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,170
you,

755
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,250
but you,

756
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,160
unless you bring like a purse full of them,

757
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,300
but here's the deal, right?

758
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,660
Is the casinos are probably buying dice by

759
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,599
the truckload and they probably test what,

760
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:31,239
10% of them, maybe less for, for various, we'll say dice quality issues.

761
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,280
I have no idea what that means.

762
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,655
-- Sigma worked out.
-- I have no doubt. I, I can,

763
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,364
it would be fascinating to watch what they do

764
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,214
but they'd probably have to like blind or something.

765
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:41,814
One of the funny things is for dice.

766
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:44,324
I know one of the simplest tests is they have a spinner for it.

767
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:46,805
They have, it's two little arms that hold the dye

768
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,395
and they just spin the dye.

769
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,339
Uh, you can do that with, with water.

770
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:53,699
You, you, uh, if you drop, well, not all dice, I've tried this, a lot of,

771
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:55,130
a lot of my dice actually sink.

772
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,569
But

773
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,060
if,

774
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,609
if you, uh, mix salt in with water and drop the dice in,

775
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:03,540
you can see if they're evenly weighted or if they are consistently kind of, you know,

776
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,170
falling to a certain state because obviously one side's heavier than the other.

777
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,979
But anyway, here's my point about casino dice. Right.

778
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,069
They're buying it by the truckload.

779
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,670
They're testing a small number of them

780
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,699
and you know, that some of those dice would fail testing if they were put in testing.

781
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,680
And so obviously, by changing them on a consistent basis,

782
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,949
even when you might have a set of dice that

783
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,530
favor the player or favor the house for that matter.

784
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,619
Right? Because let's face it. When you're a casino,

785
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,469
you, you don't want to win all the time.

786
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,520
Because if you, if the players never win, they don't come back. Right?

787
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,969
They have to win sometimes

788
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,469
in psycho

789
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,500
psychology, right? Like they've done the thing,

790
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,494
the rats where if you give the rat a lever to get a

791
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:40,614
food pellet every time the rat eats as much food as they need

792
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,295
and leaves and goes and has an out. But if you make it a random reward,

793
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:47,444
-- those poor little rats just sit there hammering away at the lever.
-- I

794
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:51,305
know it's uh you know, that's the thing I love about Las Vegas. It is,

795
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,609
it is like a place built to entertain monkeys

796
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:00,050
because everything there is about just like it appeals to that, that monkey brain,

797
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,650
you know, prehistoric of humans to draw you in and keep you there.

798
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,099
And it's like everything blinks, everything makes no, you know,

799
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:08,649
push button win push button.

800
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,739
Win. Yay me. Look what

801
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,330
it's just,

802
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,618
oh, I love it. It's, it's amazing

803
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,239
on so many levels and, like,

804
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:19,858
I know they're just abusing every innate feature of my brain when I go there.

805
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:23,197
But I still like it amuses me to no end. And I love it.

806
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,398
You know, it's funny you mentioned this,

807
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:25,878
we didn't have this in the show notes for today,

808
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:28,339
but Google apparently has started hiring

809
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,217
some,

810
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:31,498
you know, neuroscientists and whatnot

811
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:35,108
to help them make better security warnings. In Chrome.

812
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:35,329
I

813
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:35,958
saw that.

814
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,599
That was

815
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,228
awesome.

816
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:41,079
Yeah, because I'll admit to, you know, so there's this, there's a well known, uh,

817
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,799
thing called alarm fatigue.

818
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:45,358
Uh, and a great example of it is hospitals, right? Like

819
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:48,009
you have all this equipment that like beeps and buzzes, you know,

820
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,638
if your heart rate drops your, whatever, you know,

821
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,739
you fall out of whatever parameters are set.

822
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,998
And so the problem is like, um, you know,

823
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,918
these things are going off constantly and then people start to ignore them.

824
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,899
Right? Because 99.9 times out of 100

825
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,590
it's nothing really serious.

826
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,370
It's just the sensor shifted or the guy rolled over or whatever. Right.

827
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,370
But it's, you know,

828
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:10,570
and then that one in 1000 times the poor guy is having a heart attack or whatever.

829
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,729
Um,

830
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
and so what they found at one hospital is they disabled,

831
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,330
like 90% of the lower level alarms and

832
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,820
they actually found it vastly improved things and,

833
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,070
you know, the same thing with here, right.

834
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,219
We're, we're dealing with, you know,

835
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:24,129
every time people get that browser warning that pops up says that.

836
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:27,899
Do you really wanna like, install like dancing hamster dot exc and you know,

837
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:30,350
and one day they're, they're either going to accidentally or otherwise

838
00:35:30,455 --> 00:35:31,195
click. Yes.

839
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:36,715
Well, it's even more crazy than that is, let's say a browser boarding pops up

840
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,955
as you're watching a youtube video.

841
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:42,395
What are you gonna do? Right. I, I'm watching a dancing bear.

842
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:46,034
I'm gonna click, go away now because I wanna watch that bear dance.

843
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,554
Whereas if they wait till the video is done

844
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,840
now, I'm like, oh, wow. A pop up. What is that? Right?

845
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,189
I totally get this because

846
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:57,250
I have been in multiple situations.

847
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,629
Like my favorite example is when you're about to give a presentation,

848
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,149
you plug in your laptop and it's like there are 400 critical updates for you.

849
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,735
Like click, go away. Right? You're not gonna install them right?

850
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:08,735
Then you're about to give a presentation.

851
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,445
Although, although funny enough,

852
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:14,014
I've also been in talks where people plug their computer in and they

853
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:17,304
start talking and Windows is like rebooting to install updates and it like,

854
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:18,375
they don't have a choice, right?

855
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,284
And you just sit there. It's like if you ran Linux

856
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,344
it wouldn't do that.

857
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,110
Yeah. I always like the day that I leave, I, I update

858
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:31,020
-- everything.
-- I never update the day I leave. I usually do it two or three days before.

859
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,090
And so funny enough, I was on a trip one time and this was, I was gone for, I think,

860
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,909
eight or nine days

861
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,889
and on the,

862
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:41,840
I get to the airport and my phone tells me there's an update to Android.

863
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,010
I'm like, I so wanna click install but like,

864
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,449
I can't do this while I'm not at home

865
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:50,679
because if my phone disappears and no longer works,

866
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:52,949
I'm like, totally out of luck.

867
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:53,320
You think?

868
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,110
Well, these days when you travel, like my plane tickets on my phone,

869
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,649
my taxi is on my phone, my directions, like everything is there.

870
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,000
If I didn't have my phone,

871
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,649
you find me like wandering, you know, alone in the streets,

872
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,409
homeless with no clothes or something.

873
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:07,689
Like it would be horrible.

874
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,189
No, I agree completely. Like, uh

875
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:11,169
yeah,

876
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:13,590
this is one of the reasons I take my ipad with me is

877
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,709
I sort of have a copy of most of what's on my phone,

878
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,510
on my ipad.

879
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,110
I have a tablet and that's true. I could.

880
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,260
No, I'm not going to find out. No stop this. It's not

881
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:23,959
iphone. It just all auto

882
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,169
-- sync and yeah,
-- you know, it doesn't matter. Right?

883
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,370
And an iphone can poop itself just as easily as an Android phone,

884
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,570
right? But I mean, it's easier to keep an iphone and an ipad in sync.

885
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,729
-- But
-- then I would need an ipad and then I'd probably need a Mac and it would just,

886
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,860
it would be like the downward spiral curd.

887
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,479
I don't need that.

888
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,570
II, I,

889
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,399
I gave up a long time ago. I just don't want to fight with stuff anymore.

890
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,810
I know. I know. I know. We, we discuss this all the time.

891
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:50,639
Yeah. But, uh, going back to the random numbers. So

892
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,179
these Russians, you know, they're, they're not giving people the software to do it.

893
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,189
Although I'm guessing that, you know,

894
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,300
the software to do it probably requires some CPU time or whatever.

895
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,959
And I'm assuming they're renting time on, like GP US or something to crunch it.

896
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,429
But, um, because of the way they've set it up, uh, the,

897
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:08,149
the, the article in Wired stated

898
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,770
that these guys who are actually physically going to the casinos

899
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,989
and playing to win the money then have to send like,

900
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,909
90% of it back to Russia.

901
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,510
Yeah.

902
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,510
Well, not only that, the, like you said,

903
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,229
they're using their cell phone to essentially, like, like Skype, the, the,

904
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,310
you know, the mothership

905
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,949
and they're doing and the beauty of that as

906
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:28,310
well is even if the authorities confiscate that phone,

907
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,350
they don't know exactly what's going on. Like, we don't know exactly how this works.

908
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,500
We have no idea.

909
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,929
And so, yeah, I mean, it's just,

910
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,489
it's really interesting that they maintain that level of, you know,

911
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,429
the bad guys are, are, I hate to say it,

912
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:43,689
but the bad guys are getting really smart and this is a, you know, an extremely,

913
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:46,479
you know, an extreme form of DRM effectively,

914
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:48,219
you know, it's, it's, well, it's,

915
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,310
yeah, it's cheating

916
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,669
service, you know.

917
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:52,379
Right.

918
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,250
But, but, well, you have a great point here is you, you mentioned, you know,

919
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,870
crime is getting more, I, I guess complex and nuanced is,

920
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,510
you know, crime inc is kind of being become known as a thing.

921
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,270
I've seen it referenced in, in much literature up to this point.

922
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,889
And if I was going to say so,

923
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:13,790
I think Crime Inc is innovating faster than our industry is.

924
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,600
-- Oh, for sure.
-- And that's kind of terrifying,

925
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,399
but they have more of an incentive to,

926
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,080
they have a huge,

927
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,379
you know, every time a hole gets plugged, they,

928
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,800
you know, like, remember I remember back in the day, you know, like when they would,

929
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,000
um,

930
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,850
they would just register domain names because you had like,

931
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,350
what a couple of days to register it for free before it lapsed

932
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:36,399
and they just, they, they killed that by what is it a 25 cent fee now?

933
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:37,979
Boom, upfront, 25 cent fee.

934
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,739
So it's not really worth it.

935
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,760
So now, you know, they're,

936
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,959
they're hacking people's domain accounts and setting up subdomains,

937
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,500
you know.

938
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,689
So, like,

939
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:50,620
because the reality too is these guys, like, they're, they have budgets,

940
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:51,449
right?

941
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:53,439
They have to have return on investment otherwise, you know,

942
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,080
Luigi is gonna break their legs.

943
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:55,750
Yeah.

944
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,360
Well, So this is one of the challenges we have as well is in a lot of security work.

945
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,899
There isn't really a return on investment.

946
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:06,239
There's ideally something terrible doesn't happen,

947
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,260
but you can't prove something terrible.

948
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,810
Like, how many times did you not get hacked today, Kurt?

949
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:11,959
And see

950
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,350
that's, and I told you this phrase. But, uh, for our listeners,

951
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:18,260
I was watching an airline safety thing and it was a case in Brazil

952
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,699
where they ran off the runway and crashed big time and there's a whole,

953
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,969
there's like basically three different sets of factors.

954
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:23,469
But, but

955
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,300
anyways,

956
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,979
the point being is the senior guy talking about this,

957
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,919
talked about how

958
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,600
they,

959
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,040
they need to investigate this and they need to deal with this so that they can quote,

960
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,699
continue improving the safety record unquote,

961
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,889
not like prevent air crashes and not like, make sure this never happens again.

962
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,169
But just overall, statistically, like, globally, you know, when you get on a plane,

963
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:47,570
there's like that chance of you not stepping off that plane alive,

964
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,560
you know, it keeps getting better and better.

965
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,800
Like chances are you're gonna be ok,

966
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,459
you know, same thing with cars, right?

967
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:57,439
Cars with airbags and with seat, you know, three point seatbelts and with

968
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,840
now side impact airbags and with, you know, crumple zones and all of that, you know,

969
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,879
every time you step in a car now you're, you know,

970
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,679
there's less of a chance you're not going to get out of that car alive

971
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:07,239
and I, I eagerly,

972
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:11,395
-- our computer overlords driving us everywhere we need to go.
-- Oh, me too.

973
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:11,534
Yeah,

974
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:13,264
I rear ended some poor lady last night at like

975
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:15,195
five kilometers an hour on a sheet of ice.

976
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,155
And I just physically could not stop.

977
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:20,195
Like, when I actually got out of the car to make sure she was ok.

978
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,524
I almost fell over on my ass because it was so slippery

979
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,760
like it. Yeah, because people were spinning their tires.

980
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,260
We had some fresh snow and so boom, I,

981
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,949
you know, it's a left turn lane, right. Awesome.

982
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,610
Um, but anyways, you know, and, but I think part of the problem is, you know,

983
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,840
we don't have any sort of overall like safety

984
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,790
board for computers or the internet or whatever.

985
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,469
So we have no idea what our current accident rate is.

986
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,500
It probably wouldn't be very good.

987
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,679
No.

988
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:47,350
You know, and then part of the problem too is like, we don't,

989
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:47,610
a

990
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,189
lot of what happens in computers isn't really accidents.

991
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,919
It's like a hacker doing something intentionally malicious,

992
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,419
you know,

993
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,649
and most industries don't have to deal with the

994
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,340
level of this that we have to deal with.

995
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,870
Right. Like,

996
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,250
you know, mcdonald's, for example,

997
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,429
doesn't have like a million people trying to

998
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,679
walk into their stores virtually with knives,

999
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,399
robbing them,

1000
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,469
you know, same for banks. Right. They have a lot.

1001
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,979
Yeah. But I mean, it's a, it's a known and understood pro problem.

1002
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,520
Like, you know, uh, if you go to a bank now they have like,

1003
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,389
that little armored ATM computer thing where

1004
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:21,360
all the cash comes out of it and all the cash goes into, you know,

1005
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,139
they don't have drawers full of cash anymore,

1006
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:26,120
-- or at least in Canada they don't
-- vault has no money in it.

1007
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:26,949
Yeah.

1008
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:30,909
You know, I went to deposit some cash and, like, in past I haven't done this in like,

1009
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,979
10 years and past they would have shoved it into their drawer.

1010
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,625
Now. She, like, fed it into this, like, big armored, the machine and it, like,

1011
00:42:37,314 --> 00:42:37,784
disappear.

1012
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:42,675
-- Well,
-- it's, it's very similar to the safes in gas stations,

1013
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:44,735
electronic and the,

1014
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:47,895
the guy working behind the counter can't open it and the register

1015
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:50,294
has a couple of 100 bucks in it at the most.

1016
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:51,544
Yeah, exactly.

1017
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:54,955
And so, you know, we're dealing with the unique challenges but fundamentally,

1018
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:58,185
and this is one of the reasons I, I want to extend CV is I wanna get AAA,

1019
00:42:58,195 --> 00:43:00,455
I wanna get a sense of how bad it is.

1020
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,090
You know, every time I see these, uh, articles like, um,

1021
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,050
that article from France where they were talking about like

1022
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:10,280
25 or 27 or whatever, 20 some 1000 cyber attacks from Russia regarding the election.

1023
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:10,770
And I'm like,

1024
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:14,850
what does that even mean? Like, is that a port scan? Is that an actual login attempt?

1025
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,770
Is that

1026
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:17,070
like what?

1027
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,909
Right. Yeah.

1028
00:43:17,919 --> 00:43:19,750
And it's not well defined and a lot of

1029
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,159
these organizations that publish this kind of stuff,

1030
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:24,419
they have an agenda so they wanna play it up.

1031
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:24,939
Right.

1032
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:25,979
Yeah, I mean,

1033
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:29,550
technically every single port scan is a hack attempt or is it a part of like,

1034
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,530
just one guy running n map against your entire entire class?

1035
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,030
B?

1036
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,679
Um, so, yeah, speaking of the cyber,

1037
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,199
you know, there's that guy that scanned,

1038
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:40,179
like all of North Korea like repeatedly because apparently

1039
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:43,389
North Korea has like a slash 22 of address space

1040
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,310
and then like two other address blocks one through uh what was it?

1041
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,219
China, some Chinese telecom provider

1042
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,739
and the other one through a European satellite provider. And it's like,

1043
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,330
does that count as a cyber attack or

1044
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:54,989
-- did
-- he shut down their

1045
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:56,570
delink router or, I mean,

1046
00:43:56,889 --> 00:44:00,030
actually he found a Cisco router with remotely

1047
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,149
accessible sh port 8443 and something else.

1048
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:06,770
But yeah, so going back to this, I mean, with these things, we just,

1049
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,370
we kind of don't know

1050
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,610
the state of how bad it is, you know, I mean, I've, I've not,

1051
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,639
I've seen numbers on supposed losses to cybercrime

1052
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:16,770
and they're like all over the place.

1053
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,399
In some cases, I've seen, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars.

1054
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:21,149
Well,

1055
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,610
it's a very political topic still because you have the defenders want to

1056
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,090
play it up because they want more budget to do what they do.

1057
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,129
And then you have some realists who try to be like, uh, I don't think it's quite there.

1058
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,969
-- And then
-- you have about your militant moderates,

1059
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,530
-- yes,
-- militant moderate. That's true.

1060
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:40,510
Uh, that my, my blog post, we won't get into that right now.

1061
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,949
We can, we can cover that maybe in the future.

1062
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:45,540
But then you've also got essentially people who deny it

1063
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,610
who think everything's great and nothing's wrong and who's right.

1064
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,729
You know, if I had to guess it's in the middle, I mean, it generally is. Right.

1065
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:55,260
Any time you have people on either side of any sort of argument,

1066
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,949
the answer is almost always in the middle.

1067
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,199
Yeah. No, it's, um, well, and the problem too is it's not evenly distributed.

1068
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:06,169
Right. So, for some people it is truly terrible and for other people it's like,

1069
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,350
mm,

1070
00:45:06,459 --> 00:45:06,540
I

1071
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,020
mean, that's fair. That's fair. Right.

1072
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,860
I, I can only imagine what the likes of Facebook and Google see per day

1073
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,620
on the attack scale. It's gotta be outrageous.

1074
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:18,250
One thing I discovered I was buying some Ticketmaster tickets.

1075
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,879
You have four attempts to lock in to log in before they lock your account.

1076
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,030
-- That seems fair. I think most online
-- all you

1077
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
-- need
-- is a person's email address.

1078
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:27,330
-- Yeah. And then
-- you

1079
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,429
-- can
-- lock to lock their account.

1080
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:30,320
I assume you can unlock it somehow.

1081
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:30,800
Right?

1082
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,550
I hope so. Oh, ok.

1083
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:34,469
If not

1084
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:39,290
poorly designed, you should. I know your email address. Kurt, I'll, I'll find out.

1085
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:42,199
Please don't. I'm still trying to get some tickets swapped.

1086
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:42,949
I see.

1087
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:45,030
Well, let's face it too in the case of that,

1088
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,489
like worst case you pick up your telephone and you call them, right?

1089
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,080
And they're gonna help you out on the phone.

1090
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,050
So as long as there's alternative means to go around some of these, it's ok.

1091
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,729
-- I don't have an issue,
-- but that can also be a problem because for example,

1092
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:01,250
I know someone that just had their Instagram account hacked.

1093
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:03,350
Um, you know, they tried to,

1094
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,229
they got, um, an actual text message from a friend saying, you know, I,

1095
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,550
I tried to take you on an Instagram picture and it says your accounts like

1096
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:11,729
wonky or something. So

1097
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,750
this person tried to log into their account and they couldn't.

1098
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:17,070
And then they, um,

1099
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:21,129
uh, it basically said, like, helpful, you know, like we've changed, uh,

1100
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:24,189
they went to do the, uh, the password reset and they're like, oh, you know,

1101
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,090
we've emailed your new password to, you know,

1102
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,310
um, a partially obfuscated email address ending in.ru

1103
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,429
and this person's like, whoops. No, that's not me.

1104
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,459
Um, and it's,

1105
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:36,399
it's crazy is Instagram and Facebook actually have like a reasonably sane

1106
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:39,510
account recovery procedure that involves like filling out a web form.

1107
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,649
And then essentially they have you send like a

1108
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,590
proof of life picture of like yourself with,

1109
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,560
uh, like a, it was like a seven digit code number written down on it.

1110
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,989
Like you have to write on this piece of paper, your name,

1111
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,250
your email address and this like seven digit random code they send,

1112
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,080
you take a picture of that and send it back to them.

1113
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:57,370
Uh, and then, you know, hope, well, you'll see what happens. And, I mean,

1114
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,219
it's interesting to me because there, for example,

1115
00:46:59,229 --> 00:47:01,699
like Facebook and Instagram theoretically would,

1116
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,570
well, they'd have pictures of you quite often.

1117
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:05,360
Right.

1118
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:06,459
Right. Right.

1119
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:10,580
Well, I, I wonder if their a is, are smart enough to figure out that, you know,

1120
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,540
the guy who just sent a picture uh in is,

1121
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:17,500
is the same guy in, you know, 90% of the pictures that are on this account.

1122
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:18,290
Although

1123
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:21,770
that wouldn't always work because like, in my case, in various things like that,

1124
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,570
I never post pictures of myself.

1125
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:25,949
Well, but, or even simple things like just,

1126
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:29,149
just reset the account to the previous email address and reset the password,

1127
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,350
you know, unless the person sold the account and is then hijack

1128
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:35,645
it back to resell it again or something, you know,

1129
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:37,764
it's generally not going to be a huge problem.

1130
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:42,725
I would hope there's not a huge market in selling your own Instagram account.

1131
00:47:43,264 --> 00:47:45,254
-- Uh
-- There is for Twitter, that Twitter bot

1132
00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:48,925
thing that was like, what 350,000 accounts, you know.

1133
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:50,899
So there is

1134
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:53,290
people trying to monetize these things through, you know,

1135
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,979
selling likes or shares or

1136
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,340
-- whatever
-- it's different, right? I mean,

1137
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,979
you can create a fake Twitter account.

1138
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,459
That's not hard to do.

1139
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:03,209
No.

1140
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,810
But if it's easy to hijack an account,

1141
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,629
you can grab real accounts that have established credit and history.

1142
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:08,810
I see what you're saying.

1143
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:11,800
You know, it's like Reddit, right? I have a nine year old account at Reddit.

1144
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:13,860
I mean, same thing has happened with DNS now, right.

1145
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:17,169
One of the, one of the good predictors for DNS shenanigans is,

1146
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:18,489
how fresh is this domain,

1147
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:19,439
right? Like,

1148
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,280
you know, with DNS domain names, the, you know,

1149
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,010
if a domain name is like more than a decade old, chances are,

1150
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,840
it's probably not involved in too many, you know,

1151
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,010
shenanigans or not naughty things,

1152
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,449
you know, same thing with like a linkedin or Facebook account.

1153
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:33,050
You know, it's, if it's 10 or 20 years old, either, you know,

1154
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,379
these bad guys are playing the Long Con which

1155
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:38,179
generally speaking from what I've seen they don't bother with,

1156
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,260
you know, these guys want immediate returns.

1157
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,659
Yeah, there's, there's no money in the long Con. Let's face it.

1158
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:46,459
It's you, when you're doing crime, you need to get in and get out.

1159
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:48,820
I mean, that's, that's the return on investment there.

1160
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,199
It's just like this random generator on the slot machine.

1161
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:54,205
Like they, no, this scam won't last forever.

1162
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:54,735
And in fact,

1163
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:58,405
I would imagine Vegas is paying attention to this and as soon

1164
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:00,604
as they have a machine that the payout isn't quite right.

1165
00:49:00,614 --> 00:49:02,895
It's gone. Right. They're gonna, they're gonna yank it off.

1166
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:05,245
The floor immediately and they're gonna replace it with something

1167
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:07,604
else and they're gonna start paying attention to this because,

1168
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,929
I mean, it is what it is. Right.

1169
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:10,189
And I,

1170
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,909
I guess ironically they have the big data to back

1171
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,870
this up and so they will know when something isn't.

1172
00:49:15,879 --> 00:49:16,280
Right.

1173
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,800
I'm guessing what has happened in the past is security consultants have had,

1174
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,989
have said, oh, you know, we're not 100% certain about this random number generator.

1175
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,120
In theory somebody could xy and Z but,

1176
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,959
you know, unless you pay me like 100,000 bucks to spend the time actually doing it.

1177
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:32,280
I, I'm not gonna say yes or no conclusively.

1178
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,360
Well, somebody in Russia did it for them.

1179
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:40,179
Like I remember all the times where, you know, oh, this flaw isn't exploitable.

1180
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:42,310
And then, you know, a week later somebody comes up with a

1181
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,199
melo module.

1182
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:47,199
I remember being one of those people that was quite happy

1183
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:50,870
to assure the world something wasn't exploitable and that it was.

1184
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,969
And so now in my old age,

1185
00:49:52,979 --> 00:49:56,399
I've become smart enough to never say something is impossible

1186
00:49:56,669 --> 00:50:00,959
because it always is, man. It just takes a smart person long enough to get you there.

1187
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,889
All right. I think it's time, Kurt.

1188
00:50:03,899 --> 00:50:07,300
We should wrap this one up for those of you listening.

1189
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:11,850
You can go to open source Security podcast.com and get links to

1190
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,050
all of the exciting and bizarre things we've talked about today.

1191
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,729
You can find a link there to our Twitter

1192
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:22,649
handles. So, Kurt and I love feedback by all means, send it to us.

1193
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:25,770
You can find a link to we have a Facebook group.

1194
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,850
You're welcome to join and have various

1195
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,570
discussions with other like minded individuals.

1196
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:33,469
There are obviously past shows and all the other fun things as well.

1197
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,469
And

1198
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:38,510
I guess I have nothing else to say, Kurt.

1199
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,110
I would like you to have a fantastic rest of the day.

1200
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,870
And thanks for listening, everybody.

1201
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,540
-- Yeah. And, uh, well, we look forward to seeing you at RS A
-- Absolutely.

1202
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,800
Yeah, if you're going to Rs A, let us know and we could, you know,

1203
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,409
maybe catch up and have a chat or something.

1204
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:55,870
And I guess given the topic of the show, shall we leave on a random number?

1205
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,550
Six,

1206
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,520
1717, everybody.

1207
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,550
-- That's a good random number. Sure.
-- It is. It is a good random number.

1208
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,280
All, all random numbers are good, Kurt.

1209
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,000
There are no such thing as bad random numbers. Only bad random number generators.

1210
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,469
Two is a pretty bad random number.

1211
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,570
Have a good day, Kurt.

1212
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:15,600
You too.
