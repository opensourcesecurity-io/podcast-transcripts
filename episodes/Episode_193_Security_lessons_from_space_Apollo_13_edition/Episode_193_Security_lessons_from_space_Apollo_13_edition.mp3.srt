Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 10

1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,149
9876. We have pre ignition

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,690
43210. Blast off

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,799
with myself, Kurtz Fried and my partner in thought crime, Josh Preser,

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,069
-- it was
-- inconsistent.

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,250
So obviously I would hope at this point everyone has guessed that space

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,370
is going to be on the list of things to talk about.

7
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:28,899
Now,

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,220
I want to say one interesting thing that most people don't know which surprises me.

9
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,689
Maybe, but maybe I'm just a weirdo

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,770
the area code for the area in Florida where NASA is located is 321.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,130
So how cool is that

12
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:43,020
it?

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,930
Yeah, it is cool. So ok, right now when Kurt and I are recording this,

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,330
we are 50 years

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,840
into 50 years ago, I should say right now.

16
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:55,479
-- Apollo 13, I have
-- to interrupt, I have to interrupt.

17
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,009
There's an area code for the International Space Station phone.

18
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:58,970
It's Oh

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,130
no, it's in Houston. No, they cheated. It's just a Houston phone number.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,450
That'd be epic.

21
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,010
I'm sad now,

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,080
never mind you can cut that hair.

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,660
No, I'm leaving that in.

24
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,180
-- That's because I
-- was

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,660
-- like,
-- because I literally Googled, like area code for space.

26
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:20,099
-- And I'm like, oh, there's one. No, there isn't.
-- It, it should be like star, star Star.

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,500
But anyway,

28
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,150
that's anyway,

29
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:31,779
as, as Kurt and I are speaking, if, if we were playing out Apollo 1350 years ago,

30
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,300
it is

31
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:36,175
currently up in space right now and I believe it just exploded a little while ago.

32
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:37,644
So it is

33
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:41,334
an extremely interesting topic and something we were talking about and I said,

34
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:42,705
you know, we should talk about just,

35
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:45,315
we'll kind of put some focus on security in space,

36
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:48,635
but just space in general is a fun topic and I'm sick of terrible topics.

37
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:53,544
-- So fun. It is a space.
-- We're finally starting to make some progress again,

38
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,989
you know, with Elon Musk and spacex and, um, and blue origin, like,

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,550
like they're finally because, you know what always got me was the space shuttle,

40
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:05,349
like, visually, I loved how it looked,

41
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,910
but once you start to learn about it,

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,160
like it was just, well, number one, it was an industrial train wreck,

43
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:14,429
like literally, like the, the failure rate was horrific.

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,270
-- You know, two of them blew up,
-- one blew up, the other one

45
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,270
burnt up.

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,789
Ok. Fair.

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,925
And so then,

48
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,404
like the thing was designed to be like a

49
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:26,285
space pickup truck with a short turnaround time,

50
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:27,524
which, like in theory, cool.

51
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,794
Yeah, you like, have your vehicle with the engines, you know, you fuel it up,

52
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:33,125
go to space, come back, fuel it up, go to space, come back.

53
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,654
The only problem is the turnaround time was like, what, two years or something

54
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:38,664
stupid. I don't know if it was two years. It was really bad though.

55
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:42,324
Well, they had to like, take every tile off, inspect it, glue them back.

56
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,244
Probably the easy part compared to.

57
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,085
So, actually,

58
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,315
it's funny you mentioned that the space shuttle wasn't even on

59
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,985
my list of things to really talk about in that context.

60
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:51,205
But

61
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,089
so when I was in college,

62
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,649
my, I think it was my senior year of college,

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,369
a

64
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,490
professor came in who worked at NASA prior

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,979
to coming to teach at the university I attended

66
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,679
and he actually, one day he was like, would anyone like to hear about NASA?

67
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,110
And we're all like, yeah, we want to hear about NASA.

68
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,679
-- Does he ever get told? No, I would
-- hope not.

69
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,600
But anyway,

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,009
so he held like these nighttime symposiums to talk about kind of everything.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,460
And, and

72
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,419
the one thing I took away from all of

73
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:21,720
his crazy stories because there were some crazy ones.

74
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,389
But the one thing I didn't, I didn't I never thought about was

75
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,399
and this guy, he was so he was a mechanical engineer, which first of all,

76
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,880
I'd be like mechanical engineer at NASA.

77
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:29,889
What sense does that make?

78
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:34,169
But obviously, there's mechanical things inside the space shuttle and,

79
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,889
and the one thing I never realized, so

80
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,789
let's say you worked on a valve for the rocket engine, right?

81
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,990
So, obviously when you're constructing a rocket engine,

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,050
you have to test the crap out of this stuff.

83
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,570
Yeah, I mean, the vibrations alone

84
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,899
ignoring that part of it. Just like testing it. Right.

85
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,130
So, let's say you built a rocket, a valve designed for 1000 opens and close, right.

86
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,770
So you test it. How many times do you test it? Let's say you test it 100 times,

87
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,899
-- half a
-- million

88
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,160
maybe. But, but the point as you're, as you're,

89
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,520
as you're putting it together, right?

90
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,649
Because like you test the valve valve works,

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,449
you put the valve in the rocket engine test.

92
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,690
The valve valve still works, you know what I mean?

93
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,059
And so they, people never considered this with the space shuttle,

94
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,369
but because there were so many pieces and it was supposed to be reusable.

95
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,019
Well, just through testing

96
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,890
because you kept testing and testing and testing as you constructed this thing,

97
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:27,910
like you end up testing something like 100 times more than you expected.

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,170
And so it would literally fail before like the,

99
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,390
the freaking space shuttle even left the planet.

100
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,950
I remember reading a World War Two book. It was a like

101
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,480
a,

102
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,929
like a diary of um a tank uh

103
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,470
commander.

104
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,679
And basically the problem was they had was all the tank

105
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,250
maintenance schedules were designed for tanks that were being used.

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,079
So things like tightening the track bolts and stuff.

107
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,670
So when they

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,200
were like using the tanks for training.

109
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,220
They kept breaking stuff because they would over tighten things. Right.

110
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,510
Because you, like, tighten all the track bolts every week or two or whatever.

111
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,600
Which, yeah, if you're like, driving around in the tank they get loose.

112
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,070
But if you're not driving the tank around,

113
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,829
you keep tightening a bolt and eventually it goes ping.

114
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,390
So, yeah. No, that's, that's a good point.

115
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,809
Just those pictures of the space shuttle like opened up in, you know,

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,040
the bay where they're like refurbishing.

117
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:20,230
-- It basically like like how many parts did that
-- thing? The number was in the millions.

118
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,470
It's completely nuts and obviously part of their planning had to include failure

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,160
because humans are on this vehicle.

120
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,660
So you want to make sure it has, you know, a quadruple redundancy in some instances.

121
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,579
Well, and Cold Lake Air Force Base.

122
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,100
-- No, Nanaimo, the one just north of Edmonton was a return base.
-- Did it ever land there?

123
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:42,859
No, no, no, but they built, they built Nanaimo for B 52 S. Ok.

124
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:47,570
-- So the runway was very long.
-- So this is something else I learned from my professor is.

125
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:47,899
So

126
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,470
when the space shuttle was launched,

127
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,910
they had all these contingency plans about

128
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,059
if, if this happens, then do this, if this happens and do this.

129
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,049
And this is something actually in Apollo 13, the movie which is a marvelous movie,

130
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,269
by the way, if you haven't seen it,

131
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,795
like just stop listening to us right now and go watch it because you won't regret it.

132
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:07,265
But

133
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:09,214
in, in that movie they show like, oh,

134
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:12,975
we have to figure out how to do all these things to, to help the astronauts and,

135
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:13,834
and this guy was like,

136
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:16,095
NASA actually had a lot of that figured out

137
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,845
because they have these ridiculous number of contingency plans.

138
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:19,375
But anyway,

139
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,750
-- so with the space shuttle,
-- well, you don't like,

140
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,829
one thing that always gets me is when you actually have like a crisis with

141
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,950
like an airline would be the closest thing to a

142
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,970
space shuttle that actually is like a normal thing,

143
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,350
right?

144
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,070
The amount of time you have to deal with

145
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,049
the crisis before you're dead is like minutes.

146
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,950
-- Exactly.
-- And, and I'm assuming in rockets it's even worse, shorter.

147
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,049
It very well could be.

148
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,720
And so, right, so obviously the space shuttle,

149
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,160
when it's when it's launching into space and when it's going to come down,

150
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,563
they had all these different is it could land

151
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:50,954
in case of emergency.

152
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:54,253
And so when the Challenger space shuttle was the first space shuttle that

153
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,963
was lost and that was the one that had the O ring incident.

154
00:06:56,973 --> 00:07:00,674
And there's, there's amazing case studies that were done on this and again,

155
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,824
like go educate yourself because it's phenomenal

156
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,384
in terms of ethics and just engineering.

157
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:07,783
It's amazing what happens is,

158
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:08,174
right,

159
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:10,963
the space shuttle Challenger goes up and there's a problem

160
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,303
and NASA immediately knows what's going to happen next?

161
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:15,493
It was what was going to happen next was if,

162
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:20,178
if a shuttle came out of the other end of this thing intact from the explosion,

163
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:23,058
because they knew the solid rocket boosters were obviously what exploded.

164
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,238
And if a shuttle with a fuel tank had come out of that,

165
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:31,278
the contingency plan was the space shuttle would fly across the ocean to Spain

166
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:35,358
while dumping fuel the whole while because obviously it's going to have a problem.

167
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,578
They would have set the air speed record across the Atlantic Ocean. Well,

168
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,338
right, I mean, unsurprisingly

169
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,407
and then it would have attempted to land in

170
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:47,661
like as soon as the explosion happened, like they knew what happened next.

171
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,552
It's phenomenal the way these people train for emergencies.

172
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,361
The problem is it's not just training for emergencies,

173
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,381
but it's having it's being given the time and the space to figure

174
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,381
it out in advance because how often have us security people gone?

175
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,911
Well, you know, I have some concerns that I'd like to talk about.

176
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,691
They're like, no, no, no, we've got to get this into production.

177
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,661
-- Yeah, I mean, that happens all the time
-- and it's like, well, but I'd like to, you know,

178
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:12,006
can we step back for a moment and like, just make sure example,

179
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:15,156
my favorite one is always, can we make sure that the data is backed up if nothing else?

180
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:17,286
So if this thing fails, we can recover it and they're like, no,

181
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,506
we'll deal with that later and of course,

182
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,805
-- that doesn't always turn out well
-- or I see us

183
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:25,205
planning for ridiculous events that are never going to happen.

184
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:29,746
-- Well,
-- or they're so improbable or so, you know,

185
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,785
just the return on investment for the risk profile is, yeah, that's,

186
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:33,575
that's a tough one.

187
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,585
Well, and this is a discussion I want to have with you on another show.

188
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:39,315
-- Is that whole Miter attack profile thing?
-- Yeah. Miter Attack is cool.

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,979
But that's another story.

190
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:44,190
So, actually return on investment, I think is a good transition.

191
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,820
Especially just sticking with the space theme.

192
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,299
Do you think Voyager One and two have any

193
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,440
sort of authentication on their radio communications at all?

194
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:56,760
Well, no, because they go back to the old timey computer security protocol of,

195
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,299
there's a mainframe with a terminal in a locked room.

196
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,789
-- You can't get into the locked room,
-- ignoring the

197
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:02,715
locked room.

198
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:03,244
No,

199
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:06,174
but what I'm saying is that's the same thing in the past.

200
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:06,794
Oh,

201
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:10,034
you have a radio big enough to talk to Voyager one. Well, then

202
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:13,455
either you're NASA or maybe you're the Russians.

203
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:17,265
-- I don't
-- even know if the Russians have a radio that can talk to Voyager one anymore.

204
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:17,695
I mean, yeah,

205
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:21,125
there's literally what a dozen satellite dishes on the planet

206
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:24,094
that can talk to it and NASA owns them all.

207
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,669
Well, yeah, exactly.

208
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,989
So, actually one of the fun stories I read years and years ago that,

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,239
that helps me kind of process.

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,260
All this space insecurity idea

211
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,539
is when the NASA astronauts

212
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,150
were going to the moon in the Apollo mission,

213
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,549
all of their radio communications were in the clear.

214
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:48,969
So Ham radio operators were able to pick this up if they knew where you're tuned to.

215
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,380
I remember like even today, you can still, you know,

216
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,849
all air traffic control is in the clear.

217
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:54,070
You know,

218
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,729
there's still a ton of police and fire and medical departments that are in the

219
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:01,210
clear because they can't afford fancy new encrypted radios and more of the point.

220
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,169
The minute you go to fancy encrypted radios,

221
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,849
you end up with problems like September 11th where the

222
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:07,781
departments couldn't talk to each other. Yeah.

223
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,541
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, you get communications security.

224
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,481
-- But then, oh, wait, we can't talk to anybody else.
-- It

225
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,221
-- definitely
-- can create a mess.

226
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,702
And, but anyway,

227
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:18,372
what I think is really cool is so the ham radio operators

228
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:22,421
were able to pick up the NASA astronaut communications and in fact,

229
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:23,901
there's, there's a new story,

230
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,132
I'll try to dig it up and put it in the show notes where this,

231
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:30,341
I think a person was in Kentucky and basically they were listening to Buzz Aldrin

232
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,054
and Neil Armstrong talked to each other on the moon

233
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:35,463
because he was able to pick up their radio signals.

234
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:39,213
But, but at the same time, if you were doing that, you were supposed to basically,

235
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,054
like, clear it with NASA saying, I'm listening to the Astro

236
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,354
which is like,

237
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:47,314
OK, why, like, what's the purpose of this?

238
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:51,273
-- You're literally blanketing the planet
-- some bureaucrat somewhere

239
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,114
probably.

240
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,314
And of course, you know,

241
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,713
the Russians were

242
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,065
listening in on all this as well.

243
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:00,695
And actually this is one of the things I forget I

244
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:04,635
was reading somebody discussing like all the moon landing conspiracy stuff.

245
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,195
And they said

246
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,486
the single biggest reason to believe the moon

247
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,426
landing happened is because if they faked it,

248
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,945
the Russians would have made an enormous deal about it because it

249
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,966
was very embarrassing to them that they didn't get there first.

250
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,325
I, you know, I've worked for the government and I've said in many episodes in the

251
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,237
asked, like, governments are terrible

252
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:21,778
seats.

253
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:24,638
Like, have you heard of this guy called Snowden?

254
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,377
Yeah. Right. Right.

255
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,617
You know, like, and I love how,

256
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,208
you know how Snowden got a lot of his

257
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,138
-- access to stuff he wasn't supposed to have
-- just the

258
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,458
for, was it SharePoint or something?

259
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,388
He asked other people for their

260
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:36,228
good

261
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,038
job. That's it. When I heard that I'm like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

262
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,978
I don't, you know, did he hack this thing?

263
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:43,797
No, no, he just asked people for their passwords so he could get his job done.

264
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,210
That's it. Sorry,

265
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,250
I buy that. I don't know.

266
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,969
I, I'm kind of glad, like, because, you know,

267
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,840
we had the space race in the sixties because

268
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,390
we wanted to basically prove to the Russians,

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,049
but we could put something in orbit and land it

270
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,070
in a specific spot and that thing could be,

271
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,690
you know, full of humans or full of uranium.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,150
It goes

273
00:11:59,549 --> 00:11:59,849
bang.

274
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:00,770
Right.

275
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,650
You know, and then,

276
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,570
and then basically the space race kind of just satellites were big, you know,

277
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,169
weather prediction, communication satellites and all that was good.

278
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,679
But then it just sort of fizzled out for a long time.

279
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,099
-- So
-- actually, I have another funny story, I can tell you about satellites.

280
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:17,796
So I it was when the Apollo 11 astronauts were going to land in

281
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:21,546
the ocean because obviously back then the spacecraft splashed down in the ocean,

282
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,526
which was the US s way of solving this.

283
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,706
There was a top secret,

284
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:28,916
I think it was a CIA satellite that basically knew

285
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,947
there was a tropical storm converging on the area,

286
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,507
the astronauts were supposed to land and obviously back then, like,

287
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:37,627
no one even knew the United States could do this.

288
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,096
The idea of a spy satellite didn't exist.

289
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:44,984
Oh, I remember how, like how secret the whole keyhole satellite system was, right.

290
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:48,744
And so anyway, they basically had to, they told NASA they're like,

291
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,064
you need to figure out a way to move the landing

292
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:54,443
site without anyone realizing why we're moving the landing site,

293
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:54,703
right?

294
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:57,744
Because obviously they don't want the astronauts to get hurt

295
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,593
and you don't want the Russians to know like, oh, hey,

296
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,713
we can spy on everything you're doing and it was just,

297
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:06,614
I think about the madness of all of this and like

298
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:09,064
you watch these spy movies and stuff and like it was,

299
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:12,843
it was the real deal back then, man, it's just, it's madness what they did.

300
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,424
Well,

301
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:17,041
you know, the whole thing was like over flights so that you can verify, you know,

302
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:21,210
various military things or my favorite always is that, that USB

303
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,471
yard, you know, where all those planes are parked out in the desert

304
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,560
and then they leave them parked out in the desert for

305
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,750
weeks or months and some of them are like strategic stockpile

306
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,310
and some of them are there for destruction.

307
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,750
And so when,

308
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,690
then what they do is they like have this giant crane with like a metal sheet,

309
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,210
like a guillotine that they drop and like chop these big planes up into big chunks and

310
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,661
then they leave that out for like weeks or months so that the Russian satellites can,

311
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:43,310
you know, validate.

312
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:44,288
Yeah, there's

313
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:47,367
like there was a plane there and now there's like chunks of a plane there,

314
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,677
you know, and then they clean it up later so that, you know,

315
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:52,638
the Russians can validate that this stuff was destroyed, you know,

316
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,038
from the Salt Treaty or from whatever treaties in the past, you know,

317
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:56,788
I was also reading this.

318
00:13:56,797 --> 00:14:00,677
How do you put like a seismograph in Russia that is like tamper proof?

319
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,038
They cannot mess with it.

320
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,478
And so they have these seismographs to detect, you know,

321
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:05,867
underground nuclear testing, right.

322
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:06,567
And so they like,

323
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,427
encase these things in concrete and they have more seismographs around them

324
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:12,177
and like radios to call for help all sorts of crazy stuff.

325
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:12,958
So the Russians can

326
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:16,724
-- out and like, do a nuclear test and like, put it back in the ground or whatever.
-- Ok.

327
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,164
Anyway, anyway, space, we're talking about space.

328
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:20,044
So,

329
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,965
so I have another

330
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,234
interesting kind of thing I've been thinking about

331
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:26,604
in the context of security and space.

332
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:32,594
It is not well known, but when Apollo 11 landed, Neil Armstrong had to pilot the ship.

333
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,525
And that wasn't technically the plan.

334
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,645
Initially, they obviously had a landing computer.

335
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:40,255
I wasn't aware of those, the pods, like once they were in, in return mode,

336
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:42,815
I thought it was just ballistic, like just a brick with some pa

337
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,322
when it was landing on the moon.

338
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,531
Actually, I have another story about that though too. But anyway,

339
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:54,651
he basically had to like joystick it down because things weren't working, right?

340
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:58,151
Because obviously this was all just like hodgepodge hardware that they like,

341
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,192
you know, had working magically amazingly.

342
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:03,211
And I mean, it was a demo test gear.

343
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:06,971
But anyway, he had to land it and it is basically assumed

344
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:12,012
that if he wasn't the quality of pilot he was, they would have crashed.

345
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,739
Well, have you ever played X Lander?

346
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:16,898
-- Yes, that game is so good
-- also very like,

347
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:19,198
it's funny because they actually have X Lander with like,

348
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,739
nice big throttle and joystick and everything at the Tell us World Museum here

349
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:26,018
locally and it is comical to me to watch people play it because they,

350
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:30,169
they, it looks because it's like vector graphics and it's like super old people,

351
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,518
I think, assume it's going to be, like, pretty

352
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:31,888
easy.

353
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:32,698
You know,

354
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,208
I have never seen anybody successfully land that

355
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:37,809
thing and I've only managed to land it,

356
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:39,218
like, safely twice.

357
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,179
I can land in the wide area,

358
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,539
but I can, I can never land

359
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:44,226
that small area. They have.

360
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,546
-- Yeah,
-- like the 10 multiplier or whatever. Yeah.

361
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:48,106
-- Yeah,
-- it's got, it's tons of points

362
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,265
or, you know, with the,

363
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:51,385
like with all the physics turned on where you're like,

364
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,926
-- over trying to under correct or over correct
-- and

365
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,046
it's really hard and obviously you're in

366
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,315
a different gravity which changes everything.

367
00:15:59,325 --> 00:15:59,966
But I mean,

368
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,505
so this is one of the interesting things I

369
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:04,645
think about space is you look at these early astronauts

370
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,776
and they literally pick the best test pilots they could find because they knew that

371
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:12,306
the time would come when these people would have to actually fly the ships and the

372
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,312
they had,

373
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:17,112
would be imperative and this feels sometimes like early security where

374
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:20,913
back in the day it was all cowboys running around,

375
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:23,432
fixing problems and it was bananas.

376
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:23,723
Well, like,

377
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,453
literally they got stuck on the moon and the only way they

378
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:29,112
managed to fix the Lander was by poking something with a pen.

379
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:29,812
Right.

380
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,163
Like, I mean, yeah, it's just, it's a perfect case of, you know,

381
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,992
911 responders being like, well, we have to handle it.

382
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:39,643
-- Why? Because what do we do call ourselves?
-- And not only that, I think

383
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,052
early industries are

384
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,239
the heroes make the industry work,

385
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,599
but you eventually have to mature to the point

386
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,609
-- where
-- there's part of it is survivor bias,

387
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:49,799
right?

388
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,250
Because there's the heroes are the ones that didn't get electrocuted or, you know,

389
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,880
set themselves on fire or whatever.

390
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,179
Right.

391
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,419
They survived and, you know, went, ok, well, when you're doing this, do it this way,

392
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,159
so it's safe.

393
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,630
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

394
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,289
And then eventually though,

395
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,160
you have to mature to the point where it becomes

396
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,469
boring and not that I think space is necessarily boring,

397
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,660
but I think it's way less exciting than it used to be.

398
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,479
Well, you kind of want it to be boring.

399
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:17,010
Like, like cars, I mean, reading about cars, like, like the whole crank cars,

400
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,520
it's like airplanes, think about airplanes. Right.

401
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,358
Like Charles Lindbergh flew across the ocean. Now we have what?

402
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:24,979
Hundreds of planes fly across the ocean every day and

403
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,760
it is completely uneventful and they all have radios,

404
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,689
like,

405
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,760
and yet they still disappear once in a while, which kind of blows my mind.

406
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,076
That's a Black Swan event. But you have to think, like, you think true,

407
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,926
I bet before Lindbergh, I don't know. The statistic on this.

408
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:41,456
But I bet a lot of people tried to cross the ocean and they crashed their death.

409
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:42,326
Because

410
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:45,696
what else do you do? Like who's going to come save you? Right.

411
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,615
Nobody, your plane just crashed into the ocean. You're dead.

412
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,576
My understanding is from the early flyers.

413
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:54,615
There were a lot of deaths, obviously, but a lot of that was like trying to take off,

414
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,656
crashed, died.

415
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,215
You got to remember too, like the, the

416
00:17:57,332 --> 00:18:01,031
amount of money and expertise involved in just getting a plane off the ground,

417
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,432
let alone trying to cross the Atlantic.

418
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:05,732
-- So there weren't a lot of people trying. No,
-- I mean, I, I won't lie.

419
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:07,391
I'm not super familiar with that.

420
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:08,612
My understanding is, yeah,

421
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,391
there were a lot of early deaths but it was pretty tried to take off,

422
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:15,391
crashed after 100 ft or whatever or, you know, trying to land.

423
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:18,312
Well, here's the thing, right? You have just invented planes.

424
00:18:18,322 --> 00:18:19,911
Do you know how to take off in one of these?

425
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,550
Right. Ok. Cool. Good news you took off.

426
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,510
Hey,

427
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,829
did we cover landing in school yet? Oh, wait, we haven't invented that.

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,530
Well,

429
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,270
that's the Wright brothers pretty much just crashed at the end of all their flights.

430
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,670
-- Yeah. Well,
-- I mean, that's why they did it on Sandy Beach

431
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,390
basically, you know, like it's, yeah, like, well,

432
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,709
we didn't have a ball pit big enough.

433
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,390
So go to the beach, right.

434
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,410
But, I mean, and that's part of it. Right. Is, is again, like, how do you do this?

435
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,869
So it's, it's safe when you see people testing new devices, you know, you start off,

436
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,939
like, well, when you watch testing of new airplanes, they like rev it up,

437
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:58,689
they take off down the runway and then they put the brakes on and turn the engines off,

438
00:18:58,859 --> 00:18:59,810
you know, and then they,

439
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,010
and then the next time go a little bit faster and then

440
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,369
like eventually they take off do like a quick circle and land.

441
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,619
Right. Right. And, and they start pushing

442
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,546
literally the, the flight test envelope, they start pushing it.

443
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,245
And then my favorite always is when you see the Boeing tail strike tests.

444
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,095
-- Have you seen those?
-- I

445
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:14,926
don't know,

446
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:15,176
what

447
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:15,436
is it?

448
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:20,326
-- So
-- the idea is when you're taking off on a plane, you go fast to get air speed,

449
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:23,365
then you rotate up a bit to get airflow over the wing.

450
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,676
And then, you know, physics takes magic and you fly.

451
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:30,005
What happens if you rotate the plane up too fast? I have no idea.

452
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,725
Well, the back of the plane hits the runway. That seems bad. Right.

453
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,406
That's called the tail.

454
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,161
So, well, it's not ideal.

455
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,212
But so what you do if you're Boeing is you weld

456
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:38,702
a metal plate to the back of the plane and then

457
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,722
you have your test pilot drake it down the runway at

458
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:43,562
high speed because you have to test this that seems fair.

459
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:44,322
Yeah, exactly.

460
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,401
So they literally, you can,

461
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:47,291
you can youtube these videos of like the Boeing test

462
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,411
pilot just revs the engines all the way up,

463
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,871
yanks back on the stick and he's just basically like doing

464
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:54,761
a wheelie down the runway with sparks flying out the back,

465
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,962
you know, and then eventually takes off to see what happens.

466
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:58,501
Basically. That's pretty cool.

467
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:02,098
And, you know, but you get there, you don't start there, you get there eventually,

468
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:02,527
right?

469
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:04,118
You know, and you see these things like, well,

470
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,598
how do you learn how an airplane stalls, you stall it?

471
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:06,787
Yeah,

472
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:10,777
-- you start stalling it
-- and I know part of becoming a pilot is they bring

473
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:14,317
you up in the air and they're like stall it and then fix it and,

474
00:20:14,618 --> 00:20:16,718
or a spin stall or all sorts of.

475
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:18,427
And so, but,

476
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:21,677
and this always the one thing I always think about with in terms of

477
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,947
like space and aeronautics and all this testing and even like in the automobile

478
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:25,453
industry,

479
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,514
there's all this testing is these are industries that

480
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:31,874
have experienced dramatic failure and they've been trying,

481
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:34,833
they try really hard to learn from their failure and test for

482
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:37,333
failure and make sure they don't make the same mistake twice.

483
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:38,744
And I always feel like in it,

484
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:40,904
we don't just make the same mistake twice.

485
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:44,514
Everyone makes the same mistake over and over and over again.

486
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:48,364
Yeah, I think part of it is that technology changes so fast that we like,

487
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:51,709
I'm seeing in the Blockchain world these people have discovered.

488
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,790
And this is amazing to me,

489
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,530
smart contracts are basically software and they have

490
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,949
flaws that can be exploited to steal money,

491
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,959
things like re entr

492
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,819
bugs or, you know, essentially coding errors,

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,199
or there can be errors in the interpretation, you know, in the run times.

494
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,430
And they're like, oh my God,

495
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:09,369
we have like these formal contracts that are formally proven correct,

496
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,010
the instructions are completely correct.

497
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,079
But the thing that compiles it and runs it has a flaw that can be exploited.

498
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,510
I'm like, really, you don't say

499
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,489
all these Blockchain security people a few months ago

500
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,790
after the flash loan attacks and stuff were like,

501
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,469
oh my God, we should start, you know,

502
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,290
auditing contracts for security flaws and like making sure

503
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,380
the runtime are secure and don't do stupid things.

504
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,599
And I'm like, uh huh,

505
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,189
can I talk to you about C or Pearl or

506
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:36,790
-- Python or Bash or
-- any turning complete language anyway.

507
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,814
Rock paper scissor.

508
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:40,265
Yeah.

509
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:41,875
Not even turing complete.

510
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,444
Even the stuff that isn't turing complete is complicated enough that right?

511
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:46,584
It doesn't matter.

512
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:51,275
And so yeah, like it just, but I'm like, where have you people been for the last 5,

513
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:51,714
10 years?

514
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,104
-- Like, how did you not? Why
-- would people know this?

515
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,744
Where would you go to learn this if you didn't know it?

516
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:01,209
Nowhere you could listen to old men complain on podcasts. But,

517
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:01,689
but I mean,

518
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,109
you would think it as part of software

519
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,699
programming disciplines or engineering and chemical engineering,

520
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:08,530
mechanical engineering.

521
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,630
You know, all these guys are like,

522
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,199
now we're going to talk about the Tacoma narrows bridge and why, you know,

523
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,869
-- resonant vibration is a thing
-- you just made me

524
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,709
realize something really interesting is so I took a bunch

525
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,910
of computer science courses when I was in college

526
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,359
and it was mostly Java and C++ back then.

527
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,369
Yeah. Did they ever talk about failure? No. And that's exactly what I'm thinking.

528
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,530
But at the same time,

529
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,109
all of the failures that would have been discussed back then.

530
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,290
You would have had what, like the Morris worm might be the big one that,

531
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,349
that would get discussed.

532
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,130
-- I don't know if many of those lessons. Well, that's an
-- attack.

533
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,089
-- That's not even a failure per S
-- E Well, I would,

534
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,369
-- I would argue it's a failure but
-- it's both.

535
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,219
Well, I'm thinking like failures, like where, you know,

536
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,239
the poor governor of New Jersey is like, we need a bunch of coal

537
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,239
programmers staff

538
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:51,729
because like, our unemployment system tipped over, you know,

539
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:55,060
I'm thinking more not attack failures but like a failures where it's like,

540
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,020
but either way, right?

541
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Attack or not attack, you're right.

542
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,780
We don't ever talk about problems, but at the same time,

543
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,520
people generally don't advertise these things either because nobody wants to say,

544
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,089
oh, hey, look how bad we screwed up. Now, we want to talk about it.

545
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,430
Yes and no, like look at cloud Fflur every time Cloud Fflur has a whoopsie.

546
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,640
They are the exception to the rule though.

547
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,930
Google's not as good as they used to be, but Google still does post mortems.

548
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,290
Same with Amazon, same with, you know, a lot of these.

549
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,010
But again, it's the mature players do this because the mature players, well,

550
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,000
let's be real if you're in cloud flare or Amazon or Google,

551
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,069
like they could set your house on fire and you're going to be like, well,

552
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,089
please don't do that

553
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,869
because I still have to use you. Right? Like, really? Right.

554
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,910
It's like gasoline as much as I wish we could move off fossil fuels.

555
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,599
I, you know, I'm going to go, need to go gas up my car in a week

556
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,890
because I need to like get around the city.

557
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,270
I understand that like it doesn't matter.

558
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,609
So, yeah, I mean, and that's a maturity piece, but

559
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,349
I think part of the challenge is by not talking about failure.

560
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,640
I've met so many people that don't think failure is even an option or possible.

561
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,310
-- You know what I mean? It
-- is not something.

562
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,180
I mean, I think there are very few organizations that kind of plan for failure

563
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:05,390
and they try to do anything

564
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,810
to say if a bad thing.

565
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:10,910
But I guess at the same time if you're architecting failure into your designs

566
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:14,213
that costs money and that means you're working on that as a

567
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:17,723
feature instead of something that is going to sell more product.

568
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:21,052
-- But it
-- also means you understand, to some degree how the system works and how,

569
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,883
because to, to understand how something can fail,

570
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:25,412
you have to understand the system

571
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,522
well, to a degree.

572
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,483
I mean, so I'll actually,

573
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:29,532
I have a great example of this is I've been dealing

574
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:33,853
with Phipps 1 40-2 slash 1 40-3 a lot lately,

575
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,432
like more than I want to.

576
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,272
And

577
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,326
it's, it's like

578
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:41,836
honestly learning about any of these government security certifications is

579
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:44,645
a freaking curse and you will never shed your curse.

580
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:47,936
So don't learn this crap if you don't need to.

581
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:48,776
But anyway,

582
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:49,796
so it's,

583
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:52,526
it's one of those topics where if you

584
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,436
are in that situation where you're interacting with

585
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,946
an organization, like a government or a large bank or

586
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:01,635
some sort of organization that's massive, right?

587
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,819
They, they, they say, you know, we need to make sure you do these things for reasons

588
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,849
and you, of course, can argue back and forth,

589
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,010
but eventually they're going to win because they have all the money.

590
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,550
But at the same time,

591
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,810
it means you've reached a certain maturity level

592
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:17,189
because obviously if you're interacting with governments,

593
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,339
it means you have essentially a government sales

594
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,099
team that knows how to play the game.

595
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:23,530
And there's, there's like all these layers all the way down, right?

596
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,859
Well, part of it too is for one thing I just had to look this up because I'm like,

597
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,180
I know Phipps has been around a long time.

598
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,449
Like, basically as long as I've been in the industry and

599
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:36,699
pips 141 was issued on 11th of January 1990. It's really old and

600
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,540
my second thought would be ok.

601
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,739
So, like, let's hypothetically hate on pips for a moment. What's the alternative?

602
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,260
-- What do you mean? What's the alternative? Like,
-- what's the alternative standard?

603
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,920
There isn't one if I want to buy a device that

604
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,739
does some cryptography stuff and I want it to be like,

605
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,969
reasonably secure.

606
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:53,699
I can say basically,

607
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:58,119
either you have to meet pips 140.123 or four standard or what's the alternative?

608
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,939
There are a handful of others.

609
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:03,000
But no, I mean, fundamentally that's the only game in town.

610
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:07,530
And even now like the Phipps 143 standard just refers back to iso

611
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,819
documents these days.

612
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,099
It's nothing like it used to be where it used to spell everything out in detail.

613
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,780
I mean, and I understand why these,

614
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,849
these standards are important because if you don't,

615
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,099
you end up with like people making up their own crypto

616
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:19,780
and, and I get it,

617
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,060
I understand.

618
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:25,369
-- Well,
-- every time somebody says this thing is tamper proof, I'm like, no, it's not.

619
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
I own a sledgehammer.

620
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,219
-- I know, I know
-- like, you know, like, and when they say tamper resistant, I'm like,

621
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:34,993
well, maybe tamper is like tamper evident, I'll buy sure I get that.

622
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:38,133
-- But beyond tamper evident,
-- there's varying levels.

623
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:40,233
It's always cool because I know some people that

624
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:43,363
work on hardware in sensitive places and the stories

625
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:44,723
they have are amazing where like they have to

626
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,753
go test this stuff where they have like literally

627
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:50,042
an explosives range where they bring it and they put it out and they

628
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:54,133
open the case and like it lights on fire because that's basically its job.

629
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:56,373
And it's like, that's so crazy.

630
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,412
Or there's,

631
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:01,213
I forget there was one company I was talking to where they have a ballistics range

632
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,885
and they literally shoot their equipment with guns to see what happens.

633
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,546
Like, what a job,

634
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:10,125
you know, for some people that make stuff that goes to war zones. That's

635
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:12,286
seriously. Exactly. Exactly.

636
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:15,755
I remember when I found out about Mill spec gear, I'm like, ok, it's waterproof,

637
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:16,495
it's drop proof.

638
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:19,375
I get that and then they're like, but it also has to get shot because like,

639
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:22,806
if you shoot something and it just dies then we're kind of sol and I'm like, oh,

640
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:26,786
-- that
-- actually, yeah, or you think about things in space where people, like,

641
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,416
they're putting up 486 processors in this gear

642
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,086
and

643
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:30,718
why?

644
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:34,009
Because there's like all these crazy cosmic rays

645
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,999
and the temperature changes and it's just,

646
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,229
it's madness up there.

647
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,999
And so you can't put in a modern processor that's going to just

648
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:44,359
-- fry itself in the 1st 15 minutes
-- I remember learning about radiation hardened,

649
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:46,688
-- you know, electronics. And it's like,
-- yeah,

650
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:47,619
it's cool.

651
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,999
I mean, you thought you, like, I remember,

652
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,708
I once discovered I had a bad stick of

653
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:53,889
RA M because I couldn't compile the Linux kernel.

654
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:54,999
Everything else worked fine.

655
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,838
But the Linux kernel because it basically did two things that no other program

656
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,072
was, he used up all of my RA M

657
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,751
and a single bit flip resulted in

658
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:04,702
and I,

659
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:07,472
I eventually figured out I had one stick of bad Ram and I

660
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:09,082
just couldn't compile kernels on that machine

661
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,432
-- anymore because I've even
-- seen instances.

662
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:14,671
So there's, what is it mem mem test 86. I think it's called

663
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:15,592
where

664
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:18,832
I've seen instances where I had to leave it,

665
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:22,832
run for a day before it actually ran into the pro

666
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:23,911
like, yeah, I mean,

667
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:28,255
-- sometimes bad memory is weird and all it takes is a couple of bits and
-- oh yeah,

668
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:30,025
transient, bad memory is the worst.

669
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:34,224
It might as well be a ghost. It's like the machine's haunted. Got to burn it. Right.

670
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:37,824
But you figure when you've got, I mean, you've got a rover on Mars.

671
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:41,385
You can't be like, oh the Ram's bad. Let's go flip that out now.

672
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:43,305
Like, no, you're stuck with what you got.

673
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:46,614
I remember all those rescue missions for the Hubble Space telescope.

674
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,385
And I'm like, at some point,

675
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:49,175
I'm kind of like this seems like an old car and you'd just be

676
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,795
-- better off building
-- it except the new one still isn't in freaking space yet.

677
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,785
True. Yeah. Yeah. Is that

678
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,814
it's supposed to launch this year? I believe,

679
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,150
I thought it was,

680
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:00,209
I

681
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,520
don't know, we're talking about the James Webb Space Telescope

682
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:08,359
-- which by the way, check the technology on that bad boy. Like,
-- it's gonna be awesome.

683
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:10,079
I love the fact that they're like, oh, yeah.

684
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,959
You know, we just have a bunch of solar shields,

685
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:15,069
chill it down to like what is a 0.0 something of a Kelvin?

686
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,439
And I'm like, wait, what

687
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:16,800
if

688
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,550
wild is that for real? It is.

689
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,319
And my second thought was, wait, I thought space was cold to begin with.

690
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,229
-- Yeah. No, it's not cold enough. I'm like, what?
-- No, no.

691
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,500
So actually this is this is another thing.

692
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,630
So this is a cool story about Apollo 13 because we're nearly out of time.

693
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,430
And so end on one cool space story.

694
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:36,439
So when the Apollo spacecraft was traveling to the moon,

695
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,890
they didn't just like point it at the moon and go,

696
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,770
they actually rotated at a speed of like 1 to 3 rotations per hour.

697
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,910
And the reason they had to do that is because the

698
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,489
side of the spaceship not facing the sun gets very,

699
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,959
very cold and the side of the spaceship facing the sun gets very, very hot.

700
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:57,020
And so space is weirdly cold and not cold depending upon where you're at.

701
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,280
Well,

702
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,390
and it's also like the best insulator out there because there's nothing there.

703
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,650
-- Right.
-- And so it's very hard to shed the heat.

704
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:03,369
Now,

705
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,672
here's what was crazy is on Apollo 13 because

706
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,312
they basically went to live in the lunar module

707
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,312
because they had to shut everything down in the

708
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:13,512
regular spacecraft because they lost their oxygen tank,

709
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,392
which was also how they got their power.

710
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:18,912
What ended up happening was the lunar module didn't

711
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:22,473
have a guidance computer capable of rotating the ship.

712
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,322
And so Jim L

713
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,703
-- had to rotate the ship by hand. Wait
-- a stupid question.

714
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:28,603
But if you got the ship rotating wouldn't inertia

715
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:30,032
just take care of the problem for you.

716
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,432
Well, no, no, because he did it by hand,

717
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:35,473
it wasn't rotating exactly correctly and obviously

718
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:37,156
you had to constantly adjust the ship,

719
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,046
which normally the guidance computer would do

720
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,956
except the guidance computer was shut down.

721
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:41,005
Oh,

722
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,566
so I guess because my thinking is you start the

723
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,965
thing rotating and inertia would just keep it moving around.

724
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:49,456
But I guess with the astronauts moving around inside of it and stuff. Yeah. Right.

725
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:52,845
Exactly. Right. It's going, it's going to change your center of gravity.

726
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:53,495
It's going to start

727
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:53,686
in

728
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:55,456
weird ways. Right. Right. Exactly.

729
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:58,196
Or it could speed up or slow down depending upon where people are at.

730
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:03,056
And it's, this is why they had the best pilots in the world

731
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:05,808
in these ships because if they didn't,

732
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,938
they would have died like if you put you and me in this and they had a problem,

733
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,159
it'd be like, well, that's the end.

734
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,198
-- Kurt. You know,
-- my favorite thing was on top gear.

735
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:16,359
They put Hammond in a, like a formula, not a formula one race car,

736
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:19,068
but like one of those, the, the lower ones, like whatever.

737
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,479
And he could not get the thing to start and go. Like, he kept stalling it out. Right.

738
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:24,678
Because it's just those things are so perks.

739
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,428
Nicky, it's not like, you know, put it in first and hit the gas.

740
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:30,989
It's like, no, you got to, like, get the engine up to like 6000 R PM and like, blah,

741
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:31,759
blah, blah, blah, blah.

742
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:32,639
I'm like, because, you know,

743
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:35,802
these cars aren't meant to go below like 100 miles an hour, right.

744
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,702
Everything below 100 miles an hour is essentially a failure condition for them.

745
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,661
Plus they're going to like, get too hot and catch fire.

746
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:42,391
So watching them try to start this thing was just, oh,

747
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,041
-- it was comical and like you and I couldn't do it
-- right.

748
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:48,871
And this is a difference between having an industry that has heroes

749
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:52,291
running the show versus it's boring and anyone can do it.

750
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:54,442
I feel like the problem is though, to get to those heroes though.

751
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:56,962
You've got to have a lot of people who, like, died horrible deaths.

752
00:31:56,972 --> 00:32:00,781
Some people have to die on the launch pad.

753
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,621
So maybe that's the problem with computer security is that all of our failure

754
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:07,084
are kind of bad but not bad enough that we're actually forced to learn from them.

755
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,964
I, I do think that's part of our problem. I really do.

756
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:14,805
I, I don't think our failures are so bad. Anyone has to care

757
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:17,045
to the point of like, because let's face it, man.

758
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:18,755
If you're like, oh get in this rocket.

759
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,364
And I say the last people got in this rocket died in a fire.

760
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,015
I'm not getting in that rocket until you fix it.

761
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:27,444
But we're like, yeah, just, just install antivirus in your computer.

762
00:32:27,454 --> 00:32:29,125
You're like, oh, ok, that sounds fine. I'll do that.

763
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:29,895
And, and I mean,

764
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,724
I say this all the time and it sounds morbid

765
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:35,157
but like literally until computer security problems start killing people,

766
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,147
I don't think anyone's really going to care and

767
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:41,258
-- it's terrifying, but I think that might be the way it is.
-- Maybe to end on the note.

768
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:44,947
What always gets me about self driving car hacking is the look on the reporter's

769
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,878
face when they actually experience sitting in a

770
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,628
self driving car that's been remotely hijacked.

771
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:51,067
And you see them have that moment of realization of

772
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:54,238
what this actually means up until then it's all academic.

773
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:57,297
And it's kind of like, oh, you can hijack a car, blah, blah, blah, that's bad.

774
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,498
But to see the look on their face when they're like, ok, wait,

775
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:01,307
the car's accelerating and my foot's on the brake

776
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:01,777
Right.

777
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:05,931
You know, you can see that moment of, oh crap. And yeah, maybe we need more of that.

778
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:13,411
I'm going to end on one cool story back during it was the Mercury mission in, in the US.

779
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:16,970
And I know Russia has a similar story, but I don't know the details well enough.

780
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,541
So there was an astronaut named Gordon Cooper and again,

781
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,880
great test pilot, right? Like these guys were the best of the best

782
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:26,350
and Gordon Cooper was getting ready for reentry

783
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,811
and something went wrong with the guidance computer.

784
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:32,793
And so basically it came down to fly the spaceship or die, right?

785
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:37,764
Which is, of course, for a test pilot is like, that's normal, but for us,

786
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:39,134
it would not be normal at all.

787
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:43,673
And he obviously is doing a manual reentry where you've got, you know, there's,

788
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,034
there's dials and, and whatnot, but it was very,

789
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:49,443
it was very human focused right where there wasn't computers,

790
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:53,303
calculating things and he had to kind of guess where to, to do certain things.

791
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:56,504
And also you got to remember during reentry, you're shaking and rattling a lot.

792
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,034
So it's really hard to read dials and to even control anything.

793
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,154
But anyway, this guy, he pilots the,

794
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:04,937
the spacecraft into the atmosphere and he gets it to land and he was

795
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:08,777
only like one mile away from where the guidance computer would have dropped him.

796
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:14,376
And it's like, it blows my mind how good these people were at what they did.

797
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,396
And it's just, there's so many bizarre stories like this

798
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:20,257
that exist of these astronauts and I keep thinking

799
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,896
about the fact that they were the heroes and

800
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:26,937
now we're trying to make space boring and I feel like security is in the same boat.

801
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:31,179
We still have too many heroes like this needs to be accounting, not pilots.

802
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,760
All right. Anyway, I'm ending it.

803
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,239
