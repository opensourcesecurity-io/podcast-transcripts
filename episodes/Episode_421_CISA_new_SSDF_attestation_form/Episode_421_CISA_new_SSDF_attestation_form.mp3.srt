Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,380
and my partner in building a good podcast with secure methods. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,879
Do we build a good podcast with secure methods?

3
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,450
Well, I mean, we have, we secured our supply chain.

4
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,579
-- I thought we had like, I make sure you, you and you make sure I'm
-- me,

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,569
we've never claimed that even in Jest

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,819
and I don't think I ever will. I'm,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,479
I don't want to say this out loud,

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,490
but I'm starting to wonder if securing the plight supply chain is an intractable,

9
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:39,840
-- but I'm, I'm hopeful it's not.
-- Here's the thing. Can we secure the supply chain?

10
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:41,849
Absolutely. Well, absolutely not.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,009
-- I mean, that's true,
-- but that's true of all security.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,729
Like we can't even secure nuclear weapons. Like

13
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,849
there's a list of nuclear weapons that the US has lost and to be fair,

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,180
none of them are recent,

15
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:57,689
but there is like a bomb sitting in some mud somewhere outside Savannah, Georgia.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,290
It should be clarified

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,689
if there was a recent one. It's just not declassified yet.

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,769
That's

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,330
probably why we might not know.

20
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:12,709
Anyway, we are going to discuss SSDF the Secure software development framework,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,209
which is a NIST standard, nist 800-2 18.

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,250
For those of you playing along at home.

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,459
Actually, we're not discussing the SSDF,

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,849
we're technically discussing an attestation form which

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,290
sly, so I'm going to

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,849
let me try to explain this in a way that doesn't sound completely ridiculous.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,230
So nest the National Institute of Standards and Technologies,

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,470
they

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,080
have a smorgasbord of standards. We'll call it

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,190
and there is a,

31
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:44,830
the National Institute of Standards and Technologies has a list of standards,

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,069
a smorgasbord of standards. Kurt.

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,069
So Nist has a class of they, they like have, I I forget what they call them,

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,269
but like there's the the digits in the front in 800

35
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,550
denotes

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,930
information security policies, right?

37
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,029
So you've heard of like 800-53 which is basically the granddaddy of all

38
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,550
the cybersecurity policies on the planet.

39
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:11,669
-- They almost all refer back to that
-- and like all the pips and the crypto and the right?

40
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,589
It's all in there

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,470
and

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,059
800-28

43
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,914
is they call it the secure software development framework and it lays out,

44
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,085
I think it's 42 controls

45
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,354
that discuss how to securely develop software.

46
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:32,235
And you can imagine 42 controls is quite a bit, it's hard to unwind sometimes

47
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,535
and additionally,

48
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:37,134
so they have this standard, but just having a standard is meaningless,

49
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:37,595
right?

50
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:41,274
You need a way to kind of collect information and enforce it and,

51
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,595
and do some attestation.

52
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:43,559
Now,

53
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,839
one of the things that will happen in the world of compliance

54
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,119
is you can get a third party audit done. The auditor gives you a phone book of a report

55
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,559
and then that report, then you have to work with them.

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,119
It's, it takes like months and months,

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,175
years and then that report is like proof

58
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:04,164
that you are following the given compliance standard.

59
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:07,604
-- Right? You'll hear about
-- this or you have compensating controls or other

60
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:13,244
exceptions or to be clear just because you meet the audit standard for the,

61
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,309
the whatever standard it is,

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,929
doesn't mean you actually have to meet the standard that

63
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,470
the actual specific controls because that's something

64
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,119
I see a lot of confusion about because

65
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,220
like, well, like with star,

66
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,919
like we all the cloud security lines also has the Secure Trust Automation registry

67
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,899
and for example,

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,229
we have stuff where the classic thing is and this happened very early on where

69
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,759
the the the the cons

70
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,639
the consensus assessment initiative questionnaire,

71
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:40,039
the cake ask things like physical security

72
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,309
and a lot of SASS vendors are like, um

73
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:43,660
no, like

74
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,779
we run an Amazon

75
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,440
and we're like,

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,339
yeah,

77
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:49,809
just kind of pass through like say you run on Amazon and

78
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,220
then they go Amazon's entry and make sure that it's legit.

79
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,419
And

80
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:53,100
so

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,000
with almost all of these standards, you can pass the standard

82
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:01,100
and not just like passing it to pass it, but actually pass it like

83
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,589
in the spirit of being secure

84
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,649
and not pass all of it. And that's fine.

85
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,559
And that's again where things get complicated and,

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,690
and generally speaking,

87
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:15,250
I would say in most compliance standards, if you have an answer of, yes,

88
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,769
I do this to all the questions.

89
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,790
That's probably a good sign. You're, you're making it up.

90
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,609
So, anyway. Ok. So you got n

91
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,049
800 to 18

92
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:26,850
and

93
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,609
Cisa,

94
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,480
which is what does CISA stand for? Do you remember

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,470
-- every
-- time?

96
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,829
I never remember

97
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,010
cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,679
It's interesting to me that cybersecurity becomes, well, I guess is,

99
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,269
is, is, is,

100
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,049
is,

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,519
yeah, it has to be Cisa. There's no way to rearrange it

102
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:48,899
ways anyway.

103
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:49,790
Well, no,

104
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm just saying it's interesting that they put

105
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:54,269
-- cybersecurity first and not say infrastructure
-- anyway,

106
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,269
whatever

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,730
Cisa,

108
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,779
-- which is part of the Department of Homeland Security in the United States.
-- I think

109
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,279
everything is part of the Department of Homeland Security

110
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,100
-- now in the USA lot
-- of stuff is,

111
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,230
but Cissa released this thing that's called the SSDF at a station form.

112
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,579
And the intent behind this is you are a company looking to sell

113
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,805
products and services to the US government.

114
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,805
Well, software and services largely.

115
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:26,015
-- That's true. I don't think it's for, it
-- doesn't apply to widgets.

116
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:27,515
There

117
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:27,756
would be

118
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,776
specific, there's widget standards for that.

119
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:34,135
Exactly. Right. Right. This is like the famous Nist brownie recipe, right?

120
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:38,635
-- Or
-- like the screws like and in fairness if you build screws wrong. That's,

121
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,615
that's bad.

122
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,735
I mean. Right. Right. Oh, for sure. For sure.

123
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,321
We, it, it's fun to, it's easy to laugh at n

124
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,911
for like brownie recipes and $1000 pound peanut butter and stuff like that.

125
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,432
But like,

126
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:51,921
they basically are the glue that holds society together.

127
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,411
-- So,
-- like, and something that might. Ok.

128
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,441
So from the, the SISA thing to further complicate this,

129
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,321
there's the executive order 14028,

130
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,471
improving the nation's cybersecurity.

131
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:04,592
But

132
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,242
it's like uh the hip bones connected to the knee bone situation.

133
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,559
So essentially the executive order told

134
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,850
Sisa to do a thing and Sisa

135
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,190
used the new standard to tell the rest of us to do a thing.

136
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,339
And now they have the attestation form to say that you did the thing

137
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:17,899
right

138
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,970
now, the attestation form we are going to discuss,

139
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,380
we're like what we're like almost 10 minutes into this thing.

140
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,299
-- But
-- honestly, this stuff is complicated because like,

141
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,519
like the, the the relationship of the White House to Sisa to nist like

142
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,470
-- that's some complicated moving parts.
-- It's true.

143
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,799
It's true. It's true.

144
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,510
So,

145
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,459
so Cisa releases a self

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,589
attestation form.

147
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,440
And what that means is

148
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,279
an organization looking to sell software to the US. Government

149
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,040
is expected to fill this form out

150
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,320
and not nece you, you're not involving a third party auditor.

151
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,450
You don't have to like incur a bunch of costs that may come someday.

152
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,619
But for now, it's a matter of I'm a company,

153
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm going to fill out this form

154
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,000
and then I'm going to submit the form I have filled out

155
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,750
and someone important in my company who basically attest to like I,

156
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,440
I have the authority to do this, signs it and then

157
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,399
I assume sis is going to collect them and put them in a folder on,

158
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,399
on a shared Microsoft drive or something.

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
So, yeah. So essentially this is self attestation where

160
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,200
I

161
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:20,820
validated that we

162
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,850
to pick on Boeing, I validated that we put door bolts to hold the door in.

163
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:28,649
Yeah, turns out maybe you need a third party to make sure that happens.

164
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,630
Sometimes you need it. Yes, but not always.

165
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,359
And the other thing that's interesting is this does like it,

166
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:37,489
this is one of those classic if you lie on this government form.

167
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,019
Uh Yeah, there's the potential for criminal penalties.

168
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,190
Uh It's,

169
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,869
I don't know if they're going to criminally prosecute people for this, but

170
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,070
they're, they're for sure going to

171
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,739
pull the business, right?

172
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:51,559
So,

173
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,390
yeah, with respect to this form, it's a self attestation form. So like we,

174
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,209
well, basically, yeah, we filled out this form and we're, we say we're not lying.

175
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,679
It's kind of like my tax returns where my accountant says we didn't audit Kurt.

176
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,170
Like he basically promises that he gave us all the paperwork,

177
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,239
didn't hide anything, doesn't have a Swiss account we don't know about.

178
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,760
And what's interesting is you were saying before

179
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,619
So third party assessment vendors can demonstrate performance

180
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,269
through a third party assessment performed by a

181
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,720
fed ramp certified or agency approved third party

182
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,950
assessment organization. A three pal,

183
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,309
which I love that acronym. That's one of my favorites.

184
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:24,140
Yes.

185
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,579
And then, ah this is the thing,

186
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,350
the form must be signed by the CEO or

187
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,669
a designated employee with the authority to bind the

188
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,070
company uh testing that the software is developed in

189
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,539
conformity with secure practices outlined in this form.

190
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,390
That's a very,

191
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,359
like we're not messing around statement.

192
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,109
-- Like,
-- I mean, it, it kind of is, I agree,

193
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,909
you know, it feels,

194
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,789
I mean, it feels like there's some, some maybe teeth behind it, but I,

195
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,349
I have a strong suspicion

196
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,210
-- like no one's going to jail over this form,
-- uh,

197
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,250
willfully providing false or misleading information may constitute

198
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,479
a violation of 18 US C 1001,

199
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,489
a criminal statute.

200
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,010
It is technically a criminal statute. But again, like

201
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,380
it is far more likely the government is just going to pull

202
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,609
their business from you than they're going to put you in jail,

203
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:11,890
right?

204
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,530
But in classic terms, the overton window is moving.

205
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:15,330
-- I
-- mean,

206
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,929
maybe,

207
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,250
well, no, like if you'd said 20 years ago, hey,

208
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,609
you could go to jail for selling insecure software.

209
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,510
Sure, I'll agree with that,

210
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,760
-- you know,
-- and now it's like, no,

211
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:26,280
it's,

212
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,159
-- it's in the paperwork,
-- it's not

213
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:35,390
going to jail for selling insecure software. You're going to jail for lying.

214
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:35,969
That's

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,750
right. Yeah, you're going to jail for lying.

216
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:41,760
If you just say my software is utter trash,

217
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,575
you won't go to jail because you're telling the truth.

218
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:48,414
But if you say this software has no security bugs,

219
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:48,875
now,

220
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,914
it's not that it's, if you say,

221
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,575
like we have a secure development process and you don't.

222
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:58,895
And so there, there is one nugget in here that I absolutely adore.

223
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:02,015
It's, uh, where are we? But halfway P page four, I think it is,

224
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,950
it says

225
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,369
in the event, an agency cannot obtain a completed self

226
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,950
attestation from the software producer,

227
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,429
an agency may still decide to use a producer software.

228
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,280
-- It says if the producer identifies the practices and
-- blah, blah, blah, I mean,

229
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:16,630
there, there,

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,820
but there has to be an exceptions rule right now because

231
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,169
there's just not enough vendor doing it securely to pick from

232
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,200
and there's already vendors that are pre deployed and it's like

233
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,840
they're not going to do this or they can't do this in a timely manner.

234
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,679
OK? We're, we're, we're, we're dwelling too much

235
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,450
on this.

236
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,809
But there

237
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,469
-- is actually one
-- thing that's fascinating to me, also, ongoing compliance, right?

238
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,130
Vendors must notify agencies if they cease to make consistent

239
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,440
use of the secure development practices outlined in the form.

240
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,940
And that is also something that is again the Overton Windows moving.

241
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,510
That is a,

242
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,099
that's a new thing because all of these certifications

243
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,440
like used to pretty much be a point in time

244
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,250
and like

245
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,700
it was kind of hoped that you would stay good, but it wasn't

246
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,020
kind of written that way necessarily always and it is increasingly happening now

247
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,419
for sure, for sure.

248
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,429
Um So, OK,

249
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,710
and there's, there's literally a check box

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,820
that says, I further attest that the software producer will not

251
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:14,989
notify any agency to which it has submitted this form if and when the producer

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,270
ceases to make consistent use of the

253
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,630
practices identified above in developing the software,

254
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:25,909
which again, like it, it might not have any teeth out of the gate.

255
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,390
But the fact that they're writing this down

256
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,000
is something and, and look,

257
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,989
here's the other thing I want to say just before we get going into the actual content,

258
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,460
the reality of what's going to happen here

259
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,219
is

260
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,500
you're going to send these to Cisa.

261
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,210
Cisa is going to collect them all, they're going to collect a lot of them

262
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,210
and then they're going to look at them and they're

263
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,960
going to figure out what is going on here,

264
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:51,039
what's making sense, what isn't making sense and then they're going to change it.

265
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,359
This is just like how

266
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,039
all of the cybersecurity insurance companies

267
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:59,700
just like handed policies out like candy because they were collecting data.

268
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,330
That's all they were, they weren't actually underwriting insurance policies.

269
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,700
They were collecting data about cybersecurity.

270
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,169
A perfect concrete example of this is I just bought travel

271
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:10,059
insurance because I'm going to the US for three days.

272
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,289
Right.

273
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,179
And if you are fully vaccinated for COVID, you get $5 million coverage

274
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,179
and if you're not fully vaccinated for COVID, you get 2.5.

275
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,739
Oh, interesting.

276
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,280
Right. That's it. And you,

277
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:22,570
you,

278
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,320
you can't buy more coverage if you're not vaccinated,

279
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,239
like, they just won't.

280
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,489
I mean, that's because insurance companies, they run out of spreadsheets,

281
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,219
like they understand the math

282
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,539
and to keep in mind, like,

283
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,039
I'm a Canadian going from a single payer state to the US where

284
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,549
like, everything's fine here. It's great.

285
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:42,859
It's

286
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,190
great.

287
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,450
I once paid and this is like 30 year, well, 20 or 30 years ago,

288
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,340
like I paid 100 and 70 bucks out of pocket because I got strep while I was

289
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,859
in the US and I needed antibiotics and like

290
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,039
she literally looked at my throat and went,

291
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:52,760
yeah, that's strep.

292
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,369
Here you go.

293
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,789
-- I'm impressed. It was only 100 and 70 dollars.
-- Well, this was like 25 years ago.

294
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:57,909
Ok.

295
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,650
That's fair.

296
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:01,424
But, uh, yeah, now, I, I don't even want to know.

297
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:03,974
All right, let's dig in,

298
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:07,234
let's dig into this form because I think we've spent what,

299
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,544
like 15 minutes going around in circles.

300
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:11,854
All right. All right.

301
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:16,304
So I want to start out by saying the form is broken up into four sections.

302
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,034
OK? Section one

303
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:20,304
talks about your environment.

304
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:25,594
This is like your company, your, your cybersecurity, your information security.

305
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,724
I don't think cybersecurity is right. Whatever it doesn't matter.

306
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,739
So, so basically what I'm just gonna read it,

307
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:31,400
it's

308
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:31,669
a

309
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:35,080
number one, the software is developed and built in secure environments.

310
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,700
Those environments are secured by the following actions at a minimum.

311
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,760
A separating and protecting each environment

312
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,780
involved in developing and building software.

313
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,400
B regularly logging,

314
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,179
monitoring and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and access.

315
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,500
And then it says I

316
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:51,429
to any software

317
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:55,864
and build environment and I I among components within each environment,

318
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,325
c enforcing multi factor authentication and

319
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,864
conditional access across the environments relevant to

320
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,794
developing and building software in a manner

321
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:05,424
that minimizes security risk and d taking

322
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:10,094
consistent and reasonable steps to document as well as minimize use or inclusion

323
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:12,164
of software products that create undue risk

324
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:15,025
within the environments used to develop and

325
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:18,585
next page build software e encrypting sensitive

326
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,905
data such as credentials to the extent

327
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,750
practicable. Is that a word and based on risk, you must be a word

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,090
f implementing defensive cybersecurity

329
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,070
practices including continuous monitoring

330
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,429
of operations and alerts and as necessary,

331
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,619
responding to suspected and confirmed cyber incidents.

332
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,059
Cool

333
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:36,460
winds.

334
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,580
They

335
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,890
eventually responded. It was fine

336
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:41,859
to

337
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:43,169
remember

338
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,659
like the whole,

339
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:48,950
oh, it just affects one customer. Oh, maybe just 20,

340
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,330
all of them.

341
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,440
So, so here's what I find,

342
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,460
I guess kind of the most interesting about this whole form here.

343
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,940
So if you look at the SSDF, it's broken down into similar sections

344
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,599
and it has like a multitude of control examples. But I will say

345
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:08,559
the,

346
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,549
their, their references they use are like all over the place.

347
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,940
And that is just,

348
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,534
I think a common trait of a standard that isn't as fleshed out as it would be someday.

349
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,494
But I think,

350
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,494
I think by distilling this form like this

351
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,114
makes it accessible,

352
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:32,424
I'm just looking at the first thing and there's 1234567899 different vendors

353
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:35,304
and agencies or organizations represented in

354
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:37,335
something like a dozen different standards.

355
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,570
-- Like there's,
-- uh,

356
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,580
-- you're looking at the SSDF,
-- the

357
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,460
-- spreadsheet.
-- There's like nist a loss. There's n,

358
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,739
well, sorry, I counted this twice.

359
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,000
There's um,

360
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:48,299
oh,

361
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,239
wow. There's B SIM, there's PC, I, there's,

362
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,570
it's alphabet soup.

363
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,619
Oh, it's, it's bananas for sure.

364
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,109
And there's even some of that stuff.

365
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,869
I couldn't even find some of those when I was looking them up one day.

366
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,390
I literally don't know what they are.

367
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,609
I will note that most of them are not hyperlinked and that's one thing that drives

368
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:08,090
me nuts every time somebody says let's use iso 8601 for date and time standards.

369
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,219
I'm like, cool. Have you read it?

370
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:12,190
Because I sure as heck haven't because I went to and it was like 200 bucks.

371
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:12,909
Yeah, you have to pay

372
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,043
for

373
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:13,353
it.

374
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,713
-- So I
-- use RFC. What is it? Triple 39 or 933.

375
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,953
-- I
-- don't remember the number but I know it, they're, they're almost exactly the same.

376
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:21,432
There's like minor differences.

377
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:24,362
But that's one thing I realize now that I really hate is

378
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:28,153
when people make standards where you have to go by that standard.

379
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:31,192
Because back to the Lutz and Crypt thing, even a one penny

380
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:31,833
is

381
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:35,932
too much hassle and too much difficulty for most people. And,

382
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,755
well, these things should be easy to find if you to make them a standard. Right.

383
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,476
And it's funny because courts have ruled but

384
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,116
like governments can't

385
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:43,375
make

386
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,736
requirement like legislation secret,

387
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,695
like you have to give it away for free or make it available because that's,

388
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:51,056
that's a thing now that's happening where like a lot of governments,

389
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,856
regional municipal plumbing codes.

390
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,036
I don't want to dwell on this section

391
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,546
either because this section is information security.

392
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:02,435
And I think from the perspective of supply chain, it is vastly less interesting

393
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:05,515
than the other sections. I will say this though. I think

394
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,810
the days of just being able to ignore a lot of information security and be like, yeah,

395
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,329
whatever, it's good enough.

396
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,368
Those are done for any company selling anything to the US government.

397
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:19,439
Like just

398
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,189
you, you, you're gonna, you have to have information security.

399
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,670
You have to have things like logging, you have to be doing like single sign on.

400
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,348
It's the way it is now. Like

401
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,680
-- that's it.
-- It's, well, it's a maturity thing, right?

402
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:33,189
We've gone from it being a nice to have, it helps the business to

403
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:34,729
mcdonald's had a global ITO

404
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,959
and couldn't sell hamburgers.

405
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:36,890
I heard that.

406
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,630
Right. Like this is no longer, uh,

407
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,589
it's a core part of life and

408
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,569
secure development is

409
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,010
becoming a core part of shipping software

410
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,979
securely because the Attackers have figured out

411
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,750
like, why hack a government agency

412
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,670
when you can hack solar winds

413
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,209
or you can hack

414
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,430
Octa or you can hack

415
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,560
somebody who, you know, well, like, uh, not Petya. Right.

416
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,449
Russia smartly was like,

417
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,439
why should we hack Ukrainian businesses when we hack the

418
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,910
one piece of tax accounting software that they all use?

419
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,369
All right, let's keep going. I wanna, I wanna read number two.

420
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,550
So number two says the software producer makes a

421
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,140
good faith effort to maintain trusted source code,

422
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,270
supply chains by employing automated tools or

423
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:22,109
process to address the security of internal code

424
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,630
and third party components and manage related vulnerabilities.

425
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,439
So,

426
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,949
I mean, the idea behind this is basically

427
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,280
like, don't use crap software when you build your software

428
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,439
and also probably have version control because not everybody does.

429
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,479
That comes next that

430
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,479
it's number three.

431
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,050
But I mean, this is an example of the, everyone keeps talking about how

432
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:48,160
you, you shouldn't just be like

433
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:52,729
running year years out of date dependencies and

434
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:57,209
like what is going on inside of all this third party code you're running.

435
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,609
And, and historically,

436
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:00,729
we've ignored a lot of that

437
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,520
and I think this kind of harkens to a degree to like S

438
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,979
bombs right where you're going to need to know what you're running

439
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,099
and

440
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
you're going to need to know where it came from.

441
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,780
But that, that's not in this particular section

442
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:14,959
but, and not only that,

443
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:19,489
but the thing I like is they talk about automated tools and if you look at the, the,

444
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:26,459
the 800 to 18, it, it, it points at 13 of the controls for this particular paragraph,

445
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:27,439
which is quite a lot.

446
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,359
So like this, this reads simple, but it's not gonna be

447
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:31,989
super

448
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,489
-- duper simple.
-- Well, this is like saying, you know, you need to build a safe car

449
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,079
-- when that involves the car rolling over down a hill,
-- right?

450
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:40,479
-- You're gonna need some engineering
-- and,

451
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,290
and here's the thing I like the most is when you read this,

452
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,579
it says you make a good faith effort,

453
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,099
right? It doesn't,

454
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,250
that's, that's part of it as well,

455
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,420
I think is when you're dealing with a lot of this compliance stuff,

456
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,619
like

457
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,150
sometimes making a good faith effort to do the right thing

458
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,020
-- is valuable.
-- Well, I would actually say in this case, it's what's practical

459
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,430
because we don't have an actual like,

460
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,130
-- yeah, standard to hold people to like
-- that's true.

461
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,650
But this is a great example like like the car industry where it was like, ok,

462
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:17,410
you know, we, we make safe cars but now that has meaning of three point seatbelts,

463
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,560
airbags headrest, so your head don't get whiplash crumple zones.

464
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,344
-- Um All sorts of clever engineering.
-- This is a good example because today, if you read

465
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:26,935
N I

466
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:30,464
800 to 18, it's not very prescriptive, right?

467
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:32,724
It talks about a bunch of these activities.

468
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,724
It references a bunch of standards and if

469
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,545
you read a bunch of the reference standards,

470
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,224
they don't even necessarily

471
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,310
have any teeth or make sense sometimes.

472
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,609
And this is one of those instances where

473
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,290
if you look at the, the evolution of automobile safety,

474
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,910
it took 100 years to get better.

475
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,449
And this is like step one and a lot of these controls aren't well written

476
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,660
and they're really squishy and you can meet them

477
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,310
with very poor solutions. But

478
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,989
that's ok. Again, this is why SISA

479
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,660
is going to collect these

480
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,739
and then they're going to learn to put it

481
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,880
bluntly infosec is still at the arguing about handwashing stage

482
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,400
of safety and risk management.

483
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,880
Yep, for sure. OK.

484
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,079
I'm gonna move on to number three because we're running ourselves out

485
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,680
of time and we still have a lot more to go.

486
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:21,185
All right. Number three, the software producer maintains provenance

487
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,935
for internal code and third party components incorporated

488
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:27,035
into the software to the greatest extent feasible.

489
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:30,395
Which is a polite way of saying if you ship a Java app,

490
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,555
there's gonna be stuff in there that you can't figure out where it came

491
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:34,244
from because some maven think built another

492
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:35,714
maven thing that included a maven thing.

493
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,954
But now you're stuck with a package with an MP3 in it.

494
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,515
-- So
-- we have no idea what software provenance really means.

495
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,755
Here's what's going to happen.

496
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:46,155
You say software provenance to a lot of people and they're going to say, oh,

497
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,239
you just need digital signatures and you can use SIG store and you

498
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,560
can use this tool and you can use P GP and all this.

499
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,270
Here's the honest truth

500
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,560
and, and you can add me on Mastodon all you want,

501
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,229
like all of this digital signature stuff.

502
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:02,349
It all sucks and most of it doesn't actually work. Well.

503
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,660
-- It also presupposes a trusted supply to sign it
-- to a degree.

504
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,949
Yes, it, it, you, you guarantee nothing for sure.

505
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,829
Well, this is like saying, you know, uh

506
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,915
the bank kind of keeps track of all the money coming in

507
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,665
but you don't know if that's money laundering money or like Kurt's paycheck, right?

508
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:24,905
-- You don't know where this money and
-- look, this is a problem we need to solve.

509
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:27,885
I'm not saying we shouldn't solve it. But I'm saying

510
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:33,305
-- anyone telling you they can do this is probably selling you a bridge
-- there.

511
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:34,494
And there's a simple reason why it's because

512
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:37,625
we haven't even properly defined the problem yet.

513
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:40,265
And so if somebody says they have the solution to this,

514
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:43,989
yeah, we, like I said, we have not properly defined. We don't.

515
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,949
And for the people that have defined the problem,

516
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,589
ask three vendors and you get three totally different answers,

517
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,260
right? There's no agreement yet.

518
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,010
And that's part of the maturity process where like

519
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,229
Cisa and Nist and the US government comes in

520
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,310
and drags us forwards into

521
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,699
the like, essentially like English.

522
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:05,939
If, if, well, if the US government says you're putting barcodes on everything, then

523
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:08,619
people say, OK, we're putting barcodes on stuff

524
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,630
and barcodes become a thing.

525
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:16,109
Yeah, for sure. Now, now here's the thing I want to point out for, for provenance

526
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:17,619
is

527
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:22,699
if you read the SSDF standard, it defines this in a, we'll say,

528
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,599
not particularly just prescriptive manner.

529
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,020
-- I don't know where to
-- go.

530
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:28,699
They do.

531
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:29,819
And that's ok.

532
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
And look, here's the thing

533
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,319
in many instances,

534
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,569
you can meet these if you have an S bomb with check

535
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:41,060
sums and you store the S bomb in a secure location,

536
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,969
which I can't define what that means either.

537
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:43,599
But,

538
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:48,469
well, I think what they, the intent would be is it can't easily be altered,

539
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,459
it can't easily, you know, so like github

540
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,079
-- would work
-- exactly

541
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,099
right. The, the point of this is to be able to say that

542
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,900
I have some software that Kurt gave me and Kurt got some software from somewhere else

543
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,020
and it looks like what I have

544
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,175
isn't what Kurt gave to me?

545
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,385
What happened along the way?

546
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,694
And where was the problem in,

547
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:15,214
in? Is it, was it malicious? Was it stupidity? We don't know.

548
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,555
And this is the problem with the whole digital signature thing

549
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,734
is like I download a binary for the sake of argument,

550
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:20,625
I'm gonna pick on curl.

551
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,905
I download a binary from curl. Right.

552
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:23,364
And

553
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:23,525
I,

554
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,900
and let's,

555
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,349
let's pretend that curl doesn't publish checks,

556
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,260
sums in a secure manner that I can verify or validate against.

557
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,760
So I take this

558
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:32,959
package curl

559
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,780
blah, blah, blah dot TGZ.

560
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,479
And I get the Shaw 512

561
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,119
and I put that into my little secure repo we thing.

562
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,790
And then, yeah,

563
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,869
when I hand it to you and you hand it downstream and downstream and ship it,

564
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,479
we know that what I downloaded that. Shaw 512 is what ultimately ended up

565
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,430
in the software, we ship that, you know, runs a car or an F-35 fighter jet or whatever.

566
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,790
But

567
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,900
yeah,

568
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,560
like we don't know what the heck Kurt downloaded could have been an accidental,

569
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,300
it could have been a copy of Tetris for all we know.

570
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,500
No, like and that's the thing, right? So all and even even if

571
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:08,689
so let's assume Curl provides secure digital hashes,

572
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,099
you know that they publish on the website that are signed and blah, blah, blah.

573
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:15,189
But like what process did they do to make sure that this thing is

574
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:19,599
-- kind of what we all think it is. Well, let
-- me, let me, let me use a better example. Ok.

575
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,319
So I'm installing packages with N PM,

576
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,040
right?

577
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:27,290
Or, or no, I'm gonna use Go go is a better example because it is

578
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,400
so I install a a go package

579
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,140
which I don't know if they call them packages doesn't matter.

580
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,760
So I install the Go, I'm calling them packages. I install the GO package.

581
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,439
What, what happens then

582
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:44,180
is you end up with this Go dot Sum file in your Go project

583
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:47,619
that just tracks the hashes of all the stuff you've installed.

584
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:50,319
And so now I can say, ok,

585
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,760
this your Go dot Sum has this hash,

586
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:00,390
I see that go dot Sum traversing the, the C I and development process.

587
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,890
And the thing, the go dot Sum at the end is the same as a Go dot Sum at the beginning.

588
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,140
So I know that

589
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:09,709
everything inside your walls was operating on this particular artifact.

590
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:13,010
Now, let's figure out where this artifact came from and make sure that's the thing,

591
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,709
you know what I mean?

592
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,510
And that's the beauty of this is now

593
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,829
the ST prior to this,

594
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:20,310
we didn't even know what to check and

595
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,459
like validate an audit.

596
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:25,439
But now we actually have a thing that I can hand to

597
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:28,800
the auditors and say this is actually the thing that we used,

598
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,060
right?

599
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:29,810
It's like screws

600
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,430
if I get a box of screws.

601
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:34,729
And I like there's manufacturing processes that do this where they literally set

602
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:37,630
aside a few items of the screws or the components or the whatever

603
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,959
in case there's a problem so they can go back and test it

604
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:43,680
because some testing you can't affordably do

605
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,709
in like metallurgical testing for example. Right.

606
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,810
Um Well, I guess you could do a strain test.

607
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,640
But whatever point is, this is part of the road to

608
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,790
part of the frustration I think is that we won't actually have

609
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,319
a secure system and ecosystem until we've done all these other steps.

610
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,579
And they kind of,

611
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:05,920
and it's like to put it bluntly, even 95% of doing this is

612
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:09,119
you still don't have a finished solution.

613
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:13,170
And that's part of the challenge here is like, OK, so even if you do s

614
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,560
bomb and even if you do digital signatures perfectly and securely and everything

615
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,439
today, you still effectively have

616
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,640
not a lot

617
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,949
like you can't actually attest that this software is safe and secure.

618
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,180
I mean, that's a different problem though, right?

619
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:29,890
This is a matter of showing the provenance chain of command,

620
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,880
but the people are conflating these issues.

621
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,500
That's why I'm saying it's

622
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:32,729
true.

623
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,550
That's

624
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:35,609
-- true
-- in the real world people are saying,

625
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,329
so this software is secure and what they mean

626
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:37,959
by that

627
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:38,939
is like, oh,

628
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,459
you audit it for bugs and it's secure

629
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:42,119
and it's built development and what we're saying,

630
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,569
no, no, no.

631
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,670
What we mean is

632
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:46,619
we have like there could be ferrets and peanuts in here.

633
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,900
We're not entirely sure it's, there's a big power source,

634
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,369
but it was curl

635
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:54,739
version 1.2 0.6 us released by curl and we made reasonably certain

636
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,260
that's what the like the rest of the world agrees on that,

637
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,660
which in past worked quite well.

638
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,079
But now it doesn't because Attackers have learned, like, with solar winds again,

639
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:03,410
like

640
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:03,979
you

641
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,140
compromise

642
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,119
the C I CD at the source

643
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,670
and yeah, everybody's like,

644
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,250
yeah, we all agree. We all downloaded Curl. It's this version. It's all the same.

645
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,569
Hash, we're good. Right. Well, maybe an attacker got it. Maybe they didn't,

646
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,069
you know, Curl does have, as he said, you know,

647
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,359
they've had their build process and development

648
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:21,910
process audited and they're open source.

649
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,430
So that actually makes it a lot easier.

650
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,640
But for a lot of close source stuff like,

651
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,829
-- yeah, come on you and I both like,
-- yeah,

652
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,390
yeah, for sure, for sure. I I'm gonna read number four now and, and that's it.

653
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,989
This is like the last one. So it says

654
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,689
the software producer employed automated tools or

655
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:38,839
comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities.

656
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:39,500
In addition,

657
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,060
a the software producer operates these processes on an ongoing

658
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:46,170
basis in prior to product version or update releases.

659
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,234
B the software producer has a policy or process

660
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:53,114
to address discovered security vulnerabilities prior to product release.

661
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:53,984
And c

662
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:56,094
the software producer operates a vulnerability

663
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,864
disclosure program and accept reviews and

664
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,114
addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a

665
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,354
timely fashion according to any timeline specified

666
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,099
in the vulnerability disclosure program or applicable policies.

667
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,349
-- And
-- to be blunt,

668
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,270
what this boils down to is you consume CV E and maybe your language ecosystem thing

669
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,280
and you

670
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:17,709
-- pay somebody for a bug bounty,
-- not necessarily pay someone for a bug bunny, I

671
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,000
mean,

672
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,869
or not a bug bounty, but like you have, like, security, whatever

673
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,864
you need a security ad in, in a vulnerability disclosure policy, which is,

674
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:29,944
there's an iso standard that you have to pay for and kind of sucks. But

675
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:32,824
there's, it's, it's very doable. Right.

676
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,854
I find the part almost more interesting

677
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:39,375
is just talking about automated tools to

678
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:42,905
look for vulnerabilities because I think historically,

679
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,900
-- that's never really been a requirement for anyone. Right.
-- You know what?

680
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,319
You're probably right. And again, that's the overton window shifting.

681
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:53,260
Like we accept that these have to be automated tools. They can't,

682
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,140
it, well, it can't be anything else.

683
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,339
-- Yeah. That's right. That's right.
-- Like, it can't be people.

684
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,260
Right. Right.

685
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,939
You know, especially if you're doing a new build every month or every week. Right.

686
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,099
Right. For sure. For sure.

687
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,660
Kurt and I have talked about this at length

688
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,170
countless times but, like

689
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:15,219
we worked at Red Hat and we were, like, we were very, it was silent. Green of security.

690
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:15,380
Right.

691
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,219
Like, it was all people at that time because there weren't tools, like, always.

692
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,515
-- Yeah, it was people
-- and

693
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:24,855
I bought S sds so I could unpack all of the

694
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,436
source code and then run Grep and wait half an hour.

695
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:29,156
Yeah, I remember doing stuff like that

696
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:33,786
-- also
-- finding ways to run Grep on all that without it running out of argument space.

697
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,316
Right. Because you can grab 6 billion files. It just grap

698
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:37,505
goes too many arguments. But

699
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:39,796
so you have to like do a find with X rgs.

700
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:40,245
That's

701
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:40,556
right.

702
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,855
Uh Which you can also thank goodness you can run in parallel

703
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:44,436
-- one
-- to

704
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:48,832
-- four good rule, thumb, one grip per core
-- giver. Anyway, the point is right.

705
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,202
I I

706
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,722
found this particular section the most interesting.

707
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,021
Now, mind you,

708
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:58,702
it has 19 of the controls from 800 to 18 are referenced

709
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:02,171
here and then those controls reference all kinds of other stuff.

710
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:05,741
And so unwinding this one is going to be really, really, really hard to do.

711
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:08,251
But fundamentally this one makes sense, right.

712
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:11,187
We're going to scan our product before release

713
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:14,718
-- for security
-- vulnerabilities for known security vulnerabilities.

714
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:15,738
Right. Right.

715
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,748
And then it doesn't tell you what you have to do with them.

716
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:22,468
It doesn't say you have to fix all the criticals before release.

717
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:24,787
It doesn't say you have to fix all the importance before release.

718
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,177
It basically just says

719
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,267
you have to do this thing

720
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:29,858
and then it does say that you have

721
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:32,708
a policy or process to address discovered vulnerabilities,

722
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:33,947
which I mean, that totally makes sense.

723
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:36,963
If you're a a company, you're going to do that.

724
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:38,293
Well, the reality too is again,

725
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:42,343
it varies by vendor and sector and vertical and whatever,

726
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,524
you know, because one thing I was always wondering like for example, submarines,

727
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:48,494
they can't get like over the air software updates,

728
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:49,913
right. You know,

729
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:51,254
and also

730
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,114
they're like running windows 95 on a system that is, well, it's water

731
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,323
gaped, not air gapped,

732
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:58,433
but it's like water gapped. And so,

733
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:00,004
you know, there's, there's,

734
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,550
I think this boils down to this is part

735
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,800
of finding out like what are the risk profiles and

736
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,880
getting the vendors to behave in a rational way

737
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,760
because if you try one size fits all here,

738
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,510
it's gonna fail horrifically.

739
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,359
Right. That's right. That's right. And again,

740
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,319
sis is going to collect this. Now, now here's the other thing I wanna, I wanna say.

741
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:20,729
So when you submit this form, you don't just sign the form and be like I'm all done.

742
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,359
Good job, everyone, you need to submit evidence,

743
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,569
right? You can't say we have a

744
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,719
a policy for addressing

745
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,900
discovered vulnerabilities.

746
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,020
You have to attach your policy

747
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:33,650
attachments.

748
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,939
And so that's what's actually going to happen with this is this is going to collect

749
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,569
a gigantic amount

750
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,219
of information from that evidence that gets submitted.

751
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,890
I just found a major flaw in this thing.

752
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,180
Did you read page eight yet?

753
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,680
Uh I've read all of the pages.

754
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,680
The public reporting burden to complete this information collection is

755
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:56,290
estimated at three hours and 20 minutes per response,

756
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,280
including time for reviewing instructions, searching data sources,

757
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,869
gathering and maintaining the data needed

758
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:03,000
and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

759
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,599
I'm sorry,

760
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,199
I'm I don't think there's many vendors that are mature

761
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,000
enough to do this in three hours and 20 minutes,

762
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,839
like collecting the data and getting it all together is probably gonna take days.

763
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:14,959
-- So,
-- ok, I want to address that specifically because

764
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,250
when I fill this out at anchor,

765
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:22,890
it's gonna take me about four hours to collect all the data. But, but

766
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,849
I have been spending months

767
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,040
putting this stuff together because like when 802 18 was published,

768
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:35,239
obviously as a company that works with this stuff, I'm like, we're gonna make,

769
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,469
we're gonna make sure we can meet all of this.

770
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,010
And of course,

771
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,989
being a company that literally builds the

772
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,589
solution that meets most of these requirements.

773
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,099
I'm like

774
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,849
just by existing, we meet a bunch of these requirements,

775
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,410
but you get the idea right is like

776
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,660
I spent months

777
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,069
making sure we had all of our ducks lined up if you start from nothing

778
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,310
and you have to implement this. And I think that's the key.

779
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,359
What that, that burden statement,

780
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,219
that burden statement assumes you're already doing this stuff.

781
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:04,780
If you're doing all of these things,

782
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,820
collecting the evidence is probably gonna take three hours and 20 minutes.

783
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,620
It assumes the maturity level of the Linux kernel.

784
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:15,978
If you're not doing any of this stuff, it's going to take you six months.

785
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,159
Like

786
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,449
I suspect well,

787
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,879
and the classic thing is a lot of places probably are doing some of the

788
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:25,120
stuff but ad hoc not automated or not consistently or not monitored or not.

789
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,850
We all and, and that's part of the whole point of this is to

790
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,800
drag the maturity forwards.

791
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,030
-- Sure, for sure. And that's a good thing. Yep.
-- Yep. That's right.

792
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,469
It kind of amuses me that you pointed that out because I do remember reading that

793
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:42,969
and at first I was looking through this and I'm like, I don't see anything, like

794
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,790
there's not really anything about evidence in here. Right.

795
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,020
It doesn't really say anywhere specifically.

796
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,929
And then I got to the burden statement, I'm like, ah,

797
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,989
there it is,

798
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,389
there is where they talk about it.

799
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,030
Well, I think honestly my parting thought on all of this is

800
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,699
there's a reason that all of these standards have a dash version number.

801
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,639
That's, that's my take on this is that this is

802
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,919
a good start

803
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:04,419
and we will learn from it

804
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:07,290
and there will be a new one in about 2 to 3 years

805
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,110
or maybe

806
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:09,780
sooner even.

807
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:13,370
-- No,
-- it won't be sooner. Ok. So here's the other thing to remember though.

808
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,020
So uh the latest 218,

809
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:20,810
um I think it's version two we're on now. No 1.11 0.1 I just looked it up.

810
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,360
Well, I don't mean just that, but the, the

811
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,830
attestation form itself,

812
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,169
-- the
-- form, but here's the thing. So here's the thing you need to understand

813
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:27,979
that

814
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,909
attestation form is about a year in process right now

815
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,850
where

816
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,139
SISA released a draft of it.

817
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:38,429
And, and also I read the draft and the final version aren't like hugely different.

818
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:41,939
They, they added some of the I pinky square, I'm doing this boxes

819
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,235
check and stuff. But

820
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:46,854
as a rule, a final draft of a government document should not

821
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:50,445
like if the final draft and the actual final are different,

822
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,084
that means that you messed up big league

823
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:56,034
-- thing. But, but so
-- basically, like it took

824
00:35:56,465 --> 00:36:01,554
almost a year to go from creation of this to final draft when they update it.

825
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:03,284
-- There's a lot of subtlety
-- here,

826
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,574
but what's going to happen is they're probably going

827
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,854
to collect data for at least a year,

828
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:10,495
then they're going to change it.

829
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,620
And then, so you're talking a minimum of two years,

830
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,100
probably three or four from right now

831
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,500
until we see the next version of this form, which is wild.

832
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,500
The other benefit of this form too. Is it basically states

833
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:26,129
what like vendors and products like security,

834
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:28,580
vendors and products need to do and provide?

835
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:29,530
So I assume at anchor,

836
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,360
you were like already kind of doing this stuff because like, well,

837
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,929
if you're doing supply chain security

838
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,260
-- and you want to make it secure,
-- we're basically doing all this stuff.

839
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,260
You're going to be like at least 80 90% overlap.

840
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,709
But now it's like, no, no,

841
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:44,179
here's like some of the specific things we really need to

842
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:47,120
support or do or handle and make easier for customers.

843
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,020
And that is a definite boon to customers

844
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,929
because it makes their life easier and they can actually,

845
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:55,659
you know, get better security. And that I think is the most interesting thing is this

846
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,639
also now this becomes part of the ecosystem

847
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,679
and it defines other parts of the ecosystem

848
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:06,820
that now vendors can step up and do better and make more compatible and easier.

849
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,260
And to put it bluntly,

850
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,800
this is one of those things where

851
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,459
it's not perfect, it will never be perfect.

852
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,080
But yeah, if every vendor actually did this attestation form,

853
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,959
like with at least 90 95% actual sort of compliance.

854
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,909
Holy cow, would the industry move forward?

855
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:28,040
-- Like that would drag so many people out of the stone age
-- and, and that look, that's,

856
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,139
that's the key, right?

857
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:33,040
And that's how we're going to end this show is just the fact that this isn't perfect.

858
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,415
Everyone knows it's not perfect,

859
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,604
but it's the first step in what it's going to be a very long journey.

860
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,824
Well, and the thing is, there's also been a lot of other little steps along the way,

861
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,395
like the standard, like

862
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:43,784
the executive order, like

863
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,905
your stuff didn't exist 20 years ago.

864
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,754
No, no, I mean, Anchor

865
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,114
is like five years old.

866
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,004
Not even well, but I mean,

867
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,925
it didn't even exist as an idea of something we should maybe do

868
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:53,745
really.

869
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:56,385
And fly chain security was kind of like

870
00:37:57,729 --> 00:37:59,600
it's on a server and we back it up to.

871
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,949
Well, well, no, no, I think like Red Hat

872
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:04,909
started the journey.

873
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,500
But Red Hat's solution was just to hire a

874
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,590
lot of really smart people to work really hard.

875
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:11,850
And that doesn't fly anymore.

876
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,090
-- Like that's not how it works
-- well. And that's a perfect example. The fact that

877
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,500
this has to be automated,

878
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,500
that's it.

879
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,330
It just like we can have people building

880
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,489
tools and operating tools and managing the tools,

881
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
but we can't have people doing the work anymore.

882
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,750
-- That ship sailed,
-- I mean N PM is millions of packages

883
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,870
like

884
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:29,389
it.

885
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:32,419
It's still my favorite example was still the time

886
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:36,189
I told some people at the open ssf if we

887
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,909
conducted a security audit of 1000 packages a day,

888
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,310
which is an insane number, there's absolutely no way that's reasonably practical.

889
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,489
It would take 10 years to audit N PM assuming

890
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,719
no new versions are added over that 10 year span

891
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:57,169
and that they're like their heads exploded because it's like, holy crap.

892
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,729
This is a ridiculous problem.

893
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,979
I was trying to find some code I wrote and something

894
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,290
specific I'd written and it took me about half an hour

895
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,489
just to find my own code.

896
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:06,889
Yeah. Yeah, it's,

897
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:11,105
that's for sure. So anyway, ok, let's, let's, let's finish this one out.

898
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,906
Here's what I'm gonna say.

899
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,196
I'm really excited for this at a station

900
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:16,986
form partially because I'm a huge security nerd,

901
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:18,656
partially because I already did a bunch of work.

902
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,145
So I actually get to fill it out and be like, hey, look, at me everyone.

903
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:24,666
I did it, but more importantly is just the fact that we,

904
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:27,065
you and I have been complaining

905
00:39:27,216 --> 00:39:27,865
about

906
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:31,906
all of this security crap for so long and how, like, we don't do it right.

907
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,226
And no one takes it seriously.

908
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:35,961
And like, when are we, like, think of the Children, everyone.

909
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:41,471
And this is it, this is how it starts. It's going to take decades

910
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:46,842
to get to a point where I think we'll see like good real change.

911
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:51,302
-- But this is how it starts
-- survivable car crashes.

912
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:51,922
Like

913
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,882
most car, like most car crashes. Now you just

914
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:56,731
like you walk away from them and you leave bits

915
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:57,802
of your car behind.

916
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,191
Exactly.

917
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,300
Exactly. That like

918
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:04,689
this, this is it, this is what it looks like. And

919
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,070
now I'm, I'm hopeful

920
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,810
it continues because there's also the possibility

921
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,120
that the industry will complain and gnash their teeth

922
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:15,669
and whale and the government's gonna be like,

923
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,729
all right, I guess we'll let you go.

924
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,159
I don't think this can be undone. The genie is out of the ball.

925
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:24,250
We have too many high profile hacks.

926
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,449
You have the entire US healthcare system stumbling along for a few weeks.

927
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,699
Like

928
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,699
this is not an option anymore,

929
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,010
right? Like people realize

930
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:38,219
software runs the world that we depend on to live.

931
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,300
It does. We're gonna find out, man.

932
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,250
