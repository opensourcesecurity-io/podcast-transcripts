-- All right. It's December 6th. Hashtag
-- always those podcast.

1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,148
So, uh, this is the half dozen risks of using dirty public Wi Fi networks.

2
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,810
And what I love is that this somehow implies

3
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,310
that there's like clean public wi fi networks.

4
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,850
Well, I guess it's a library.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,010
-- The library is pretty clean,
-- whatever you can't trust those librarians.

6
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:20,370
-- Yeah, but they're, they're tidy and clean. They keep their books in order, I
-- guess.

7
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:23,555
I love life libraries. I don't, I don't mean to pick on libraries. I love librarians.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,235
Librarians are my favorite people in the world.

9
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:28,274
We have a new library. Well, not a new library.

10
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:30,475
It's, it's the old library location, but they gutted.

11
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:33,715
It got rid of all the asbestos and weasels rebuilt the whole thing.

12
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,604
The Stanley Miller library in Edmonton.

13
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,075
It's quite beautiful, not as beautiful as Helsinki.

14
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:39,345
Um, but

15
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:41,435
they have amazing Wi Fi coverage and they

16
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,465
have this giant wall showing a reef aquarium.

17
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:45,075
It's, it's really cool. But anyways,

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,549
what are the half dozen dirty risks?

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,130
Uh Sorry,

20
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:52,950
what are the half dozen risks of using dirty public Wi Fi networks like this is.

21
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,819
And, you know, obviously at Starbucks, you wipe your feet, it's clean,

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,639
whatever, whatever. But

23
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,279
I love that.

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,909
It's like scanning and ordering, fingerprinting, eavesdropping,

25
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,110
remote access exploits evil twin wi fi

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,260
lateral network infections and DNS hijacking.

27
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,459
-- So, ok, let's start with this.
-- No, I don't even think we should cover them.

28
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,529
I think it's just ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous.

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,819
All of us use public wi fi all the time. If there's public Wi Fi we're going to use it.

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,519
And my absolute favorite thing in the world is security.

31
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,059
People who talk about, oh, you can't use

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,180
Wi Fi without a VPN because blah, blah, blah

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,370
and I guarantee you every one of them does it because they're just a bunch

34
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,300
of annoying hypocrites and everyone is going to do this and the world never ends

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,360
and more to the point,

36
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,099
none of this all matters because everything to put it

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,739
bluntly nowadays needs to be done at the application level,

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,019
which means TLS 1.2 or higher.

39
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:42,830
Ideally, all except 1.1 for the most part and certificates

40
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:43,809
because like

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,680
I connect to gmail,

42
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:48,489
I need to know it's gmail. It doesn't matter if I'm on VPN or not.

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,489
Well, and now that the web browsers show non https

44
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,120
websites is untrusted.

45
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,559
It's going to be insanely difficult to properly

46
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,349
fish someone with any of this technology.

47
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:04,519
And now here's my favorite example and this is how I sum up security on a regular

48
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:09,005
basis of all the technology that has happened to make public wi Fi safer to use.

49
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,404
Has any of it been driven by the people who have

50
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:14,455
been complaining about public wi Fi for the last 10 years,

51
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,725
0% of it was driven by them.

52
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:21,074
It's all been other people who had good ideas who drove this industry for.

53
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:24,845
I wouldn't even say they drove it forward. They drug it forward with a rope.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,169
Like, seriously, this is where

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,210
people complaining and talking about how bad and stupid something is

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,039
generally just makes it worse because now you have people saying,

57
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,339
-- oh, I can't use the public wi fi
-- and here's the thing,

58
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,050
I love people complain about this constantly.

59
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:39,289
And,

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,479
and so I actually have a spreadsheet for our internal CS a like for

61
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,160
all the vendors we use and one column of it is number one,

62
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:49,009
do they support http S because the spreadsheet is 10 years old.

63
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,643
And so the answer wasn't always yes back in the day.

64
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,203
Of course. Now it is yes.

65
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,602
And then the column right after that is do they use hsts?

66
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,483
Which is HTP strict transport security mode,

67
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,992
which means essentially do they either serve a

68
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,923
header or are they whitelisted in the browser

69
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,522
to force you to use htps? So for example,

70
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:08,442
cre.org cloud

71
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:10,462
airlines.org, paypal.com,

72
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,923
all of them are whitelisted in your browser. Like if you type in http

73
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:15,675
and slash L

74
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:21,916
see you.org, your browser is going to go. No, no. Like you have to talk http s to that

75
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,266
and it flips it over

76
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,455
and the point is that stuff is what fixes this,

77
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:30,145
it doesn't matter if it's Wi Fi Ethernet or, you know, you're dialing in,

78
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,026
from Australia

79
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,485
and for dialing in, we mean,

80
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,615
connecting over a phone line for those of you that don't know what that means.

81
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:36,186
-- What's
-- a phone

82
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:36,526
line?

83
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,996
Here's the thing. A VPN

84
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:41,770
is no part of this.

85
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,259
Exactly.

86
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,570
All the things, people,

87
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,929
all the things the security people have been talking about in the past

88
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,500
about why public wi Fi is dangerous and what you need to do.

89
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,449
Absolutely. None of those things.

90
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,389
I think nobody really ever did them,

91
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,839
but they're not part of the solution because they're obnoxious and they get

92
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,050
in the way and none of them really work that well anyway.

93
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,410
-- Well,
-- the problem is I like

94
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,386
buying a VPN Enterprise product for the CS A

95
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,835
but the challenge is none of them could be enforced.

96
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:11,055
Whereas very simply put, we can pick vendors like gmail,

97
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:14,376
like office 365 like sales force

98
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:16,485
that enforce HTTP S

99
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,644
so ok. Problem solved.

100
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,696
That's it. Seriously, like for real

101
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,411
and it doesn't just solve the Wi Fi problem. It solves like

102
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:26,342
-- all the problems basically. Right.
-- Absolutely.

103
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,881
It, it's, it's another one of those examples where

104
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:32,582
be mindful when you are a security person or you listen

105
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:36,731
to security people who are talking about the dangers of something

106
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,971
because I think quite often it's not as bad as they say.

107
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,820
I think it is easy to complain. Something is broken

108
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,910
and then not make anything better. All you've done has made the world worse.

109
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,380
It used to be as bad as they said.

110
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,420
But then the world got better for the people that chose to get better.

111
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:56,079
And funny enough when it was that bad, no one was really talking about it yet.

112
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:56,700
Exactly.

113
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,940
Like when people started complaining about it,

114
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,109
it is when things started to get better, which is hilarious.

115
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,579
But all right. Anyway, anyway, it's time to be done. I've lost my tab.

116
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:08,100
We will see you on December 7th.
