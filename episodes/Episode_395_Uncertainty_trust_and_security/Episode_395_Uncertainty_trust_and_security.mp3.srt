Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,279
Kurt Siefried and my partner knowing what a pager is.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,270
Josh Pressers. I do know what a pager is.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:16,030
I had to explain what a pager was twice yesterday,

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,030
why

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,979
it came up just talking about tech and old tech and

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,139
old cell phones and like, yeah, like my, I wasn't even a cell phone.

7
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:27,149
-- My first thing was a alphanumeric pager.
-- I, I do remember that.

8
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,649
-- Of
-- course, anybody under the age of 40 doesn't know what that.

9
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:31,645
Thank goodness they were terrible.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,525
They're still used because the frequency they're on penetrates buildings,

11
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,205
parking structures, basements.

12
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:42,205
-- So that's why hospitals still use them.
-- That's true. I can hate them though.

13
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,564
I do not miss owning a pager at all

14
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:44,685
so

15
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:48,244
well. And then I had to explain to the waitress, the thing is

16
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:51,055
you would call your answer service and an answer service

17
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:52,985
was this person that would take a message for you.

18
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:53,724
And

19
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:54,720
like,

20
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,459
obviously you have to call them because they can't call you

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,950
because if they could call you and knew where you were,

22
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,770
then the person calling to leave you a message could have just done that.

23
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:01,959
And

24
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,569
that's right. And you couldn't push a message to somebody.

25
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,669
And she's like, oh, yeah, she's like, texts are better and I'm like, uh huh.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,080
-- Yes, they are
-- for sure.

27
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,470
-- I don't think anyone would disagree.
-- That thing. I will never pine for the olden days

28
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:17,419
anyway. All right. This is not a topic I have any desire to dwell on.

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
Well, it's this forward March of progress, which is good because things are better

30
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,370
and

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,730
well better.

32
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:24,470
And

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,699
once in a while

34
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,290
I'll take texting over a voicemail any day,

35
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:28,779
I'll agree

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,959
with that. And like the new voicemail interface in Iowa 17. I'm sorry.

37
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,830
But having it pop up and I can just hit the play button.

38
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,569
I don't have to dial my voicemail, punch in the code and blah, blah, blah.

39
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,809
-- I love that.
-- My phone has been doing that for a long time.

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,900
I don't think it's an I OS 17 feature. I think you're, it's a phone provider feature.

41
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,019
Uh uh

42
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,360
I am with a uh

43
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,319
I'm with Tell us which is a Canadian phone provider. So by definition, they suck.

44
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,819
That's fair.

45
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:55,059
But this goes back to like, for example. So, um unity is a game engine.

46
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,309
It's very widely used.

47
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,220
All right, our topic is uncertainty for anyone who's thinking about it.

48
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,199
Changing

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,309
to a new podcast right now, it's gonna be good.

50
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,209
So unity

51
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,330
-- wants to make more money
-- as does everybody.

52
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,809
Yeah, that's fair. I get that

53
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,429
but

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,309
-- they did two things.
-- Only two,

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,589
well, two main things.

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,289
They did lots of little things, but two main things is number one,

57
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,929
they decided to

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,250
alter the terms of the deal.

59
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,869
-- Pray we don't alter it further,
-- right.

60
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,580
In a, in a way that's pretty ugly. And actually

61
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,910
see, here's the thing,

62
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,149
like Microsoft's is a good example of this Microsoft

63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,679
will absolutely bend you over to make money.

64
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:38,130
And like,

65
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,179
especially if you're like the mouse story where

66
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,380
they saw the mouse at a meeting and then

67
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,910
came out with their own mouse that looks

68
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,229
suspiciously identical six months later or whatever.

69
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:46,889
But in

70
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:49,574
general, if you're an actual partner of Microsoft, they'll bend you over,

71
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,115
but they won't kill you

72
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,024
typically because they understand that they can extract a lot of

73
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:57,134
money in the long term by having a bigger healthier ecosystem.

74
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,645
I don't know if I would agree with that.

75
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,934
There's a whole embrace extend and extinguish concept.

76
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,574
They're a bad example, probably.

77
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:08,815
-- Look, I think we can, we look, we don't need to give examples.
-- Unity went too far

78
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:09,535
with

79
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:12,735
altering the deal and hurting their developers to the point where

80
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:13,229
the,

81
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,899
the new terms of the deal because it was paper install and

82
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,960
if somebody buys your game and installs it on five systems,

83
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,119
now you have to pay five times as much to unity.

84
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,979
OK? We should clarify what, what is even going on.

85
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,250
So unity is a game engine used by mostly

86
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:29,440
independent developers and it's a very nice game engine.

87
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,679
If you've done any game development, ever,

88
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,520
you understand the importance of an engine that takes care of your

89
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:38,820
physics and drawing the sprites and collisions and tons of stuff,

90
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,160
right?

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,610
And unity had a really nice model where for not a lot of money,

92
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,339
you could get a really nice game engine

93
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:46,089
and

94
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,770
recently they altered how the game engine was priced.

95
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:54,139
So they want a cut of every sale after a certain point.

96
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:57,119
So I think you need to get like a million installs or a million revenue.

97
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,580
I forget what the number is exactly.

98
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,089
-- So
-- that was part of the problem is it was based on installs.

99
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,729
So if you're getting like a lot of people trying trials and stuff,

100
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,380
ok.

101
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,250
Basically what it boiled down to is a lot of small developers are like,

102
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,169
hang on a second.

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,309
This might bankrupt to me. Sure,

104
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,979
not, this might cost me money or I might make a lot less money, but

105
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:16,709
this might actually bankrupt me. Sure. Sure.

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,619
Like I will end up owing more money than I've made.

107
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,170
And, and so here's what happened though.

108
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,260
So unity does this, there's enormous backlash

109
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,609
-- there,
-- but there's the second part is

110
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,670
they were going to make this post facto.

111
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,100
So what unity had traditionally done has said has said

112
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:36,269
we have a game engine version X basically they did it by year

113
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,250
and

114
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:41,079
that game engine X year has terms. And if you agree to those terms,

115
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,359
that's the deal moving forwards. If we alter the engine and the deal,

116
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:49,130
you can move to that. And if you don't like it,

117
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,589
you can stay on the old one,

118
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,200
which is not

119
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,679
super great, but it's better than nothing.

120
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,350
But in this case, they said no, no, no,

121
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,119
this is post facto like this is altering

122
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,920
all the deals for all time.

123
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,630
You don't have an option.

124
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,209
You don't have an out and to add insult or injury previously, they,

125
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,089
they had had a github

126
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:09,760
repo

127
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:12,529
that tracked their terms of service and changes to it

128
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,769
and it just sort of got deleted

129
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,720
because no one was reading it, we were told. So it's fine,

130
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,609
but that's the real problem is and this is

131
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,299
very specifically

132
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,309
not how contract law works. Sure

133
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,260
contract law is pretty specific around the world.

134
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,399
But if you agree to a contract, that's the contract.

135
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,220
And if you want to alter the contract,

136
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,239
that either has to be a provision in the contract for that alteration,

137
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,339
like we reserve the right to change the terms and conditions at any time,

138
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,440
we feel without warning,

139
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,220
but that's generally not how actual proper business contracts work.

140
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,019
And so unity had that out, but they, they joined it.

141
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,690
They so they

142
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,070
like every single lawyer that saw this unity thing was like what?

143
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,670
Like

144
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,549
you can't do that.

145
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,579
Ok? Anyway, anyway, it doesn't matter. It's less important. I think.

146
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:58,959
Well, it does matter because it,

147
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,350
-- oh no, no,
-- no, just it's the, the overall problem.

148
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,950
So anyway, unity does all these shenanigans, right?

149
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,380
And an enormous number of people are now saying we're going to move to Godot,

150
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,829
which is go dot Which is an open source gaming engine

151
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,649
and unity has walked back. Some of these changes.

152
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,220
I won't say they walked them all back,

153
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,709
but they realized they kind of made a mistake.

154
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,390
But an enormous number of developers are like,

155
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,450
we're not going back because they're gonna just do it again.

156
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,630
Well, and that's the problem is they can't go back because now unity has introduced,

157
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,989
not only did they do a terrible thing,

158
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,459
but they then walked it back and they were like, oh blah, blah, blah, we,

159
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,549
we hear your concerns.

160
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,440
We, we understand that you don't like this

161
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:44,190
and now they've not only done a bad thing, but they've also done an uncertain thing.

162
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,660
That's right. Exactly.

163
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:48,339
Ok. So, hypothetically speaking,

164
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,420
they could march forward and never do a bad

165
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:53,260
thing again and be a good company that this is

166
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,890
theoretically possible. It's, it's a possibility, it's unlikely.

167
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:01,303
-- And most of us are mostly game devs are not really,
-- we've seen this dance before.

168
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,002
Exactly

169
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:06,433
what is more likely as we've seen many companies and legislatures and things

170
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:09,602
do is introduce a terrible piece of legislation or a terrible change.

171
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:12,282
Walk it back and then just sort of keep hammering that

172
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,083
wedge home until they get it all the way in.

173
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,333
That does happen a lot.

174
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,833
And that's kind of what people expect to

175
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:19,132
happen because that's kind of what usually happens.

176
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,993
But I, I think the uncertainty is

177
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:25,645
the, the key pivot here because as security people,

178
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,946
uncertainty is

179
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:32,385
the single most dangerous thing we have to deal with on a regular basis.

180
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:33,626
And I think there's a couple of

181
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:35,985
how severe is this vulnerability?

182
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:40,996
Yeah, like, if not knowing is worse than anything. And this is where like

183
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:41,946
I give, I mean,

184
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,335
remember when we were at Red Hat and Red Hat marks vulnerabilities won't fix.

185
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,985
And a lot of people are like, oh, you shouldn't do that, but it's like, no, no, no.

186
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:48,440
And,

187
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:48,959
and,

188
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,440
and in an intermediate limbo state of uncertainty

189
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,179
is worse than saying we're never fixing this

190
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,440
because what does the customer do?

191
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,089
Oh,

192
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,630
maybe they're going to fix it and we don't have to worry

193
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,589
about it or maybe they don't fix it but we don't know,

194
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,679
you know, whereas, oh, you're not going to fix it. Ok. Now we have a choice.

195
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,750
We can stop using the product.

196
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,859
We can yell at Red Hat, we can tell them no, you really do need to fix this.

197
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:11,029
We can find a compensating control. We can

198
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,355
and just say, look, it's a moderate, it's cross site scripting.

199
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,635
Just don't log into the admin screen

200
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,394
after clicking links and email. That's

201
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:18,475
right. That's right. Exactly.

202
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,135
And that's the right.

203
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:24,494
And that's the thing is uncertainty increases the cost of dealing with this

204
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,415
by magnitudes

205
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,515
for sure, for sure. I mean, this is,

206
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,364
this is the,

207
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:34,215
the cl a story which we're going to have a whole episode after this one all about CLAS

208
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:37,679
and what's the cl A contributor license agreement? Thank you.

209
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,330
But uh you know, with these, some of these companies like has

210
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,450
a

211
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,700
Corp just did this and, and

212
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,679
Bongo and Redis and, and friends, they changed the license

213
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,859
and that created uncertainty because now people are saying, OK,

214
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,429
so they change it to this, but they could change it again.

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
What do I do? What happens now?

216
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,969
And the thing to remember too is changing the

217
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,630
license or changing the terms of the deal.

218
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
It's not just that

219
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,400
it's

220
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,679
what does this really mean or indicate at a deeper level for sure.

221
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,469
The chances are something not good for you,

222
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,880
right?

223
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,109
And that is, it's part of that uncertainty of, oh I was a partner with them,

224
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,590
but now they see me as food.

225
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:20,599
-- No really.
-- They always saw you as food cart. I just figured it out now.

226
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:25,010
But anyway, and there's a third story we want to tie into this as well,

227
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,719
which is salesforce and meta.

228
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:29,940
When I was searching for the salesforce link, I found out the

229
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,960
salesforce and meta

230
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,880
laid off a ton of people and now they're saying, oh and

231
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,159
-- on second thought, we need to bring some of you back.
-- So,

232
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:41,630
and the best part here is why did all these high tech company layoffs happen?

233
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,409
And from what I've been reading it, it sounds like a

234
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,619
uh tech salaries have been going up, tech people have been, you know,

235
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,739
doing well, doing successful

236
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,289
and a bunch of hedge funds and stuff said we don't like this

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,669
and

238
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,539
as kind of an excuse of between work from home, return to office and, oh COVID,

239
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:01,750
the economy is terrible.

240
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:04,669
These companies like salesforce laid off 10% of their people.

241
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,940
Microsoft had layoffs

242
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,099
and yet they all had either record or

243
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,010
-- borderline record revenue and profits
-- for sure,

244
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,590
for sure.

245
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,799
And there's definitely weird business shenanigans.

246
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,929
None of us will probably ever understand behind all of this.

247
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,229
There's a spreadsheet somewhere that

248
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:24,109
-- made the numbers shift in
-- with. Absolutely.

249
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:24,900
Absolutely.

250
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:29,349
But the point is if, if a company laid you off and I was like, oh, on second thought,

251
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,000
we need you back like

252
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,349
that's uncertainty to a degree and I don't know how you would respond to that.

253
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:39,549
II, I would love to say no way would I come back? But I'm not in a position

254
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,669
to say yes or no to something like that.

255
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,880
But as an outsider that feels like a lot

256
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,599
of unknowns and uncertainty that would make me nervous.

257
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,919
-- The
-- thing
-- is, it's been what, three or four months in sales force case. So either

258
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,950
to put it simply either these people found a new job or they didn't.

259
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,500
And if they found a new job, why in the heck, unless that new job is terrible,

260
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,900
why in the heck would they, like, now give notice that, that new job

261
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,140
and go back to sales force or alternatively, they don't

262
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,960
have a new job and, well, maybe they need to pay the rent so they go back to sales force.

263
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,080
But I would assume I would hope that they're, you know,

264
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,419
buffing their resume and like, looking for something with more stability because,

265
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,330
well, you got laid off once it

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,969
could happen again.

267
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,400
I mean, maybe, maybe it's definitely,

268
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,890
it's, it's one of those weird things and I, I feel like

269
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,609
there's this huge,

270
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:33,169
just like weird pot of uncertainty brewing all over the place right now where I,

271
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,049
I don't know what it is and maybe it's just me being a paranoid security freak,

272
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,549
but I feel like there's so much in the air right now

273
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:43,849
and so many things we can't fathom or understand

274
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:49,260
that the, the level of uncertainty has my spider sense going off like nonstop.

275
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,099
I, I think that's true because for example, pensions and benefits used to be defined

276
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,640
in the sense of like you work for the government

277
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,989
and for every year you work for the government,

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,830
you get 2%.

279
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,400
That's how it works provincially here.

280
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:03,299
Now it's 1.25% matching funds and stuff.

281
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,260
And a private companies, like, remember when Sears went out of business.

282
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,140
Oh, yeah.

283
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,859
You remember what happened to the pension fund?

284
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,229
-- What
-- pension fund?

285
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,599
Yeah, that's,

286
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,690
oops,

287
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,809
that money was supposed to be protected and put

288
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,659
aside for these people and now it's gone.

289
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,030
You,

290
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,950
you actually reminded me of another angle to

291
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,650
this with the whole government talk is so,

292
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,570
first of all the US government's credit rating

293
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:33,929
was decreased like it earlier in the year. And part of the reason was uncertainty

294
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,280
because the like the politicians we have in the

295
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,950
United States can't freaking tie their shoes right now.

296
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,450
So the credit agencies were like, this is uncertainty. We don't like uncertainty.

297
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,039
We're going to lower your credit rating,

298
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:44,960
which

299
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,409
I don't blame them for it all.

300
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,780
But then, but then here's the other thing that really, I find amusing

301
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,700
is

302
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,030
there is a ton of open government jobs in the United States

303
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,080
and they're struggling to fill them.

304
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,760
And one of the reasons is because we have a political party in the

305
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,940
United States saying if we take control of the government in the next election,

306
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,299
we're going to fire half of the government.

307
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,780
-- Would you take that job? Like no freaking way to like, no, absolutely
-- not.

308
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:16,239
Well, and a great example of this is so there's a list of federal shutdowns here

309
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,739
and

310
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:22,380
there were 1234, the first four shutdowns.

311
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,619
Guess how long they were

312
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:27,739
there? The couple days only. I know they were really short 11 day. Ok.

313
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,659
The third one was approximately the, the,

314
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,630
the 3rd and 4th 1 were approximately four hours.

315
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,169
-- That sounds like someone lost the paperwork or something
-- pretty much.

316
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,330
Then in 1990

317
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:42,559
1995 you have a three and a five day shut down. Ok, that's bad.

318
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,140
And then in 1995 96 a 21 day shutdown.

319
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,380
And then of course, you know, the 2013 1 for 16 days, the 2018,

320
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,780
1 for three days and then the 2018 1 for 35 days

321
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,940
as I speak, as an outsider here, I'm Canadian and I look at it and I'm like,

322
00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:00,119
this is literally insane to me.

323
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,780
Yeah, it's definitely not because

324
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,049
one of the few jobs of government is to have legitimacy.

325
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,659
Right. Yes. And

326
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,159
you're not supposed to show the side of your, like if you're going to have a fight,

327
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,880
you do it behind closed doors like you don't

328
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,760
this in public so to speak.

329
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,219
And so as an outsider, I just find this utterly insane that your government

330
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:24,659
-- can shut down.
-- I mean, I think most of us here think that also

331
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,859
and all non-essential services like the Park rangers and stuff are kind of like

332
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,070
it

333
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,979
-- just left hanging in the wind
-- like much,

334
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,669
don't go to work, don't get paid

335
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:34,859
-- that.
-- And so

336
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,349
again, back to this,

337
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,650
but the thing is the beauty is the US government has enough legitimacy.

338
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,099
They're like,

339
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,989
what are you going to do about it? Right. Not pay your taxes. Ignore us

340
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,789
like that.

341
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,140
-- How this
-- works. I don't think that's gonna work.

342
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,820
So

343
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:50,919
there was this great quote that somebody said it was a Dutch quote that trust

344
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,570
walks in but leaves on horse,

345
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:59,479
which is to say it takes a long time and effort to build trust and it leaves very fast.

346
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:00,460
And somebody else pointed out

347
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:03,159
if you do a great job and make people happy,

348
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,710
they basically won't say anything, whatever, who cares.

349
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,599
But if you piss them off

350
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,000
and break their trust,

351
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,409
-- well, they'll tell their friends
-- it's, it's the perpetual challenge of security.

352
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,340
If we do our jobs, nothing happens.

353
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,909
But when we don't do our jobs, holy cow. Do we hear about it?

354
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,760
And we hear about it

355
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,859
and, and I think the whole uncertainty angle and this is,

356
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,520
this is truly why I wanted to discuss this even is just the fact that

357
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,440
as security people,

358
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,780
if we are, if your organization has like a concept of uncertainty,

359
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,359
especially around security,

360
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,419
you're going to have a problem because part of

361
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:45,369
our job is removing uncertainty from doing business.

362
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,049
Yes.

363
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,690
Like

364
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,070
that sounds silly when you say it, but that's it.

365
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,900
Well, it's managing risk

366
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,840
and to manage risk, you have to quantify it.

367
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:57,150
And what really blows my mind about unity is ignoring for the

368
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,979
fact whether or not what they did was bad or wrong.

369
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,919
They made a significant decision

370
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,450
and then a week later, totally reversed it,

371
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,929
which shows

372
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,390
you clearly didn't consider

373
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,390
your decision.

374
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,820
You know, it's like you're playing chess and you blundered your queen.

375
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,409
Yeah.

376
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:15,770
Like you, you clearly didn't think this moved through and oops.

377
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,900
And now you're like, oh, we're going to take it back like

378
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,450
that doesn't work in chess, but it does work in real life.

379
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,770
But what it says to me is that your senior leadership

380
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,070
is not very competent,

381
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,049
probably not, you know what? It's

382
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,929
probably not provably not because either they would have made the bad

383
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,500
decision and stuck with it or found some way to sell it

384
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:33,450
or

385
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,599
they would have made the bad decision in the first place.

386
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,099
They would have floated it and been like, oh wow, wow,

387
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,440
that's some negative feedback.

388
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:42,500
And the lawyers are saying that's not how contract law works.

389
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,820
So maybe we shouldn't do this.

390
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,030
You know, it's like the,

391
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,760
the layoff at sales force where they laid off 10% of their people.

392
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,280
And now four months later are saying

393
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,190
they literally had a Boomerang campaign.

394
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,599
They had stuffed Boomerang plushies and t-shirts.

395
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,400
And my only thought was like, if you throw a boomerang and don't pay attention,

396
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,609
it's gonna whack you in the head.

397
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,809
And

398
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,180
like that's, that was my mental image of this Boomerang campaign.

399
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,160
But they literally were throwing boomerang plushies out into

400
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,239
the crowd trying to like hype people up to

401
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,770
like get them to tell their friends to come

402
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,969
back to sales force after they've been laid off.

403
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:13,770
And,

404
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,420
like,

405
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,680
it's kind of one thing if you get laid off

406
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,630
from the government because the government is big and impersonal,

407
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,108
it's like nothing personal but just

408
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,489
the, you know, the way the election went or whatever,

409
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,665
but salesforce, it's very much. No. The company laid me off to make numbers

410
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:27,295
and now you want me back,

411
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:28,685
it happens.

412
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,704
Well, the next time you need to make the numbers.

413
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:34,344
That's right. I guess I'm on that list of

414
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:35,074
probably

415
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,885
here's the fat we can trim

416
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,505
and it just, it blows my mind that

417
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:41,584
number one,

418
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,415
every place I've ever worked.

419
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,369
Well,

420
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,170
I've actually not been locked out immediately when I

421
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,589
give notice because they generally make me keep working,

422
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,170
which annoys me.

423
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,540
I want to get locked out for two weeks.

424
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,040
-- I wish I had that too.
-- I

425
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:53,219
know.

426
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:53,729
Right.

427
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,170
But in general when you lay off somebody or fire them or whatever, you,

428
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,050
you walk them out and it's like work done here

429
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:01,650
and

430
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,410
because there are a risk at that point,

431
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,530
well, it's not even that they're a risk. It's like

432
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,459
I want to be locked out because if anything goes wrong,

433
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:08,650
I don't want to get blamed for it

434
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,430
because like, enough stuff goes wrong naturally

435
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:15,060
that I get blamed for anyways. I don't need to intentionally break things,

436
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:16,739
you know, like,

437
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,439
like the time I broke, uh,

438
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:22,199
access to the admin control panel on the website because I forgot,

439
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,040
I'm not in the WF rule

440
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:26,119
that

441
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,010
everything's fine.

442
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,750
But like,

443
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,079
it's weird to me that we have this idea of this, like,

444
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,920
insider threat of the minute you lay off somebody or fire them

445
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,020
-- and now they're asking them to come back.
-- I mean,

446
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,040
that's a funny conversation.

447
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,239
Like,

448
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,609
are they really going to be working hard and

449
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,390
giving the company all they've got after the company,

450
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,520
like, kicked them to the curb literally.

451
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,540
I mean, look, I don't, I don't think you can make that accusation.

452
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,339
I think it's on a case by case basis.

453
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,579
I think there are people who would come back and like, legitimately be phenomenal

454
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,670
workers and there, there might be people who would come back and not be,

455
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
you know, statistically,

456
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,239
you have to think the bell curve would have shifted to a side.

457
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,599
-- Maybe
-- you'd think so.

458
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,380
I, I would think so, but I'm not willing to make that assumption either

459
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,319
because I think anyone listening in that position who would go back,

460
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,040
like,

461
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,390
yeah, I don't want crap on them.

462
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,030
Well, there's different reasons for going back.

463
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:18,099
You know, a lot of people are very moral and ethical and won't cause any problems.

464
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,119
But at the same time, like,

465
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:22,040
I have to assume that they're going to be looking for a

466
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,270
new job and going to be leaving at some point because,

467
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,599
you know, they already got kicked out once or

468
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,349
like the unity thing. It was funny.

469
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,449
I was watching, um, you know, day nine, former Starcraft caster and

470
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,550
he's big in the gaming thing. Right on youtube.

471
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,250
Uh very educational, great guy.

472
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,979
And, you know, and he's basically talking about the unity situation. He's like,

473
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,790
Mike, the company he works for, did not choose unity for different reasons.

474
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,829
But he's like, well, you know, it's,

475
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,890
it's just one more thing they're glad about like,

476
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,119
oh, when the CS A moved out of last Pass, we actually moved out of last pass

477
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:54,400
because we couldn't get access to somebody's passwords when

478
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,579
they left unless they gave us the master password.

479
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,270
And I needed that corporate recovery because that's not their accounts.

480
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,510
-- It's the C SAS accounts.
-- Right. Right.

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,319
Plus last Pass had a history of some security incidents.

482
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,479
It was starting to make me nervous.

483
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:07,819
So it's funny you say that because I remember when

484
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:10,949
I moved my family from last pass to one password,

485
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,300
it was painful

486
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:15,469
and it wasn't even because they had a lot of security incidents.

487
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,069
It's because they handled it all incompetently. And I had

488
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:22,829
the level of uncertainty I had in their product was

489
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,890
off the charts and I was like,

490
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,150
you have to stop using this. Like, this is unsafe.

491
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:28,810
Yeah.

492
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:31,930
And the thing is I can do products that

493
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,849
are incompetent and unsafe potentially for certain things,

494
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,569
but something like a password manager or my car

495
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,329
or the food I eat

496
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:46,489
I, I need it to be good quality certainty. Boring like that.

497
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,079
Nutritional label actually needs to be what's in the package.

498
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,109
My car, if it, you know, starts to fail,

499
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,310
it needs to fail in a way that doesn't involve me

500
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,569
careening into a car accident,

501
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:57,949
for sure. For sure.

502
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,560
And my password manager, if it has a problem or fails,

503
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,709
I need it to fail in a way that doesn't result in,

504
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,209
oh, they used one round of encryption.

505
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,569
So even if I like,

506
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,229
I'm sorry, but I don't care how good your master password is,

507
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,650
if there's only one round of encryption.

508
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,959
GP us are heck fast nowadays

509
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,969
for sure.

510
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,079
I mean, I just,

511
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,459
I literally bought two and shoved them into my desktop here so I

512
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,910
could have 24 gigs of V RA M affordably for like 600 bucks.

513
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,699
U si got 24 GAV

514
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,040
each. Uh 12 gigs each.

515
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,500
No, I mean 600 bucks for both.

516
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,089
No, 600 bucks total.

517
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:34,660
They were about 400 bucks. Canadian apiece

518
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,050
like

519
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,979
a pair of RT X 30 sixties with 12 gigs of ra M.

520
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,420
I don't know what any of those numbers mean, but I'll assume they're good.

521
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,270
It has like

522
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,500
somewhere between seven and 9000 K

523
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,010
Decors each and 12 gigs of ra M and like, wow, I upgraded from an NVIDIA super 1616 50

524
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,829
or 1660 super. Also not help.

525
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,229
Well, that's,

526
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,890
that's the actual current most popular card on

527
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,910
steam and has been for four years now because

528
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,310
the video card market went all.

529
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:02,824
But like

530
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:07,045
I fire a BNG and instead of it like drawing it like a child with a crayon,

531
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:08,155
like doing one thing at a time.

532
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:11,655
-- Like there's your fender b
-- ng the, the driving game you mean?

533
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:16,055
So like it draws the fender, then it draws the tire, then it draws a boulder

534
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,744
like it's like watching Bob Ross, like over here we're gonna put this,

535
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,935
this one is just like put up.

536
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,760
-- Oh, cool.
-- And it's butter smooth.

537
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:23,959
I mean,

538
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,079
-- you have $600 worth of graphics card now.
-- Well, yeah, exactly.

539
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,939
But, um, but back to the uncertainty,

540
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,040
if there's uncertainty then,

541
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,319
well, I don't want to plan for the worst case scenario because that's expensive.

542
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,000
But maybe I have to plan for the

543
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,239
worst case scenario because maybe that's what will happen

544
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:44,640
and conversely, maybe nothing happens.

545
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,680
Maybe I get my best case scenario and I don't have to do anything,

546
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,599
but that's also not very likely because the

547
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,640
company showed that they might do something goofy.

548
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,239
-- I mean,
-- but this is, this is part of our job.

549
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,310
If you get laid off,

550
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,420
you have to plan, you have to do, I need to find a new job.

551
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,109
Yeah. Or do I wait for sales force to call me back?

552
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,630
No, I don't think anyone would say that's a strategy.

553
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,270
That's what sales force thought they were

554
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,430
apparently. Doing.

555
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:12,369
-- I, I,
-- I have a better example that's less offensive in terror inducing than layoffs.

556
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:13,430
So

557
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,709
we

558
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,290
at

559
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,010
Encor

560
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,219
have a container registry. We use to distribute our product. Right.

561
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,829
And we're having some

562
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,180
issues with the registry we're using today. I'll say,

563
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,579
and we need a solution and we need it soon.

564
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,910
And this is one of those things where,

565
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,369
like when you have a service that is core to your business.

566
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,699
If it fails, that is an existential threat. Yes.

567
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,579
And it's funny because we were in a meeting and I'm like,

568
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,459
this is an existential threat.

569
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,760
Like we're fixing it now.

570
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,729
You know what I mean?

571
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,699
And that as soon as that is said, it's like, oh, of course,

572
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,939
it is like we need to do it right now.

573
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,550
And I think this is

574
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,239
as security people.

575
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:00,250
I think one of the really interesting things because anything that is core to

576
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,890
basically the things that keep the lights on and keep pay the paychecks coming,

577
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,869
those are the services you absolutely cannot live without. Right.

578
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,229
Like, I think we could all agree if our email fell off the face of the planet,

579
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,959
we would have enormous problems.

580
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:15,869
You know what I mean?

581
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,989
We ceased to function as a, as an organization

582
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,050
and,

583
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,390
-- and
-- so how would you even coordinate recovery?

584
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,430
-- No. Really?
-- Well, I mean, so that's another conversation. There are ways

585
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,739
of doing, you know, side channel conversations and things that, that's another,

586
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,449
it's disaster.

587
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,160
-- Recovery at that point.
-- Right. Let me, oh, here's a question.

588
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,040
How would you do a cold start of your company if you had control of your domain name?

589
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,920
And that was it.

590
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,760
I, I have, it's written down.

591
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,119
-- No, it's, it's phone telephones because
-- you're a crazy person that

592
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,589
plans for this eventuality. I guarantee you less than 1% of companies

593
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,410
have thought this through.

594
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,489
But yeah, like this is,

595
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,989
this is one of the things you account for in

596
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,979
a like a tinfoil hat disaster recovery program is like,

597
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:58,589
let's say literally all of the infrastructure we have is gone,

598
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,170
including employee laptops.

599
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,770
What happens next?

600
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,810
And of course,

601
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:05,670
the cell phone network needs to survive for my plan to work if that's gone.

602
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,560
I assume society is crumbled. So I'm fine.

603
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,209
Like I have other issues then

604
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:09,880
like

605
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:10,689
anyway,

606
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:15,849
but I, I think this is one of the pieces of uncertainty I think about all the time

607
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:19,199
is what are like, what are the things we absolutely have to have?

608
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:21,250
It's kind of like Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right?

609
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,010
Like if I don't have food and water, I don't care if I have internet.

610
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,609
Well, I kind of do, but you know what I mean?

611
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,839
Like maybe internet and food and water are on the same level.

612
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,040
But you know what I'm saying?

613
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,579
And I know like people say, oh,

614
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,939
Maslow's hierarchy has been debunked and whatever

615
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,459
-- they sort of
-- represent the same thing,

616
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:39,140
their, their foundational infrastructure now and if they cease to work,

617
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,089
then something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

618
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,900
And now that you say this a lot,

619
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,270
I think this is one of the reasons why A I is

620
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,439
scaring so many companies is because they want to use it.

621
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:49,400
But

622
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,660
even as like, let's ignore, like, OK,

623
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,930
let's say they use Microsoft's A I which I think we'll agree that

624
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,280
Microsoft as a company is going to be around for a long time and

625
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,790
they only kill products if they like really have to

626
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,920
like, they're not Google

627
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,420
to put it bluntly like,

628
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,189
oh, what was that Google service?

629
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,729
You said you were going to start using and I'm like, in three years,

630
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:09,949
you're going to be angry about it.

631
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,810
Oh, I forget what it is. They just read the price on Google apps for your domain

632
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:17,010
and there's, I think they call it Cloud Id.

633
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,729
Oh Cloud ID. That's the one which is where you can keep the login

634
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,010
because like, one of my concerns with,

635
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,219
if I would even try to move away from Google for my domain,

636
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,430
your single sign on

637
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,939
single sign up, but you can supposedly keep that for free.

638
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,760
But at the same time, like you said,

639
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,849
Google doesn't have the best track record in this sport.

640
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:35,040
They

641
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,199
just

642
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,250
Google Podcast.

643
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,569
I don't even know.

644
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:37,790
I

645
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,420
have no

646
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:38,859
idea.

647
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:40,010
The thing I'm thinking of the,

648
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,329
one of the biggest challenges with A I is not whether or not,

649
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,689
the company stays around and all that.

650
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:43,930
It's

651
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,719
the A I

652
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:49,305
models themselves are constantly being modified with new guard rails,

653
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:53,094
new capabilities capabilities that get worse or go away entirely.

654
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:55,525
And so if you have a business process that depends on being

655
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:58,175
able to ask this A I reliably a question of like,

656
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,925
and it all of a sudden

657
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,795
either stops answering in which case, at least, you know,

658
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:04,635
something happened and went wrong

659
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:08,285
or worse. What if it subtly answers X

660
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:10,244
differently in a way that

661
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,150
is like, let's say you're using it for contract reviews

662
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:16,949
that could have some significant consequences. And,

663
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,819
and, and I think this is

664
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:21,839
um I've been thinking about this like, why are these companies so scared to use it?

665
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,099
And it's this uncertainty of

666
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,979
and I think this is one of the reasons open source A I will really take off

667
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:31,339
is because you can basically deploy an A I and freeze it and just be like,

668
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,660
it will behave this way

669
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:35,920
because even if it's true, I that you deploy in a quote

670
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,939
unquote frozen state,

671
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,310
you know, if you modify the temperature, these things are so complicated,

672
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,849
they can give totally different answers.

673
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,329
00 for sure, for sure.

674
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,290
But you could take away a lot of uncertainty and risk of like

675
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,449
all those, remember those lawyers that were saying like, yeah, man

676
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:50,199
cha PT four,

677
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,000
like I had to do my job and now they like put

678
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,750
on some guard rails and I have to like rejigger all my

679
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,729
making it, write my briefs.

680
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,069
You know what else this reminds me of is Slack

681
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,250
just changed their U I and I freaking hate it.

682
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,339
And it's like the

683
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:07,180
worst. This is one of the issues I have with the whole like universe is a service is

684
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,349
if one day Slack decides we're changing the U I

685
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,849
I have zero say in this, I can't be like this is stupid.

686
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,930
I am really struggling with the new UI

687
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:18,170
I am having not a good time with it.

688
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:21,949
I don't want, I don't want to feel like old man yells at Cloud here but man, it's

689
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,800
not good.

690
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,079
I'm not seeing how it benefits me. Like I OS has,

691
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,369
I've been using it since the iphone version three.

692
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,170
So whatever version of I OS that was, it was in the single digits and now up to 17

693
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:34,369
and

694
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,689
they haven't done anything that made it

695
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,750
-- immediately significantly worse.
-- I won't disagree with that statement.

696
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,150
I feel like I just upgraded to the latest I Os. Not long.

697
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,479
What did I know it was my, my Mac, my Macbook,

698
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:53,270
I upgraded my Macbook to the latest version because part of my job is like

699
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,670
guinea picking all this crap to make sure it doesn't break any of our apps

700
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,849
and

701
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,550
nothing. I I looked at the the changes list. I'm like,

702
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,060
I don't even know what any of this is the one, the one joke I made is Apple.

703
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:07,130
Now claims like improved gaming experience.

704
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,270
I'm like, oh, I better game for the ne the rest of the week.

705
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,329
Everyone to, to make sure it works.

706
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,729
-- Those seven users care.
-- I wish, I wish I could do that.

707
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:15,060
Does ma

708
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,010
-- even show up in the steam survey? I have
-- no idea.

709
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,910
Do they? Does steam run on Mac? I don't even know.

710
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,099
I have steam running on that M One Mac over there. It's beautiful.

711
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,329
The M One is a very quick machine.

712
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,880
Ok. That's fair. That's fair.

713
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:29,099
But

714
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,089
anyway, anyway,

715
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:34,030
-- this
-- uncertainty thing, I think part of it is there,

716
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,979
there are certain things in life that are uncertain by definition,

717
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:37,760
like the weather,

718
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,310
the weather is just uncertain and har particularly kind of like this hurricane,

719
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,750
it could go here, it could go over there.

720
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,130
Who knows? The supercomputer said maybe there.

721
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,469
But the European supercomputer said maybe over there.

722
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,729
But there's a lot of uncertainty that people generate

723
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,619
unnecessarily.

724
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,010
Like if salesforce did 10% layoffs and said like

725
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:57,849
too bad

726
00:29:58,109 --> 00:29:59,209
10% layoffs.

727
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,930
Well, that's usually what that would have been the end of the story,

728
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,890
but now four months later,

729
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,689
they're like literally a boomerang campaign of please come back.

730
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,229
Wow, that's kind of messed up,

731
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,750
right? Like

732
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,810
kind of,

733
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,500
you know,

734
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,369
next

735
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:13,670
-- year.
-- I

736
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,569
mean, maybe that's a good question.

737
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,339
And so that's the thing is,

738
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,920
I guess if possible introduce as little uncertainty as possible.

739
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,400
So that means things like gaming out the decision before you announce it.

740
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,290
Sure,

741
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,819
maybe like actually maybe like have a quiet side conversation

742
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,329
with a customer and see if they punch you.

743
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,770
No, no, I want, I want to clarify something. We're running ourselves out of time,

744
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,170
but I think we should end on this point.

745
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,660
You mentioned like gaming it out and,

746
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:42,030
and clarifying decisions and all this.

747
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:47,630
I have a suspicion that as security people, this feels extra ridiculous to us

748
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,540
because part of what we do

749
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,339
is trying to understand uncertainty before it becomes a problem and address it.

750
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,540
Right? Because we're like, broken humans

751
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,130
that we, we purposely look for the worst in every situation.

752
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,729
And it's funny because you, I mean,

753
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:06,050
I'm sure we've all been there where you talk to a friend and you're like, oh,

754
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,790
that's not safe and they're like, what's wrong with you?

755
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,069
Why would you even talk about that?

756
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,170
You know, where you see a thing or whatever?

757
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,979
And

758
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:15,050
I have a suspicion most of the leadership

759
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,489
that is responsible for things like coordinating layoffs or headcount or whatever

760
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,569
has never had to do that

761
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,000
in the kind of way we do so to them,

762
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,079
they had no idea this was a possibility.

763
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,530
They certainly don't do it every day, although

764
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:31,800
they should.

765
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:32,500
That's,

766
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,390
that's one thing I really respect is whenever

767
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,270
you watch a competent Western military general,

768
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,410
uh, testifying in front of Congress or the Senate or having, you know,

769
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,479
their internal meetings with their general staff,

770
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,920
they really do

771
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,260
consider a lot of

772
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,550
the potential bad things.

773
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,660
And despite that, we still have, you know, like 20 years of war in Afghanistan

774
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,260
and then two weeks later it's like, whoops. Well, that was a total waste of time.

775
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,420
That's true.

776
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,140
That's true.

777
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,650
But

778
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,300
they

779
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,020
are at least working towards that because they have real world consequences.

780
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,709
They do and, like, very real. Like, people die in real world.

781
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:07,849
Like at least when we screw up, like people don't die.

782
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:11,609
Remember when we were all afraid of Russia and their military power

783
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,020
and now to quote,

784
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,270
I forget who I'm quoting.

785
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,079
But, you know, Russia is still the second most powerful military

786
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:18,750
in

787
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,510
Ukraine.

788
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:20,140
Yeah,

789
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:21,089
like

790
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,650
not the world but

791
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,250
Ukraine.

792
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:23,920
Right.

793
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,449
Yeah. Oh, for sure. For sure.

794
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:27,160
If you'd said that to me in the eighties

795
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,630
or nineties or two thousands or even 2000 tens,

796
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,290
I would have been like, what the heck?

797
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:31,589
No.

798
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:34,420
Yeah. No, no way. Like you're nuts. No way.

799
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,800
Like they have 5000 tanks.

800
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,989
-- Yep. Yep.
-- For sure. Here

801
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:38,869
we are,

802
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,030
here, we are. That's like the,

803
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,780
here we are. That feels like the motto.

804
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,719
This is the thing like uncertainty to me

805
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,180
indicates that the leadership has done a terrible

806
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,550
-- job.
-- Well, look, here's what I'm going to end on.

807
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,739
Uncertainty breeds mistrust

808
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,589
and an enormous amount of what we do on a daily basis, either personally. Or in,

809
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,489
as business people

810
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:06,270
-- trust is the currency that makes it all go.
-- Yep.

811
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,709
That's the reason I can,

812
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,810
because I can phone a random restaurant and order 50 bucks of food and they're like,

813
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:12,390
ok,

814
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,150
it'll be 30 minutes and then hang up on me

815
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,819
and I don't have to pay for it and I don't have to, you know, they just, it works

816
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,790
because trust

817
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,829
exactly

818
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,739
100%.

819
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,140
All right, I'm calling

820
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,439
