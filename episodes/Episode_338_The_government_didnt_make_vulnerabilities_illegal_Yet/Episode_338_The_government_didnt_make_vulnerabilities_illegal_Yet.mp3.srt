Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,289
and my partner in tearing apart possibly bad legislation. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,560
That's not even the worst of it.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,329
So, we record this show on Wednesdays and since the last recording,

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,569
I think two decades worth of news have

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,479
occurred and I'm concerned of what will happen between

6
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,409
today and Sunday.

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,979
This is why we're not discussing Twitter because whatever we say will be obsolete.

8
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,139
Yeah, I know. I know. Exactly. So, I mean, just kind of to set things where we're at.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,560
There's been what the NDA A legislation which we want to talk

10
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:43,759
about today because I feel like that's at least calmed down enough.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,369
We can have a sensible conversation.

12
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:48,369
There's the Twitter news of Mudge,

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,290
like Outing Twitter and that's like a whole nother can of w

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,090
not even just Outing Twitter but like, sec fraud

15
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,549
related stuff. Like that's

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,610
no, like, as businesses go,

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:02,639
that's one of the few things you can do and end up in prison.

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,699
That's probably true. Not prison, prison.

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,099
But like,

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,489
that's one of the few things you can

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,239
do as a company where corporate officers actually

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,150
are harshly sanctioned.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,660
That's true. That is true.

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,080
You can literally kill people whatever it happens. But like

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,400
you mess with fraud and security

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,440
related acts,

27
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,069
-- I suppose. But then there's also flex was
-- hacked.

28
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,419
-- What was up with that? Because I'm like,
-- no one knows yet. No one knows.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,010
-- But here's what I, I
-- haven't received a freaking,

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,550
-- oh, you didn't
-- get an email? I got an email this morning.

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,519
Oh, here we go.

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,639
-- I just did. But
-- here's where it gets

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,230
more strange is they just claim an attacker acquired.

34
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:40,480
We,

35
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:42,330
we'll say we'll put the word hash passwords

36
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,470
and quotes because even that's not totally clear.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
They claim

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,139
they're resetting everyone's accounts out of an abundance of caution,

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,879
which is fine.

40
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,199
But then when I,

41
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,839
it took me multiple tries to get my password reset this morning.

42
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:58,489
But then when I logged into plex to like, look at it to make sure it was there,

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,040
none of their services worked.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,120
The machine in my basement worked fine, but their stuff was all down.

45
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:07,959
-- So I'm like this, this doesn't smell quite right.
-- Honestly, that was my first thing.

46
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,824
I was like, I made sure my local plex is working because of the my kids will be annoyed.

47
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:13,203
And I'm like, ok, great.

48
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,643
Yeah, it's so, yeah, because yeah,

49
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,524
they were saying hashed or salted or whatever passwords.

50
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:19,554
The email says encrypted passwords.

51
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:23,544
And I will say one thing in their defense, people often mix the two up. I agree.

52
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:27,384
I, and whatever, you know, we'll see. Right. Let's wait and see.

53
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:30,544
But then also there's a pie, pie, fish going around

54
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:33,574
where people are trying to fish, pie, pie, maintainers, passwords.

55
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,434
And I'm just like,

56
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:39,024
I don't know what's happening anymore. Everything is ridiculous

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,820
and there's, there's other things I'm not even going to anyway, whatever

58
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,679
everything is bananas. And so

59
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:46,880
I,

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,690
I don't even know what's going to happen between now and next week

61
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,649
I have a new thing.

62
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,509
I, I think we should think about doing at the beginning of some of the shows is

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,720
every now and then I stumble across like a podcast or a

64
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,529
news site or just something that I think tickles my fancy and,

65
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,759
and I have two that I found recently that I'm really enjoying that.

66
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to give a shout out to the first is called the Hacker Mind Podcast.

67
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:15,080
-- It's by the, the, uh David Brumley group.
-- You have to give me the,

68
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,279
I can react to it.

69
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,740
Yeah, I'll put it, whatever it doesn't react thing.

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,369
I'm just, well, I'll put it in the show notes.

71
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:21,839
It's the for all secure guy.

72
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,320
We had David Brumley on the show and like years ago, it feels like now.

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,360
But anyway, they have a podcast that's pretty good called the Hacker Mind.

74
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:31,160
And there's another one that Linux foundation just came out with and they,

75
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,199
it's called the, the Untold Stories of Open Source.

76
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,679
And it is really freaking

77
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,869
where it's just old people telling stories,

78
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,690
which is like my favorite kind of podcast.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,190
But I love that

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,580
we have this, like, sanitized view of history and I mean,

81
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,020
like all history where it's just like, you know, stuff happened,

82
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:48,350
people were sort of in charge and like, things happen.

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,940
But when you actually dig into history, it's all like,

84
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,410
people were just like, reacting and being crazy and dealing with insane stuff.

85
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,580
Be it a world war or like the open source world?

86
00:03:58,589 --> 00:03:58,830
Like,

87
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,029
and it's even more wild than that sometimes

88
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,460
I think because obviously it's totally survivor bias,

89
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,750
right?

90
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,389
That anything we hear now.

91
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:06,429
But then

92
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,389
it's fun to listen to people explain

93
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,460
an event

94
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,919
and there is what they tell and then there's what I

95
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,630
remember and I know both of those accounts are incorrect because

96
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,510
there's something entirely different happened and you remember what you want to,

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,809
but it amuses me to no end of being like, oh, I remember that or I was there for that or?

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,670
Oh, yes, I, that person I hated them too.

99
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,829
But yeah, it's a lot of fun. Anyway,

100
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,190
links in the show notes.

101
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,890
But I, I think it's

102
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,010
as I find amusing things, I think it would be enjoyable.

103
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,489
We could do like a site with a directory of pages linking to these things.

104
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,049
-- Maybe,
-- I don't know. I'll think about it. I'm really lazy.

105
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:48,920
I remember when Yahoo like Netscape. Oh, no, sorry, not Yahoo.

106
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,320
Not even Yahoo that Netscape.

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,970
Remember when Netscape, the Netscape directory of the internet

108
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,649
and, like, trying to game yourself onto certain pages. And

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,309
that's right.

110
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,750
Well, and I mean, that was what made

111
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,359
like, like things like Yahoo and Google so amazing is they were automatic.

112
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,290
They weren't hand

113
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,480
curated lists

114
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,359
anyway. Anyway.

115
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,329
All right, let's, let's get on to our, our actual topic of the day,

116
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,089
the National Defense Authorization Act.

117
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,130
So

118
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,250
it is, I,

119
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,250
I'll give a little bit of background and then we'll kind of get into the meat of it.

120
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,959
So, every year,

121
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,609
well, this is my understanding, some of this might be wrong.

122
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:28,010
So if I'm wrong, like just yell at me on Twitter or something. But

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,750
every year, the US federal government basically gives the, the,

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,410
the US Department of Defense a budget

125
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,809
and it's called the National Defense Authorization Act where they basically say,

126
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,390
like these are the things we want you to do and then they

127
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,660
turn it into a law and they give it to them and say,

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,989
here you go, go nuts.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,630
And

130
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,260
you can imagine this is a, a multi 1000 page document.

131
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,605
Like this is not something any human is going to

132
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:53,804
sit down and read in a reasonable amount of time.

133
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:58,524
I'm skeptical any human could actually read it because it is, we'll say it's not the,

134
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,984
the edge of your seat sort of reading material.

135
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:05,804
-- It is very dry and very long and very boring. Well,
-- it's like reading code.

136
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,695
-- It's, yes,
-- yes, it is a source code to the government.

137
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,795
The only problem is the compiler sucks.

138
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,200
-- That's
-- a good joke. This is why I don't program.

139
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,750
This is why I write articles for humans because humans

140
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,809
are fuzzy compilers and I can write basically borderline garbage.

141
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,290
And if the words are even remotely in the right order, people understand what I say.

142
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,980
That's so good. That's so good.

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,390
The NDA A

144
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,570
has a couple of there,

145
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:36,589
there's some moving parts to how this works. And

146
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,649
the House of Representatives passed their version.

147
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,850
The US Senate has to get their version passed which will

148
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,760
be slightly different and then they have to reconcile the two.

149
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,529
And in the House of Representatives version

150
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,049
at this time,

151
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,959
there is language that I should actually look up the exact language that,

152
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,920
-- that it says
-- it's in my blog post

153
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,200
and

154
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,239
we'll put a link to your blog post and but it,

155
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,200
but it basically says each item listed on the submitted

156
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:07,320
bill of materials is free from all known vulnerabilities or defects

157
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,799
affecting the security of the end product or service identified

158
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,549
in a the National Institute of Standards and Technology Nist,

159
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,720
the NV,

160
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,984
the National Vulnerability Database and any

161
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:22,154
database designated by the under secretary in

162
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,095
co ordination with the director of

163
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:27,375
the cybersecurity and infrastructure Security Agency.

164
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:30,375
That's a mouthful that tracks security vulnerabilities and defects

165
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,804
in open source or third party developed software.

166
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:33,674
So basically

167
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,839
what this says is you cannot sell software to

168
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,070
the US government that is affected by known vulnerabilities.

169
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,619
No, that's not what it says

170
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,649
because later on it says you can have a mitigation plan

171
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,119
-- or you have to have a mitigation plan.
-- Mitigations don't count as affected.

172
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:53,415
Like the vulnerability can exist if you can mitigate

173
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:56,595
it or it's not actively exploitable in the software

174
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:57,815
that doesn't count.

175
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:58,065
Well,

176
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,934
what they say here is a notification relating to the plan to mitigate repair or

177
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:04,415
resolve each security vulnerability or defect listed

178
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,375
in the notification required under paragraph two.

179
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,059
Ok. That's fair. Having a plan. But this is where it gets complicated, right?

180
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,619
Because there's,

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,720
it's, it's hard to untangle all this. Now, here's the most important part.

182
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,589
Before we start this conversation, this text will not survive the Senate.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,390
I talked to some policy people.

184
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,559
I know and basically said, like, how big of a deal is this? And they, they all said

185
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,829
it's not gonna make it through the Senate

186
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,179
guaranteed,

187
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:30,670
right?

188
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:35,530
Like this is a bit of a wink and a nudge sort of situation where the many companies

189
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,609
and many people in positions of power are going

190
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,619
to make sure it doesn't happen this time.

191
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,469
However,

192
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,340
it is going to come,

193
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,630
-- it's basically a warning shot across the boat.
-- Yes, exactly.

194
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,750
It, it's not going to happen for 2023 but we are almost certainly going to see this

195
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,679
probably like 2025. Ish give or take is my suspicion.

196
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,190
So keep that in mind as we discuss this while this isn't going to survive this year.

197
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,960
It is definitely going to be something we have to worry about in the future.

198
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:06,260
-- I think that's enough background. Also.
-- Fun.

199
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,960
Fact, cutting and pasting it into word, almost broke my computer.

200
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,359
-- What,
-- how does? Because it's a really big chunk of text.

201
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,489
Wait, what did you copy and paste the whole NDA A text?

202
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,030
I cut and paste the whole thing into word because I'm trying to do

203
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,229
a word count and I don't know how to work the modern word.

204
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,520
Oh Where my oh, this ribbon menu thing is just

205
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:26,890
where is anything?

206
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,770
Where's word count?

207
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:33,020
No, I'm serious. I don't know if somebody could. Well, by then it'll be too late.

208
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:38,679
-- It's not under draw
-- just copy and paste it into the, the UNIX command WC.

209
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,200
Well, I also wanted to get the reading comprehensibility level,

210
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,760
which is always amusing to me,

211
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,919
do this on your own time and put it on Twitter.

212
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:47,440
The,

213
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,349
the thing that gets me is, yeah, it's, it's

214
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,119
even if it, OK, let's say theoretically survived. It's not that insane.

215
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,039
It's basically saying

216
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,789
you have to give us a list of all the defects that are known,

217
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,070
especially like in our National Vulnerability Database, which is

218
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:04,479
literally exactly what it says on the tin. Like a Gin and tonic.

219
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,059
The National Vulnerability Database is literally

220
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,580
the national vulnerability database for software.

221
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,880
This is why CV E is.

222
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,030
So us, government centric is because number one, us government pays for it.

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,400
And number two,

224
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,710
they want stuff that they use covered, right?

225
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:22,000
Which always amuses me because things like Drew Paul are

226
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,960
ridiculously well covered in CV E and the CIA stuff. And it's like,

227
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,080
I guess the government must use a lot of this.

228
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,979
-- It's weird
-- or they have a security team that's competent and

229
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:33,460
acquire CV E I DS for everything that needs it.

230
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,619
Well, no, no, but CIA, like, for example,

231
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,580
when there's known vulnerabilities and stuff and exploits and Dr Paul, they,

232
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,570
they publish it right away then.

233
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,669
Yeah, they must use it then.

234
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,869
But, but so, ok, ok. What I, I think

235
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,020
we should take the stance that this isn't completely insane.

236
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm comfortable with that. I think there are,

237
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,469
I'm seeing

238
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,000
kind of two groups

239
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,169
in the wild right now discussing this.

240
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:59,119
-- There's people who are, well, this
-- assumes that they read the whole thing.

241
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:00,700
Well, no one read the whole thing.

242
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:01,309
No

243
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,289
one's going to read that

244
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,330
anyway.

245
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,289
So there's people claiming like this is completely bananas

246
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,489
and there's no way we can do it.

247
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,919
We obviously do not agree with those people.

248
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,830
Well, I, I point out like to cut, to cut to the very final stage of this

249
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:14,710
in my blog post.

250
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,364
I point out that you have even like a remotely competent, secure,

251
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,234
manage the security process for your software or service.

252
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,984
And that's the other thing this applies not just to software but to services,

253
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,984
which I find fascinating because that

254
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:27,515
I would not have expected them to be that on the ball.

255
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,565
But anyways, let's take Red Hat, for example,

256
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,835
red hats basically compliant with this.

257
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:36,275
They acknowledge and aggressively or used to not so much now, but they,

258
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:39,395
they, they acknowledge every CV in their product.

259
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:41,315
You know, they have a page for it and they have

260
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,544
uh like they have a statement saying like,

261
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,440
yeah, well, like it's bad or, you know, in the case of like cross site scripting like,

262
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,700
yeah, we'll get to it when we get to it.

263
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,179
I, I don't know that that will be good enough for this

264
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:51,960
thing.

265
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,640
They might have to amend the language or commit to a deadline or something.

266
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,760
But fundamentally, there's not a lot red hat would have to do to be compliant.

267
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:58,390
-- I
-- mean,

268
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,299
that's one of the challenges I think is it's not particularly clear

269
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,460
if you acknowledge it how long until you have it fixed?

270
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,979
Like some of that is,

271
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,965
and I don't think it should be spelled out in the this legislation necessarily,

272
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,965
but that's definitely one of the questions

273
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:14,414
one size does not fit all.

274
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:17,914
Like, I mean, I, I totally respect like Google zero day,

275
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:20,565
going from 120 to 90 days disclosure,

276
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:24,815
but like you, you can't do that for like a nuclear submarine software system

277
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:25,914
and then

278
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:31,700
there are people on the internet claiming this is no big deal. It won't matter at all.

279
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,469
And I do think it is a big deal because

280
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,979
I think there's a lot of organizations that are unprepared

281
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,330
for this sort of universe where you have to manage your, I guess,

282
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,820
just security of your applications in a, a more,

283
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:44,950
I

284
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,580
-- guess, purposeful manner, we could say,
-- I would say accountable

285
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,340
because that's, that's what gets me is the language here. It's like

286
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,049
you don't have to give them an S bomb.

287
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,289
But if they ask for one, you have to give it to them in a timely manner, right?

288
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,250
You don't have to XY and Z, I mean, you're supposed to,

289
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,989
but basically if they ask for it,

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,750
you better be able to come up with that documentation quickly.

291
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:05,729
I mean,

292
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,229
everyone I granted I'm in a weird place but when we work with the government,

293
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:13,169
we're getting requests for S bombs on a regular basis right now.

294
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,890
And of course, being a company that

295
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,489
literally makes s bombs, it's like sure, here you go.

296
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,099
Yeah. Well, but there's no teeth,

297
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,150
there's no teeth to that request, right?

298
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,289
Like, and this is where this is my favorite thing about the US government is

299
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,299
and a lot of governments, in fact, it's,

300
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:33,500
we can't make you do X but we can attach money to not to not doing or to doing X.

301
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,109
So like the federal government raising the drinking age in America,

302
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,799
they can't force the states to do that,

303
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,570
but we can withhold highway funding.

304
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,500
Right. And so all the states fell in line eventually,

305
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,479
you know, and same thing here, it's like we can't force companies to give us an S bomb.

306
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:48,059
But,

307
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,830
well, if you're not allowed to, you know, sell to the government without an S bomb,

308
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,039
but they're, they're going to do S bombs pretty quick.

309
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,989
-- Right.
-- Absolutely. That's,

310
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:00,059
I guess the beauty of, of something like the NDA A is

311
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,830
by putting some of these rules in it has

312
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:09,140
just like 2nd and 3rd order effects that are amazing and, and in some cases good or,

313
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,859
I mean, it could be bad, but I, I'm all for

314
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,280
keeping track of what's in our stuff as well

315
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,869
as understanding the vulnerabilities that are in it because

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,349
while you and I are both very aware that

317
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,530
there are magnitudes more vulnerabilities than we're tracking.

318
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,695
Like the first step of this story is we have to get a handle on what we have today,

319
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:28,715
which we don't at all.

320
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,614
And then we can kind of move to the next place.

321
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,594
This reminds me of the open badges thing where

322
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,325
it's like you have to have a testing framework,

323
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,895
you don't have to actually have tests,

324
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,794
but you have to have a testing framework because, well,

325
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:40,294
then you can start adding tests and if you can hand,

326
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:43,054
if you can ingest the National vulnerability database

327
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,145
and properly handle it.

328
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:47,655
Like you can ma like, basically there's a couple of steps here.

329
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:50,695
One, you, you have to have an s palm of your software and all its dependencies.

330
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,489
Number two,

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,270
then you have to have the data vulnerability feed

332
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,929
and you have to marry the two together.

333
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,929
Which ironically, I think your company does something there. I don't know.

334
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,880
That's actually his company's core purpose. Right.

335
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,919
And so,

336
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,190
and then, and this is the tricky part,

337
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,549
then you actually have to do something about it, right?

338
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,640
You can't just generate reports. Like here's a list of our flaws. Cool. We're done.

339
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,619
No, you kind of maybe have to go fix them at some point.

340
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,590
And that speaks to actually being able to do

341
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,559
software updates and push them into production and blah,

342
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,210
blah, blah, which again, like some companies are hilariously terrible at,

343
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,830
by forcing them to kind of build the infrastructure to handle this.

344
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,640
That's, yeah, they won't get every vulnerability,

345
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,809
but now they have the infrastructure to handle this.

346
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,900
That's right. That's right.

347
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:28,570
And

348
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:33,580
I think part of the beauty of all of this as well is if you're requiring S bombs,

349
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,809
you don't have to scan your S bomb for vulnerabilities.

350
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,669
If I have your S bomb, I can scan the S bomb for vulnerabilities,

351
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,070
which I think is part of what makes this so powerful.

352
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,630
It's one thing if I have to rely on a vendor

353
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,750
to tell me what the vulnerabilities are because let's face it.

354
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,070
We've been in this industry

355
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,869
every now and then. It's like, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

356
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,020
It's like we're working on that. You just don't worry about it.

357
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,510
Versus if you have a literal s bomb, you can be like, why, why is this here?

358
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,690
Why haven't you fixed this particular thing? And, and I think

359
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:07,090
it amuses me sometimes because the product security person in me

360
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,840
gets annoyed when someone asks me questions, like, why haven't you done this?

361
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:11,630
It's like, I'm doing my job, leave me alone.

362
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,070
And at the same time, it's like

363
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,369
there's really nothing wrong with asking that.

364
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,289
It would kind of be like, why is there lead in this salad? Can you tell me that?

365
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,380
-- You know,
-- a

366
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,630
great analog of this is like,

367
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,500
both my kids have skin uh sensitivities to Aloe and Aloe is in every dam I

368
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,140
can't and

369
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,090
I don't even know how you deal with that. It's actually really simple.

370
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,299
Either the product has a list of ingredients on it that is complete and correct.

371
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:37,820
I hope

372
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,979
or

373
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,539
like most diapers don't list all their products, uh all their ingredients,

374
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:43,940
but they have a 1 800 number

375
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,469
and you call it and about two minutes later you get a

376
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,039
human on the phone and they will literally read off verbatim.

377
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,559
Like some, it's basically like a, you know, like a product safety sheet.

378
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,869
It sounds like because she's literally like, it's like, you know, uh blanky blank,

379
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,719
you know, wood cellulose fibers, blah, blah, blah, this blah, blah, blah, that

380
00:16:58,909 --> 00:16:59,630
and all that.

381
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,809
And they literally will tell me like what kind of plastics in there like, oh,

382
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,569
it's this kind of plastic, it's not this kind of plastic, whatever.

383
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,010
And literally,

384
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:11,150
I've never spent more than five minutes on the phone to get that list of ingredients.

385
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,219
Be it a shampoo, a diaper anything.

386
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:16,608
And so they have this process, they have obviously,

387
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,560
and it's clear that this is not like I'm not talking to the company company,

388
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,069
I'm talking to like a service that does this because it's pretty clear that,

389
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,380
you know, they're like, OK, this product this

390
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,319
like they need the exact name. They're like, OK, tap, tap,

391
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:26,510
tap,

392
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,260
tap, tap and they're like, OK, blah, blah, you know, they start reading it.

393
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,619
They're like,

394
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,020
and so it's clear what's happening here is that the company has,

395
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,380
here's a list of all our products,

396
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,770
here's a list of all the ingredients,

397
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,119
data sheets. And then they, they fired off to some call center service that

398
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,030
sure when people call in, it's like they literally ask like,

399
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,380
what company are you calling for?

400
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,180
Oh OK.

401
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,079
What product are you calling for? OK.

402
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:50,699
Tap tap, tap and then they just read the thing off to you.

403
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:54,569
-- So I
-- suppose this is comparable to certain items in

404
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,290
our personal supply chains have

405
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,635
gradients. We say the

406
00:17:58,964 --> 00:17:59,755
bomb is included, right?

407
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:02,265
Where you can look at like the back of a bag of chips and

408
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:05,635
see the ingredients list versus I need to go and ask for an S

409
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:06,305
-- bomb.
-- The

410
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:10,175
caveat. I know a bunch of people with gluten intolerances or celiac disease

411
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:12,395
and the problem is they'll list spices.

412
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:13,925
Right. Right.

413
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:13,964
I,

414
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:16,094
I have a friend with that problem actually because he

415
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:19,505
-- was
-- spices almost always means at least trace amounts of gluten

416
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,185
and thickeners. Thickeners are the other big one

417
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:24,925
where if it just says thickener, you're like,

418
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,834
maybe no one knows

419
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,189
it's not perfect.

420
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:32,280
But I mean, well, it's a lot better than the software industry, that's for sure.

421
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,699
I mean, well, look in the food industry,

422
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:43,239
there was literally thousands of years of no real tracking or regulation

423
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,805
food. It wasn't until really after the industrial revolution and

424
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,555
we made a bunch of people really, really sick and killed them

425
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,625
that the government started to step in and say maybe we should do something here.

426
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,545
And I think if you look at the history of software,

427
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:59,724
we are an extremely young industry to be getting this

428
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,994
-- right now.
-- Well, but the problem is we've also everything is software now.

429
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,444
-- I know
-- the world is software. Absolutely right.

430
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:10,635
Like this whole, like, oh, there's this great tweet talking about um oh,

431
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:11,805
what was it talking about?

432
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,005
Essentially the uh

433
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,609
the Dally and all the knockoff,

434
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,849
like not knockoffs but the other people doing Dally like

435
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,270
systems to like you basically plug in a bunch of text

436
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,619
and it spits out an image.

437
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,890
It's magic and talking about how just completely messed up these things are.

438
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,400
And it's like, and it totally, you know, builds my confidence in self driving cars,

439
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:29,359
you know,

440
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,464
or like you see that video of Tesla

441
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,694
just running over some little plastic child thing.

442
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:36,125
Yeah, the kid, well,

443
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,655
I remember they had a video of this from a

444
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,785
couple of years ago and it was kind of hilarious

445
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,165
and they just released another one like a month ago.

446
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:46,064
And I'm like, it's the same thing. You'd think you'd fix this by now,

447
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:46,484
but

448
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:47,775
better

449
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,364
maybe break a little bit. I don't know.

450
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:52,165
I don't know.

451
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:53,944
Anyway. So

452
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,224
I think that's part of the problem is like, is

453
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,640
we, we had a food industry since, I don't know, 5 10,000 be

454
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,890
-- forever
-- because humans need food to survive.

455
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,219
-- We don't need software
-- that

456
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:06,369
the

457
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,880
idea of a restaurant or like

458
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,439
the food supplier is actually sort of relatively recent,

459
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:14,459
right?

460
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,819
In, in the scheme of human history. Right.

461
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,790
And obviously it's more than last Tuesday.

462
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,209
But software, I mean,

463
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:25,030
software running the world that's only in kind of the last 3040 years.

464
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,530
Ok. I want to before II, I think we've, I think people get the point.

465
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,989
We don't think this is terrible.

466
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,349
It obviously needs a lot more thought than it's probably been given.

467
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,229
But at the same time, I think one of the important things about

468
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,630
dealing with the government.

469
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,420
I think this is something that happened when we were young.

470
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,030
There's this idea of the government is completely strict and

471
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,890
stringent and if you break any of the rules,

472
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,949
like you lose, go back to start.

473
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,989
But the reality is like, that's,

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,369
that's mostly insurance companies in the United States, not the government,

475
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,369
the government's usually like, I've done this with the IRS.

476
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,910
We like you screwed this up.

477
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,910
Here's a new form, fill this out correctly and everything will be fine.

478
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,829
It's like, oh, well, thank you people.

479
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,890
And now granted, I know there's instances where that doesn't happen.

480
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,349
But I think generally speaking,

481
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,000
-- they're not there to screw you over my
-- account.

482
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,599
Made it pretty clear to me like you have to

483
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,089
mess up pretty big to end up in prison for tax shenanigans.

484
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,530
Like

485
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:15,729
you have to try.

486
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,160
Now, here's how I think we should frame the rest of our conversation

487
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,099
rather than complaining or not complaining about something is,

488
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:29,949
let's say I want to get ready for this particular piece of legislation

489
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,560
that we know is going to happen in the next couple of years.

490
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,109
What do I do today? Assuming I have nothing in place at all.

491
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,550
-- So first of all, you have to get executive buy in. Well,
-- ok.

492
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,949
-- Yes,
-- because there's literally no, I'm sorry, but there's like this is a problem.

493
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,069
It's a lot of technical people like, oh,

494
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,609
we should go do this good technical thing and they don't get executive buy in.

495
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:50,150
So

496
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,430
they run a script on their computer and it just never gets done reliably.

497
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,459
Yeah. So step one is actually getting executive buy in that.

498
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:59,390
This is something we'll have to do once you've got that,

499
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,050
it's essentially you start building a piece.

500
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,900
-- Her. No, no.
-- Hold on. Hold on. I, I think your, your carts too far in front of the horse.

501
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,359
I think

502
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,719
the executive buying is a good point.

503
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:11,459
And I think there, there is a nist standard that just came out not long ago.

504
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,520
Um This nist 800-1 61

505
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:16,599
and it's titled Cyber Security Supply Chain

506
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,510
Risk Management Practices for systems and organizations,

507
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,199
which is a very nice title.

508
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:24,489
They love doing that and this is not a technical documentation.

509
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,199
It fundamentally just talks about how to structure most of

510
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:31,260
this in a way that an organization can become,

511
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,890
I guess palatable

512
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,199
to what you need to do.

513
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,319
And I think

514
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,810
the executive buy in

515
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,280
is the first step.

516
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,219
But fundamentally the vast majority of these

517
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,800
changes you need to do in your organization

518
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:48,770
aren't super technical. It's more about getting humans

519
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:53,560
to accept and be willing to make small changes to what they do.

520
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,420
There are a lot of other standards here too. So for example, there's an iso standard.

521
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,260
I forget the number

522
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,369
literally for taking in security reports and dealing with them.

523
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,579
Well, is that the vulnerability standard.

524
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,670
And so

525
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,839
part of it is like when I say you need to build a P cert, I mean, not just the P cert,

526
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:11,609
but the stuff behind it in the sense of, you know,

527
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,150
your developers have to start reporting stuff to the P cert,

528
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,949
they have to start listening to the P cert.

529
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,219
And you know, actually

530
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,969
you have to start

531
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,339
maybe prioritizing a vulnerability fix

532
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,979
for a new feature, which

533
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,849
-- again you need executive buy in from that as
-- we, we talked about that last week,

534
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,520
Dustin.

535
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,270
That's a different story.

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Here's rather than go into that and,

537
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,260
and there are better places than here to talk about.

538
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,829
Things like P Cert. I think

539
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,510
there's more foundational.

540
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,390
Well, things like S

541
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,609
-- bomb, I see, I would
-- consider S

542
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,160
bomb is going to be a big foundation of all of this. I think

543
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,170
I would consider S

544
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,550
bomb to be part of. I would say PRT

545
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,790
nowadays because

546
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,369
while in my mind, it should be part of what the developers just do like as like

547
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,300
it's just a basic thing that all developers should do.

548
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,640
The reality is we're not there yet as an industry

549
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,030
like

550
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,890
that doesn't surprise me though. If you look at every use case for

551
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:08,239
today, they're almost exclusively security focused use cases.

552
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,729
There aren't a lot of use cases that

553
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,890
are non, there are things we will be able to do with these.

554
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,670
That's like a whole, that's a very long other conversation,

555
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,349
but fundamentally the vast majority of people when they talk about

556
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,739
bombs, it's to do vulnerability scans

557
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,709
and it's to figure out if I'm shipping something because like log for Shell

558
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,770
just happened.

559
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,810
And I need to know, have I ever shipped this package in the history of time?

560
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,175
Which is, again, it's a very security

561
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:37,915
-- focused use case.
-- The original use case for S

562
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:39,525
bomb, which was license compliance

563
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:40,364
is

564
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:41,285
quasi

565
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:45,125
security in the sense of like we're back to the kind of don't do that, you know,

566
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,484
stage of software development, which sounds a lot like security people,

567
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:50,084
it's risk related for sure.

568
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,204
And so I, well, basically

569
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,194
you need S

570
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:54,685
bomb, you need. And

571
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:55,744
the thing is the PRT,

572
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,130
when I say A P cert, it also can't just be like

573
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,160
a person, ideally, it needs to be maybe two or three.

574
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,550
And I get that there's really small software development shops

575
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,979
and open source products or projects that,

576
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,089
that will never have a P cert team

577
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,579
because there's like literally one person working on it.

578
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,689
But part of it is is

579
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,920
it's not so much building the P cert as building

580
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,489
the cultural bits and the sort of the beliefs that,

581
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,719
you know, this could be important. This is something we value.

582
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,099
Well, and, and look,

583
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,560
here's the way I look at this is when you and I got started in all this.

584
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:33,760
If you wanted to know what vulnerabilities were in your system,

585
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,430
you had to hire an army of people to basically build a custom S bomb by

586
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,250
bomb. I mean, text file, checked into CBS

587
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:44,420
and then cross reference that with all of

588
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,050
the vulnerabilities that have basically ever been released

589
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,040
-- and there was no automation and
-- then realize

590
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,719
you forgot case sensitivity and do it again

591
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,969
and then some of them

592
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,069
have hyphens.

593
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,910
Yes, I know. I know.

594
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,709
Well, this is, this is a problem today though even with,

595
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:03,560
with vulnerability data and F bombs is how do you, how do you define?

596
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,310
What is the name of the product? Does it have? Hyphens? Does the

597
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,790
-- company's name is that part of the product is
-- well and product names change.

598
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,310
I know, I

599
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,420
don't,

600
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,550
I know,

601
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,010
I know this is actually where the Spring framework there was uh

602
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,349
there was a back door in spring a couple of months ago

603
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,300
and

604
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:23,442
Spring has changed ownership multiple times.

605
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:26,491
And so figuring out what the name of it actually is because

606
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,472
in like the world of C pe they include vendor name.

607
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:32,671
Well, the vendor name, there's like five vendor names. So it's completely insane.

608
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,751
But anyway,

609
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:36,322
so I think this is where we have an opportunity. Now.

610
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:40,531
You don't necessarily need an army of people digging through vulnerabilities.

611
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,802
If you have something like an S

612
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:44,452
bomb, now you can just like basically scan it.

613
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:44,982
There's m

614
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,203
there's million scanners,

615
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:49,333
scan your ass bomb and then you can start saying things like, ok,

616
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,703
what am I affected by?

617
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:54,634
And then you need someone to say, ok, here's the list of stuff,

618
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:56,504
here's what we're going to fix right now.

619
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,504
Here's what we're going to fix

620
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,053
before you do that. You also need to start triaging it and see.

621
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,963
Like, are we actually affected because,

622
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,284
-- yeah,
-- that's true too.

623
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:06,413
My, my favorite story, you know, Jackson Data bind, deserializing vaults,

624
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,264
remote code. Absolutely. And thank goodness that

625
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,446
is it Red Hat satellite?

626
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:13,456
I want to say five or six, I forget which one

627
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:14,725
doesn't use the deer

628
00:27:15,355 --> 00:27:16,125
and never will.

629
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:16,755
So I, you know,

630
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:20,015
kept arguing with or trying to educate people which devolved down

631
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,916
to arguing because I'm not very good at it apparently.

632
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:24,115
And then we would just fix it to make them go away, which

633
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:26,385
I know we did the same thing at elastic.

634
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,595
We had Jackson Data B and Elastic search and we didn't use any of the

635
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:34,605
-- deser stuff, but people freaked out because it was there.
-- Let me put it this way.

636
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:34,985
What's

637
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,260
the cost of saying I'm not vulnerable

638
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,359
when the software component has been updated.

639
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,410
Versus the cost of saying I'm not vulnerable

640
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,000
when the software component has not been updated.

641
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,579
And there's this like weird explanation from the vendor, right?

642
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:49,790
Well, in my favorite always was people would say, prove it, prove you're not

643
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,020
-- exactly like
-- in the case of elastic where our source code was in github.

644
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,290
So we could say, look at this line. This is where we disable this.

645
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,680
That is why we're not vulnerable. But, you know, a lot of people can't do that.

646
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:03,449
What amuses me is we've trained people that software update equals not vulnerable.

647
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:06,265
Just accept it because we have made whoopsies in the past.

648
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:07,765
-- I mean, it's
-- kind of true,

649
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:10,166
like it's mostly true but not always, not 100%.

650
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:14,635
-- But uh moving along,
-- yes, triage. Figure out what affects you.

651
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,985
You have to prioritize it because my one complaint about this law,

652
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,005
I will say is they say like, no,

653
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:22,316
they need to be more clear because there are,

654
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,206
you can never fix all your vulnerability.

655
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:26,566
I mean, I've been saying this for years and I will keep saying it.

656
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:28,965
If your vulnerability scan comes back clean,

657
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:33,005
you either have a broken scanner or someone has done something to trick the scanner.

658
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:33,465
Like

659
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:38,391
you just any reasonably sized application these days doesn't come back clean.

660
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,362
It just doesn't.

661
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:42,692
Well, and that's where the language of it talks about having a plan to deal with it.

662
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,421
And I, I would assume again, I

663
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:49,212
would think most government agencies are mature enough to go. Ok.

664
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:51,822
These criticals need to be fixed soon and these not so critical.

665
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,671
Sure, next release or

666
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:54,582
sometimes

667
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:59,362
next release doesn't always work. Either if you have 300 low issues,

668
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:02,031
you're not fixing 300 issues in a release. Well,

669
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:02,842
generally

670
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,760
you say that

671
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,369
-- sometimes it can happen where you upgrade like one node package and
-- red hat,

672
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,640
one of their log for J updates.

673
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,530
One of their Java pack things was like over 100 they, they, they finally upgrade, uh,

674
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,760
updated a couple of packages and it was like,

675
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,810
it was about five years of CV S

676
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,349
and, and that's fair. It happens. Right.

677
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:22,540
But, but

678
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,650
that's where I think being overly strict,

679
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,400
but I think this is where this is where the scale we have the issue

680
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,430
of you have people on one end of the teeter totter that are like,

681
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,589
whatever, we just don't worry about any of this crap.

682
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,859
This is where the,

683
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,170
the S bomb for services I think is going to really

684
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,390
be a game changer because before you could ignore it,

685
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,290
that's going to be a tough one because a lot of these companies, like,

686
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,619
that's kind of their secret sauce type stuff.

687
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,189
Like I've, I've talked with a lot of these vendors and they,

688
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,750
they really don't want to give up this

689
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,959
information also because the minute they start giving

690
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,449
up these S bombs then they're gonna have to deal with what you deal with,

691
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,390
which is all these emails going.

692
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,219
Ah, you say you use version X and it says it has a CV S and why?

693
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,869
But if you want to sell to the government, you're going to have to do that.

694
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,050
I'm not saying they're going to publish them on their website,

695
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,640
-- but they want that sweet, sweet government money. So they're going to
-- comply.

696
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,569
Almost every company I deal with will not publish their sock to report publicly.

697
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,369
Which I know it's bizarre to me because I've read

698
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,689
a lot of them and they're not that interesting.

699
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,680
I know. I know, whatever.

700
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:23,439
Anyway.

701
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:23,810
Uh,

702
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,790
right.

703
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,290
So,

704
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,869
but then the other side of the teeter totter now is the government people that

705
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,810
I think sometimes they take a purposely hard stance against a lot of this.

706
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:35,640
Not because they even believe it. But because if they don't,

707
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,859
-- you can't meet in the middle,
-- it's actually simpler than that.

708
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,130
They,

709
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,010
the government 99 times out of 100

710
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,219
has a stick that they can use, but using that stick is a pain in the butt.

711
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,410
And no, so unless you, like, do something to, like, really tick them off, they're,

712
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,839
they're not going

713
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,729
well. No, no. I mean,

714
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,949
I'm saying when,

715
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,010
when I deal with the government as a customer,

716
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,630
they'll often look at a vulnerability scan and say you

717
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,209
have to fix all this stuff and we're like,

718
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:05,290
we're not fixing all this stuff, we'll fix these things and they're like, ok.

719
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:05,680
Yeah,

720
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,290
like,

721
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,969
yes, we accept your terms.

722
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,430
Yeah.

723
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:11,369
If you, if you start in the middle, they're gonna meet you over in, you know,

724
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,750
-- New Jersey instead of
-- in the,

725
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,880
and, and that's my suspicion.

726
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:15,849
But then

727
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:16,949
ii I

728
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,790
feel like if you have a, a

729
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,750
moderately sensible

730
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,219
development

731
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,150
kind of culture and environment,

732
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,219
none of this is going to be

733
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,030
that drastic or life changing

734
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,530
is

735
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:31,689
my

736
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:32,239
suspicion

737
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,089
change

738
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,920
for mature companies would be the,

739
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,339
the services that will have to start providing bombs

740
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:41,339
to the government because like Microsoft Red Hat IBM,

741
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:42,060
like they're,

742
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,530
that stuff's pretty much all public anyways.

743
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,260
You know, there's that one Mercedes document.

744
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,319
I love, that's like 1000 pages long and it's

745
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,560
all the open source junk that's in their car

746
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:54,750
and it's just this honk and huge PDF.

747
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,119
Right. Here you go. Here's RSP.

748
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,010
Well, no, I mean, like they obviously have that data in a structured manner already.

749
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:02,900
And,

750
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,550
you know, I, I would hope they give something better than a PDF but fundamentally,

751
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,069
like they've already published this on the web.

752
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,599
So it's, can't be that hard.

753
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,150
Right.

754
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,390
And I, I can't wait.

755
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,489
I,

756
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,109
I wish I would have more insight into what

757
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,750
the services s bombs are going to look like because

758
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:20,859
I'm,

759
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,469
I don't, I, I legitimately don't know.

760
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:27,270
Part of me thinks a lot of these services are going to be like flaming bags of poop.

761
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,650
And part of me thinks,

762
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,140
I bet a lot of these services are actually going to be pretty good because

763
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,260
it's just,

764
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,449
it's not when you're running a service,

765
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:39,099
it's not that hard to just upgrade dependencies with something like depend

766
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,300
aot

767
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,489
because you can quickly roll things back

768
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,630
and move things forward and make minor changes

769
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,329
and it's not like a big event. You know,

770
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:47,229
well,

771
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:51,010
again, if you're mature, like uh the, the, the best story I have

772
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,199
-- testing
-- and all that.

773
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:57,310
The best story I have is, and this is like 1510 or 15 years ago ebay, ebay had

774
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,880
a Java monolith.

775
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,319
That was what ran ebay was this

776
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,510
just honking huge Java Binary.

777
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,479
And I forget what their release schedule was, but it was like once or twice a week,

778
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:07,640
the train leaves the station,

779
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,420
get your, get your stuff on board if you want it there.

780
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,689
And I don't know how ebay made this work because I mean, Java, 1015 years ago,

781
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,930
making a model with that big work on

782
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:17,099
a,

783
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,160
like a really high profile public facing website with a lot of moving parts

784
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,719
like, wow, however, like,

785
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,869
so I can't even imagine where they are now probably in the exact same place.

786
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,890
Um Well, no, because like they got to work and like, why would you change it? Right.

787
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,800
It's like, it's like

788
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,099
robot

789
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,530
services. Apparently the whole back end of that sucker is just a big old pile of Java

790
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:36,349
because

791
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,270
what else did you architect that thing in 1015 years ago?

792
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,229
Right.

793
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,810
Like Python or Haskell?

794
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:42,670
Yeah,

795
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,410
exactly.

796
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,229
So

797
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,800
like companies have

798
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,959
made this kind of like huge

799
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,060
engineering.

800
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:53,550
Like it always reminds me kind of like building the Hoover Dam,

801
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,459
like the Hoover Dam came in under budget

802
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,079
ahead of schedule, right? They did some clever engineering hacks

803
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,050
and

804
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,060
I mean, yeah, a bunch of people died and they actually improved safety.

805
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:06,050
They started making them wear helmets and like tying them to ropes and stuff,

806
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,370
which in hindsight again, seems really obvious, but I guess

807
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,090
whatever, somebody had to go first, right,

808
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,330
to put it bluntly, like, if you're a big mature company, then this,

809
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,050
even if you're not doing this and you probably are doing this,

810
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,850
it's not going to be that heavy of a lift.

811
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,034
The biggest problem will be is if you have a culture of

812
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:26,165
secrecy or a culture of not telling people what's in your software,

813
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:29,395
-- that's going to be a problem.
-- That's true. That's true.

814
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:33,235
So anyway, I think, let's wrap this up because it's been too long.

815
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,813
I feel like when I first read this,

816
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,675
it felt like it was going to be a big deal and it mattered a lot.

817
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:39,995
But I honestly,

818
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,870
after this discussion, I feel like it's going to be a heavy lift for a lot of people,

819
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,500
but I don't think it's going to be

820
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,719
as bad as I

821
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,429
-- thought it was initially, which is a good thing.
-- I think more so than that.

822
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:53,590
Stepping back, it's going to be a big cultural change

823
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:54,600
for the

824
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,219
like, look at seatbelts,

825
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:59,010
like straight up there is

826
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,419
Senate and congressional hearings where people

827
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,360
are talking about how like just seatbelts

828
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,810
are going to literally be the end of the American way of life.

829
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,850
And there's the same videos for not smoking on airplanes, like, not,

830
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,270
not smoking in general, but just banning smoking on airplanes and, like,

831
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,310
straight up this is the end of American life as we know it.

832
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,750
Yeah. And

833
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,750
so

834
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,469
whatever, whatever

835
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,449
it's gonna be a major culture shift.

836
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,709
But we've done these, like a great example is,

837
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,820
remember when open source was kind of the weird

838
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,669
smelly hippie hiding in the corner of the room

839
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,550
and now it's,

840
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560
uh,

841
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,139
-- well, it's everything, it's everywhere,
-- it's

842
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:34,969
literally everywhere. That's

843
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:36,489
right. It went from

844
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
the cancer that will destroy us all

845
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,750
to the thing that is saving everyone.

846
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,020
-- I love it, but
