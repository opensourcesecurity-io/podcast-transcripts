Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:10,500
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,279
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,270
Hey, Kurt,

4
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,550
I'm super excited. We have a guest today.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,640
We have Dan Lawrence,

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,260
software engineer at Google who's doing if you

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,719
aren't paying attention to open source supply chain,

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,440
anything,

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,610
there is no way you've not crossed paths with Dan before.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,360
-- So Dan, hello, welcome to the show.
-- Thank you so much for having me.

11
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,700
So give us, give us an intro. Who are you and why are you here?

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,330
Sure. I'm a software here at Google where I've been for

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,080
eight or nine years now.

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,250
And for the past couple of years,

15
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,430
I've been doing open source security and specifically supply chain security.

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,409
I kind of backed into this space just because I noticed so many

17
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:48,799
problems as I switched from doing internal stuff at Google and our,

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,439
you know, weird mono

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,200
repo set up to a bunch of our

20
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:54,799
open source cloud technologies and everybody was building

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,299
things on Jenkins machines on Mac minis under

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,930
desks all over the world and everything.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,580
Just kind of

24
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,939
kept getting increasingly horrified at what I found in trying to fix it all. So

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,800
I haven't fixed much yet, but I've spent a while poking at things.

26
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:09,620
That's how I got here today.

27
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,370
That's an interesting tangent because I've

28
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,660
noticed a lot of people accidentally end

29
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,720
up in security when they notice a problem and start fixing it.

30
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,540
And then, well, I get through the security guy now.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,150
-- Yeah, I guess
-- that's basically what happened.

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,209
I kept poking around saying there's got to be a better way to do

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,860
this and everybody looked at me crazy and thought this was all fine until maybe

34
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,150
a year ago. People started to take it a little bit more seriously. And then

35
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,720
December January when solar winds happened,

36
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,599
uh all of a sudden everybody started panicking about this,

37
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,519
you know, obvious problem that had been lying around for a long, long time.

38
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,800
Totally. Totally.

39
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:40,690
Ok.

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,440
So

41
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,569
I would say from my understanding and you can correct me if, if, if you like is

42
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:53,459
Google has been taking a lot of this stuff seriously for years now.

43
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,080
Whereas many of us will say have not been,

44
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,440
will be my,

45
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,010
my polite description.

46
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,239
But I'm, I'm curious,

47
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,800
what, what can you tell us about?

48
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:04,199
Kind of what,

49
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,209
what Google's been doing because I know there's some really

50
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,038
cool work that Google does with kind of their internal

51
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,990
ii, I forget what it's called, but you're like repository of trusted open source

52
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:18,119
that then is usable by, by engineers and things like that, which is I mean,

53
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,199
you've been doing it for a long time.

54
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,380
I know and it's way ahead of the curve for sure.

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,029
Yeah,

56
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,750
we can talk about that a little bit.

57
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,339
Yeah. Trusted open source is a little, a little strong for what it is. Um

58
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,110
But yeah, so Google, um

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,639
you know,

60
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,985
Google is pretty famous for having a giant mono

61
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,546
repo or all of our code

62
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:37,436
is in one huge repository. It's all kind of virtualized and fast.

63
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,626
So you can build across it all

64
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,046
you really quickly on all of your machines without downloading, you know,

65
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,186
terabytes of source code, all of this stuff.

66
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:46,216
What happens though with something like this is you get dependency sprawl really,

67
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,216
really quickly because it's super easy for, you know,

68
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:50,546
one package over here and one P A

69
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,662
an organization to import a bunch of other stuff.

70
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,192
It's awesome because you can reuse code

71
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,701
but it means the dependency graphs get really, really hairy.

72
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:57,261
Yep.

73
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:59,031
So early on as we were, you know,

74
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,421
importing third party code had to get pulled into here.

75
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,001
People had to switch the build system over to our internal one.

76
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,371
You know, we don't use bash scripts and make files and auto

77
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,451
FT and all that stuff.

78
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:11,222
We have this uh internal version of basil if you've heard of that.

79
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,229
Um

80
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,669
They kind of does all these declarative hermetic builds for performance.

81
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,990
Um And

82
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,949
yeah, at some point uh because of that, um you know,

83
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,699
the dependencies probably started to run into, you know,

84
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,589
the diamond dependency issues where you have multiple versions of things.

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,470
Uh you know, the same dependency imported a bunch of times

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,699
and you start to get crazy build breakages.

87
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,199
Uh Because of that or you know,

88
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,479
some team changed something that had nothing to do with your code.

89
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,589
But now you can't build anymore because you have two conflicting versions of some,

90
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,550
you know, c dependency.

91
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,029
So because of that, we have a pretty strict one version rule now where you know,

92
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,710
there's one version of every open source dependency that's put in there, you know,

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,259
mostly for build performance,

94
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,910
build stability and just keeping builds working at all.

95
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,949
Uh which has some nice side effects when it

96
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,479
comes to supply chain security where things get imported.

97
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,429
Once the DS get reviewed, we try to do it pretty quickly.

98
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,139
Um So again, I think

99
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,580
sort of where we started uh the security aspects of it came later.

100
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,740
Um You know, it wasn't really part of the initial design.

101
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,979
Sorry, quick question, you say one version of everything. So you're saying like

102
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:12,410
Google has one version of, of G zip in their mono

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,889
repo that all the projects that use GZ I have to use that one version.

104
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,290
That's

105
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,640
awesome,

106
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,019
isn't it?

107
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,720
Because like we worked at Red Hat and that was not the case necessarily always.

108
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,029
And I,

109
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,679
that blows my mind like,

110
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,690
-- yeah, it's nice in some ways.
-- How do you make stuff, not break.

111
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,829
Um, yeah. So, I mean, it doesn't break if you don't touch it. Right.

112
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,559
You know, that's the, if it doesn't break, don't touch it, uh, issue.

113
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,429
Which, which is nice when you have huge things that are dependent on and, you know,

114
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,869
teams actively maintaining them.

115
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,929
Uh, the trade off there though is not,

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,049
everything gets as actively maintained or not,

117
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,920
everything gets as actively updated because, you know,

118
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,250
the person that originally imported,

119
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,369
it might have moved on and not be on the project anymore.

120
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,000
And now 35 other teams depend on it and can't find the right person to update it

121
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,750
and now nobody can update it without breaking 300 other people.

122
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,989
So it has good and bad effects. I guess I would say it's, it's a whole set of trade offs.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,250
Um, I don't know that I would really recommend it as a great policy for everyone,

124
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,429
but if you do get there, you know, it's a, it does have a bunch of benefits.

125
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,200
Right. Right. Ok. So I don't, I don't want to dwell on

126
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,880
Google's internals too much here.

127
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,660
But now from what I gathered, you've taken a great deal of that knowledge

128
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,179
and kind of, you're bringing it to the outside world now to a degree.

129
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah, we kind of have to because, you know, the mono

130
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,239
repo is great for where you can use it.

131
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,700
But as we start to get more into, you know, the cloud space and open source space.

132
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,130
And, you know, it matters how we build our software and we're taking, you know,

133
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,269
these applications that are published on github

134
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:39,670
and building them directly from github

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,510
to put them into products and things like this, the, you know, the mono

136
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,320
repo and the one version rule don't really work and they don't really

137
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,149
anymore.

138
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,040
You know, if you have to support five versions of my sequel in a product,

139
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,109
then you've got to have five versions of my sequel, you know, stuff like this.

140
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,079
So there's a lot of technology that's shifting to

141
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,269
kind of this more open source uh smaller repo

142
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,109
package manager world uh which is a whole bunch of stuff backwards from this,

143
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,829
you know, kind of hermetic perfectly declared reproducible build, set up

144
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,589
um that a lot of teams were used to before. So we're trying to figure out ways to

145
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,000
get those same security guarantees and build

146
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,609
performance aspects we're able to have.

147
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,320
Uh but outside of, you know, the

148
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,179
Mote repub and custom tooling world.

149
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Awesome.

150
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,160
Awesome

151
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,170
one question.

152
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,709
Uh And this isn't necessarily specific to Google,

153
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,399
but like in my experience of open source,

154
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,709
outside of a few projects,

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,279
the majority of open source seems to be consumed as well as source code, right?

156
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,649
Like red hat. Download source code builds it, ships it,

157
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,739
I back in the day, you know, download the newest version of bind, build it locally,

158
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,380
install it, run it

159
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,619
and I know, for some larger projects like say Firefox. Well, obviously you,

160
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:47,970
you know,

161
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,839
Mozilla does a build and you download the build

162
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,119
because building Firefox is a nightmare and a half

163
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,940
is this sort of aimed at

164
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,160
the world where the expectation is that people are more,

165
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,369
are still downloading the source code and building it or

166
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,320
is it more aimed at the world of binaries?

167
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,250
-- It's both
-- and you get a bunch of weird hybrid cases too.

168
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,429
Um You know, it's interesting.

169
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,899
You said the majority of source code is uh

170
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,480
majority of open source is consumed as source code.

171
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,040
Um I don't know that that's been

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,179
experience, I think, you know, maybe depending on how I

173
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:15,339
could be wrong,

174
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,709
I

175
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,079
wish that was the case, right?

176
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,829
You know, the old days of just going, grabbing stuff and building it yourself.

177
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,750
Um But, you know, especially as you move outside of like the ce C++ world, um,

178
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,950
a lot of stuff starts to get packaged up into package managers and sort of semi

179
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,779
compiled.

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,760
Um And maybe depending on how you squint and draw that line,

181
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:34,709
like is a Python Wheel file source code just because it's a whole

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,250
bunch of pies that are in a zip and arranged a strange way.

183
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,720
Maybe, maybe not.

184
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,200
There's a bunch of,

185
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,070
maybe there's binary blobs in there too and

186
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,470
you don't really know where they came from.

187
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,549
But one of the big challenges we've seen actually is that

188
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,260
most people aren't consuming stuff directly from the source code repository.

189
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,899
Even if they are taking source code,

190
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,820
you're taking a zip archive that somebody uploaded somewhere and

191
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,609
you don't actually know what commit that came from and you

192
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,290
don't know what stuff got stripped out and you don't

193
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,510
actually know this hasn't been tampered with along the way.

194
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,720
Pause when you say the word package because traditionally,

195
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,380
when I think of a package, I think of you have a source code in you know CV S or now

196
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,790
get,

197
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:10,209
then you have Tar Balls of releases

198
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,109
and then

199
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,510
possibly you have,

200
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,609
well Tar Balls, let's say of of binary files with the help files, the man pages,

201
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,190
the config files or whatever

202
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,579
you're saying from your perspective,

203
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,619
you count the source code like cutting a Tar Ball as a release as a package,

204
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,179
basically.

205
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,450
No, no, no, I'm saying most people aren't consuming stuff that way, right?

206
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,799
Most people are consuming the wheel file that you

207
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:36,090
uploaded to PP I or the gem that somebody

208
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:36,359
published

209
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:37,070
to Ruby.

210
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,580
And so there's source in there kind of because these are interpreted languages.

211
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,169
Um but it's not really,

212
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,950
you know a source release uh philosophically, right? It's

213
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,059
somebody did a bunch of packaging steps first to

214
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,270
turn it into something that you're installing directly.

215
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,400
See the same in Java, right?

216
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,090
People grab jars from Maven Central,

217
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,820
they don't grab the actual Java source and recompile everything.

218
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,979
Uh Every time they do their builds.

219
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:00,909
So there's usually some kind of transformation stuff that happens between the G

220
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,299
repo or the source code

221
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,340
it's maintained and then the

222
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,880
-- package manager download that someone does. Alright.
-- Alright.

223
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,460
So here's where I think it starts to get more interesting is

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,289
what is the problem between say me having a

225
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,070
github

226
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,950
repo

227
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,859
and you doing an N PM install?

228
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,119
Yeah,

229
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,219
the problem there is you have no way to verify if

230
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,409
that N PM package you just installed actually came from that Get

231
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,010
repo.

232
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,390
Um That's the simplest one, right?

233
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,460
When you look at, you know, N PM, there's a little link that says here's the Get repo,

234
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,229
this came from

235
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,940
uh anybody can go create an N PM package and put anything they want in that field,

236
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,359
you're trusting people kind of blindly.

237
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,440
And I mean, this is true of every

238
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,919
kind of package repo that exists,

239
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:47,640
right?

240
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:49,679
So

241
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,070
now

242
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:56,669
tell me about Sig Store, which is one of the plans you have to help make this better.

243
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,750
And, and II, I must say I want to add to, for, for anyone who kind of listens

244
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,070
Dan is all over the place.

245
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,049
It is fascinating to see because you're working on sig store, you're working on

246
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,869
uh the, the salsa stuff which, which we'll get to

247
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,789
and, and there's what I forget what else there is. There's a bunch of stuff though.

248
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,380
It's like it's ridiculous to me every time I see you doing something different.

249
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,049
It's amazing.

250
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,960
But anyway, Sigs

251
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:19,239
Zor

252
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:19,780
first.

253
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,030
Yeah, it's not just me, we've got an awesome team helping out with all of this stuff.

254
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,760
Um, but,

255
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,179
yeah,

256
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,469
so we'll start with Sigs Store and I'll kind of use an analogy from that N PM example.

257
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,250
We just talk through, um, the one that I like to talk about is, you know,

258
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,190
if you find a USB drive on the ground,

259
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,669
you pick this up. Right.

260
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,590
Everybody know you don't bring that inside and plug that

261
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,530
into your computer and I hope everybody knows that.

262
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,799
-- No,
-- you plug it into someone else's computer. Right.

263
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,159
Yeah. Yeah, you definitely do not plug that into your own computer. Right.

264
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,650
Everybody's it, department. Everybody's security department

265
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,460
has hopefully scared them out of doing that,

266
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,309
but real attacks actually happen that way. Um,

267
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:50,700
you know,

268
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,679
to companies targeted attacks or we will just drop a

269
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,780
bunch of these outside and somebody eventually brings it in.

270
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,989
So this is terrifying. You're not supposed to do that.

271
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,219
But when you go type N PM, install foo,

272
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,590
um, for some reason, nobody thinks twice about that.

273
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,969
Even though it's doing the exact same thing, except in many ways,

274
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,619
it's worse because you're taking that code.

275
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,469
You've never looked at,

276
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,960
you have no idea who wrote it and you're shipping that off to production,

277
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,030
it's not just the laptop you're plugging it into.

278
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,570
So, trying to think about how to solve that. Right. I mean, to make that safe

279
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,969
and the real problem

280
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,640
there is you have no idea where that source code came from.

281
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,619
Even if everybody did the right thing,

282
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,929
the developers reviewed all the code and they made sure there

283
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,200
are no vulnerabilities that they could find in there anyway.

284
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,489
Um, they published stuff the right way using, you know, the right build scripts,

285
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,510
nothing got tampered with.

286
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,719
You don't have any way to find those breadcrumbs and to follow them back

287
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,270
and, you know, this isn't a technology problem. Really? Right.

288
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,309
We have technology for doing stuff like this.

289
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,989
We've had, you know, cryptographic signatures and asymmetric key,

290
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:42,830
cryptography

291
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,950
and ways to sign packages of source code and binaries forever,

292
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,869
but nobody's really doing it today.

293
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,280
Um So we kept looking into that did a bunch of research,

294
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:54,190
talked to a bunch of open source maintainers.

295
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,039
Um And it seemed like it was just

296
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,789
too inconvenient, too hard, too expensive.

297
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,919
The, the analogy we started to copy was let's encrypt

298
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,760
people remember what browsing the internet was like, you know,

299
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,229
even four or five years ago,

300
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,580
half or more of the websites had the chrome red danger icon up

301
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,659
because they weren't using certificates even though

302
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,510
they've been available since the nineties.

303
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,500
Um It was really just an annoyance, right?

304
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,789
You had to pay some C A, you had to find one, you had to give them your credit card,

305
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,530
you had to email them this weird certificate request,

306
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,309
they would send you one back over email

307
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,479
you'd figure out how to drop that next to Apache in the right

308
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,469
directory. And then Chrome would light up correctly.

309
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,799
I just, I laughed because I actually had to buy my first secure web server.

310
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,799
No, because there weren't open source ones available at that time.

311
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,479
I mean, even the server itself, not just the certificate. Yeah.

312
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,919
Yeah, I had to buy Red Hat Stronghold server.

313
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,039
Yeah. Crazy.

314
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:46,159
Um, so lets encrypt came along and said,

315
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:50,479
let's make that free and automatic and uh build tooling around it.

316
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:53,419
So they set up a free C A that anybody could get

317
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,619
just by installing a little automated tool to keep refreshing your certificates.

318
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Now, if you're using Kubernetes or some fancy platform as a service,

319
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,150
you just set a Boolean that's like secure.

320
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,700
True when you automatically get a certificate provision because

321
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,500
let's encrypt automated it and made that all free.

322
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:07,929
So we said,

323
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,650
hey, can we figure out how to do that?

324
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,719
But for code signing certificates because those exist and they're still kind of

325
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,530
stuck in the nineties where you pay somebody 500 bucks and they,

326
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,320
you know, do a background check on you and check your business address,

327
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,729
verify it and then they send you the certificate that's valid for three years

328
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:23,840
and then you can't rotate it and you can't figure out

329
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,840
what to do if you lose it and all these problems.

330
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,039
Uh So that was just going through this with BMI and it's uh

331
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,400
it's like three steps backwards.

332
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,799
Yeah, it's, it's fun.

333
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:37,840
Um And you know, so many of the edge cases still are handled to around,

334
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:38,340
what do you like?

335
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:41,679
There's no revocation and there's no rotation and all this stuff built in.

336
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,849
So if you lose that or get it tampered with like,

337
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,150
you know, Microsoft accidentally signed a malware driver a couple of months ago.

338
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,400
Remember that? And,

339
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:48,940
you know,

340
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,520
there was a great solar Rs blog post about how they had to spend

341
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,130
three months um finding all of the old versions of their source code or

342
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,049
of their products that were distributed and

343
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,849
resigning them with their new certificate before

344
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,219
they could revoke the old one because

345
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,919
otherwise things would just stop working overnight.

346
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:07,840
Um Yeah, so we started a couple of different projects to address that.

347
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:11,440
Um we have a free certificate authority for open source code signing.

348
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,609
We've got a whole bunch of cool transparency logs to make it

349
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,239
all work and make it all auditable just like certificate transparency.

350
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,340
Um and just kind of trying to copy the lots of

351
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:24,280
playbook and then translate it to code signing uh instead of, you know TLS and

352
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,919
uh web encryption.

353
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,000
And, and I will say, I think the important thing

354
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
that I see cigar

355
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,400
doing

356
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,650
is

357
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,289
it's not very human focused

358
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:42,299
in the context of read this horrible how to and then run these 700 esoteric commands,

359
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,210
which I think is a huge deal.

360
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:46,950
Yeah.

361
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,969
It's, it's again, yeah, we can make it free, you know,

362
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:52,349
we can do all the security stuff, but it's got to be easy.

363
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,820
It's got to be automatic and people have to not even think about it.

364
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,099
Otherwise they're not going to do it,

365
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,590
you know, just this morning.

366
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,530
I was thrilled to see you when I woke up to Go Releaser,

367
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,809
which is this awesome tool for automatically publishing, go

368
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,729
BNA, you know, on a million different platforms and package managers,

369
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,400
just integrated SIG store.

370
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,710
Um And so you can start signing any go

371
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,729
binary that people are already releasing on github,

372
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:12,169
github

373
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:14,000
actions with just like a little bullying.

374
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,989
Um So that's the type of integration we need.

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,929
Otherwise we're just not going to get people to care enough to do it.

376
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,070
OK, cool.

377
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,409
So you just kind of,

378
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,599
I think led us into one of the topics I wanted to bring up with you because

379
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,979
uh you reached out to me on Twitter because I think I

380
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:30,830
was whining about some supply chain thing a couple of days ago.

381
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,770
And

382
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,260
so you, you talk about making it easy,

383
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,900
but also an important part of this is integrating it together.

384
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:41,940
One of the things that I I is terrifying me about the world of supply chains,

385
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,020
especially open source supply chains is

386
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,739
if we rewind the clock a decade or more,

387
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,200
there was this kind of attitude among application security.

388
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,460
People of security is special, you need to listen to us,

389
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,429
you need to do all this weird stuff to be secure.

390
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,890
And I think saying we failed is a polite description of, of what happened.

391
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,960
And I think we're still dealing with fall out of that even now.

392
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,719
And I feel like a lot of this supply chain stuff I see is, is in that,

393
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,359
in that wheelhouse of this is security supply chain, right?

394
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:20,280
But I, I feel like it needs to be part of a bigger picture and I I'm terrified

395
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,599
we're screwing that up.

396
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,799
Convince me I'm wrong.

397
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:24,760
Yeah,

398
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,090
I was wondering which uh which supply chain thing you were whining about there.

399
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:31,690
You didn't quite say you just said it was all terrible but there's so many, you know,

400
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,200
every week there's another one,

401
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,630
there's right.

402
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:36,250
And so in all seriousness, I mean,

403
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,469
this is part of what concerns me is

404
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:40,719
supply chains are cool right now and fricking everyone

405
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:44,359
is hitching their wagon to supply chains and, and it, it just,

406
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,400
it feels like it did before of like, oh my goodness, what are we doing again?

407
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,049
Do you have any s bombs for me? Yeah,

408
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,270
that's exactly what's happening. Um

409
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,469
because it's seeing so much attention now at the

410
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,659
national and international level like we have an executive

411
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,849
order about this

412
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:04,290
part of that story is is that everyone wants to shake the money tree, right?

413
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:05,819
Yeah.

414
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:06,780
Yeah, I mean,

415
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,949
it's crazy seeing an executive order about something that nobody even understood,

416
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,920
you know, a year ago

417
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:11,500
but

418
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,260
-- no one
-- understands now.

419
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,868
You know what? No, no, I think it's worse than that.

420
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,680
It's not even that they don't understand it again.

421
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,459
It goes back to, they didn't even know this existed. Right.

422
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,500
No. Right. I,

423
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,829
I've met so many people that are

424
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,839
what's in your software. What do you mean? Well,

425
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,390
you know, I see these BSD strings in your software.

426
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,880
Could you tell me what's in there?

427
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,550
-- You know,
-- I

428
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,609
-- don't
-- want to rat hole.

429
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:33,869
I

430
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:37,310
want Dan to convince me I'm wrong because I still want to be wrong.

431
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,630
No, it's good. I love a lot of what you said there.

432
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,599
I was listening to one of the other podcasts you had

433
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:43,400
and you said something great that you just reminded me of.

434
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,310
You said it's not that there's cracks in the foundation or something,

435
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,689
but there's a whole basement down there that people don't know about,

436
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:50,270
right? And so,

437
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,500
yeah, a lot of what I've seen in the last year, you know,

438
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,140
hasn't really led to improvements, but it's been, you know,

439
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,579
better insights into what is actually in uh dependency trees.

440
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,530
Eal is kind of a part of that. It's kind of like the end result.

441
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,880
But stuff like, you know, the github

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,650
dependency graph and having depend a bot nag you by

443
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,060
sending you a million updates constantly when you turn that on

444
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,030
is showing people how big of a basement there is

445
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,579
under there that they don't understand that they don't realize.

446
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,260
Um, and then,

447
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,140
yeah, it's

448
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,599
who we get to, how, how we're gonna make this easy and everything in a second.

449
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,469
I'm just gonna go off a little bit more of a tangent on what you just started with.

450
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,319
And you said the BS D strings, right? Um,

451
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,750
because we're not starting from scratch here. Uh There has been some work done

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,180
in standing dependency graphs and it did come out of these licenses, right.

453
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,020
Um You know,

454
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,099
decades ago when open source uh cases were being tried all the time

455
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,939
and everybody was suing everybody over breaching

456
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,780
different licenses and copyright uh clauses.

457
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,369
Um Everybody started to, you know,

458
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,010
annotate their source code with licenses because they were scared of getting sued.

459
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,469
Right.

460
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,489
Um So now we're seeing the same thing again, except instead of getting sued,

461
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,170
it's getting attacked or getting attacked.

462
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,729
And so it's, you know, what's scarier lawyers or Attackers.

463
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,729
Um You know, they're both pretty scary.

464
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,260
Um, the licensing stuff did a great job,

465
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,069
but I think the level of granularity they did in a lot of these

466
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,589
cases is a little bit wrong for what we need to do here.

467
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,750
Packages don't change their license every day.

468
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,680
You know, they don't have, there's 12 commits a day,

469
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,280
but people don't change their license more often than every couple of years,

470
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,989
hopefully.

471
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,189
Um And so we have to take a lot of that work and kind of move it down to the commit level,

472
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,709
make it more fine grained.

473
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,400
So we can actually say not just these 35

474
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,390
packages but the exact commits of these 35 packages.

475
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,469
Um So then we can join them with more interesting vulnerability databases,

476
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,449
which I know you've done a great deal of work on

477
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,489
trying to automate the way vulnerabilities get ingested and add

478
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,040
more metadata so that we can figure out exactly,

479
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,349
you know, which commit introduced it, which commit fixed it

480
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,250
because we have all this data around.

481
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,329
We just don't have it in ways we can query and do automation with.

482
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,829
Um so I think there's a bunch of different pieces all coming together. And I think,

483
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,020
you know,

484
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,119
there are people of course trying to profit off of all of

485
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,959
this and come up with ways to sell the secure supply chain.

486
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,030
Uh But I think getting it to be automatic,

487
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,290
getting it to be default and getting all this to be, you know,

488
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,880
the right and easiest way to build software is where we need to go.

489
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,079
And I don't think that's too hard, right?

490
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,229
You know, the story I told earlier about, you know, Google getting to this world by,

491
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,800
you know, by accident almost,

492
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,280
right?

493
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,589
Knowing what you're building is great for other reasons than security, right?

494
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,040
It lets your build to be faster.

495
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,439
Um It lets you update dependencies easier,

496
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:18,199
it lets you know your binaries be smaller, it can improve performance.

497
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:18,229
Um

498
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,619
So there are all these other reasons

499
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,104
you might want to build things. Uh you know,

500
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:27,025
in ways that aren't bash files and curl pipe to sh and

501
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,214
um you know,

502
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:32,234
tar balls being g zipped and piped around without any integrity checking.

503
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:32,925
So, you know,

504
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:36,354
knowing what's running in production and knowing uh what commits

505
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:38,734
it came from is important for so many different reasons.

506
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,234
Ok. I'm not convinced yet.

507
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:41,944
Let's, let's, let's

508
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,744
let me narrow it. OK. I'm gonna, I'll pick on your salsa which is

509
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,915
SLS A, what does it stand for? I forget

510
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:48,920
uh

511
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,109
uh

512
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:53,069
-- security levels for software artifacts, something like that. Yeah. OK.
-- That

513
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,079
sounds, that sounds right.

514
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,609
Maybe swap two VSS. I can't remember.

515
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,500
It's probably fine.

516
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:01,270
So I, I've, I've read this

517
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,670
and I feel like

518
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,939
it has,

519
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,439
well, I shouldn't say I feel like it does.

520
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:10,250
It has a very security focus to it and, and that's obviously the intent.

521
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:16,979
But when I read this, I, I, my immediate thought was this is part of a larger ecosystem

522
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,530
and I think we are doing a disservice to the developers

523
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,339
and ourselves by trying to single this into security instead of saying

524
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:30,510
this is a larger problem and security is part of it.

525
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,079
-- What would you describe that larger problem as
-- just

526
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:37,550
I would say the whole world of building and maintaining

527
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,390
II,

528
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,739
I hesitate to even use the word software necessarily because I

529
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,229
think software is also just part of a larger ecosystem of,

530
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,709
you know, you might, for example, let's say, in the case of Google,

531
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,170
Google has a variety of products and software is what drives that.

532
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,390
But you still have like, you know,

533
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,630
humans interacting with a thing and then the thing does something and

534
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:01,890
security is an aspect of this, but you also have usability, you have quality,

535
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,680
you have the developers that have to

536
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,250
features, right?

537
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,880
There's, there's so many other things and security is just a narrow sliver of it.

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,640
I'm, I'm concerned

539
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:12,959
that by

540
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:15,239
trying to address just security,

541
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,140
we're going to miss the bigger picture and it's going to turn back into the, oh,

542
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,160
the security nerds are at it again.

543
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,250
So you're saying the whole software industry is broken and

544
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,719
we need to throw it all out and start again,

545
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,959
wouldn't we all love that?

546
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,099
But you know what I mean?

547
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:27,380
It's,

548
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,319
and I'm not saying that that any of this work is

549
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,660
for naught because obviously you have to start somewhere and,

550
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,420
and build into that.

551
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,099
But at the same time, I, I just,

552
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,439
I remember the early two thousands and how adversarial the

553
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:45,339
relationship was between security and development and I'm like,

554
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,729
I'm, I'm terrified, we're going to do that again.

555
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,670
Yeah, I think it's a big risk. I think so. Yeah, let's talk about salsa a little bit.

556
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,810
Um And how some of that interplay here, I think, you know, the,

557
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,810
there's an initial set of levels in there,

558
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:02,160
your criteria that you're supposed to meet to get to salsa level 1234,

559
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,890
that kind of thing.

560
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,689
Uh you know, for the most part,

561
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:07,569
if you actually read through and think about what you have to do to get something,

562
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:08,489
you know, to one of those levels,

563
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,689
most of the work is actually done on the

564
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:13,170
side of whoever is operating the build system.

565
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,060
And I think,

566
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:18,369
you know, so as an open source developer, as somebody like that, I don't, you know,

567
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,520
most of the work really is not yours uh to know about,

568
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,579
you just kind of have to pick a build system that cares about security

569
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:28,010
and you have to not, you know, build on a Jenkins machine in a closet somewhere,

570
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,369
right?

571
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,209
Um

572
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,324
And we've known about this forever.

573
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:35,175
This is one of my, my favorite rants, you know, it's uh we've locked down production,

574
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,744
we buy all this expensive intrusion detection and, you know,

575
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:39,724
cis call monitoring and everything like that.

576
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,104
But then, yeah,

577
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,454
we build on somebody's random laptop and push that and we

578
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,824
have no idea what security is happening in the build environment.

579
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,060
So I think, yeah, the principle is like, you know,

580
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:50,469
the build system has to be at least as secure as the, you know,

581
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,300
environment you're deploying that stuff into.

582
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,780
Well, I mean, I think solar winds told us maybe more secure, right?

583
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:56,380
Yeah,

584
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,650
I would actually take a step back and say you just,

585
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,280
you even need to know what your build system is because I've

586
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,689
literally found production RP MS where the build host is workstation.

587
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,300
Like that was the DNS name of it,

588
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,839
you know.

589
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,099
Yeah, people should not be building from their individual machines, you know,

590
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:13,829
you should be doing this from secured

591
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,959
systems with monitoring and everything like that.

592
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,910
I guess it's sort of, I guess my,

593
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,609
my thought is even taking a step back and

594
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,530
going back to the like the inventory level of,

595
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,540
yeah, what build system is actually building this? Right?

596
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,459
I'm not gonna even assume it's a build system to start with.

597
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,719
Yeah, that's basically, I,

598
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:33,020
I did a couple of tweets yesterday trying to explain the levels in like one sentence.

599
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,819
And yeah, level one is like use a build system,

600
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:37,300
don't build from your laptop and that's a huge, you know,

601
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,819
huge security improvement if everybody did that.

602
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,859
Um And then, you know, number two is, you know, use a build system that, you know,

603
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:46,579
secures some metadata so you can actually trace stuff back and you know,

604
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:47,680
it it builds from there.

605
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:49,619
But the first one really is use a build system.

606
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,349
Um it creates a single point of failure that worries a lot of people.

607
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,170
Like if everybody's on github

608
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,920
actions and github

609
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,270
actions gets compromised.

610
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,989
Uh But at the same time, I think,

611
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,680
you know, the supply chain is

612
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,270
so distributed that um

613
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:02,949
you know,

614
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:07,050
it's having one central thing to protect is a lot easier than having

615
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,589
a million things all over the world that then feed into each other.

616
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,189
Right.

617
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,630
Um, you get into one dependency, you're eventually going to make it everywhere. So,

618
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,579
um, yeah,

619
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:18,969
I think getting stuff onto a small set of well operated production grade build

620
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:22,209
environments is going to be one of the biggest improvements we can make.

621
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,510
And I don't think people even need to do that for security right there.

622
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:26,795
Other reasons to do it, you know, for productivity,

623
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,734
nobody wants to be doing these builds on their laptop.

624
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,694
-- It's just been so hard to set up and,
-- and that, that's just it. Right.

625
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:35,375
I feel like the other reasons are way bigger

626
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:40,214
and, and again, if I'm the security nerd talking about security things,

627
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:41,155
I'm going to get ignored.

628
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,775
But if I have a story to tell that's way bigger than just security.

629
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,415
I, I think people are going to listen.

630
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,099
Exactly.

631
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,790
Yeah, I completely agree.

632
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,260
-- Well, but
-- also I,

633
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,540
one thing I've noticed is we'll fix this security problem that may or may

634
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,660
not be a problem versus we'll fix this problem where let's face it.

635
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,060
Building on Josh's laptop will be a problem someday soon when

636
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,339
Josh goes on vacation and we need to do a build.

637
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,250
Right. I, I've encountered that right now. I'm trying to rebuild a website with N PM.

638
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,699
It's some N PM build thing

639
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,099
and it's just, it's not behaving itself and of course,

640
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,900
the person who originally set this up is gone and

641
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,319
yeah, I'm staring at this thing trying to figure out how to make an update.

642
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,400
-- You
-- just need their laptop and then if you log in as them, I'm sure.

643
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,510
Well, and, and no,

644
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,729
the worst is I found the jerk me left a build script for

645
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,750
Mac Os but not how to get that Mac Os stood up properly to

646
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,699
do it all.

647
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,810
Yeah, I think leading with a lot of those benefits, you know, can really help.

648
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:38,760
One example, I like to show people is, you know, with uh you know, the Google, the mono

649
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,339
repo and stuff we have internally and everything is built from source and

650
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,989
there's just one number that increases as all the changes go in.

651
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,479
Um

652
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,729
you can actually

653
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,459
go type in a, you know, commit hash or whatever.

654
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,609
Um They're slightly different in our system is based on per force.

655
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,420
So they're just numbers that go up, but you can type in a, you know,

656
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,989
commit into the system and then see every single binary

657
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,989
in production right now that has that in it.

658
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:02,380
Um Which is awesome for like is my change in prod yet?

659
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,579
You know, how many hours have you wasted debugging code?

660
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,270
Because you thought you had the wrong version

661
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,900
checked out from what was actually happening.

662
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:09,015
Oh,

663
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:09,984
even simpler.

664
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:13,415
How much time did me and Josh spend looking to see which

665
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,255
versions of our back port of packages were affected or not.

666
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,824
-- Yeah.
-- Just like, why isn't my print statement getting hit?

667
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,954
And you're like, oh, it's because I still haven't deployed or, you know,

668
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:23,405
it's still a Q A and I'm looking at, you know, the proud stuff.

669
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:23,935
So there's,

670
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,295
there's so many of these things that I think do

671
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:27,494
resonate with people that don't understand or for some reason,

672
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,494
don't think they need to care about security yet.

673
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:31,694
Um, that you can build up just by having

674
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,170
some semblance of understanding on what's running where.

675
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,609
Yeah, I mean, look, I, I think let's encrypt is a great example of that, right? Where

676
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,069
most people I think aren't using, let's encrypt for the security aspect,

677
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,180
they're using it because it makes the little red stop sign go away in the web browser.

678
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:47,609
Right.

679
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,290
Yeah. And these are gradual cultural changes too, right?

680
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,670
You know, chrome and other browsers had,

681
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:54,410
had turned off http websites, you know, 10 years

682
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:57,265
that wouldn't have worked. You can't do that. It's gradual.

683
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,344
You need to get people to start caring where they are and then eventually, you know,

684
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:03,255
and I hope in five or 10 years people are going to look at, you know,

685
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,435
random binary packages they downloaded that don't

686
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:07,564
have any metadata associated with them as,

687
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:07,814
you know,

688
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,094
as scary as a USB drive you found on the sidewalk.

689
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:14,775
I think you just hit on the most valuable thing and, and,

690
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,814
and it even reminded me because

691
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,180
we often expect rapid change

692
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,479
and it's never rapid and especially in security and unfortunately,

693
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:27,660
if we try to push it too fast,

694
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:29,500
we become the enemy.

695
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,060
And

696
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,510
I know I'm guilty of that from the past. And so I'm always very, very

697
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:36,599
aware

698
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:41,199
of what I'm asking of developers because I know if you ask too much,

699
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,239
you, you

700
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,849
just, it's over

701
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:44,650
-- change,
-- fatigue,

702
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,640
right? Like alarm fatigue. It's a real thing. I mean,

703
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,709
I,

704
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:50,849
I know people working for various organizations

705
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,290
that through the pandemic have made,

706
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,920
you know, enormous changes to their workflows and

707
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,579
like on a weekly basis and people are just burning out.

708
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,209
Um And I, I imagine developers are humans as well.

709
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,510
I'm not entirely sure of that, but it seems to fit my theory of people,

710
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,890
most of them are,

711
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:10,869
-- there are a few strange ones.
-- The other thing I, I also wonder about is sort of,

712
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,140
I look at, you know, most things are a nice curve of adoption.

713
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,000
You have early adopters, then you have the bulk and then you have the stragglers.

714
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,109
But it seems to me, I think part of the

715
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:22,650
challenge with open source is we have such a diverse,

716
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,280
like when you say a build system,

717
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,030
my mind immediately goes to like there's 30 of them,

718
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,810
like which one? You know what I mean?

719
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:32,560
There's, there's almost too much choice sometimes, which is wonderful. But also,

720
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,680
you know, how, how do we get 30 different

721
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,569
user or 30 different build systems with completely disparate cultures and users

722
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:42,280
to agree on something like,

723
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,839
like build security.

724
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,959
-- Yeah,
-- it's slow and, you know,

725
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,719
that's my biggest worry is that we forget about this in a year or two.

726
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:49,380
and move on to something else.

727
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:51,915
History, especially with all this political pressure happening.

728
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:52,885
But I think, you know,

729
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:55,265
I think the Attackers probably won't let us forget

730
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,775
about it and they're going to keep coming.

731
00:29:56,954 --> 00:29:58,704
-- Um
-- So, I mean,

732
00:29:58,994 --> 00:30:04,334
no, I, I think if, if we forget about it, it's because there's no demand for it.

733
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,944
I don't think it would be because

734
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,650
it, we need it and we're not doing it.

735
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,390
I think it would just be because for some reason we've kind of solved this problem,

736
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,890
you know.

737
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:15,880
Yeah, or the other aspect, you know,

738
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,540
where you get standards and regulations written that say you have to

739
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,420
do X and X isn't exactly what you need for security.

740
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,359
And, you know, we get all these cases where, you know,

741
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,949
compliance is slightly different from security and people end up

742
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,270
making worse decisions in order to get a check box.

743
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,959
But I think we can, you know, come up,

744
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:34,229
hopefully come up with something good where we stay out of that debacle.

745
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:36,300
Let us, let us hope so.

746
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,839
Um Now, now at the same time though, like, so,

747
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:41,920
so one of my complaints about a lot of things

748
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,714
and I'll pick on salsa again for this is

749
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,974
like, I like the idea of salsa

750
00:30:47,204 --> 00:30:47,645
but

751
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:50,334
like, where are the references? Where are the things that say?

752
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:52,045
Like this is why we're doing this, right?

753
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:56,885
I, I feel like today and this might, it's where it starts, I understand to a degree.

754
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:57,415
But like,

755
00:30:57,535 --> 00:31:00,444
how do you prove what you want to do? Make sense?

756
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:03,055
And the example I always use is the NIST

757
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:04,334
password guidance

758
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:04,915
where, right?

759
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:07,694
Like NIST literally just made some crap up and then someone did research,

760
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,765
you're like, oh, wait, this is actually bad.

761
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:13,849
That's exactly what I was hinting at with the regulations being bad. But

762
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,079
yeah, like, I mean, that, that's the, that's the,

763
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,439
that's going to be the poster child forever of, of terrible regulation, right?

764
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:23,280
Because like a guy made some crap up instead of doing research and

765
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:26,969
like this is one of my concerns about all the supply chain stuff is

766
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:30,199
if, if it's people making crap up and not doing research,

767
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,670
it could be worse than nothing. Be it regulations from NIST, be it

768
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,189
something from the Linux Foundation,

769
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,859
be it something from the Cloud Security Alliance?

770
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,510
Right? Like, it doesn't matter where it comes from.

771
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,040
If it's just, if it's not backed by data and research,

772
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,119
you run the risk of being worse than nothing.

773
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:45,959
Right.

774
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,500
Yeah, I think, um,

775
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,349
yeah, it's a great risk.

776
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,689
I think a lot of this stuff is a little bit simpler than, you know,

777
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:53,979
say the password guidance.

778
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:55,390
Well,

779
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,630
-- some of it. Yes, I will agree.
-- Even password guidance to be fair.

780
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,229
It seemed like, you know, at, at a, at a first blush does seem like a good idea.

781
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:02,979
Um,

782
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,550
of course, rotate your passwords, um, until you realize what that leads to,

783
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,930
you know, the second order effects of it.

784
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:09,810
Yeah.

785
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:10,790
I mean, there's always a risk,

786
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,670
some of the stuff we come up with is going to be wrong and, you know,

787
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,510
we can't really do that research until we try

788
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,300
and people start trying a lot of this stuff.

789
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Um I think the the way that a lot of the recommendations and the

790
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,790
levels in this first draft came up was kind of one high level principle,

791
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,550
which was

792
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,140
how can we ensure that at least two people looked at everything, right?

793
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,359
No one person uh preventing unilateral access or preventing unilateral changes.

794
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,280
Um and that applies to source code, right?

795
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,910
Most people know that source code review is good where you can do it.

796
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,430
Um There even are some compliance uh things that, you know, take that into.

797
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,430
You can't prevent one person from, from force,

798
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,500
pushing to proud and then you kind of carry that along.

799
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,969
You know, two people should publish an artifact,

800
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:48,449
two people should change the BUILD script

801
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,380
or BUILD system that publishes that artifact

802
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:53,089
all the way out to like the BUILD system itself should

803
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:55,339
be operated in this way where nobody can change the BUILD,

804
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,420
the running BUILD system.

805
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,020
The infrastructure, all this stuff is on

806
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:02,380
that also leads to some second order effects like you need hermetic builds for

807
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,910
this because if even if two people reviewed every single line of code,

808
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,670
but one of the lines of code was curl

809
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,670
PPE to bash.

810
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,319
So a hermetic build is something you know where there are no outside effects,

811
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,839
it's sealed off from the outside world.

812
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:16,569
You can't make random network requests to download code, right?

813
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:18,119
And so if you've got a build script that, you know,

814
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,479
that script could have been reviewed, but it's hitting some random URL on github,

815
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,069
then anybody can change.

816
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,270
That's right. You've got unilateral access again.

817
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:28,540
Um And so figuring out how to prevent all the different examples of

818
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,160
all the different places we could think of throughout the life of,

819
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,349
you know, published artifact, uh you know, from source to production

820
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,599
all the places where one person had an opportunity to change. That

821
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,750
um is kind of the,

822
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,199
the guiding principle for how a lot of these recommendations came out.

823
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,349
Um The weird part is a lot of this doesn't make sense in open source.

824
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,079
So we've got to figure that out where, you know,

825
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:50,150
tons of projects have zero or one maintainers.

826
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,000
You know, you're lucky with one person looking at stuff

827
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:52,880
who's going to review that.

828
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,489
-- Exactly.
-- Exactly.

829
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,449
-- So that's, that's the struggle insert
-- the XK CD

830
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,569
-- comic,
-- right?

831
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,349
And I mean, and that might be something valuable to do.

832
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,849
Is with this BUILD system, you know, just to point out, hey, this

833
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,719
uh

834
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,890
like I remember was it XML? Hash do.

835
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,860
And, you know, it was a couple of things were affected

836
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,889
and literally the one person was,

837
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,100
I have a weekend free in about three months and I'll, I'll fix it then.

838
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,389
And Red Hat was like, we'd like to help you get it fixed now,

839
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,319
you know, and this might be,

840
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,128
I think this is part of it is we need to identify those critical projects and maybe

841
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,108
go well, this one doesn't have a lot of support.

842
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,108
So if you depend on it, you might want to help out.

843
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:30,239
Yeah, we could talk for another hour about this.

844
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:33,099
Um, because that is such a hard problem to do.

845
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:35,138
Um, you know, all the different cases of,

846
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:38,378
uh pretend you have a blank check and go try to improve open source.

847
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,059
It is not as easy as it sounds.

848
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:40,849
I

849
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:45,138
mean, now if someone wanted to though, I will take that blank check and,

850
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,688
and we'll have a hell of a party.

851
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,208
Yeah. No, we could, we could get into some real stories here.

852
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,820
Um You know, some people, some people don't want the money.

853
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,120
Some people have full time jobs.

854
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:55,199
You know,

855
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,820
the worst is when somebody has a popular open source project and then all of a sudden

856
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,560
they get a super high paying job where they're not allowed to work on it anymore.

857
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,110
I mean, something similar happened to Lo Dash

858
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:08,675
actually recently where that's literally what happened and then

859
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:12,514
it was a, they, they had no good way to basically

860
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:13,435
fix it.

861
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,354
Right. And it took months

862
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:15,784
to,

863
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:18,074
before they could sort out like who had ownership

864
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,794
of the package and who is owning the github

865
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:21,514
repo and like it was, it was wild.

866
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,959
Yeah, you can always fork the code but you can't always, you know,

867
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:27,560
get access to the N PM package or

868
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:31,179
on a lot of these registries. Yeah. So name spaces are important too

869
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,120
and low dash is if you look at N PM, everything uses a lo dash.

870
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,500
It's like it's literally in everything. It's

871
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,889
it's terrifying to think about sometimes.

872
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,350
Yeah. And so, you know, I I

873
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,709
completely agree and you know, I've listened to a lot of your podcasts,

874
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,860
open source owes you nothing, right?

875
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,860
Just because somebody put code out there, you know, it's this code comes with no,

876
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,159
this code comes with no warranty, use it at your own risk.

877
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,780
But then once it ends up as like a third level dependency

878
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,699
down your tree and you literally don't have permission to switch that

879
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,620
your fork,

880
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,149
you're kind of stuck too.

881
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,080
And I think that's where tooling has to come in and make it easier to swap, you know,

882
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,469
things out for their forks where relevant and start maintaining patches.

883
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:11,780
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah, totally. Alright. Alright. I'm gonna, I'm gonna cut us off.

884
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,989
I feel like I could talk to you for like, six more hours.

885
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,800
I won't,

886
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:19,169
I won't subject you or, or the audience to me for that long. Ok.

887
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,149
So Dan, I want to give you the last word

888
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,270
and then, and then we'll wrap it all up.

889
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,070
What is your, what is your advice for, about open source supply chain security?

890
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:32,899
Yeah, I would say, uh, be patient. Right? You know, this is a huge change.

891
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:33,939
We have to make software

892
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:34,969
now.

893
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,959
I know software doesn't get rewritten overnight though, right?

894
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,639
We have to change the way software gets written,

895
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,520
which means we have to wait for software to get rewritten.

896
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,919
Um But hopefully we'll get it right.

897
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:47,409
You know, this next time, thankfully, software doesn't live forever though.

898
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:50,199
And I think we're making good progress and people care about it now.

899
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,120
So we'll start to see improvements.

900
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,969
I, I truly hope so.

901
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,030
I will say you've given me a,

902
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,840
a sliver of optimism compared to where I may have been prior to speaking to you.

903
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,550
So I thank you for that and

904
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,550
I, I am hopeful. I truly am.

905
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:08,439
All right.

906
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,770
So thank you everyone. Thank you so much, Dan.
