Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,100
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Heat Wave crime.

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:11,899
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,090
Yeah, you guys are like on fire up there in Canada right now, aren't you?

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,770
We set a record yesterday.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,309
-- Hottest day in Canada
-- ever. You're going to set a lot of records. I think

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,360
we did set new records in Alberta for electricity consumption.

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,370
We beat the previous record by a gigawatt.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,250
That's neat.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,299
Yeah, the previous record was December 2019 when it was stupid. Cold.

10
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:37,049
And, uh, now it's

11
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,439
air conditioning obviously is kind of the big thing and

12
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,400
I didn't realize 60% of Canada has air conditioners, which I,

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,909
I would have guessed way lower.

14
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,009
So you told me that.

15
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,279
Well, I grew up without it

16
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,950
and, and I also did, which was terrible,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,400
but

18
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:53,409
you told me this and it didn't totally

19
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:56,680
shock me just because a significant portion of Canada

20
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:59,380
lies south of where I live,

21
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:03,700
like the population because you figure that like Toronto Montreal area,

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,370
there's a lot of people there.

23
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,879
Well, it's also to put air conditioning at your house is like $20,000.

24
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,400
And so like my parents don't have it.

25
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,860
Right. They have an older house and it would be

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,879
20 grand to install an AC unit

27
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,260
and chiller and pipes and all that other stuff.

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,000
And so a lot of people, you know,

29
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,339
just haven't bothered because quite honestly most summers we have, like,

30
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,430
five hot days

31
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:27,410
and, well, and where I live humidity is a non issue. Like I,

32
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:30,209
yeah, I, I think it was humid once.

33
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah. And again, the Toronto area is literally surrounded by water.

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,459
-- It's disgusting. It's incredibly humid all the time.
-- Yeah.

35
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,599
Whereas I'm 1000 kilometers from the nearest

36
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,410
body of real water with a mountain range in between.

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,809
This kind of reminds me of the whole solar winds thing, you know, and that it's,

38
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:47,959
it's one of those classic things.

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,300
It's like we've kind of known for a while

40
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,389
that this something bad is probably going to happen.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,669
-- But like if we just sort of don't pay attention to it long enough.
-- All right.

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,809
That's the worst transition

43
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:57,989
I've ever heard.

44
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:58,550
Now,

45
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,309
here's what we're actually going to discuss is we

46
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,930
had a listener send us a mail last week,

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,050
I think maybe, I don't know.

48
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,449
It's sometime before now

49
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,240
that basically said, hey,

50
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,660
do you think Se Linux could have stopped solar winds?

51
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,529
And I thought this is a marvelous topic because

52
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,080
it, it is a thought experiment

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,770
in the context of the answer is technically yes.

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,830
But

55
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,119
because

56
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:25,839
it,

57
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,130
it probably could have in the same way I could build an

58
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,479
uncrushable car if I had $12 billion to buy a car with.

59
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,160
You know what I mean?

60
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,389
I think part of the problem is, uh

61
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,009
and what we're, where we're eventually gonna end up at one point.

62
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,220
So I'm just gonna kill it now is

63
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:47,259
no amount of technology can fix problems.

64
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,770
Like a vendor saying, oh, hey, our package isn't signed properly,

65
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,820
just smash that button and just jam it in.

66
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,740
So,

67
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,139
right? Like no amount of

68
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,559
technical

69
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,380
problem.

70
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:00,539
But that's what I'm saying. It's like no amount of technical controls will fix

71
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,240
the problem of, oh, the technical controls are misbehaving,

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,520
just ignore them and force it

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,250
-- right?
-- So let's just get that out

74
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:06,860
-- of
-- the weapons,

75
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,550
right? And that's,

76
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,880
you know what I always think of is

77
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,589
and, and I I'll use Se Linux is a perfect example is so

78
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,089
my laptop finally came,

79
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,320
remember we talked about that like way back in the many episodes ago.

80
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,330
And so for those of you who don't know,

81
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,800
I ordered a new work laptop and the original date they told me it would

82
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:32,529
come was in 2024 and I ordered it in early April of the year 2021.

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,979
So obviously that was a place,

84
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,250
right? And the date June of 2021

85
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:42,029
uh the end of June, right? It it came on like June 25th or 26th I think

86
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,240
is when it like arrived at my house and so April and beginning

87
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,509
of April to end of June is what we ended up with,

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,399
which was better than I expected.

89
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,470
I'm not going to lie. But anyway, I have it

90
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,539
well, with the current GP U shortage. Yeah.

91
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,970
Right. Right.

92
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,419
I have my computer.

93
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,940
I do all the set up and everything

94
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,679
and of course, se Linux gets in the way here and there

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,610
and I just turn it off, do what I need to do and turn it back on because you know what?

96
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:11,119
That's way easier than figuring out what's going on

97
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,350
and then adding one rule for the one thing I need to do.

98
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,399
And so yeah, like, and, but this is a great example.

99
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,839
Well, and making sure that that rule persists.

100
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,309
Well, I don't need it to persist because this is like edit a file.

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,820
Oh, you can't edit the file because you're not special. It's like F us E Linux,

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,660
I am special.

103
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,600
Well, but that's the problem, right is in production.

104
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,619
If you're going to make, if you're going to have to modify Se Linux

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,660
policies, you,

106
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,059
you're gonna have to edit them and make it that change persist across Se Linux

107
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,690
updates.

108
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,279
Right. Right. You know,

109
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:40,250
plus

110
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,029
then for example, the, the server that wants to write the log file to

111
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,209
vlog slash whatever

112
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,149
changes that location or you want to log to a database or you want,

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,720
you know what I mean?

114
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,859
You, you change it and then

115
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,019
-- it breaks. I,
-- I've got, I think a nice way to think of this. So

116
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,290
in the case of solar winds,

117
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,179
it was the build system

118
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,540
that was compromised.

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,630
And let's say you have a build system and you have Se Linux running on it, right.

120
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,709
There's kind of two ways you can treat this, you can treat it as OK.

121
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,739
We're going to have a very loose se Linux

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,850
policy designed to, let's say,

123
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,239
look for a couple of of obviously bad things and then we're gonna,

124
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,579
let's say it'll be a little squishy in the middle, you know, hard,

125
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,489
crunchy outside squishy interior.

126
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,040
I don't see how that would really help here when the Attackers like I don't,

127
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:29,429
-- it wouldn't,
-- I don't really care about attacking the build system per se.

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,510
I just want the bill to have some funky backdoors.

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,950
We'll get to that, we'll get to that. So you're right,

130
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,109
it would basically not have stopped an attack like solar wind.

131
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,000
So now you say, ok, we're going to

132
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,720
lock everything down and we know

133
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,519
that the build and test are going to do these activities in this way

134
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,540
and then we're going to block like everything else, right?

135
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,440
So you're talking a super strict policy,

136
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,239
but the problem is as a product is developed and tested,

137
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,329
it's, it's constant change.

138
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,470
So you would have to have a policy that's also

139
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,579
being updated as often as new builds are happening,

140
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:04,809
which is you're talking about,

141
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,420
probably a team of people would have to maintain that.

142
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,859
I'm skeptical

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,390
they could keep it updated quick enough.

144
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:12,920
There's an even worse problem.

145
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,250
You're making the fundamental assumption of using a persistent build system,

146
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,510
which in my opinion is wrong.

147
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,250
Don't use a persistent build system.

148
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,619
Use a non

149
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,390
persistent build system that fires it up in a container

150
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,869
and you get like a fresh build every time.

151
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,959
That's the vision I have in my mind,

152
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,230
your build system should never be reused because even ignoring malicious stuff,

153
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:33,790
like

154
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,190
what happens if a build leaves some crap behind or

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,670
what happens if you some Brando installs a weird package.

156
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:44,910
You know, there, there's a million things, build systems should never be reused.

157
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,450
-- Well,
-- if somebody tweaks something to fix it, you know,

158
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,630
they tweak an environmental variable or they

159
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:51,380
whatever and

160
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
like, do you even know that that happened? Really? You know,

161
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,549
and that's why I like containers.

162
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:00,299
Is that whole, here's our version of reality and if we want to fix reality,

163
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,890
we actually have to like, fix it in a document weight,

164
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,769
like in the container file or whatever.

165
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,200
Right?

166
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,970
You know what I always think of is,

167
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,239
I've worked at more than one place now where it's the only

168
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,119
way to build a certain product was to ssh into someone's machine.

169
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,609
You had to build it there because

170
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:21,700
no one else could figure out how to set it all up. And it's like this is madness.

171
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,649
Well, I mean, like what is it? You know, what's the Python stuff called again?

172
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,690
I'm spacing out which Python stuff like pip.

173
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,790
You know, the stuff that sets up your magic kind of

174
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,329
magic Python environment with like conflicting library version.

175
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,299
Yeah. Virtual,

176
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,730
you know, stuff like that where it's like

177
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:40,390
I, I get why Python developers built that.

178
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,790
But at the same time again, it's like you're solving the problem by letting people,

179
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,170
you know,

180
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:48,279
punch giant holes in the side of their house and put Saran wrap on it instead of

181
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,489
having a proper box, like a container or something.

182
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,130
-- And
-- I don't know if I'd agree with that. I mean, so I use a lot of virtual environments.

183
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,510
I do a lot of Python work

184
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,429
and I think the biggest advantage I see is I can make sure I only have the things I need

185
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,149
in each of my little development universes. That way.

186
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,309
I know, for example,

187
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm not just like throwing garbage into this project when

188
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,915
the other project doesn't need any of those dependency.

189
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:17,644
-- So I mean, I really like it but containers functionally can do the same thing.
-- Yes.

190
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:21,325
Well, the nice thing about containers is you have a real clean boundary.

191
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,885
Like it's a, it's a really sharp clean edge.

192
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:25,744
And

193
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:26,244
I mean,

194
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,924
that's what I'm seeing more and more of an it is I want real

195
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:33,804
sharp clean edges between my stuff because I remember back in the day where,

196
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,864
you know, this whole idea of one server per service.

197
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,205
No, we, we, we can only afford one computer.

198
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:41,337
So we had to put everything, you know, we had to put the DH P server, the

199
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,008
FTP server, the web server, the email server, the DNS server,

200
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,669
you had to put everything on one computer

201
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,629
because that's all you could bloody well afford.

202
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:51,749
Not just that we used to brag about that in the Linux world is, oh,

203
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,908
Windows can only do one thing for a computer.

204
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,508
We can do 100 things for a computer, aren't we? Awesome? And it's like

205
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:02,840
in back then that was awesome. But now it's like, no, that's the opposite of awesome.

206
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:07,289
And so now it's, I mean, between either virtual machines and,

207
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,080
or higher level stuff like containers,

208
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:11,450
you absolutely should break stuff down, you know,

209
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,619
use network sockets as sort of your, your boundary condition because again,

210
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,359
it's really clean and clear what's going on.

211
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,289
There's no magic

212
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,200
like, oh,

213
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,210
it dumps something onto the file system somewhere that something else needs.

214
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,690
All right, I wanna, I wanna reel this back just a little bit and, and

215
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:29,780
focus on something you said, as you said, you know, people want clear boundaries

216
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:30,809
and

217
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,190
I think

218
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,650
that is why containers have won this battle.

219
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,409
Whereas you look at some of these other sandbox type technologies like for example,

220
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:41,450
Se Linux

221
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:46,489
-- has not or, or app Armor or pick one of them.
-- Well, And do you know why?

222
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,849
There's one simple reason,

223
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:51,010
trust boundaries with containers inside of your container,

224
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,450
you can have a single trust level and just essentially, right?

225
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,809
Like who cares? YOLO?

226
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,309
Because quite frankly, if a container, if an attacker breaks into the container,

227
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,929
they don't

228
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,530
have to care about rooting it.

229
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,059
Like they've just rooted that container,

230
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,450
they've taken over that container at the application level of say

231
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,659
the database or the mail server or the web server.

232
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,330
So it doesn't really matter if they get more

233
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,460
access within the container. Whereas if you have a multi

234
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,929
user sort of multi-tenant system

235
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,530
being protected by Ac Linux,

236
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,179
you know,

237
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,849
and you have the mail server and the web server on it

238
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,849
and you have to keep those two from touching each other.

239
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,570
And that's really hard because they share

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,580
the system in so many ways like DNS lookups libraries, you know, all, all that stuff.

241
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,419
And

242
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,530
so when I build a container,

243
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,859
I can say I'm gonna maybe decompose my application into a web server,

244
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,979
an application server and a database server, right?

245
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:42,780
A classic three layer cake

246
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:43,640
and

247
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,729
each of those cake layers effectively has a single trust layer

248
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:49,380
with

249
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,989
like a port exposed, you know, on the web server,

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,309
it's going to be port 80 or 443 or whatever on the application server,

251
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,140
it's going to be port like

252
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,590
5000

253
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,729
and on the database server, it's going to be port uh

254
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,530
whatever post Chris SQL uses, I think 4321 or something.

255
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,539
I don't know anymore. And, you know,

256
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,369
that's

257
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:07,460
super easy,

258
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,729
you know, and, and to put a blank, if you can break into post Grass SQL via the network,

259
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,330
well,

260
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,130
you can do that anyways like you can, it's, it's on a system.

261
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,890
Se Linux wouldn't be able to protect that because the,

262
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,650
the application server has to talk to the database,

263
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,830
you know, and if the attacker, so

264
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,270
I, I really think this whole multi

265
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,309
system

266
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,169
and by system,

267
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,320
I don't mean just a hardware machine or a container or a virtual machine,

268
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:33,880
but I mean,

269
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,099
like a running sort of quasi whatever

270
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,619
you want to call it operating system environment

271
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,530
that has multiple levels of trust

272
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:40,679
is

273
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,880
-- it's just too much work to do it correctly. I
-- mean, I agree with that.

274
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,760
And again, this is, it's not just,

275
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:48,960
it's not just that,

276
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:49,640
I mean,

277
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:51,599
well, sure, but this is,

278
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,729
I think this is fundamentally why containers one

279
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:56,479
because containers solve like 10 annoying problems.

280
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:01,429
-- And this is just one of them that it solves a perfect
-- example is, is like Jenkins,

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,380
Jenkins, like in classic terms was, you know,

282
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,039
you install Jenkins on a server and you use it, it's persistent,

283
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:08,280
it's highly persistent

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,359
and then that changed. And Jenkins is now, you know,

285
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,219
when we worked at Red Hat, remember openshift used Jenkins and it,

286
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,669
every build was a new instance of Jenkins effectively running in a container,

287
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,099
did the build and the proof it's gone

288
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,750
and the BUILD artifacts were extracted.

289
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,669
And so there's a whole pile of Jenkins security vulnerabilities that

290
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,869
just no longer matter.

291
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,869
That's right because it's like, oh, you know,

292
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,799
the attacker can do this and then get persistent.

293
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:31,815
Well,

294
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:35,484
yeah, they get persistence for like, three minutes and then the container is gone.

295
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:38,034
I mean, now, mind you that doesn't always matter.

296
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:41,465
-- There's a talk I will try to
-- find gone in 60 seconds.

297
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:41,905
Yeah.

298
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:43,354
Is that it where they basically,

299
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:47,275
-- it's an attacker
-- shows escaping function as a service.

300
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:48,184
-- Right.
-- Right.

301
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,174
But at the same time

302
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:54,744
that raises the bar for the Attackers and something we always forget

303
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,270
in the world of security is we love to think of

304
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,840
this all as binary of attacker wins or we win.

305
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,090
But the reality is,

306
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:05,830
it's all about, I just want to make life miserable for the attacker.

307
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,020
It's not about I win or they win. It's about I'm going to make their life suck.

308
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,309
So they give up eventually.

309
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:11,770
Well,

310
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,580
but also you can gain the ability to

311
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,119
notice something bad happened because for example,

312
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,559
your Jenkins ephemeral build service should never try

313
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,460
and poke the rest of your network infrastructure.

314
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,739
You know, the Jenkins build server should not, you know what I mean?

315
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,739
If it's in a container, there's a whole bunch of stuff it just will, should never do.

316
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,840
And it makes detection so much easier because again,

317
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:34,080
when you have a server running an email server, a web server and a database server.

318
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,599
Like I remember back in the day

319
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:39,739
having firewall rules on my servers that they couldn't connect out

320
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:43,609
to create network connections. So if somebody broke into me

321
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,729
and then tried to connect out to attack other people,

322
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,039
I would notice it

323
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,000
right away.

324
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,989
Now, of course, that breaks updates and a whole bunch of other stuff I need.

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,450
So there's then, you know, you need a proxy server for DNS.

326
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,119
You need a proxy server for updates and a whole pile of other junk.

327
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,799
But the point is the whole point of it was so I could,

328
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,219
if somebody broke to my server and then like tried to port scan my network,

329
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,340
I would, I would know right away

330
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,919
and I could take corrective action.

331
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,580
And that's the other thing, right? Is this

332
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,080
this thing of detection? Like what gets me about the solar winds timeline?

333
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,000
December 8th Fireeye,

334
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,960
our prominent cybersecurity firm announces that they were blah, blah, blah,

335
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:17,469
hacked

336
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,719
December 13th Fireeye discovered a supply chain

337
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,359
attack while investigating blah blah blah,

338
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,679
Trojan Eye solar winds

339
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,270
like December 13th 2020. And then this whole thing chugs along for a while

340
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,830
and then kind of blows up later.

341
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,380
You know what I mean?

342
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,510
And that's the thing

343
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,719
or like the home I remember Home Depot.

344
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,270
Remember they got hacked for a whole bunch of credit card data

345
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,960
and their security firm had told them, like, months before that there were like,

346
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,359
bad guys in their network

347
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,859
and, well, they ignored it

348
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:49,280
-- or something. I don't know. Right. And that's human nature.
-- It is. And

349
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,989
you talk all the time about,

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,479
actually you haven't talked in a while about aircraft horrifying accidents.

351
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:54,853
But

352
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,802
one of the things you always talk about is the

353
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,922
fact that it's rarely one thing that went wrong.

354
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,893
It's like 10 things had to go wrong in just

355
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:03,223
the right order for this to turn into a catastrophe.

356
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,643
-- What
-- the Swiss cheese holes had to line up. Right.

357
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:10,203
And, I mean, it's the same thing in all e every security incident when you read

358
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,403
what happened. It's like, oh, holy crap.

359
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,643
Look at how they screwed up now, mind you,

360
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:17,403
I'm not going to pretend that that couldn't happen to any of them.

361
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,185
Us because goodness knows we're humans and we make loads of mistakes.

362
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,315
-- Well, I mean, I had my servers hacked once upon a time
-- even now.

363
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,395
You could be hacked now and you might not know it, you know.

364
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:30,116
Well, and that's part of why I outsourced all my junk to the cloud because to hack me,

365
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,435
you'd have to hack into Google.

366
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:31,995
I mean,

367
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,635
kind of, it depends how you're running it, but

368
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:38,676
it's irrelevant. Right. The point is the point of all this

369
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:40,296
is just the fact that

370
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,440
when you look at a problem

371
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,219
and then some of these proposed solutions there is like, technically correct.

372
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,179
And then there's actually working

373
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,599
and you know what I mean? And I think this is part of the disconnect.

374
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:55,210
We run into a lot in the world of security is there's these like,

375
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:58,320
technically correct things where you say, oh, you should do this, you should run

376
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:01,820
this policy, you should run this thing to lock it down.

377
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,349
There's a million things, but the reality is

378
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:07,080
people are people and you have to pick something

379
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,500
that actually works and can be worked with.

380
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,260
And I think that's where a lot of these security technologies fail.

381
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,640
Well, I look at the,

382
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:18,205
I've had a lot of people sort of try and sell me security solutions like AC M

383
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,155
and I'm like, no,

384
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:22,695
I'm not going to do AC M because we don't actually we have one VPs

385
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:24,885
server and everything else is essentially platform as

386
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,815
a service or higher in the cloud.

387
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:30,844
I literally, there's no value for me in AC M plus

388
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,924
the expertise and time and effort needed to run it properly

389
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:39,625
-- is more than zero, much more than zero.
-- There are a lot of work to do it, right.

390
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,744
That's the thing is, is just that

391
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,234
like I look at Se Lenox

392
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,719
and to make policies you have audit to allow.

393
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:50,140
And as far as I know, that's the only tool and audit to allow is not fine grained.

394
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,289
It basically looks at the errors in the log and says,

395
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,799
you know, this thing tried to touch this thing in this way.

396
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,020
Boom, here's a rule that allows that like, but typically a very broad rule, you know,

397
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,900
there's because I remember writing back in the day about se like

398
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,694
there was this one cool tool, for example, that would,

399
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,385
it would watch why you did like, you know,

400
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:11,375
back in the days of uh what was it dot slash configure make test, make, make install.

401
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:14,685
Um And it would watch the make portion of the tarball creation

402
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:18,155
and create like a list of files and try and make some rules to kind

403
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:22,015
of cover what the server would probably have to do with those locations and stuff.

404
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,239
And it would kind of try and make a policy, you know,

405
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,689
you know, based on that

406
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,520
as far as I know,

407
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,959
there's one person on the planet that actually

408
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,880
knows how to make proper se Lennox policies.

409
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,589
-- There's, I can think of about 50,
-- ok.

410
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,119
Well, I was thinking of Dan Walsh and maybe he taught a few people.

411
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,339
Dan Walsh is the best by far.

412
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,719
But yes, it is definitely one of the challenges

413
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,280
and then the problem is too, it's going to randomly break stuff.

414
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,689
I guarantee it's gonna have to at some

415
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,969
because if you actually have a properly restrictive policy

416
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,930
at some point, your server is going to do like the,

417
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,250
the yearly backup or the yearly report

418
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,959
that wasn't accounted for in the rules.

419
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,300
Oh, I don't even think of that anymore.

420
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,920
I mean, you think when, when Se Linux was created,

421
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,650
it was created in like the early two thousands

422
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,310
by the NSA literally by the National Security Agency.

423
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:11,709
And back in those days, it was very much a universe where you would set up a machine

424
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:13,969
and that was it, it was like cast in, in

425
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,709
epoxy forever and you never changed it because if you touch it, it might break.

426
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:22,189
And I mean, that's, that's the world. Se Lennox comes from and today

427
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,050
and this whole like madness of Dev ops and whatever you want to call it,

428
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,890
your application is changing.

429
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,969
Probably, I'd like to say multiple times a day, but let's face it.

430
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,130
Most people aren't, don't move at that speed,

431
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,290
but it's still going to be a couple of times a month for sure.

432
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,920
And so if you have some sort of security engine policy,

433
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,030
as soon as you push a new update to prod

434
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:44,000
it, it breaks. Right.

435
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,010
-- And that's
-- unacceptable

436
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,729
and it doesn't break in a simple, nice, easy, clean way either.

437
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,640
Right. It breaks in a way you're just going to turn off Se Linux

438
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,520
because that was the quickest solution.

439
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,390
Well, but also you, it's kind of the quickest way to troubleshoot.

440
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,250
Did Se Linux break this or did the application just break?

441
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,050
That's true too. I

442
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,540
it's only,

443
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,130
I've done that so many times when I turn up Se Lennox and it's still broken.

444
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,540
I'm like, well, crap.

445
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,219
Now, I know.

446
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,689
Right

447
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,170
now I really have to figure it out.

448
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,640
Yeah. Or you put Se Linux

449
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,839
back into, um, from enforcing to what is it,

450
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,280
-- the logging? Permissive
-- mode? Permissive. Yeah.

451
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,479
Permissive is when it doesn't fail.

452
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,530
-- Yeah. And you watch your log files.
-- Yeah.

453
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,579
Yeah. Well, and that's how you use the audit to allow is you,

454
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,520
you put Se Linux in permissive mode,

455
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,020
you do what you need to do,

456
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,189
then you analyze the log file and it will add the

457
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,275
rules you need and you can put it back into,

458
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:39,074
you know, the the restrictive mode and it will

459
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,094
in theory

460
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,244
work and see and this is a perfect example of you.

461
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,464
But to do that properly,

462
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,655
you have to account for those multiple trust barriers and get a tight policy.

463
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,954
Whereas if you go with the idea of we're gonna have a single trust level,

464
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:52,234
then you just YOLO in a container,

465
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:52,925
that's it

466
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:53,584
done,

467
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:54,295
right?

468
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,675
And like I know which one I'm going to pick nowadays.

469
00:19:56,969 --> 00:20:00,479
So there's also another side to this that I don't think we talk about a lot.

470
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:04,000
So let's say I have an application I built I now

471
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,540
am solely responsible for my security policy on that application, right?

472
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,380
I have no help.

473
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,569
I can't get help because literally no one but me is

474
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,609
running this assuming you're running a Sass or something like that.

475
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,589
Now,

476
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,170
if we look at the world of containers,

477
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,280
the whole world is using containers in fundamentally the same way.

478
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,569
So everyone working on container security is doing so

479
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:28,180
in a manner that can basically benefit everyone else.

480
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,520
That's amazing.

481
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,589
Well, and even better than that, not only is it shared,

482
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,589
but it's quite often it's the vendor publishing a container.

483
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,430
It's, it's like good and legitimate and works

484
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,219
properly.

485
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,449
You know, it's no,

486
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:42,410
it's not some like random container from some guy in Switzerland that, you know,

487
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,839
needed this to work in a container.

488
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:44,989
-- So he built it
-- right.

489
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,949
90 percent of the internet runs off of some random container.

490
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:50,079
-- But
-- more to the point

491
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,319
that

492
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,319
the vendor has a very, here's the beautiful thing.

493
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,510
The vendor has an incentive that the container

494
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,729
works and people don't phone their support line.

495
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,869
I mean,

496
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,780
like from the perspective I deal with, yeah,

497
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,189
that's totally true is we need to make sure our containers don't

498
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,650
-- suck
-- because here's the thing with Se Linux as a vendor.

499
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,280
The only thing that Se Linux will do for me is create support volume

500
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,869
compared to the number of calls that will prevent from security issues.

501
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,890
Whereas having a fully working container.

502
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,109
Oh, all those calls. What, how do I install the product and get it working?

503
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,010
They stopped

504
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:24,140
because they, it's just like download the container. Ok. And then you turn it on.

505
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,699
There's no step to, right. That's the beauty of containers. That's why I love them

506
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,900
stuff just works.

507
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,589
Absolutely.

508
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,349
I,

509
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,290
you know, there's a, so the beauty is,

510
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,250
there's a huge incentive for vendors to do this correctly and most of them do now,

511
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,300
you know, because it, things just work,

512
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:41,319
you know? I,

513
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,650
yeah.

514
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,119
Yeah.

515
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:43,469
I,

516
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:46,260
I remember the bad old days of downloading a vendor product and trying

517
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,010
to make it work on like a system they said it would work on

518
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,849
and they'd be like, oh, yeah, there's this magic step. You forgot.

519
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,020
Yep. Yep. I've done that. I remember that.

520
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,180
Or my, my other favorite is when they would just like, literally throw

521
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,530
a huge pile of crap into like slash opt

522
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,219
and it like, came with its own operating system, essentially all the,

523
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,569
like its own lib sea, its own everything

524
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,339
because

525
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,500
it worked.

526
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,060
I mean, ironically

527
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,979
that was basically a container.

528
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,479
We

529
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,500
-- just didn't have a name for it.
-- Well, or a nice clear boundary.

530
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,239
Yeah.

531
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,790
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I mean,

532
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:25,939
-- so,
-- yeah,

533
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:26,880
-- it's,
-- oh my

534
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,030
-- goodness.
-- I, I honestly think things like Se Linux

535
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,839
are,

536
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,119
they're not dead but like pearl, they're a dead end.

537
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,229
-- I mean,
-- I don't know if I'd go that far.

538
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:40,390
I, I, the thing I think about a lot is so let's, let's talk about Chrome for a minute.

539
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,810
Let's kind of change directions a little bit. So the chrome web browser

540
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,729
has a sandbox

541
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,729
and when you run Chrome,

542
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:52,489
it basically uses all of the same technologies that things like Se Linux

543
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,250
used to lock itself down

544
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,650
and it uses this stuff to basically neuter the Chrome processes,

545
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,369
-- the Children it spawns
-- there.

546
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,369
You actually have a vendor whose incentives align with.

547
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,939
We need these web browsers to just accept any and all data off the

548
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:10,040
internet and not get users hacked so that they keep seeing our ads.

549
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:15,150
There's that side of it. But I mean, like all all the browsers do this now, right?

550
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,420
Sandbox is not new.

551
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,329
It was when chrome started, there's the angle of we have a vendor with an interest,

552
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,609
but there's also the aspect of when

553
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:24,495
you have a very

554
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,495
understood and specified, use

555
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:31,245
these things have immense value, right?

556
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:34,336
But when you're doing, who knows what,

557
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:37,765
then it becomes extremely difficult. So for example,

558
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,336
if you know

559
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:43,056
that you have something doing one thing like a web browser, for example,

560
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:46,526
or if I had like an upload service where I was accepting files,

561
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,125
like that would be a great

562
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:49,776
use where you can say Se Linux

563
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:54,112
only allow rights to this directory and only

564
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:57,982
this directory and never ever ever execute anything

565
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,972
outside of slash bin

566
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:02,482
like that makes sense, right?

567
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,302
But saying here's my Sass app that's made of 72,000

568
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,411
random piles of stuff I've downloaded off the internet.

569
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:14,151
-- Good luck. Like that's out of the question. Well,
-- here's the thing.

570
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,222
I keep coming back to

571
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:16,541
vendor supplied. Se Linux,

572
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,732
100 and 26,000 results in Google

573
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,310
vendor supply container

574
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,910
about 9.5 million

575
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,550
again, like looking for Se Linux

576
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:26,650
tools.

577
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:27,349
Se Linux

578
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,020
tools, you know, 1 million results,

579
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,189
but it's all how tos it's the same set of

580
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,829
like here's kind of the basic Se Linux walk through.

581
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,510
There's no like there used to be a graphical user interface tool to creating Se Linux

582
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,319
policy, which was really nice because just something as

583
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,359
quote unquote,

584
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:47,150
simple as figuring out like what is the name of the thing I need to call to like

585
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,550
add to this policy,

586
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:51,954
right? And it's like something with like five underscores and it's really long.

587
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,255
Se Linux is

588
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:56,954
too complicated for most people to get, right? So they don't and

589
00:24:57,114 --> 00:25:00,555
there's no vendor support really. Like I, I don't remember ever.

590
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,694
I've never seen a vendor ship an Se Linux

591
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,405
policy that works properly.

592
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,875
Red hat does, I mean Red hat stuff is great

593
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:11,834
-- but like
-- Red Hat, but then you need to install other people's stuff on it and se

594
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:12,295
breaks

595
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:12,755
it

596
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,625
gets dicey after that for sure.

597
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,890
That's like saying open BS D is secure because you

598
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,540
just run what open BS D ships by default.

599
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,339
And it's like cool, but I need more than like a dns and email server.

600
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:24,229
I actually needed to run stuff

601
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:27,660
well, and, and right, and that changes then obviously,

602
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,390
but

603
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,349
it's,

604
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,670
I, like I said, I think fundamentally

605
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,839
se Linux is a dead end because

606
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,199
it's had 20 years

607
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:40,839
and we still don't have an ecosystem for it.

608
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,869
People just don't care enough to write tools.

609
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,069
All right. So here's, here's a question though.

610
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,829
Is there no se Linux ecosystem

611
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:51,010
because nobody wants it

612
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,229
or is it because it's too hard or is it because

613
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,910
the authors of Se Linux

614
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,579
-- didn't nurture a community in the way they should have.
-- I think it's honestly,

615
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,910
it's a solution the NSA needed. It's not a solution. Most people need.

616
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,869
Most people need to inventory their systems and patch them.

617
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,050
And then they can start thinking about Sc

618
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:12,800
Linux, the NSA.

619
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,479
On the other hand,

620
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,800
has a bunch of ridiculously constrained systems that

621
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,420
need to absolutely just do like geospatial data analysis

622
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,560
or take in data from whatever

623
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,000
and,

624
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,849
and but they need,

625
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:25,569
they have like they have a check box that says

626
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,319
this thing needs to provably be secure in this way

627
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,489
and we care because it's handling like the most ridiculous level of top secret,

628
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,819
you know,

629
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,900
satellite imagery out of North Korea or whatever

630
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,979
the majority of us don't have that constraint.

631
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:40,380
So the thought experiment for everyone as we leave this,

632
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,300
what it can only be described as an Se Linux bashing session

633
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,280
is

634
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,790
could se Linux

635
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,189
have become the general purpose tool we need or was it always doomed

636
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,630
for this kind of specific use case?

637
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:57,619
I'm just looking actually the Se Linux project has a github

638
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,790
organization and there's an se tools repo

639
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:05,699
it's kind of up to date, but most of the stuff is not super up to date. And

640
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,430
I, I think realistically that the ship has sailed,

641
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,670
we have

642
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:12,209
things that will get you a much better return on investment,

643
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,510
not in the sense of just security, but in the sense of

644
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:15,839
here's the thing,

645
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,989
we can spend time and effort on Se Linux

646
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,089
and that might buy us some security or we can spend time and effort on containers.

647
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,989
And that absolutely will

648
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,109
make this thing install super easy

649
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,829
and it will buy us a bunch of security stuff real easy. And you know what I mean?

650
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,030
It, it forces us to do some automation that then benefits us down the road because,

651
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,099
oh, you know, we released an update, boof, here's updated containers.

652
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,150
All right. Now, here is the question I will ask you as we come to the close

653
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,969
-- wood containers have stopped the solar winds
-- attack.

654
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,079
Nothing would have stopped solar winds attack

655
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:50,750
because they have like an intern set password.

656
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,030
-- 123, you know,
-- no,

657
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,729
that wasn't the attack even though that

658
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,819
was just an unrelated incident that everyone

659
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:00,650
keeps pointing at which drives me up a wall because it doesn't make,

660
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:03,545
it's not important.

661
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:04,114
Well,

662
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:09,265
it matters in the sense of solar winds would have got and hacked at some point somehow

663
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:12,314
because they just had so many massive problems.

664
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:13,885
And that's kind of a separate

665
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:15,185
and that's my point, right? Like

666
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:19,584
when a vendor says, hey, this sign package, yeah, the signature is wrong. Ok. Just

667
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,685
smash that install button and ignore it.

668
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:23,064
Ignore it's fine at

669
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:23,984
some point,

670
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,505
you know, it's, it's when you have maintenance,

671
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:29,704
people who don't do maintenance correctly, eventually it's going to fail.

672
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,229
It's not a win or it's not an, if it's a when and how bad

673
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,430
that's true. And so

674
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,790
there's nothing that

675
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,060
could have prevented a solar winds hack at some point

676
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,660
in the future with the way their culture was,

677
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,160
it was inevitable and they were also a huge target. Like,

678
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,670
you know, now that certain countries have figured out who, you know,

679
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,829
we attack this one company and we gain access to the, well,

680
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:53,900
to all the,

681
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,839
yeah, to every organization with over 100,000 computers.

682
00:28:59,630 --> 00:28:59,880
That's a no

683
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,380
brainer.

684
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,439
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,380
All right. I,

686
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,229
I want to apologize

687
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,069
to any Se Linux

688
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,709
fans out there because

689
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,439
we poured on some hate, but I

690
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,390
don't hate it.

691
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,989
I think Se Linux is cool. It just needs, I wish it was easier.

692
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:19,729
Yeah, I, I wish it was, I wish it actually worked

693
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,170
the way. I think that a lot of

694
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,170
it, it, it has usability issues which basically make it unusable,

695
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,380
which makes me sad because,

696
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,410
because there's a lot of things

697
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,449
where

698
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:33,489
Se Linux won't necessarily

699
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,900
block or prevent or stop the attack, but it would sure as heck

700
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,849
give me an indication that there's an attacker doing something bad

701
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,569
fast and right away and then I could go deal with it.

702
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,609
But I have to disable it to get the system to work.

703
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,930
Yep. Yeah, and that, that's a challenge.

704
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,290
All right, I'm gonna call it. Thank you, everyone
