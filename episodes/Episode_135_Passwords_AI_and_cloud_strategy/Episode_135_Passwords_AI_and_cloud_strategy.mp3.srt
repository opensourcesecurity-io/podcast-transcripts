Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 135 with myself,

1
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,319
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:16,610
-- Josh Pressers,
-- man. I burnt my finger super bad in my 3d printer today.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,079
It like really, really hurts.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,649
Isn't there? Only one tiny little part of the 3D printer that actually gets hot.

5
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:26,120
Well, the bed does but you won't burn yourself. Yeah, the extruder.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,860
So my story which I feel like has a security tie in which is why I'm going to tell it is.

7
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,729
So I, I bought some wood filament

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,509
and I have some projects.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,409
What?

10
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,439
Yeah, I'll explain.

11
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:38,569
Uh So

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,250
basically I have some, I have radiators in my house, right. And

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,970
I have pipes that come up out of the floor and

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,840
over the course of the 100 years this house has existed,

15
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,009
all of the radiator pipe covers are gone

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,959
and I've tried to find some I could buy,

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,959
but just given the fact that the pipes

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,650
are like ridiculously sized because they're very old.

19
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,889
I can't get one right.

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,310
You probably have to go to Europe.

21
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,810
It, it doesn't matter. Right. That's not the point.

22
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,750
So, anyway, I got the idea. Hey, they sell this wood filament.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,959
I could print radiator, like nice sleeves that, that are two pieces.

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,309
They kind of snap together

25
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,430
and I'll make them out of wood so I can stain

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
them and make them look really nice because that's the whole

27
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,120
point of this wood filament is you can sand it and

28
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,430
-- stain it and make it look kind of like
-- wood.

29
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,959
So, wait, it's actually physically wood.

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,589
No, it's not. It's weird though. It's not, it's not exactly plastic.

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,349
It's not exactly wood. I have a suspicion.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,519
It's some sort of weird amalgamation of stuff.

33
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,900
It smells a bit like burning wood as you use it.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,430
So I have a feeling there's some wood product in it.

35
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,110
But anyway, anyway,

36
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:40,349
so I'm,

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,419
I'm printing all my stuff and I go

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,589
downstairs this morning while it's printing and it,

39
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,769
like, just had stopped.

40
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,389
The, the, the filament had stopped,

41
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,269
stopped coming out of the extruder. Right.

42
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,279
And I look and thought, well, that's not normal.

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,910
And then I was looking at every, you know,

44
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:57,510
the various dials and gauges and things and saying, I wonder what's going on.

45
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,309
And then my first thought was, I wonder if the extruder is not hot.

46
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,879
So, guess what I did. I touched it and guess what? It was really freaking hot.

47
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,629
200

48
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,110
-- Â°C. Man,
-- this is my theory that

49
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,509
almost all people need to learn either hot or sharp the hard way.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,350
Possibly more than once.

51
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,880
Kurt. Do you know how many times I've burnt myself touching that extruder

52
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,610
more than I can count.

53
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,229
And, and that's, that's the lesson.

54
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,550
So, so put a sign on it or something.

55
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,910
Yeah, that,

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,350
that

57
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,720
wasn't gonna work and you know it,

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,160
but that's the lesson, right?

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,050
Humans are dumb

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,410
even

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,279
though we know we shouldn't do something. We, we do it

62
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,279
generally because we have like a momentary lapse of sanity

63
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,649
and, and then we obviously regret it.

64
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,089
And like, now I'm sitting here and like,

65
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,160
my finger really freaking hurts and it's probably gonna hurt for a week.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,130
It's, it's not a third degree burn or anything, thank goodness.

67
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,960
But like, holy cow, it freaking hurts.

68
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,490
Well, I feel like this whole thing with the, so, uh, not today,

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,160
but February 1st was change your password day.

70
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:01,520
-- Oh,
-- my

71
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,919
-- goodness. You, you sent me a document about that.
-- Just

72
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,169
the stupidest thing I've heard,

73
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,850
but not only that, but this person, the interview for this,

74
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,770
I'm not going to say their name because this is terrible.

75
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:17,309
Um, he basically says use a passphrase instead of,

76
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,389
uh, a password,

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,940
like one W 3 $3 sign, you know, Carrot, capital ad GF I star bracket bracket TYU.

78
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,729
Because you know that password is apparently not very secure

79
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,589
and it's hard to remember which is legitimate. And here's the secret folks

80
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,320
don't remember your passwords.

81
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,500
No, like, seriously, that's the secret II, I have

82
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,509
two passwords that. I know

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,860
one to my encrypted backups and one to my encrypted icloud

84
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:47,630
and then,

85
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,419
and my, uh, last pass, so three passwords

86
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,460
and everything else is in the last pass and an icloud.

87
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,479
-- That's it. No,
-- II, I agree.

88
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,649
I don't even make like it's, I, you know, I,

89
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,199
I don't even know my Google password because it's a

90
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,289
combination of something stored in last pass and my,

91
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,190
you know, my UB key.

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,089
right? And obviously two factor

93
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:08,919
off is obviously the best possible solution.

94
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:09,380
And in fact,

95
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,820
not just two factor off because there's something we should clarify at some point.

96
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:17,834
And I remember uh Tavis Ormandy had a, a Twitter rant about this a while ago is that

97
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,475
the U two F style keys where you put the

98
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,765
key in and have to push a button are vastly superior

99
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:27,095
to the like apps on your phone that give you a token.

100
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,635
Well, no, they're vastly superior to anything

101
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,154
they're easy to use.

102
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,915
Like I, I it's funny because I had to do like, well,

103
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:37,434
I don't want to call it user training, but, you know, we did some UBQ deployment

104
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,274
and of course people like, how do I use this? I'm like, you plug it in

105
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:43,140
and you touch it and then like, and then what? And I'm like, nope, that's it.

106
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,279
And they're like, oh, ok.

107
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,839
Right. And you know, that's, that's what this should be.

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,769
It should be simple and easy. It shouldn't be

109
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,809
although let's, let's specify as well.

110
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,299
Just for people that are like, wait, what's wrong with my phone app is

111
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,779
the issue being someone could fish, you,

112
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,839
you could type in your real password and your token into a fake site.

113
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,070
Whereas things like the U two F and then now web off

114
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,239
keys,

115
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,220
they look at the URL. And so if you're at not google.com,

116
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,820
it,

117
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,489
it won't work, right? Because it, it, the URL is kind of part of the magic. So.

118
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:22,579
Right.

119
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:27,100
And of course, uh don't use S MS ever, right. That's like

120
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,190
the agreed upon

121
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,149
two points.

122
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,790
Number one, the other aspect of phone apps is that the,

123
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,750
the seeds and the keys can be copied off your phone,

124
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,989
right? It's not like your phone has

125
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,149
some magic encrypted partition beyond like what's built into an iphone.

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,769
Like once an app can get in there, it can get to all your stuff

127
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,790
uh uh with respect to S MS in

128
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,410
principle, I agree. But the fundamental problem is

129
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:52,609
so, for example, my bank doesn't offer anything better.

130
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,260
So I can either have, I can either have a password or I can have a password and S MS.

131
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:00,899
Now, I, I'm not a big fan of S MS because yeah, hijacking SS,

132
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,609
MS is not actually as hard as it should be,

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,700
but it's, it definitely raises the bar,

134
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,750
you know, now it's got to be a targeted attack.

135
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,549
They can't just, you know, be trying random passwords.

136
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,260
They actually have to hijack my phone.

137
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,959
So I, I guess the problem is S MS will prevent you from,

138
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,089
I guess you would call it like a casual attacker or

139
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,899
a non targeted attacker,

140
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,829
but a targeted attacker will hijack your SM SS

141
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,799
because there's services out of various countries that

142
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,059
will let you do that for 10 bucks.

143
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,519
Um, and what's worse is my,

144
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,299
the other bank I deal with was using voice as your password.

145
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,630
And I'm like, that's not gonna work for me. And they're like, why not?

146
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,839
Well, because I have several 100 hours of audio recordings online. Right.

147
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,559
Right. Well, heck, man, in the, in the last episode I said what?

148
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,299
Ok, Google,

149
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:49,480
which I think is what you say to unlock android phones if I recall correctly.

150
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,130
Exactly.

151
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,519
Yeah. So

152
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,399
I'm doomed.

153
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,220
Yeah.

154
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,299
Oh, crap. My phone just did it again.

155
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,459
It was unlocked next to me and I started doing stuff and I'm like, oh, crap.

156
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,019
Yeah.

157
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,299
So here's what it really,

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,529
and we keep harping on this,

159
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,089
but maybe someday it'll start to get through is number one,

160
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:10,325
you should only have at most two or three passwords. Good.

161
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,404
And you actually have to remember.

162
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,924
And those should be to things like your password manager and you know,

163
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,404
your encrypted data storage

164
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:19,964
-- and,
-- and in that instance, a passphrase is exactly what you want.

165
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,375
I actually use a passphrase plus a password.

166
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:25,684
I, I just brute force memorized like a string of random characters,

167
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,165
it's about eight or nine characters long

168
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:31,005
that on top of the pass phrase, I figure is reasonably safe.

169
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,769
Uh, I bet just a passphrase.

170
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,209
I mean, so kind of for the audience, the reason this matters is generally speaking,

171
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,859
if a human types in a string of gibberish letters,

172
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,100
it's probably between six and eight characters long

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,489
and using things like GP US today,

174
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,160
you can crack probably most eight character

175
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,450
passwords in a reasonable amount of time.

176
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:54,829
And so the issue being if someone steals, you know, the hashes of the passwords,

177
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,890
-- they're going to totally break them
-- at RS A.

178
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,640
There was that company demoing their um they had a system with, what was it?

179
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,579
Eight Titans in it?

180
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,329
So eight Honk and huge GP US for password cracking.

181
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,519
Yeah. Yeah, there's tons of cool info in doing this.

182
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,649
And I know like uh is it solar designer

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,529
from, what is it open wall? He, he's super active in this space.

184
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,989
He wrote, what was it, John, the Ripper, I think way back in the day

185
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:18,649
and like this password cracking rigs now are, are unreal.

186
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,410
Whereas the, the point is when you have a pass phrase,

187
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:25,350
unless someone kind of knows you and is going to guess your song lyrics or something,

188
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,369
you know, make sure it's not something super obvious

189
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:31,119
cracking. A 30 character password is going to take

190
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,210
probably longer than

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,200
can be accomplished in a lifetime.

192
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,219
-- Whereas obviously short, passwords
-- are short,

193
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,080
assuming it hasn't been used by somebody else

194
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,799
and breached and it's not in the dictionaries.

195
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,619
Right.

196
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,869
And that's very true because the dictionaries dictionary

197
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,619
attacks are super simple and super common.

198
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,789
There's good news, there's a simple solution to that,

199
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,000
which is

200
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,520
amongst other things. Google has now released password checkup.

201
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,109
Uh, it's an extension for Chrome

202
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,599
that essentially checks the passwords you type in against the,

203
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,500
have I been

204
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,080
pwned? I think it's the, have I been pwned password database

205
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,590
and tells you if you're using a password that's been,

206
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,409
you know, publicly leaked and thus is easier to break.

207
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,239
And before everybody's like, oh my God, you know,

208
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,940
Google is taking all my passwords and sending them to some Rando.

209
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,760
No, what they do is they take a hash of your password

210
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,409
and then they don't even send the full hash. They send part of the hash

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,640
to the backend service and the backend service sends you like, ok, these are,

212
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:29,650
you know, the 1000 or 100 or whatever records that match that partial hash.

213
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,890
You take those hashes and then look at them and see if it matches what you just type in.

214
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,469
-- But Kurt Google's reading all my passwords now. Oh, my goodness.
-- Yeah.

215
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,770
Well, that's how your web browser works.

216
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,489
The web browser kind of has to see your password when you type it in.

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,109
But that's another big thing that I think is going to

218
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,190
have to change in the next couple of years is that

219
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,559
to put it bluntly, let's face it.

220
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,590
The majority of apps we use are through a web browser.

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,130
And so having,

222
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,570
you know,

223
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,950
and also those tend to be the sites that get compromised in your password exposed.

224
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,320
So I think it basically has to become standard that

225
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,010
things like password checkup get just become the default.

226
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,080
So every time you type in a password, you, you're going to get warned that.

227
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,969
Yeah. Uh, we've, we've seen this password, it's out there publicly.

228
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,099
You might not want to use it.

229
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,140
-- Yeah,
-- I, I agree. I think it's a great idea.

230
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,859
Now, here's the thing I keep wondering though

231
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,690
is as more and more sites are breached and Troy Hunt collects more and more passwords

232
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,789
at one point.

233
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,489
Do we just have like every possible human conceivable password in this,

234
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,150
in this backup database?

235
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,549
Right.

236
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:34,070
Well, I, I suspect we already have most of them because there's, I think his,

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
his thing is over.

238
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,109
Is it a billion or something? Now? It's, it's a lot of password.

239
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,630
Oh, it's, it's more than that.

240
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,760
It's, it's, well, it's probably tens of billions if I had to guess.

241
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:45,510
And more to the point again,

242
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,739
this is why you should use a password manager that generates

243
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,070
-- passwords.
-- Right. Nonsensical passwords.

244
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,510
And also, I mean, one thing I've run into too is a lot of sites, for example,

245
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,950
block various symbols or slashes.

246
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,690
I suspect it's in some sort of misguided effort to protect

247
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,030
their software from like SQL injection or something goofy like that.

248
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,419
Probably one nice thing about these password managers is

249
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:12,270
that most of them will not only know that.

250
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,549
Ok, this site, this field is a password. Do you want me to generate a password for it?

251
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,299
But they know about the restrictions?

252
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,500
Oh, I can't have an at symbol or I can't have forward slash

253
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,780
back slash or

254
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,380
star or carrot or

255
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:24,349
whatever.

256
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,479
So like an example being

257
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,659
I, you know, it's, if you listen to the podcast, you know, I use last pass and

258
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,070
when you tell last pass to generate a password,

259
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,429
they have like little sliders and buttons and things.

260
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,090
And if somebody says you can't use any weird characters,

261
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,030
I can untick that and then I just slide the bar up.

262
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,859
So I've got a longer password because

263
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,210
the, the hard part,

264
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:49,400
I guess when you're dealing with passwords is the concept called just entropy,

265
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:49,840
right?

266
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:53,390
Where you want more bits of randomness in your password.

267
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,739
And obviously, if you take out all the special characters,

268
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,400
you've just reduced the, the amount of complexity that password can have.

269
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,280
So obviously, you can increase complexity by making it longer.

270
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,719
And that's how we ended up with pass phrases because

271
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:09,229
humans beyond the 26 letters and some basic punctuation can't remember

272
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:10,849
anything past, you know, what is it?

273
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:14,969
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog while I was fishing the carp.

274
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,960
I know I'll make the a, the at sign. No one will guess that.

275
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,650
Yeah, Google has like a nice picture of how, under the password or, um,

276
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,469
how password checkup works under the hood and how it, you know,

277
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,690
it's not disclosing your personal data, blah, blah, blah.

278
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,150
And the other nice thing, I,

279
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,169
I haven't seen a password alert yet but it

280
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,460
says that it makes the password alerts actionable,

281
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:34,789
not just informational.

282
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,359
So I'm assuming it's prompting you to not

283
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,270
just, you know, oh, you got a bad password.

284
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,500
Feel bad about yourself, but, oh, you got a bad password.

285
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,549
I'm hoping it tells you where to go to change it

286
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,510
and what to,

287
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:45,039
you know,

288
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,929
and to help you change it to something secure and, or ideally,

289
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,969
I don't want them recommending a specific password manager,

290
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:51,919
but I think in general they should

291
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,020
be recommending password managers because we're,

292
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,070
at the point I, I have a spreadsheet with over 1000 passwords in it that

293
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,729
I've migrated all the important stuff into last pass. So,

294
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,150
you know,

295
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,469
the average person has at least dozens of

296
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,669
websites that they interact with using passwords.

297
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:05,900
And,

298
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,349
you know, everybody, I know their strategies to have two or three passwords,

299
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:12,880
you know, a high quality one for their brain and their web for their email and then a

300
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,599
lower quality one for kind of where they do all

301
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,469
their shopping and then like a third tier low,

302
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,109
low quality one for,

303
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:24,599
you know, looking at the news or whatever, stupid stuff wants to log in

304
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,909
and again, you know, humans are terrible at this.

305
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,169
This is why we have computers, folks.

306
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:29,950
Right.

307
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:32,080
And it's not like people can say, oh, but

308
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,179
I, I mean, I remember one thing back in the day is, you know,

309
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,270
not everybody actually had a computer 20 years ago.

310
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,969
Right. You had your desktop, that's it? Not like,

311
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,669
you know, actually having a laptop was kind of special.

312
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,750
Right. Going back 20 years,

313
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,650
-- I'm trying
-- to think. Did I have a laptop?

314
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:48,429
I think I did have a laptop 20 years ago and I paid an ungodly sum of money.

315
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,750
My first laptop cost four grand

316
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:51,659
and it had

317
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,219
eight megs of ra M.

318
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:54,429
Yeah, that's about right.

319
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,669
It was very expensive.

320
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,650
So, you know, now everybody should generally have a smartphone in their pocket.

321
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,109
They're not that expensive.

322
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,719
And trust me, the value you're going to get from a smartphone is, is worth it.

323
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,090
So, so that's the bad part of this newscast. But the good news is

324
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,669
Google is trying to make it better.

325
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,169
Yeah, I think it's awesome.

326
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:13,770
I,

327
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,349
I really appreciate some of these efforts and I know there's going

328
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,549
to be a lot of people who complain and whine about it.

329
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,330
But it's,

330
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,729
it's kind of one of those things, if nobody's complaining about what you're doing,

331
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,250
you're not doing anything interesting.

332
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,479
And I feel like the vast majority of the

333
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,520
security industry is so painfully stuck in the past,

334
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,159
if they're complaining about you, like,

335
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:35,570
keep going because you're probably doing the right thing.

336
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:35,989
Yeah.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm actually getting ready for death threats from my RS A presentation because what

338
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,130
we're presenting is so completely opposite to what most people are used to.

339
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,489
-- Oh,
-- whatever. Stop, you're being overly dramatic. I know what you're presenting.

340
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,770
You are going to get death threats.

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,770
Uh If I don't get death threats, I'll be disappointed.

342
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,549
-- You're going to be very disappointed. I think
-- that means we didn't go far enough.

343
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,549
-- Yeah,
-- you, you're not getting death threats, dude. It is cool though.

344
00:14:56,969 --> 00:15:00,390
You have to talk about it after, after the show. That'll be cool.

345
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,940
And then, so this is kind of awesome because I mean, I just, I love where A I is going and

346
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,280
there's a lot of common uses for a, that we would think of like, you know,

347
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,260
self driving cars.

348
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,599
A I? That makes sense.

349
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,200
But I think this is fantastic is, um, what's the company's name? Mccormick? The?

350
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,679
So they make spices.

351
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,250
They're using a I to find new flavors,

352
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:20,210
which is like

353
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,669
crazy. That's so cool.

354
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,909
I love it.

355
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,250
What, what I'm worried about though is, you know, when you go to buy paint

356
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,150
and you go to the paint aisle and you look at the swatches and the names on them

357
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,020
are just

358
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,469
what now like some of them, you know, like ivory white. Ok. It's an off white.

359
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,760
That makes sense. I get it.

360
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,539
But

361
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,630
you know, some of these like

362
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,210
colors,

363
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,539
uh

364
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,020
they have like a place name and then Bay.

365
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,419
Right. Right.

366
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,169
Well mccormick's gonna do the same thing is that

367
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,729
because by giving a color of ridiculous name,

368
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:53,919
you can totally, you know, trademark it and other things.

369
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,130
Yeah, copyright and trademark.

370
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,099
So,

371
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,969
but on the other hand, I'm looking forward to new flavors like this is fantastic.

372
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:04,299
I mean, and, and part of me is like, this is one of the few uses of A I where

373
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,090
what could go wrong? Nothing, right. I hope,

374
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,979
I don't know.

375
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,489
I until it figures out some mysterious

376
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,190
spice combination that creates vampires or something.

377
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,270
And then we're like, oh crap, what have we done?

378
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:15,869
Well?

379
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,864
It's like how we added sugar to everything to

380
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,905
make it tastier and bulk up the calories,

381
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:20,924
you know, post World War Two.

382
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,465
So people weren't starving all the time

383
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,164
and now we have an obesity epidemic.

384
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,104
So I'm wondering, you know, can it's like futurama, can you make, you know,

385
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:30,184
a spice so flavorful and tasty that people have to eat

386
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,734
-- it. The
-- essence of flavor, right? Yes. The

387
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:33,645
essence of flavor.

388
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:36,344
Which folks it was LSD so don't do that.

389
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:36,859
Oh,

390
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,369
that's such a good episode.

391
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,229
So for the people who might not know and if

392
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,729
you don't know every episode of Futurama by heart,

393
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:44,729
shame on you go watch more Futurama,

394
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:45,880
but essentially Bender,

395
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,010
the robot wants to be a chef and of course

396
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,250
he can't taste anything and he's a terrible cook.

397
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,479
Then he goes and trains with a special chef. It's a master chef that

398
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,169
the character Elza who's supposed to be Emerald. Basically.

399
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,080
Uh I forget he backs stabbed him or something. I don't remember the details.

400
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,679
Exactly. Shame on me for not knowing.

401
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,880
But then, yeah, at the end, Bender wins and then,

402
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,410
then the professor tested. He's like, it's just water. Oh, wait. And there's LSD.

403
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,270
So it was awesome. Whatever happened to Emerald. Uh, he's still around, I think.

404
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,439
I don't, he was, it's like anything, right? You become known for a thing

405
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,920
and then when that gimmick wears off, if you have, I guess nothing else to do next,

406
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,719
you just kind of get forgotten.

407
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah. Well, you're always going to be doing something new.

408
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,709
Right. Exactly. And, and I think a lot of celebrities

409
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,540
get stuck in a place where they're known for one

410
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,300
thing and it's very difficult to go to another thing.

411
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,500
I, I guess so, even on that note, thinking about this,

412
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,459
I see a lot of people who,

413
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:47,650
who kind of speak in public and actually I'm going to pick on security here again.

414
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,699
Is there are a lot of security people, these,

415
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,750
a lot of the older folks who've been around for a long

416
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,099
time now I'm old so I'm not no age as I'm here.

417
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm older than many of them.

418
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,099
Uh, they've been talking about the same freaking thing for 20 years.

419
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:01,979
-- It's like, come on guys, you know,
-- it's, it's actually worse than that.

420
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,819
Not only have they been talking about the same thing,

421
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,199
but they've come to the same conclusion and they haven't changed.

422
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,339
You know, I'll be blunt,

423
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:11,369
my view on passwords and password management has changed drastically.

424
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,329
100 and 80 degrees since I was younger.

425
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh, completely

426
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,760
my take on, you know, how do you, how do you give grandma a computer that's secure?

427
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,540
Well, the answer is simple. You get her a tablet.

428
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,670
Yep. Yep. Exactly. That's it. Like the

429
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,709
sorry folks.

430
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:28,550
But, yeah, that's, you want something that'll work reliably and be secure.

431
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,689
Well, it better be an up to date Android device or an, an I device.

432
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,770
Yep. Yep. Actually. So I, I, I'm sure I've told this story before

433
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,010
but my parents came to me some years back and said we need a new computer and I said, no,

434
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,010
you need a tablet

435
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,829
and they're like, we don't want one. We want a computer.

436
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,609
I said, all right, I tell you what,

437
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,010
uh, let's buy this cheaper computer and a tablet. All right.

438
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:49,439
And funny enough now,

439
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:51,969
the only reason they still have a computer is because their

440
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:54,670
printer is an old printer that doesn't do like cloud printing.

441
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,989
So I keep telling them, like, if you guys get a new printer,

442
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,520
you can throw that computer away.

443
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,880
They're like, oh, we like our printer.

444
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,290
You know, the ink's only like, $200 a cartridge now. It's like, oh, my

445
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,469
God,

446
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,130
freaking ink

447
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,839
jet printers.

448
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,339
Yeah. I have a really nice old laser jet that I like that.

449
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:07,609
Osco

450
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,069
-- sells the toner cartridges pretty cheaply. So I'm stuck with that for a while.
-- I

451
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,630
just got, I just got a new printer actually. So my old printer

452
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,829
was, it reached a point where the,

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,829
for a new toner it was going to cost me $500 because, like,

454
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,310
nobody was making it anymore.

455
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:26,550
And I bought some knockoff third party cartridges just to see the toner.

456
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:27,969
Yeah, they were bad.

457
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,010
They were, they, they, like, streak the pages like they sucked.

458
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,839
And so anyway, finally I'm, like, all right,

459
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:36,729
I got to bite the bullet here and I bought some, like, crazy printer that does, like,

460
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:37,750
scanning and copying.

461
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,280
It prints on both sides. It's full duplex pages.

462
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,680
-- It's only scans on one side
-- of the page. See, that's what I love about my printer.

463
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,170
It's, it's a full duplex printer.

464
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,250
Yeah, that's like the best thing ever.

465
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,089
And, and it's, it does like the internet web printy stuff. And I,

466
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,650
I don't know. II, I guess the way I see it is

467
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,390
it's just a printer basically. If, if somebody starts printing garbage to me.

468
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,579
Oh, well. Right. I'm, I'm not gonna cry.

469
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:04,640
My, my, I treat my home network as if it's the public internet already.

470
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,979
-- So I figured, uh, I'll see what this is and it's ok.
-- Well, it kind of is,

471
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,250
I mean, that's one thing, sorry, just to go on a rant.

472
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,280
But this is one thing that drives me

473
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,489
nuts is people who heavily secure their home network

474
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:18,810
but then they take their laptop to the coffee shop or whatever. Right.

475
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:21,619
So, unless you're actually also securing your laptop, well,

476
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,109
you're going to get that thing infected somewhere public at some point.

477
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:24,829
Uh, well,

478
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,989
it's even so funnier than that is how many security people keep talking about.

479
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Oh, you can't use public Wi Fi. You can't use public Wi Fi.

480
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,439
Everybody uses public Wi Fi. I don't care who you are.

481
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:38,939
I guarantee that people saying that are totally using public Wi Fi.

482
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:39,310
Well,

483
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,250
unless you go through and actually change some settings to not hop on

484
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,969
wifi and you forget all the networks that you've got in there,

485
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:48,619
you know, like, because my, if my laptop sees anything remotely labeled Starbucks,

486
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,510
it's like, oh, yeah.

487
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,329
Yeah, I'm so happy to see you. How are you, buddy? Oh, my God. It's been so long.

488
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:53,619
We haven't talked in years,

489
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,780
you know, so I'd have to, like, have it, forget all the networks

490
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,829
and, you know, not automatically join networks and I'd have to,

491
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,239
you know, I've done the thing with, um, I think it's Amazon where, you know, it,

492
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,550
my Amazon devices.

493
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,239
Remember the Wi Fi passwords. Because,

494
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,000
and I don't know how this works but it's magic.

495
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,219
It's just the devices somehow set themselves up mostly.

496
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:14,890
Right.

497
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,479
Which I don't fully understand how,

498
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,040
because how does it set itself up and get on

499
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,030
the internet if it's not already on the internet?

500
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,439
So,

501
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,790
I, I don't know, it's black magic as far as I'm concerned. Whatever. I don't care.

502
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,060
All I know is my fire sticks.

503
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:29,699
I, I plug them into a TV and it says hi. Are you current? And I go, yep. And that's it.

504
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,380
That's the setup. I'm like,

505
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:31,939
uh,

506
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,660
my head doesn't understand this but whatever.

507
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,170
Well, and speaking of that.

508
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,150
So the dod, uh, the department of defense actually released a really good, uh,

509
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,199
short paper.

510
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,020
It's marked unclassified.

511
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,989
It's their cloud strategy.

512
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,650
And what I love is is they specifically go over

513
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,790
not just the stuff you'd expect, like, oh,

514
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,089
we gotta find cloud providers that are secure and blah, blah, blah,

515
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,400
but they talk about

516
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,930
getting infrastructure ready for the cloud,

517
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,250
right? Because when you think about it, like they have systems

518
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,050
that are still running on floppy

519
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,810
disk and by floppy

520
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,750
disc, I don't mean those cute little 3.5 ones.

521
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,729
You know, there was that article about what was it, the, the nuclear launch, uh,

522
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,469
systems running on eight inch floppy

523
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,969
-- disk or whatever,
-- which is, I'm kind of ok with that one. But,

524
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,489
so do

525
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,250
you,

526
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,089
you sent this paper to me like two minutes

527
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,349
before we started recording and I've not read it.

528
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,890
It's 18 pages uh sum this up you're talking about.

529
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,869
So the dod releases a document and it's about

530
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,890
well embracing the cloud for everything except for administrative work.

531
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:34,349
So like the really sensitive stuff

532
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,520
and, you know, it's a lot of different reasons,

533
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,050
cost uh agility being able to grow and shrink, right?

534
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,359
Because

535
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,349
uh well, for example, you know,

536
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,640
all of a sudden you need a whole bunch

537
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,170
of resourcing to support a mission in Afghanistan.

538
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,430
Well, now we're done with that,

539
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,209
you know, like the dod is not going to go build data centers in the middle of a war zone.

540
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,040
I

541
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,420
think

542
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,150
not,

543
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:55,890
you know,

544
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,790
I imagine that would be quite expensive and the cloud might be a better option.

545
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:00,339
But what I'm really impressed with is they

546
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,630
sort of embrace and lean into their challenges,

547
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,189
which are, you know,

548
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:07,189
we get that we have a whole bunch of old it that just is not suited for the cloud

549
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:11,910
and that has to be dealt with in some way, you know, we need to make our data

550
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,109
sort of more cloud smart.

551
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,030
So talking about, you know, what, what

552
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,550
when you have big piles of data,

553
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:20,859
how

554
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,859
do you manage that data in a cloud sense?

555
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,680
It's very different when you have all your data and processing in one location

556
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,979
and say a 10 gigabit network to t all together.

557
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,010
But you know, when you're talking with cloud providers,

558
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,150
you might want to move stuff around the world quickly.

559
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,949
And so it's honestly, I would recommend

560
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,189
any, if you work for a large organization, you should probably read this because

561
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:43,030
there's definitely some parallels for all of us

562
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,030
from what we can learn from their pain.

563
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,119
That's wild man. And

564
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,150
you know what my feeling is here is

565
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,089
if, if the the dod

566
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,819
is embracing cloud like they are,

567
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:57,810
I I said before

568
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,650
it's over cloud one

569
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,500
and I think at this point, if you're a naysayer, you're complaining about the cars

570
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,939
on the freeway. Right? It's, we're way past the point of cars versus horses even.

571
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:09,479
It's just

572
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:11,050
cloud one.

573
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:14,199
There's nothing you can do about it like it or not, it is what it is.

574
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,319
Well, and they specifically talk about

575
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:20,739
two, not just cloud but that it's cloud cloud, not on premises cloud but like

576
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,050
the big cloud, not your

577
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,319
little,

578
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,359
you know, couple of racks running open stack or whatever.

579
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,400
Nothing wrong with open stack. But let's face it, folks.

580
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,449
You know, Google can scale up a lot faster and cheaper than you can.

581
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,939
Yeah. Right. Exactly. I get it.

582
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:39,410
And I guess at the same time though, it just, it's a new paradigm. It's

583
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,050
the way I keep thinking about this and I keep talking to people because there's,

584
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,939
there's always some weird conversations around.

585
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,680
Is it, you know, tell me about the security of this. How does it work? It's

586
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:48,729
it's kind of like

587
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,359
if you

588
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,719
think about security in the old way

589
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,849
in a new environment, of course, it's not going to work. And this is true of anything.

590
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:57,140
Right.

591
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,349
I mean, if you try to apply security concepts from, let's say, the 19 twenties to say,

592
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,979
-- say, like, physical security,
-- dude, having a perimeter firewall, uh,

593
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:10,489
except we have, you know, thousands of IP S and locations.

594
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,400
-- Right. Right. Exactly.
-- Good luck. Yeah.

595
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,640
Oh, and all those locations have Wi Fi,

596
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,310
but people are attaching.

597
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,410
-- God knows what
-- to and,

598
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,369
and their cell phones are connected to them and

599
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,089
their cell phones are connected to the cellular network.

600
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,569
Right.

601
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,810
-- You know,
-- so, well,

602
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,209
it's like all those banks that have been hacked

603
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,449
by people physically attaching stuff to their networks.

604
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:27,930
And I'm like,

605
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,000
if you get hacked because somebody physically attaches something to your network,

606
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,489
you're doomed.

607
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,729
Your network sucks.

608
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:38,969
You can get a full proper computer. Now, the size of a pack of gum for like 20 bucks.

609
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,170
Uh, they're less than that, man. They're so freaking cheap. It's not even funny.

610
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,859
And so how are you going to physically secure a network when

611
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:48,310
I can basically cut a cable and jam a device in line?

612
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,310
Right. Well, and, and did you see that

613
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,020
there's a new story now about some

614
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,599
Bluetooth devices that only use like ambient wireless

615
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,130
power,

616
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:58,839
like with,

617
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,290
with stuff like that?

618
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,030
You're doomed. There's, you can't win.

619
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,239
Well, and then SpaceX

620
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,630
is going to throw up their gigabit wireless magic satellite network.

621
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:09,239
Right?

622
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,630
And so all of a sudden there's no way you can

623
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,969
prevent data exfiltration even if you completely control your network.

624
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,469
And that's ignoring, of course,

625
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:19,290
Wi Fi locally and somebody parked out in the parking lot sucking down the data,

626
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,400
you know, like, what is it,

627
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,400
all those um uh ATM and gas station skimmers now that are Bluetooth.

628
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:28,060
So the bad guys literally just have to go gas up and they have a laptop running

629
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:30,400
in the car that connects all the Bluetooth skimmers

630
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,069
and gets all the data and that's it.

631
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,040
They don't even have to

632
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,030
open anything up or, you know, get out of their car.

633
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,250
That's right.

634
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:37,780
So

635
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:41,250
fundamentally, I look at all networks including my own network.

636
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,680
I actually specifically now I flattened my network.

637
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,439
I bought a bunch of Google Wi Fi devices

638
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,959
and I just have one flat network with everything attached to it.

639
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,050
And I assume that the network has goner

640
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,839
and syphilis floating around on it

641
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,849
-- and it does
-- and, and all my devices are set up to, you know,

642
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:59,369
be as secure as they can be themselves.

643
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,000
Right? Actually, so I've got, you'll appreciate this.

644
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,520
So I still have a guest network and the only reason I do it

645
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,699
is because I have like a comically bad password for guests to use.

646
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,189
And I tell it to them and they look at me and they said is that really the password.

647
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:11,869
And I said, yeah.

648
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,550
And they said that's the worst password in the world. And I said, yeah.

649
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,469
And they say

650
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:18,060
what, like, what's wrong with you? You're a security guy

651
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,670
who cares? Like, this is

652
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,339
the only reason I have a password at all is just like to

653
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,800
keep the homeless people from hanging out in the yard or something.

654
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,979
Right. Like, I don't care. You

655
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,569
-- can drive into my, my, my driveway and use my Wi Fi like I don't care.
-- Yeah.

656
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,229
And all those classic arguments of, you know,

657
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,069
what if somebody sucks down the intern?

658
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,869
Well, yeah, an extra 15 bucks a month for unlimited internet.

659
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,969
-- I,
-- I, I don't have a cap and in fact, I use an obscene amount of data.

660
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,530
Iii I read a news story the other day that said

661
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,560
like only 4% of internet users use one terabyte or more of data per month.

662
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,849
And I thought that seems low.

663
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:56,079
And I looked and I had like 1.5 terabytes already and it was like the 20th of the month.

664
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,010
Well, I'm special.

665
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,569
But you know, the thing I noticed is when I watch four K video, for example,

666
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:05,770
the amount of data I'm sucking down during that is insane.

667
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,709
-- 04 K is bonkers. It is,
-- it is ridiculous without question.

668
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,050
And at the same time, the really funny thing is I, I honestly couldn't care less.

669
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,040
They could show it to me in like SD quality and whatever.

670
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm not like, I'm not one of those people that really, really minds.

671
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,900
-- Either way
-- you got 40 year old eyes, they're not going to notice the difference.

672
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,119
-- Yeah.
-- Exactly. Exactly. Maybe if I was young I'd care. But I'm an old man, whatever.

673
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,989
It doesn't matter.

674
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:28,800
So,

675
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,140
but, but at the same time it's like, uh, the cable company is not yelling

676
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,089
me. I don't care. I'll just keep using that data.

677
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,969
Yeah. So, no, the whole thing is just, it's,

678
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,810
the world has changed and more to the point.

679
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:40,930
I, I actually checked the other day,

680
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:44,569
I think I had seven computers on my desk and the majority of them were tablets,

681
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,630
phones or other little flat devices.

682
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,089
And I realized there's really nothing I can do to secure them because,

683
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,290
and there's nothing I really have to do to secure them.

684
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,290
-- Yeah. Exactly.
-- Right. They're, they're generally quite secure by default.

685
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,790
Uh, well, maybe whatever. It probably doesn't matter.

686
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,680
Well, the I devices, the fire, the fire tablets, I mean,

687
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:04,510
it's not like they're running,

688
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,880
here's the thing like a fire tablet or an Android tablet.

689
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,540
What, what is it running that you can attack?

690
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,160
It's not like it's running a network service,

691
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,410
uh, not remotely.

692
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,119
I scan them very fishy or, or hit websites because for example,

693
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,130
a lot of android devices are comically out of date.

694
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,140
And so if you can get them to visit a certain URL or something

695
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,229
you can definitely cause some problems.

696
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:30,489
I probably, I don't surf the web like a normal person. I mostly stick to a few new sites

697
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,060
-- and that's fair. The web on a tablet is a nightmare because of just all the
-- garbage.

698
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,660
The ads,

699
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,430
the ad, well, you know,

700
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,550
so for the ads I use Firefox and you can install an ad blocker and Firefox on my tablet,

701
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,310
which is fine.

702
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,229
But, no, I mean, I agree. I, I often don't go to many interesting places.

703
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:49,510
I think Reddit is the most exciting place I go to

704
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,300
which anyway,

705
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,209
edits its own set of problems. All right, man. Uh

706
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,699
We're about out of time here. You got any closing thoughts?

707
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:56,199
Yeah.

708
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:57,219
II, I just,

709
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm curious to see what other crazy things people will come up with to use A I for

710
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,140
like new colors, maybe new, new,

711
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,160
I don't know. Right.

712
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:07,709
If I knew I'd be rich.

713
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:09,119
Uh Maybe,

714
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,000
maybe

715
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:14,640
anyway. Awesome. Yeah, I can't wait. I can't wait for my A I powered spice rack.

716
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,880
It'll be fantastic.

717
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,079
