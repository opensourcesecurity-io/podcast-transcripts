Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,520
-- with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime. Josh Pressers.
-- Just crime.

2
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,649
Not thought crime anymore.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
Yeah, I'm tired of thinking about crime. We're doing it.

4
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:18,129
That's fair.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,819
So my smashed thumb saga continues. It took

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,280
an unexpected twist. So I'm building

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:26,590
that.

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,620
No, I didn't. I actually haven't smashed it. I actually, ok, so

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,130
we recorded the podcast and I talked about smashing my

10
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:35,220
thumb and then I smashed it that night again,

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,189
which was

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,040
in the same way.

13
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,430
Like I think I smashed it on the, like the frame of the workbench at a place.

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,619
I couldn't really see it while I was like, wrenching the clamp but whatever,

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,130
whatever.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,939
So then

17
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:48,319
-- like
-- one of those, your hands in an awkward dark spot.

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,470
Yeah, I think, I don't know for sure though,

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,720
-- but it still hurts. But anyway,
-- ok.

20
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,939
Have you heard the word proprioception?

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,459
I have no idea what that means.

22
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:57,340
It's the,

23
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,590
it's one of the senses your body has and it essentially

24
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:02,470
is the sense of knowing where your body parts are.

25
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,950
Ok?

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,739
So, like you don't walk into door frames and stuff,

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,660
do you I'm just beginning to wonder maybe if this is your issue,

28
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,319
you just don't know where your hand or thumb is.

29
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:15,949
-- I generally have never had this problem.
-- Can you close your eyes and touch your nose?

30
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,040
Ok.

31
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,160
I, I don't think, I don't know. I don't know.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,959
Anyway, anyway, I smashed it again, which really hurt and it bled like everywhere.

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,029
It was terrible. But then, but then, so I get my blanket rack built.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
And for those of you who don't know,

35
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,029
this is in reference to something from the last episode,

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,040
uh, I, I get my blanket rack built and I'm, I start staining it

37
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:37,980
and, uh,

38
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,059
I forgot to open the window in the, in the garage.

39
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,040
I was like high as a kite when I figured it out,

40
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,010
man.

41
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:46,760
Holy

42
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,440
cow.

43
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:48,919
I

44
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,639
like two houses ago. We refinished the wood floors

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,349
and so I cranked up the vent, the furnace and everything, like opened up the windows.

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,620
I could, but, you know, it was anyways and I slept there overnight and wow,

47
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,699
don't do that. Oh, man. Yeah,

48
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,199
I

49
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,199
-- don't, yeah, folks, solvents are real. Don't,
-- don't do that.

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,259
So, anyway, and, and I guess, thank goodness I've actually been in this,

51
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,750
I did a similar thing, refinishing floors where I figured out what was going on,

52
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,919
like years and years ago.

53
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,800
So as soon as like everything started buzzing and, and the world was getting hazy,

54
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:25,610
I'm like, oh, crap.

55
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:28,410
I didn't open the window. Like I knew exactly what was happening immediately.

56
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,550
-- But it was like,
-- well,

57
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,729
it reminds me of that really scary story on Reddit where this guy is like, is my,

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,539
is my landlord pranking me or something?

59
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,070
There's this guy leaving weird notes and it turns

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
out he had like a carbon monoxide leak.

61
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,589
Oh,

62
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,699
interesting.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,009
I

64
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:41,800
remember that's

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,830
don't,

66
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,429
don't only change the batteries in your fire alarms

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,210
every whatever day of the year it is.

68
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,470
Make sure you have a working carbon monoxide detector.

69
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:52,429
Seriously. Actually, it was really funny when I got,

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,059
when I got my,

71
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,770
I thought

72
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,020
I own an old house.

73
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,229
I had to get it rewired when I bought it and I

74
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,539
had them install like the magic smoke alarms that are all networked together

75
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:07,419
and I have way more carbon monoxide detectors that are, are, are legally required.

76
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:10,660
And the electrician said, you know, you don't need these. I'm like, yeah, I do.

77
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:11,649
You're putting them in

78
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,770
because

79
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,539
I'm why not? Right. Like, yes, it's, I've maybe spent 100 extra bucks.

80
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,320
-- They are expensive but they're not that expensive.
-- It's better than dead. I mean,

81
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:27,160
-- yeah. 00, yeah, absolutely.
-- So, actually I'll put a link in the show notes.

82
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,169
A guy I really like,

83
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:32,160
called C GP Gray and he makes youtube videos and his videos are phenomenal and he,

84
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:35,580
he kind of did a video about like the pandemic and everything and,

85
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,210
and shutting down and what that means.

86
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,419
And he had a really interesting way.

87
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,067
Think about it where basically

88
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,386
if you kind of rank the, the

89
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:47,386
pros and cons of things like dead is minus infinity. Right. So,

90
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,507
and I never really thought of it that way. But, like, that's totally true.

91
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:54,246
Like, yes, carbon monoxide detectors are more expensive than smoke alarms.

92
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:57,516
But being dead is the worst of all. So,

93
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:58,257
I mean,

94
00:03:58,826 --> 00:03:58,917
it,

95
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,307
yeah. Right. Exactly. So, anyway, anyway, all right, we should.

96
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,016
I, I don't know if I'd say we're going to get happier but

97
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:08,233
want us to talk about, well, we're going to start our conversation.

98
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,703
Well, it's a similar thing.

99
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:12,233
Right, because we've, we're now seeing,

100
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,194
we have to tell people what we're talking about first.

101
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:17,334
All these parts of the it industry,

102
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:21,363
it's like they spend time and effort ignoring the lessons of the past.

103
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,553
Yeah, I think that's part of it and

104
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,334
there's no way to put it nicely.

105
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:26,834
I mean,

106
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:29,644
so the term I did a lot of thinking about this and I

107
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,373
wrote a blog post which I'll put a link in the show.

108
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:31,604
That's all.

109
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,040
So, which we're going to recycle a bunch of the content. So I won't bore you with it.

110
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,800
But I, I'm, I'm calling it security signaling

111
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:42,360
where there's all this stuff people do or don't do that. It's kind of like

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,520
if you read between the lines,

113
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,401
you can actually tell a great deal about what's happening.

114
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,040
This is exactly why, like 10 years ago,

115
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,790
when I became the uh it admin for the cloud screen lines,

116
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:57,020
why I forced all of our web properties onto

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,321
HTTP S

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,401
and

119
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,070
also started doing the HSTS headers and most importantly, the HSTS whitelist.

120
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,660
So like it is actually hard coded in your browser though,

121
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,820
when you go to cre.org or the clouds security lines.org,

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,010
you have to go to HTTP S your browser will not

123
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,209
allow you to go to HTTP like it will change it.

124
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,359
And that was not normal when you did that. I mean, it's perfectly normal now.

125
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:21,799
-- Well, I
-- mean,

126
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,279
remember those articles from like the BBC or

127
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,649
from these other major sites where they like,

128
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,160
you know, we've,

129
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,480
we've done this transition to HTTP S and it took us a year and here's what we learned,

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:29,959
you know,

131
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,179
because they had like tons of content and assets

132
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,040
from third parties and ad networks and mixed content and

133
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,390
just, you know, it was a nontrivial thing for major sites to do.

134
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,559
And, and of course, yeah. Now it's generally, I would say 95%

135
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,359
because for one simple reason,

136
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:48,179
-- Google search engine optimization,
-- I bet it's higher than 95%. Even now.

137
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,019
-- There's still a ton of old sites.
-- The web browsers will mark a site as insecure.

138
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,750
-- Now, if it's only using HTTP
-- oh, and they scream when you fill out a form as

139
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,779
they should,

140
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,980
right. I Yeah, absolutely.

141
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,750
So, it's interesting to me to see Well, you know,

142
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,899
Slack being sort of the current you tell the Slack story.

143
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,100
OK. So

144
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:07,899
I would,

145
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,463
I would say the story is indirect where basically what

146
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,822
happened was Slack has a public bug bounty which is

147
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,403
a marvelous signal, right? Very good.

148
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:18,173
Excellent.

149
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,972
They want to play nice with the community and they probably won't sue them.

150
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,053
But then

151
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:27,803
there was an R ce remote code execution flaw reported in the Slack desktop client.

152
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:31,692
And now this flaw needed some human interaction.

153
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,895
Not well, but it needed normal human interaction

154
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,696
in the sense of like no offense,

155
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:41,716
but somebody posts a document into the channel and I click on it to look at it, right.

156
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,105
Which I which I always do. Right.

157
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,976
That's like, that's like blaming people for clicking on links and email.

158
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,605
-- Yes,
-- I agree.

159
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,286
-- What else do you do with the links in email?
-- Yeah, absolutely.

160
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:52,906
This is a really good point and this is a topic maybe for another day.

161
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,265
But anyway, OK, so basically remote code execution,

162
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,799
somebody reports it via their bug bounty.

163
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,559
And then we say it wasn't handled particularly well.

164
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,089
-- I would say if
-- you read it,

165
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,019
they were talking about holding off on all of their disclosures until August.

166
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,260
I

167
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,609
suspect maybe it had to do something with their

168
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,760
-- uh their IP O or something.
-- I don't know. And it doesn't matter.

169
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,600
But then

170
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:26,130
the worst part of this though I think is the bounty they gave out was $1750.

171
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,579
-- That's a joke for
-- an R ce,

172
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,320
well, an R ce in an application used by

173
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,350
tens of millions of people for, to put a bluntly real work.

174
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:39,170
-- No,
-- let's not even call it that, let's call it. It is critical infrastructure today.

175
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,609
That's what we need to call it.

176
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,799
That is an embarrassingly low number.

177
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,410
And that sends a, we'll say

178
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,970
opposite signal

179
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:49,410
about a bug bounty.

180
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,160
Yes.

181
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,459
And so what I,

182
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,070
what I did actually is I started to write this blog post where I was basically just

183
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,540
looking to kind of poke them in the eye a little bit over their terrible bug bounty.

184
00:07:58,809 --> 00:07:59,399
And

185
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,089
what I ended up finding out was if you

186
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,709
actually look at slack and how they're approaching security,

187
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,079
it becomes very clear that their legal and marketing

188
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,640
departments are actually running their external security presence,

189
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,510
which I think is a,

190
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,880
I won't say it's good.

191
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,690
That's how I would classify it.

192
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,480
Well, it, it's actually in some ways, I think marketing and legal should

193
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,720
be the ones to sort of run it,

194
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,929
but they should be running it in a

195
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,410
mature way and they should understand what they're doing

196
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,959
and to put it bluntly, they clearly don't understand

197
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,000
because like under 2000 bucks for remote code execution

198
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,229
in a piece of software used by tens of millions of people is a joke.

199
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,597
I mean, the black market would happily pay more for that.

200
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,268
And even the legal market, you know,

201
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,679
third party like companies that buy vulnerabilities to using their, you know,

202
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,359
pen testing products or part of their, their bug, you know,

203
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:53,778
hunting products would cheerfully pay a lot more than $2000.

204
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:54,768
I agree with that.

205
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,619
Now, I'm, I'm going to take issue with what you said though. I don't think

206
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:00,898
legal and marketing

207
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:06,645
should be running your external security presence. And the reason for that is

208
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,825
exactly what I would say.

209
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:13,655
The Slack website conveys if you go to their security landing page,

210
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,434
it's just like full of white papers.

211
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,635
I don't. What is that for?

212
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,705
And then eventually I found a page that there,

213
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,984
in fact even claimed to be part of the legal team where

214
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,664
it was kind of explaining how they take my privacy very seriously.

215
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,940
And then there was eventually a link to the bug body,

216
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,580
but it was very legalese like it wasn't approachable and it didn't give me the,

217
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,130
it made me feel like

218
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,299
if I tried to contact you,

219
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,099
I think the problem is you're thinking of Slack as a piece of software.

220
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:41,260
Slack thinks of itself as a service.

221
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,789
No, no, I think it's a, it's a service. Everything is a service.

222
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,859
Now, I view the world as a service.

223
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,280
Well, but in the sense of this is a very, I'm just looking at the security page.

224
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,700
This is a very service oriented security page talking about their, you know, their

225
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,719
iso their sock three, their

226
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,760
all that stuff, you know, HIPAA compliance and all that.

227
00:09:59,119 --> 00:09:59,919
Right. Most,

228
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:00,900
you know, they're

229
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:01,830
fine.

230
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:02,669
That's fine.

231
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,960
But then they have a bunch of white paper links and they have no links to contact us,

232
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,320
no links to

233
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,280
like what's up with our security. It's, it is clearly a marketing page.

234
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:17,590
Yeah, there's no way to report or link to report or even a hint.

235
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:21,539
And now if you search for the site,

236
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:21,830
Colin

237
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,109
slack.com, search for security advisory and you should get a link to a legal page.

238
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,719
-- It even has legal in the title. Yeah, slack
-- dot com slash report vulnerability says

239
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,919
if you believe you found a security vulnerability, some hacker one,

240
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,000
it reads like a lawyer wrote it.

241
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,520
Well, but it's just short and to the point,

242
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,270
if you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Slack,

243
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,349
please let us know right away.

244
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,119
Well, yeah, we

245
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,530
will investigate all reports and do our best to quickly fix valid issues.

246
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,109
You can submit your report on hacker one and our security team

247
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,989
will respond as soon as possible to find out more on Slack.

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,159
-- Security visit our security information page, which we did and was
-- right.

249
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:59,099
-- And it's terrible
-- for other security questions or issues, please. Email feedback.

250
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,309
Oh,

251
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:01,919
-- not security at Slack.
-- Right.

252
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:02,859
Exactly.

253
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,849
It feels like a lawyer wrote it.

254
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:08,229
-- So that just goes into the general ticket system and disappears.
-- Probably.

255
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,940
I don't want,

256
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,989
I don't want to dwell on slack too much and kind of throw them under the bus because

257
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,479
unfortunately I suspect they're still better than most.

258
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,190
Well, here's an interesting note, it says on their hacker,

259
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,510
one page reports resolved 1079 average bounty, 500 bucks, 500 bucks is a very

260
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,109
low bounty. Like to put it bluntly.

261
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:33,219
That's not, that's basically maybe 4 to 5 hours of a professional's rate

262
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,710
if that, I mean, but so here's, here's what the signal I, I see in that is,

263
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,619
is so when you have a low bounty,

264
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,580
there's, I think two sides to this, there's either our stuff is so bad,

265
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,219
we're not going to raise the bounty because we're gonna go broke paying it.

266
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:46,539
I mean,

267
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:50,059
or in fact, so like I, I help run a bug bounty

268
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,219
and we had an in

269
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,280
where we actually needed to decrease the reports for a variety of staffing reasons.

270
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,380
And I'm like, let's just lower the bounty, right.

271
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,219
We lowered the bounty, the reports went away. Who knew?

272
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,219
I'm assuming it was more, the low quality reports went away.

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,830
All reports, all reports were way down when we lowered the bounty amounts.

274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,179
And then of course, like we, we dealt with what we needed to deal with,

275
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,880
brought everything back up and hey, it all went back to normal.

276
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,929
Like, so like these bounty amounts totally reflect

277
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,739
-- the way you
-- get.

278
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,780
They're paying out bounties that are still

279
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,280
cheaper than hiring a single person because

280
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,580
it says here they paid out 42 grand in the last 90 days.

281
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,190
So you multiply by four, that's 100 and 60 grand a year.

282
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:25,859
That's

283
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,200
less than one

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,640
info.

285
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:33,979
Now, now here's ok. So there's the worst. So our, our, our stuff is so bad.

286
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,700
We just don't want to pay because we're going to go broke or

287
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,659
there's the, we couldn't get funding for this.

288
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:41,299
So

289
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,380
our bounties are low, which has two purposes.

290
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,580
One is you just don't want to pay a lot of money.

291
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,669
And the second is it artificially depresses

292
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,260
the number of reports you get.

293
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,820
So what ends up happening is there are security

294
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,659
researchers who will look at things even for free.

295
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,520
Microsoft used to not pay bounties and they got a ton of reports. Good stuff too.

296
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,099
Same with Red Hat. Red Hat.

297
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:06,299
As far as I know is never, and probably never will pay a bounty.

298
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:10,090
I don't know if that has changed, but I know when we were there.

299
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,299
-- That was definitely,
-- well, my understanding is the majority of the open source.

300
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,929
Like the older open source world doesn't pay bug bounties because it, well,

301
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,450
that's ok.

302
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,030
It works.

303
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:18,969
Right.

304
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:21,869
Yeah, because, like, the Apache Foundation actually, as part of my research,

305
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,210
I was like, I wonder if the Apache Foundation has a bug bounty?

306
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,179
And they're quite clear, I would assume they pay zero. They don't have a bug bounty.

307
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,200
They were quite clear about it. Like, we don't have a bug bounty.

308
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,619
Here's where you report bugs. Yeah.

309
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,109
-- But they have security at apache.org, which is responsive. Right.
-- Right.

310
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,539
And, and, but, and, right, they still get bugs.

311
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,840
They're going to get information and so kind of the way, the way I see this.

312
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:40,789
And this is also,

313
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,239
I know some researchers,

314
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,390
I understand kind of their mindset here and if

315
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,390
they find a bug they're going to report it.

316
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,599
If there's a bug bunny, great. That's gravy.

317
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,659
But then there's also people that

318
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,940
if you have a real bug bounty and you pay real money,

319
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,739
they will invest real time into looking at your stuff.

320
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,500
-- Because
-- economically, at that point, the incentives are such that it can be a job.

321
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,299
The payout is reliable enough and high enough then I can

322
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,140
reasonably expect

323
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,869
because here's the blunt truth,

324
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,309
you know, all the good security researchers,

325
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,390
we know if you point them on a piece of software or the website,

326
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,789
they'll find a flaw pretty much.

327
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,049
It's not if it's just like, how long, you know,

328
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,030
how many days or weeks do they spend grinding on it?

329
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,979
If you have a payoff,

330
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:24,070
a payout that's high enough and reasonably guaranteed of happening.

331
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,200
Because, you know, there are bug bounty companies that are like, oh ha ha.

332
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,390
No, we, we don't believe that's a flaw, but, you know, we're going to fix it anyways

333
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,440
and we're not going to pay you. Right. Well, yeah.

334
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,200
Those researchers don't want to deal with those

335
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,299
people because they want to get paid.

336
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,640
Yeah, I'm just looking at this and, I mean, yeah, 1500 bucks for, you know,

337
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,469
critical flaws

338
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,210
privilege escalation affecting all teams. Yeah, 1500 bucks.

339
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,559
-- Like, that's, that's not a lot of money
-- and, and to give you an idea,

340
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,289
I think Twitter is 40 grand and I think Mozilla is 20 grand for criticals and,

341
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,239
like Microsoft has hundreds of thousands if

342
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,679
you can defeat like their virtualization technology.

343
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,549
So there are some sub

344
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,989
substantial payouts that people have in this space.

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,450
So, but anyway, I don't want to just go on and on about bug bunnies.

346
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,010
I think we could do a whole another show just about bug bunnies if we want to.

347
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,869
We probably find someone smarter than us to talk to.

348
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,400
But, but the signaling,

349
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,909
I think the signaling is the important part of this conversation

350
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,239
of Slack has like one step forward and two steps back.

351
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,690
The other thing is like you pointed out in your article, they have one CV,

352
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,059
-- which
-- blew my mind

353
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,070
like they've definitely,

354
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,750
I hope fixed more than one security flaw or

355
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,070
maybe they haven't.

356
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,590
I mean, what's amusing to me is there's a bunch of CV S for Slack plugins,

357
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,640
-- but those aren't owned by Slack.
-- The ecosystem is doing

358
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:40,119
like,

359
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,400
or Jenkins Slack notification plug in has three or

360
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,280
four CV S so they're doing a decent job

361
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,070
-- and I'll be blunt, if Slack wants to get CV S that would not be a problem.
-- Or,

362
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,390
or, or so, part of, part of this argument, I think as well is so

363
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,460
I can forgive an organization that doesn't want to

364
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:00,140
deal with Miter to get Cve because it is,

365
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,830
they've historically been very difficult and I would

366
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,940
say they've upgraded to just mostly difficult.

367
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,960
-- I would
-- say it's not so much miter. The problem is CVE was born before 2000.

368
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,530
I'm blaming

369
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:11,080
mier though.

370
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,659
So,

371
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,580
but change is difficult because part of the problem is there's a lot

372
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,739
-- of organizations that like cve the way it is
-- and that's probably fair.

373
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,619
And I bet half of them are on the board. So,

374
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:23,719
but anyway, anyway,

375
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,440
we're not, we're not going to spend this podcast ring on CV,

376
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,590
either we can do that another time.

377
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,679
But the point being so

378
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,760
like you should have some sort of security messaging even if you're a service.

379
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,229
And obviously in Slack's case, they have the service, but they,

380
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,460
they push hard into their apps.

381
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,655
I'm looking at, I finally found their change luck, which was not easy.

382
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:50,715
It's buried as an article slash 1, 1 5 0 0 4 8 4 6 0 6 8 dash blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

383
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,474
and the word secure and security occur in it.

384
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:58,335
But so far never as like we fixed a security flaw.

385
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:00,104
It's like we added a layer of security or we

386
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,354
added a plug in that uses this security feature,

387
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,814
but there's nothing like we fix this security flaw.

388
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:05,290
Yeah.

389
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,329
And I, I bet they don't, they don't announce it publicly and, and I feel like,

390
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,250
so this is again,

391
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,540
that whole signaling discussion of there are,

392
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,368
I, it's critical infrastructure.

393
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,868
There are companies running your software that are running outdated versions.

394
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,170
They don't know, they're running outdated versions and so they're,

395
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,209
they're assuming a certain level of risk that they

396
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,776
even know about this is completely blind.

397
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,936
So there is the one argument I've seen from some major

398
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,656
companies now that like we don't need to do CV,

399
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,656
because our software auto updates and it forces

400
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,745
you to update and that is somewhat true.

401
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,265
But here's the problem,

402
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,796
-- I would like to be able to make an informed choice
-- or I

403
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:45,745
think the important thing is so any time you have a fleet of users

404
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,406
and a fleet, I'm going to

405
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:51,261
is more than 10, there's going to be reasons things don't update. So,

406
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:54,661
I mean, one of the stories I always like to tell is I was, this was,

407
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:57,222
this was back when Microsoft and Red Hat hated each other.

408
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:59,822
I was at Red Hat and I went out for dinner with some Microsoft people

409
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:03,942
one time and we were just talking about like security updates and all this stuff.

410
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:08,612
And this guy, one of their people said something that is like, it haunts me of

411
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,760
on the, on patch Tuesday.

412
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,410
Actually, I don't think they might, they might not have had patch Tuesday back then.

413
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,619
It was so long ago, but basically when they released security updates, they would,

414
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,420
they had a dashboard showing what happened.

415
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,469
And he said generally speaking, 10% of Windows users,

416
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,189
the update wouldn't install for, who knows what?

417
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:28,329
Right, 10% that was like literally tens of millions of computers.

418
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:33,069
And so part of part of managing a fleet of users is you have to be able to say, ok,

419
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:36,900
who has, who has updated Slack, who hasn't updated Slack?

420
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:37,689
And

421
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,449
how, how much should we care?

422
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,229
Because if, if you have no security insight into what, what's in an update,

423
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:46,089
maybe it was a critical fix, maybe it wasn't, right.

424
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,140
That is incredibly important.

425
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:48,750
I agree.

426
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,969
And I'm just looking at it and it,

427
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:53,410
it Slack will show me what version of Slack I've installed

428
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:56,890
but it doesn't have like a check for updates button that I can find.

429
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,770
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so anyway, this is, but this is a problem, I think across

430
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,449
the, the consumer ecosystem and the business ecosystem.

431
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,660
-- Oh,
-- I've had, I've had on my Mac, I've had Mac

432
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,449
updates fail and that should like, never happen because I'm running,

433
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,380
it's not like I'm running some strange hardware combination.

434
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm like running on a Mac. I bought from the Apple store. I mean, it happens, man.

435
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah. Like literally where I've had it like where it fails to install the update.

436
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,280
So I'm like, ok,

437
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,319
I turn it all the way off, leave it off for 10 seconds, turn it all the way on and, like,

438
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,270
reinstall the update and it works and most

439
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,859
users aren't going to bother doing that because,

440
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,760
like, I mean, I know when we did a, we did a bit of an audit of, like,

441
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,760
making sure everybody's computers up to date and, like, yeah,

442
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,660
some people's computers weren't because,

443
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,479
like, they had

444
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:40,189
to, and they didn't want to do the whole install an Os update and run the risk of stuff.

445
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:40,949
Getting screwed up.

446
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:47,239
My, I just bought my wife a new Macbook, a Macbook air and then we did, like, the, like,

447
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,369
let's move some computers around and shovel them

448
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,270
and the old Macbook that the kids were using

449
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,609
it was, it was a 2012 Macbook. The things, like, still supported.

450
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:57,949
I'm, like, shocked. But anyway,

451
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,530
they got the old, the less old Macbook

452
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,750
as their, their, like, computer now to play games on. And

453
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,540
so I looked at what they'd been doing.

454
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,589
They haven't installed any updates on that Macbook in like,

455
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,890
years because they just turned off automatic updates

456
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,079
because they kept getting in their way.

457
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,400
-- But what's the benefit to them of it?
-- Nothing.

458
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,800
But I'm like, you can't do, not turn these off. Like, I, we had a talk.

459
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,300
-- But,
-- yeah, well, but that's the thing.

460
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,339
What is the actual benefit to a user of

461
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,619
installing updates and the answer is almost never,

462
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,660
-- it
-- annoyed them.

463
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,170
So they turned it off and I'm like, oh, my goodness, like whose Children are you?

464
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,469
And in some ways it makes it worse.

465
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,780
Um, going back to ipads,

466
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,869
I tried to run an app on my son's ipad that he likes or he used to, like

467
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,390
we talked about this last week. No, no, there's a different one. T Mu

468
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,819
Mizumi, it's still installed on his ipad and it says, oh,

469
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,800
I OS

470
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,890
is too new. I can't run on this.

471
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,000
You need to install the updated app and the updated app is also gone off the store.

472
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:52,290
And again,

473
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:52,979
it's

474
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:53,750
interesting.

475
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,150
Yeah. So I OS

476
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,439
version whatever. I think we're up to 13.61 or something is

477
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,660
so different from like 10, but

478
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,680
stuff just doesn't work.

479
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,810
So anyway, signaling

480
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,199
we're not

481
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,369
gonna,

482
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:07,050
I

483
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,050
feel, I feel like we just complain.

484
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:13,219
Well, see what's interesting to me is like, I want to make an informed choice

485
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,640
about software.

486
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,949
And so one of those choices to me for software, it boils down to two things.

487
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,810
One I know your software and service is going to have flaws.

488
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,130
That's just the reality of it.

489
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,880
So I want to get a sense of how many flaws, like, how bad is it like,

490
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,229
is it going to be like one or two bad flaws a year or one or two bad flaws a week?

491
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,489
And then secondly,

492
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:34,510
so like what what does the vendor then? Do, do they fix them quickly or slowly?

493
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,530
You know, because remember the bad old days, like back in the two thousands where,

494
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:37,829
you know,

495
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,010
people would post those vendor disclosure timelines that

496
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,530
were like three or four years long.

497
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,089
Yes.

498
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:43,760
You know,

499
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,510
and now you're seeing vendor disclosure timelines

500
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,630
where it's like contacted vendor emergency on Friday

501
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,949
-- fixed on Saturday. Cool. That's, that's the vendor I want.
-- Right. I, I agree. It is.

502
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:59,469
But again, how, how do you know? Right. How do you figure this out?

503
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,550
-- Well, you don't unless they have a CV database and change logs and, and,
-- and

504
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,280
I think those are not common at all.

505
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,369
No, no, no.

506
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,739
I mean, I,

507
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,250
I remember like I came to elastic and before I got here they were inconsistent.

508
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,119
-- Well,
-- and that's, that's a big part of it. Yeah.

509
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,910
Is consistency is a sign of maturity being able to

510
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,609
do something reproducibly and reliably because if it's broken,

511
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,250
you can then fix it and change it.

512
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,770
Right? Because if you do something consistently,

513
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,130
you can then do it a different way consistently.

514
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,930
Whereas if it's all the right place, like, I,

515
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,930
I remember vendors where they would just a security report would go

516
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:33,790
in and it would just get randomly handed to some developer,

517
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,530
like straight up that was their process

518
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,439
and, you know, and for a small firm or something, it's kind of like, well,

519
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:39,790
I guess what else are they gonna do

520
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,390
but then when you see, like, major firms it's like, no, you,

521
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,939
you need a security team that

522
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,709
at least tracks this because I remember this one vendor didn't

523
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,050
know how many sort of security flaws they were handling.

524
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,979
And I'm like, what do you mean? You don't know?

525
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:53,130
And they're like, well, it's not in the ticketing system. Well, where is it?

526
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,449
Well, you know, the does have it? Oh, ok.

527
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,439
Right.

528
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,729
Like, is it 5 5500? Right. And that's

529
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,089
so, I think a lot of this boils down to is,

530
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,290
I hate to say it's about process, but it is about process and it's about boring,

531
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,189
like spreadsheet ticketing kind of processes.

532
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,439
Yeah.

533
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,390
Oh, I agree. I think security is accounting

534
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,540
in terms of its excitement level and I have no doubt this is part of the

535
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,270
problem that has kind of got us to where we are is for a long time.

536
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,510
We were the special snowflakes that were exciting.

537
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,540
And

538
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,000
I think the more we, we mature, the more we realize

539
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,949
that the fact that we were snowflakes is just

540
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,670
a symbol of how broken everything really was.

541
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,589
I mean, we're not special security

542
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,189
is, should be boring because if your security isn't boring, like,

543
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,479
something terrible is probably going on.

544
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:42,780
Well,

545
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,550
the one thing I will say is that security incidents tend to have an emotional impact

546
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,300
but other incidents don't have as much.

547
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,890
Yeah, I do agree with that. It's Well, it makes a mess, man. I mean,

548
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,709
so like my wife just got a mail,

549
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:01,420
an email from some company she works with that was saying, oh,

550
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,219
your data has been breached but, but you know, here's my favorite part of it, it says,

551
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:08,060
but your, your credit card information was encrypted. So that's safe.

552
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:13,069
I'm like, I guarantee you this is a fake statement like there is, I bet you anything.

553
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,369
Well, no, no, no, they're not lying. It was encrypted.

554
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,430
But did they say whether or not the encryption keys were protected?

555
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,680
-- They didn't
-- say anything about that and I,

556
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,300
right.

557
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,430
Exactly. We know what's going on. Right.

558
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:28,040
But anyway, the point is that business is no doubt, completely up

559
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:30,699
ended and disrupted because of a security event.

560
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, it's like a natural disaster.

561
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,800
I mean, honestly that's what a security event is.

562
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,199
Like, it's the same caliber, like you're unprepared. There's nothing you can do.

563
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,140
There are places in the world where they're

564
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,719
common enough that they just deal with it.

565
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,640
Like, I remember this one town in Germany where they have a river, you know,

566
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,119
like most towns are on a river because that's where the water is.

567
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:52,150
And so it floods often enough that they installed those removable flood barriers.

568
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,339
But, you know, they just

569
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,770
install them like in an afternoon and they hold, you know, four or 5 ft of water

570
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,099
and they wait for the river to go down and they just pull out.

571
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,650
It's like these aluminum panels.

572
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:02,449
Right.

573
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,359
Yeah, and that's fine until the river gets so high it goes over your emergency.

574
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:10,719
But, yeah, at that point, you know, like they, they've, they've solved, you know,

575
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,989
for 95% of the flood cases they've turned them into non events.

576
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:18,199
Well, but that's the thing. Right. And, and this is going to be true of security is

577
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,609
you can, you can account for certain events, but there's always,

578
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,349
there's always going to be something bigger,

579
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,900
there's always going to be something new.

580
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:24,969
Oh,

581
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,500
-- yeah,
-- there's always a bigger fish. Yeah.

582
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,839
And I mean, like my favorite comparison here is like Florida, right?

583
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,989
They just keep building stronger and stronger houses and

584
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,339
we keep getting strong and stronger hurricanes like it,

585
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,719
it's one of those things.

586
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:36,069
Right.

587
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,449
Yeah,

588
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:38,199
I don't know.

589
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,579
But back to signaling, I mean,

590
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:41,420
part of it too is there are signals that

591
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,719
are signals and there are signals that are effective.

592
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:46,530
So it always kind of reminds me of plumage in the wild,

593
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:47,250
right?

594
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,140
Where there are,

595
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,349
there are signals animals give out and some of them are

596
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,819
actually more effective for that animal being fitter for its environment.

597
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:57,979
And some are like having bright plumage means well,

598
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,650
like I'm strong enough that I don't get eaten.

599
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,060
So in and of itself is not a good thing,

600
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,569
but it basically proves something else.

601
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,420
So, for example,

602
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,829
if you have a bug bounty that consistently pays out like 100 grand for R CS.

603
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,800
Well, then one of two things is true. Either one you don't have a lot of R CS

604
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,609
or two. You're big enough and mature enough that, like, cool.

605
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:19,020
Yeah, we're going to pay out millions of dollars a year in security flaws because,

606
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,900
like Microsoft and Google, we can.

607
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,319
Yeah, but those, those places have.

608
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:27,569
So, actually this is, this is a good line of line of discussion because I don't think

609
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:30,599
it's ever going to be the case of. We just have plenty of money.

610
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,410
I think it's always going to be the case of our security

611
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,640
is so good now that we have to pay ridiculous sums of money

612
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,479
for people to justify spending the time and effort on our stuff.

613
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,640
And that's a great sign.

614
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,359
Oh, yeah. Here we go. This is from a few, this is from what, two years ago,

615
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,000
Google has paid out

616
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,209
over $21 million

617
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:55,119
since 2010, which is a lot of freaking money, $2 million a year. That,

618
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,920
that's actually some real money.

619
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,949
However, however, I will say,

620
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,880
I guarantee you if they had internal people looking for the

621
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,849
same kind of bugs and doing the same kind of work,

622
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,760
-- I bet they would have paid out 10 times that
-- much,

623
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,430
easily.

624
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,829
Well, more to the point

625
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,520
they can't because

626
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,890
-- do you know any security people without a job?
-- No, there are none.

627
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,109
And

628
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,390
actually one of my favorite, favorite comparisons here is.

629
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,479
So if you pay to get a pen test done against your site,

630
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,069
there is a high probability, if you're competent they will find nothing.

631
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,270
And then you just paid them 100 grand for a report that says good job. Everybody like

632
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
that sucks.

633
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:33,630
-- Yeah.
-- But that's valuable.

634
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,250
Like, I mean, we, we have a service now that looks at our D MARK reports for our email.

635
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,930
And it's funny because we had like 98 point something

636
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:43,489
percent of our email is DKIM and SPF compliant.

637
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:44,989
And I'm like, oh, that's not bad.

638
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,910
And I found like, two or three things where I could fix it.

639
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,349
Like, you know, sales force is emailing it

640
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,162
reports as us and, you know, not set up. Right. So I'm like, oh, good.

641
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,883
You know, it's a couple of 100 emails a week that we can fix

642
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,733
and another contact piece of software.

643
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,902
And it's funny though then talking to the vendor, I'm like, yeah, you know,

644
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,633
like we're at 98 point whatever percent, you know,

645
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:05,072
and I think I can get this down to about two or three per 1000 you know, and I,

646
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,022
and I feel like though I can't get it any lower

647
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:09,123
than that because just there's email systems that are broken,

648
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:09,353
right?

649
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:09,853
And he's like, yeah,

650
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,333
and I'm like, what is it kind of your average vendor go for? And he's like,

651
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,196
5 to 90%.

652
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:18,556
But when you think about a major vendor

653
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:21,265
sending out millions and millions of marketing emails.

654
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:26,495
You know, like, like one thing I realized is like at the cloud screen lines,

655
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,725
there was like five, we had about five or six ways.

656
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:31,735
I knew that we were supposed to be sending out email, like Google mailchimp,

657
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:32,336
stuff like that.

658
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,475
But like I said, there was a couple of surprises like, oh, Salesforce is emailing out

659
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:39,505
us us. Why? What? Oh, these automated reports like a daily report? Ok, cool.

660
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,500
And so

661
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,479
you think about a fortune 100 company?

662
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,560
Oh man, I mean,

663
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:47,119
we're not even that big and we have similar problems where we actually,

664
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,500
so it's weird that you're, I don't know why the D

665
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:52,619
mark is getting hip right now because we, we had an internal project.

666
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,479
-- What
-- I love about D Mark is it's helping me improve

667
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:57,229
my email deliverability and as a side effect I get better security

668
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:00,260
and that's exactly what we're experiencing at work as well.

669
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,140
It's like we're starting to clean up some D Mark stuff and people are like, wait,

670
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,099
what, where like, where did this even come from?

671
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,739
Well, I I'm like, why we have one email from one

672
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,864
subdomain and I'm like, that should never send an email

673
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:11,385
because

674
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:12,104
that doesn't

675
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:12,944
exist

676
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:18,905
like this doesn't exist as a thing. How is it? It's an S3 bucket. How is it?

677
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:20,505
Why is there an email from it?

678
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,114
-- But
-- at the same time,

679
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,864
I think this is what makes Demark so cool because

680
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:28,464
it's giving a window into some of this madness.

681
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:31,505
So, anyway, anyway, all right, we need, we need to wrap this one up.

682
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:35,864
So I feel like we talked about bug bunnies a lot, even though that wasn't the intent.

683
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:40,310
But I do think there is a lot of interesting lessons to learn.

684
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,800
And I think this is one of those instances where reading between

685
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,459
the lines of what a company says versus how they act is,

686
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,439
I mean, this is true of just humans in general.

687
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,219
There's a lot of power in that slack does. I think in general a fair job.

688
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:57,670
I don't want to make it sound like I'm anti Slack or anything. I use it every day.

689
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,185
But I do think it, one of those instances where

690
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:02,785
you don't have a lot of excuses at this point

691
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:04,875
to not have a lot of this figured out.

692
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:07,915
Well, I think they could definitely do better

693
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:10,515
and well, that certainly it's true of everybody.

694
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:14,194
But I think also more importantly, they should do better because like you said,

695
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:16,474
this is now critical infrastructure people, you know,

696
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,275
work from home is now the new normal.

697
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:20,994
Like people like me and Josh, we're not trendsetters anymore. We're boring,

698
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,380
boring for years.

699
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,079
But yeah, I, I, yeah, absolutely. And this is, I mean,

700
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,579
we could probably throw actually before we go, I'm going to end on. This is so

701
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:33,060
funny enough.

702
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:36,910
I'll pick on Zoom who just had, like, their stock is last, I looked,

703
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,869
was up $100 today because they had, like, ridiculous earnings yesterday.

704
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,250
But,

705
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:42,880
yeah,

706
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:44,530
exactly.

707
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,660
We just wait, they're like,

708
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,849
anyway, anyway,

709
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:48,640
it's

710
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,300
up 37.7%.

711
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,709
I'm sad. I didn't buy their stock.

712
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:53,859
But

713
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,380
anyway,

714
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,810
here, here's the thing though, right?

715
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,650
Like, they had a signaling problem at the beginning and then they're like, oh,

716
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,849
we're going to fix all this,

717
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,209
what we should do at some point is like we should follow up on what they've done.

718
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,290
I, I actually did, I,

719
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,079
I looked at them as part of my slack research and

720
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:09,569
I decided to set them aside as their own special thing.

721
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,410
A, let's just say it looks like they haven't done squat.

722
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,329
Oh, that would be my assumption. Yeah, they've done the public lip service.

723
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:18,410
-- But
-- it was apr stunt and now it's back to normal

724
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,660
as

725
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,369
far as I know they haven't become a CV numbering authority.

726
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,569
They haven't. There's, there's so much again.

727
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:26,040
Zoom is another topic,

728
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,209
I think because it's a big one and there's a lot of stuff they haven't done.

729
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,750
And this is what I love is everybody throws, you know,

730
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:36,545
everybody got so upset and stressed out about it and it's like they don't even, yeah,

731
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:37,625
on their hacker one page.

732
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,375
They don't even tell you what their bounties are.

733
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:44,625
That hacker one has links to companies that isn't like the Zoom

734
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:48,025
hacker one bug bounty that is hacker one's link to Zoom.

735
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:48,395
Oh,

736
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:52,375
-- yes. Right.
-- That's part of the story, part of the story. Anyway,

737
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,545
we're not going to do this right now.

738
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:55,535
Intrigued.

739
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah, exactly. Like I said, I said it off to the so.

740
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:00,949
Ok.

741
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,290
No more. No more.

742
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,060
I will stop looking

743
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:05,540
at

744
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,890
it. Alright. Thank you everyone for listening. You can go to open

746
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:10,209
I

747
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,949
can't even talk today.

748
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,989
You all know what to do, you know how to find us. We're on Twitter.

749
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,229
I'm going to end it there. All right, Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.
