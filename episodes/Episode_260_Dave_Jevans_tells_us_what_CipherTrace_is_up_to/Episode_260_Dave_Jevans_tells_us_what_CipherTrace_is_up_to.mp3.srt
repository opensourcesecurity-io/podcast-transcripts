Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,100
-- Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser
-- and back to Normal Crime again.

2
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,449
I'm super excited today.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,270
We've got, we have a guest, Dave Jevans,

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,059
who's the CEO of Cipher Trace and the chairman of the anti fishing working group,

5
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:20,639
Dave.

6
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,290
Why don't you give us a little intro and we'll kind of go from there.

7
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:27,770
But as listeners are aware, like I love Bitcoin and so you are right up my alley.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,076
Josh Kurt. It's great to talk to you today.

9
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:31,596
Yeah. So as an intro,

10
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:36,835
I'm the CEO of Cipher Trace. We are a Cryptocurrency

11
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:41,195
compliance and investigation capability company.

12
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:44,305
So we help a lot of people in the banking

13
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:48,245
area in the Cryptocurrency exchanges and the OTC desks.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,675
But we also work with regulators and others

15
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:54,922
and we do help victims who've had Cryptocurrency stolen from them.

16
00:00:54,931 --> 00:01:00,122
My background is in computer security and financial services.

17
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:04,191
So I've started three very successful start ups in

18
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:09,061
computer security encryption over the last almost 20 years.

19
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,281
And I have a master's degree in Computer

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,162
Science from the University of Calgary in Canada.

21
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,982
Oh, man, another Canadian

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,599
actually, it's funny for,

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,680
just for the listeners who don't know is I had to cut Dave

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,410
and Kurt off at the beginning because they wouldn't stop talking about hockey.

25
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:26,970
So,

26
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:32,309
anyway. All right. So, I guess the very first question I want to lead off with is

27
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,040
you talk about doing investigations into Cryptocurrency?

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,510
The way people understand this is that Cryptocurrency is anonymous.

29
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,029
-- Are you telling me it is not
-- that Cryptocurrency is pseudonymous? Oh,

30
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:45,290
I

31
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,379
-- like
-- that.

32
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,440
Yeah, it means you can identify

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,519
entities, we call them. You know, it could be a company, it could be an individual.

34
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,819
It could be an automated system, a defi system

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,940
that control certain kinds of addresses or smart contracts or wallets.

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,500
So that can be derived purely through Blockchain analysis,

37
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,350
which means we know that these

38
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:14,350
addresses are owned by people. So that's pseudonymous. So it's not anonymous.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,789
It means you can cluster addresses together.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,190
Now when you layer it on with other analytics, you can make it more precise.

41
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,589
-- So
-- you're basically talking classic traffic analysis layered with other data.

42
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,910
I mean, that's really cool.

43
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,339
This is one of the things that I think a lot of people don't, don't always grasp is that

44
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,339
even though you're dealing with addresses,

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,940
you're leaving a digital footprint all over the place.

46
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,190
I mean, let's, I guess let's take an easy example, right?

47
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,830
Why don't you explain to us like what is

48
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,660
a Bitcoin transaction look like and what are the

49
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,500
things you guys maybe look at there because I

50
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:48,220
think Bitcoin's probably the leakiest of them all.

51
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,630
Yeah.

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,100
And I think that's,

53
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,860
it's a good way to generalize over the entire space is just to talk with the,

54
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,580
the granddaddy of the mall.

55
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:58,850
So in a Bitcoin transaction,

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,679
what you get is effectively a transaction ID and then addresses that are

57
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,009
involved in that and there could be a sender and a receiver,

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,089
but that's even too simple.

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,039
There's always a sender, a receiver and what we call a change address,

60
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,009
which means let's say I want to send you

61
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,369
Josh half a Bitcoin but I have one Bitcoin.

62
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,610
It's going to send you half a Bitcoin and I'm going

63
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,490
to get the other half Bitcoin back sent to me.

64
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,850
So in general, there's almost always three parties and a Bitcoin transaction,

65
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,210
the sender, the receiver and whoever got the change.

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,600
Not always, but generally now you can make it more extensive.

67
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,889
So let's say you're a Cryptocurrency exchange

68
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,809
and you want to reduce transaction fees,

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,279
you might throw 50 inputs in

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,070
to a Bitcoin transaction. So 50 different addresses

71
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,960
and then you might send it out to

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,399
150 addresses

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,899
that are receiving transactions. And this is done to reduce transaction fees. So

74
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,639
transactions look like that.

75
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,380
But this gives you an analysis pattern where

76
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,419
you can start to track transactions through the Blockchain

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,270
to see where they started from.

78
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:12,419
And eventually you could go 10 steps 20 steps, 50 steps and see where they are.

79
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,210
That's awesome.

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,350
And now do you guys only track Bitcoin

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,540
or do you track other cryptocurrencies as well?

82
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:17,589
Cipher

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,345
trace tracks over 800 cryptocurrencies.

84
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,394
I didn't even know there were 800 cryptocurrencies.

85
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,614
There's way more than 800

86
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:27,595
holy

87
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:27,785
cow.

88
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:33,255
There's, there's, there's about 2030 40 that really matter.

89
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:37,454
But there's, yeah, there's thousands of little ones but we, we,

90
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,654
we put effort into tracking about 800 of them.

91
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,535
But again, like there's really 20 or 30 they're,

92
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:47,445
they're the top ones and these are based on different chains.

93
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,845
So some of them are based on

94
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,720
the Bitcoin Blockchain.

95
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,760
A lot of them are based on the Ethereum Blockchain,

96
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,750
which is a complete rewrite and adds smart contracts

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,079
IV software that can run on the Blockchain.

98
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:04,500
And then there's a number of independent blockchains that have been developed,

99
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,329
for example, to support what we call stablecoin.

100
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,359
Ok. Ok.

101
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,269
So

102
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,760
I'm, I'm, I feel like a kid in a candy store. There's so many things I want to ask you.

103
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:13,000
But

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,500
so let's start with criminal investigations. Can you, can you talk more on that?

105
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,070
Because I think that's one of the things that captures people's imaginations

106
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,049
is you hear about these crazy Bitcoin heists where people are stealing,

107
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,489
you know, you know, millions of dollars or billions of dollars in some cases.

108
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,739
And,

109
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,760
and I'm curious, like, what does that mean? Like, what, what does that mean?

110
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:35,730
From your perspective, like what is cipher trace doing in that, that case?

111
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,950
So yeah, so on the high side of things, it, there's two types,

112
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,149
I would say there's um the ones that are targeted at individuals.

113
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,899
So those tend to be fishing related.

114
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,970
So, you know, I'll fish your password to your Cryptocurrency account someplace.

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,910
There's more sophisticated versions of it which we can

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,654
discuss if we want to get into detail.

117
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:58,035
But,

118
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:02,975
you know, I steal your private keys, but typically think of it as, as, as as fishing,

119
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,445
advanced fishing. And then the second one is

120
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:10,375
um actual attacks against Cryptocurrency exchanges where people

121
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:13,565
are holding a lot of their cryptocurrencies,

122
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,234
you know, so they can buy, sell trade,

123
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:17,135
etcetera.

124
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,149
Um Those are obviously much larger.

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,420
So those tend to look like any kind of security attack against a,

126
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,250
any kind of online service or company,

127
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,799
which is I want to break into that company through various mechanisms.

128
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,019
Most of, you know,

129
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,750
what we think about as traditional security breaches

130
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,029
are I stole all your customer data,

131
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,380
you know,

132
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,829
I stole your credit card data and I go sell it on the internet or I sell passwords

133
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,244
and user names on the internet. Now,

134
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,875
the thing about crypto which is different is

135
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,244
if you get people's private keys,

136
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,154
um you basically stole their money.

137
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,195
And

138
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:55,575
so there's way more monetary incentive to attack

139
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,565
Cryptocurrency exchanges because if I like extract,

140
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,795
you know, I don't know,

141
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:04,825
1000 bytes of information. That's your private key or that's your recovery key.

142
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:08,195
Then I basically can steal all your money from anywhere in the world.

143
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:08,829
Yeah,

144
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,970
I've been looking into this because it's

145
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,720
interesting how traditionally to monetize the tax,

146
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,950
you have to get the data and then do something, sell it, whatever, rent it.

147
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,750
But, yeah, with, with Cryptocurrency you, well, it is money.

148
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,820
One thing I'm, I'm finding really, uh, that I don't quite understand.

149
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:23,750
So for example,

150
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,880
uh there was the exo

151
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,029
hack back in December of 2020 right?

152
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,760
Where they stole something like $10 million worth of Cryptocurrency.

153
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:33,839
About 6% of the uh exchange's total value from their hot wallets.

154
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,799
And obviously they know the address is that the money was

155
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:40,183
to and they've published these and said, you know, don't do business with this.

156
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:44,013
But I'm wondering, you know, kind of like dirty law like dirty money.

157
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,792
Does the criminal underground?

158
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,602
Are they still willing to trade in these, with these addresses?

159
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:52,122
Like kind of at a reduced rate because they know the money's tainted or is this,

160
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:55,553
is this Cryptocurrency, you know, burnt forever or, you know,

161
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,092
if they wait long enough, can they spend it?

162
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:57,562
Like, how does

163
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,216
I'm kind of wondering how does it work with?

164
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:02,156
We know that this address is bad. They stole a bunch of money,

165
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,696
-- don't do business with it. Like will that work
-- typically not?

166
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:10,966
Now if you use a product like cipher trace on the receiving side

167
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:14,226
of things you can do deep chain analysis that would look at,

168
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,156
ok, I'm going to analyze this transaction, this transaction,

169
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,436
this transaction looking

170
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,135
backward down the chain because what these guys do is they try to evade

171
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,406
any kind of simple blacklist.

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,529
So what what what people will put out as you know,

173
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:28,760
a

174
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:32,489
blacklist of here's the address is where we know the bad guys sent the money.

175
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,239
Well, no bad guys. Well, in these days anyway,

176
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,780
no bad guys stupid enough to try to send

177
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,349
that directly to another exchange to cash out.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,219
They would have been like four or five years ago. Yeah, or three years ago.

179
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,500
But now, no, so now they move it through,

180
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,210
they split it up into lots of private addresses.

181
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:53,159
So these are addresses that don't exist on any exchange.

182
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,320
They exist on someone's Linux computer

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,780
or their phone

184
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:02,659
and they split it up into 1020 30 40 5100 different pieces

185
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,780
and then

186
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,200
the smarter guys write software to do it.

187
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,599
So they'll, they'll make what we call peeling chains where they'll,

188
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,690
they'll move the money from one to another to another to another and they might

189
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,059
do like 50 to 100 transactions and then bring it back together at the end and

190
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,539
maybe three or four different exchanges where they can cash out.

191
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:28,419
So that's the state of the art of it is really kind of trying to avoid detection

192
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:32,159
increasingly using software algorithms to do it.

193
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,190
Are they also mixing it with sort of like clean Cryptocurrency

194
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,380
or is it sort of sitting out on its own?

195
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:37,979
No?

196
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,299
Yeah, they'll definitely, you know,

197
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,390
they'll have addresses that try to mix it in with clean.

198
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,580
It's not the biggest way they do it, but it, it happens,

199
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,640
you'll also sometimes see crypto moved into commercial money

200
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,780
laundering services which we call mixers or Tumblr or foggers

201
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,909
And that mixes, you know,

202
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,580
50 people's money into one transaction and then splits it out again.

203
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,070
So it's, it becomes harder to track.

204
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,190
That's not the primary way that we see it being done today.

205
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,590
There tend to be more proprietary mechanisms that people use to

206
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,020
split stuff out.

207
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,169
And um I think you also mentioned Kurt an interesting one which is the time delay.

208
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:18,419
So sometimes you will see people wait

209
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,440
and be very patient on moving it because I think they think maybe

210
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,619
if you wait 18 months,

211
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,260
people will stop watching anymore,

212
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:28,919
which is,

213
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,010
you know, generally true. Right.

214
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,159
Well, that this thing is something I don't understand because, well,

215
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,919
I guess technically maybe a statute of limitations could be an issue potentially,

216
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,840
but more to the point.

217
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,690
These are computer records and computers are sort of as I

218
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,169
understand it infinitely patient when it comes to this stuff.

219
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,969
Yeah. But let me give you an example.

220
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:50,030
So let's say a small investment firm buys

221
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,989
$10 million in a Cryptocurrency let's call it Bitcoin

222
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,150
on a Friday. They move it to a hardware wallet. It gets stolen on a Wednesday.

223
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,469
It moves into some address

224
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:05,090
and then it sits there for 18 months, which is now,

225
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,849
of course worth probably 30 $40 million.

226
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:11,130
-- That company's probably gone bankrupt.
-- Oh, I see what you're saying.

227
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,690
-- So, there's no one to chase it anymore.
-- Right. Well, a stupid question.

228
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,520
But wouldn't that company maybe sort of sell that debt?

229
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:17,809
Like,

230
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,609
wouldn't somebody buy that as a debt or as an

231
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,380
asset that they could then recover at a later date?

232
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,474
I've never heard of market. Perhaps that's a market. That's an interesting idea.

233
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,955
But I mean, I would think that the return rates would be,

234
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:33,554
-- I would imagine people would offer 1% 0.1%
-- because I just,

235
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:34,955
because like there's been, you know,

236
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,945
on the order of several billion dollars of Cryptocurrency

237
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:40,215
-- known to be stolen
-- now way more than that.

238
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,585
But yeah, I mean, it's, yeah,

239
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:45,114
I think at cipher trace we've tracked probably 4 billion.

240
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,244
Yeah, I mean, to quote Congress, that's real money.

241
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:49,474
Let me ask this. So

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm a criminal.

243
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,700
I acquire some Cryptocurrency. I let it sit for 18 months and then I start using it.

244
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,700
I presume

245
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,260
that cipher trace has no problem recognizing that

246
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,969
the stolen money is starting to move again.

247
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,940
Yes. Correct. That's true.

248
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,669
No problem because we put an alert and monitoring on it and once we see it move,

249
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,710
then our analysts get alerted in real time.

250
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,340
That's ok. So let me ask that. Then let's say your analyst does get alerted.

251
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,520
-- What does that mean? What do
-- they

252
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,469
-- do?
-- Well, it depends if

253
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,400
so we don't do any work for free. I mean, we do a lot of work for free. That's not

254
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,010
true. We work for,

255
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,250
we do a lot of pro

256
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,219
pro bono work for small investors that, you know, have been ripped off. We also

257
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,020
have a network of

258
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,169
12 different universities that we work with where they have master's

259
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,739
degree students in financial crime that we feed them cases from.

260
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:45,489
You know, I got ripped off 50,000 bucks, 10,000 bucks. What have you? So,

261
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:45,849
you know,

262
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:50,409
we have 12 universities with these master's degrees in financial crimes that,

263
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,250
that can help and they're trained on the cipher trace product and

264
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,179
they will help small, you know, investors

265
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,900
and small holders to try to recover their funds and trace them.

266
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,359
But in general, what we do is, you know,

267
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,489
if we have a customer who's had one of these heist,

268
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,210
let's say it's an exchange or an OTC desk or something like that,

269
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
then,

270
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:15,179
um, we'll get an alert, we'll have our investigation team,

271
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,479
look at it, we'll notify the customer and then

272
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,919
we start tracing where that money goes.

273
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,099
And what we find is in these cases where people hold it for a long period of time.

274
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,219
That's a long time to think about how you're going to monetize

275
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,140
it and move it out quickly and typically it moves really,

276
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,340
really, really quickly.

277
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,739
So they, ok, so they come up with a plan and then

278
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,429
made it.

279
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,919
-- Yep,
-- they come up with a plan, they automate it.

280
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,159
They come up with a syndication program which is ok.

281
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm going to split it up, for example, in five different pieces. So I'll say

282
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,119
1 million, 2 million here, 1 million, 2 million there

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,840
and then they'll break it out. And so you'll have either them doing it

284
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,599
completely themselves, either by manual operations.

285
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,719
Some of it will be software automated,

286
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,539
but some of it they'll delegate to some third party who will say like, ok, well,

287
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,590
I'll run it through my mixing service and

288
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,539
you'll pay me 20 percent.

289
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:14,409
So they tend to break it out into kind of the criminal underground network of um,

290
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,109
you know, combination of money mules,

291
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,369
mixing services and then their own software developed.

292
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,200
And then also people who are experts at doing it by hand.

293
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,039
Sorry, that just blows my mind because there's an old science fiction book,

294
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:30,155
Hardwired where they actually do this.

295
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:33,494
Like there's an actual scene in the book where they're laundering some money.

296
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,905
And for example, they send it to this

297
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,905
offshore account and then take a loan against 99.9% of the money,

298
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,905
you know, which gets sent somewhere else to, you know,

299
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,484
to try and break that chain of connection of the money.

300
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:47,234
Right. I, I just, I remember as a child thinking this was wonderful and magical and

301
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm kind of, well, I'm not happy to see it happening now, 30 years later.

302
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,679
But part of me is glee internally like a little child. But, you know, this is finally

303
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,580
we're getting, you know, Johnny, demonic style cyber hacking. Right.

304
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,479
Or, uh, you know, Neil Stevenson's Krypton

305
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,840
Noon. I mean, that's real.

306
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,510
Yeah.

307
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,330
Yeah. Oh,

308
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,280
man, that's such a good book. I haven't read that in a while. I need to do that. Now.

309
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:11,700
It's a big book though.

310
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,679
-- It is, it's a great, it's, it's very large.
-- All his books are big.

311
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:17,000
Uh,

312
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:17,179
yeah.

313
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,299
Yeah, they kind of are now that you say that anyway, whatever,

314
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,890
what I find really fascinating is it sounds like

315
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,859
the criminals are trying to be more technologically,

316
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:24,260
you know,

317
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,650
coherent and, and sophisticated,

318
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,739
but at the same time, it sounds like

319
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:33,585
for once law enforcement and tech technology is actually keeping up with them and,

320
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,934
or possibly a step ahead of them in some cases.

321
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,945
And I'm wondering kind of what's different this time around,

322
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:40,375
-- like why I
-- don't believe we're a step ahead of them.

323
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,854
We never will be as, as we talked about in the intro.

324
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,455
One of the other things that I do is I am

325
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:49,424
chairman of a nonprofit called the Anti Fishing Working Group.

326
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,934
You can find us at anti fishing.org or a

327
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,174
pwg.org.

328
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:57,539
We've been working on fishing since 2004.

329
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,979
We run a real time fishing feed that most of the browser

330
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,789
companies and all the big security companies use and big brands use.

331
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:07,780
We also run electronic crime conferences around the world.

332
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,419
So that's been 15 years doing this. We're never ahead.

333
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,859
We're always playing catch up now. We can predict things

334
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,309
and if we predict things, my,

335
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,640
my experience is if we predict some way that someone's going to do it

336
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:24,599
in, let's say 18 months from now, they usually do it in about 12.

337
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,429
So we might, we might have a prediction of how it is.

338
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:32,419
But the bad guys are always figuring it out ahead of time.

339
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,559
So it's ii I feel like it's always a combination of

340
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:36,330
addictive,

341
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,489
what are they going to do but also reactive because there's

342
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,349
always ways they think about that we never thought of.

343
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,359
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, by definition, that's just that's the game of cat and mouse, right? The

344
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,479
cat is always chasing the mouse.

345
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,900
There's, it's never the other way around, obviously.

346
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,530
OK. This is,

347
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:56,010
this is fascinating. So I guess I'm really curious then. So if you're part of the

348
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:59,460
anti fishing group and you're dealing with tracing Cryptocurrency,

349
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,700
how often do those worlds kind of collide where you are seeing?

350
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,419
Because obviously,

351
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:08,010
there's tons of Cryptocurrency phishing everything that goes on every day.

352
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,180
So we started the Cryptocurrency working group at a

353
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,500
PWG about three years ago and you can imagine we had two or three companies involved

354
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,249
and now it's blooming. It's the fastest growing part of the

355
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:26,058
data sharing network, which is, you know, ransomware,

356
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:30,129
theft frauds and more and more data is flowing through it.

357
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:31,859
Even my local police department, you know,

358
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:37,088
has on multiple occasions issued bulletins and news articles about, you know,

359
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,899
essentially if, if revenue Canada calls you up and wants you to pay them in, you know,

360
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,129
Amazon gift cards or Bitcoin don't do it.

361
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:48,439
Yes. So one is obviously fishing consumers, you know, hey,

362
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:52,520
it's your Cryptocurrency exchange. You got to update it, et cetera.

363
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,219
But there's another area you have to be thinking about. So,

364
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,310
um, I fish the it

365
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,280
person who runs the DNS

366
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:08,119
at my Cryptocurrency company and I now get their third party DNS

367
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,910
providers

368
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,680
credentials.

369
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:14,300
So now what I can do is I can create

370
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:21,920
AAA basically route all of your customers traffic to my website

371
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,439
and I maybe I couldn't issue a certificate against it.

372
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:29,030
So some people will get like bad certificate, match and what have you.

373
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:29,880
But

374
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,959
I'm going to get a lot of your customers

375
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,500
passwords and potentially private keys.

376
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,689
So you have to think about internal phishing

377
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,790
as well on these Cryptocurrency services where,

378
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,270
what if somebody who runs, you know, the DNS

379
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,020
got fished?

380
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,800
Well, I actually just had this experience with one of the exchanges I use where they,

381
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,890
I was logged in and the support window pops up and they're like, hey,

382
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
we need to update your P I and I'm like,

383
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,439
I don't really want to because it's up to date and they're like, ok, well,

384
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:55,420
you can email it to us

385
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,390
and they emailed me from a domain that was totally different.

386
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
It was, you know, some generic support website kind of service thing.

387
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,410
And I'm like, has their support system been compromised and of course, you know,

388
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,319
I email them and they're like, no, no, no, this is totally fine.

389
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,579
This is normal. And I'm like, oh my sweet, you know,

390
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,229
you're basically teaching your customers to get fished.

391
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:14,709
Well, Kurt,

392
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,790
the other thing that I've seen is

393
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,069
Google and other advertising services allowing advertisements for

394
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:29,229
fishing sites for crypto. So being able to, for example, advertise fake meta mask

395
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:34,189
website. So meta mask is a great tool for protecting your Cryptocurrency assets.

396
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:38,709
If you want to manage them on your own computer, rather than a third party site

397
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:41,930
on an exchange, you can manage them yourselves,

398
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,290
you can put in your keys and then you can look at all your crypto

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,660
assets and it's a great product. But for the last couple of months, we've had

400
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,530
criminals basically advertising meta mask, installs, paid ads

401
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,900
on Google

402
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,890
and

403
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,750
you know, you go click on it.

404
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,790
It looks like it,

405
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,050
you install it the update to your browser and then they

406
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,199
just copy all your private keys and steal all your money.

407
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,540
It's, it's,

408
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,609
I've actually been through that with my kids and apps because if

409
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:12,089
you search the app store for a lot of popular kids terms,

410
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:12,680
you know, there's

411
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:17,050
some really dodgy looking fake copies of those popular apps.

412
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,439
Yeah, I'm just, I hadn't even really thought of, you know, as a, as a consumer.

413
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:22,400
How do I? Yeah.

414
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,880
How do I download software safely and install it and make sure that it's

415
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,819
not going to shut my private keys off to Russia at some later date.

416
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,239
So, I mean, that that problem has yet to be solved too, you know,

417
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,339
which is how do you educate people and

418
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,859
block these things and all that kind of stuff. So

419
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,760
real time block lists are important. Information sharing is important.

420
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,310
If the government would share information back with us rather

421
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,540
than us only sharing one way would be important.

422
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,420
-- Ok.
-- So this is, so you said you share

423
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,619
information with the government

424
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,109
about crypto,

425
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:57,550
-- I guess crime would, would that be accurate?
-- So what Cypher

426
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:05,239
Trace does is we, we create publicly available reports that discuss crypto

427
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,579
crime. So that would be theft

428
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,180
and fraud.

429
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:16,089
And so those are publicly available reports. You can find it on our website at cipher

430
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,310
trace.com

431
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,400
and those are, those are frequently quoted by government agencies as you know,

432
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,729
here's what the state of the world is.

433
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:26,719
That type of thing.

434
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,300
Right. Right. I got you. I got you. Ok. So that's,

435
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,910
I mean, I mean, that's fascinating to me because

436
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,069
you are, you, obviously you're tracking all of this information.

437
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,310
And I think what's fascinating about it is it's all in the public, right?

438
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,339
It's all on these public ledgers that

439
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,130
anyone with the resources is capable of doing this in

440
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,989
theory because I'll put that in quotes because I actually,

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,989
I imported the Bitcoin

442
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,420
chain into Alaska Search once and it's really big.

443
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,920
But it's, it's,

444
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,260
it's nontrivial. I can't, if you guys are tracking 800

445
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:59,060
blocks or 800 chains, I can't imagine how much storage you must have.

446
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:02,020
So I guess here's my question then is you've got kind of this,

447
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,819
this public research being done.

448
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,839
But then at the same time, obviously,

449
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,969
I, I assume like if, if someone goes to the, the FBI and it says, you know,

450
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,390
I've been stolen, you know, or not, I've been stolen.

451
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
That's not, that's not words.

452
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,900
But, you know, if they say if someone stole my Cryptocurrency,

453
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,790
then

454
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,030
obviously the FBI starts investigating.

455
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,550
I assume they don't have that level of expertise you guys have, right?

456
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,250
Uh Well, that's true.

457
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,790
But the FBI has a,

458
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,900
the United States FBI has a pretty well

459
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,750
trained uh Cryptocurrency team so they can help.

460
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,849
But remember that, you know,

461
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,800
every law enforcement agency has a limited

462
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,920
budget and limited training and limited people.

463
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,609
So, I mean, unless

464
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,550
you had

465
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,910
$5

466
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,750
million stolen, they're not gonna be able to help you.

467
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,900
That's fair.

468
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,349
I mean, I, I get that it's like,

469
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,099
it's like when people go and try to complain to the police that

470
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,270
my wallet got stolen and you're like, oh,

471
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,199
fill out this piece of paper and we're going to throw

472
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,979
it in the garbage when you walk out the door,

473
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:01,319
you know.

474
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,540
Well, one question because

475
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,410
uh so there,

476
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,530
I think that's part of the problem is this perception

477
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,530
that all the Blockchain data is public and you know,

478
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,099
immutable on the ledger forever.

479
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:10,810
But

480
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:15,410
do you guys also monitor the memory pool like the transaction pools of

481
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,060
transactions before they actually become transactions?

482
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,900
OK.

483
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,209
Of course, they do

484
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,420
monitoring Blockchain is tricky but monitoring the memory pool of Blockchain,

485
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,609
-- that is way way
-- trickier,

486
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,390
especially when you have chain reorgs and things like that.

487
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,739
Why don't, why don't you tell the listeners what that means?

488
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,290
Because I have a strong suspicion. There's some who don't quite know.

489
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:40,025
So that means that so we think about the Blockchain, let's just again,

490
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:43,125
keep it simple and think about Bitcoin Blockchain

491
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,265
rather than others because they're all different.

492
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,925
But this is probably the granddaddy of them all

493
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,484
is um typically you can think about

494
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,444
the blockchains get

495
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,270
validated every few seconds every few minutes, et cetera. So

496
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,290
Bitcoins around, let's call it 10 minutes. You know, e theorem is faster than that.

497
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,890
Others are faster, some are slower.

498
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,609
But in between that time,

499
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,170
you have an uncertainty period of who owns

500
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,310
what and there's a consensus algorithm runs,

501
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,369
let's say, in Bitcoin,

502
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,949
every around 10 minutes that's derived by minor solving computational program

503
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,130
problems. Right? OK. So

504
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,699
there are reorganizational problems. So let's say

505
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,959
somebody has a big huge mining pool running in.

506
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:34,219
I don't know Utah with really cheap power off a dam or in China or something like that.

507
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:39,709
Or in Iceland, thermo, what they, they might do is they might pre compute,

508
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:42,359
they might compute blockchains for

509
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,900
20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes

510
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:50,319
and they get all the votes on it and then they come back and they say, oh,

511
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:54,780
that thing from like 10 minutes ago, no, we can prove that we had more votes

512
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:59,270
than that. And that creates a Blockchain reorganization which

513
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,790
reallocates who owns what

514
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,469
now these don't happen all the time

515
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:06,489
but they do happen.

516
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,979
-- So
-- this is then leads to people saying, you know,

517
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:12,060
your transaction isn't finalized unless it's at least six or

518
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,540
10 blocks or whatever.

519
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:13,790
Yeah,

520
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,260
exactly.

521
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,459
This is why people put depth limits on, on Blockchain confirmations

522
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,359
and while you will see other companies who mitigate risk against it, so you'll find,

523
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:26,430
for example,

524
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:32,979
Cryptocurrency at T MS might say we'll take a zero block or a one block confirmation,

525
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:36,270
but they're going to charge you like a credit card,

526
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,640
you know, 1.5% 2% 3% 4% which covers their risk

527
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,579
of a reorg.

528
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:48,829
Yeah, for a double span. Right. That might affect their settlement.

529
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,640
I'm curious, how often does this actually happen?

530
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,180
-- Is it like a daily, weekly, monthly kind of thing?
-- It happens on Bitcoin.

531
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:59,770
It's less and less frequent, but there have been a number of them recently

532
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,209
because it requires tremendous computational power.

533
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:09,270
So they tend to be more organized or somebody screws up or something.

534
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,150
But oftentimes they might be more organized around that on other chains,

535
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,050
it will happen much more frequently if there is less computational power.

536
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,369
I mean, reorgs are a thing you have to architect for.

537
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,569
And then that means that when you do Blockchain analysis,

538
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,180
you can almost never be 100%.

539
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:34,199
But the longer it hangs out in as far as transaction confirmations goes, you can get,

540
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,689
you can get more and more confirmation around it.

541
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,469
-- Just
-- a side question because I was looking

542
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,760
at some Blockchain hash rate graphs and it's like

543
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:44,390
in a period of 24 hours or while in a period of basically two days,

544
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,939
it seems to vary between

545
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:51,160
like 124 million and 174 million, which is like, that's a huge variation is,

546
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,420
do you have any idea why?

547
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,239
-- That is?
-- I only have theories.

548
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,119
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not an expert on mining hash power.

549
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,589
There's other people who are, I think a couple of those things are

550
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:08,829
based on obviously power. You know, what is the price of electricity where you are?

551
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,290
Some of it? Is when you get new hardware in or you don't.

552
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,910
So you'll see spikes around that.

553
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,550
But I also think some of it is redirection of the hash rate to other chains.

554
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,790
So there is a whole liquid market around this new chains coming.

555
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,869
We're going to focus hash rate over here.

556
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,390
And some of these companies either will do

557
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,469
it themselves or they have consumer products where

558
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:39,109
you can say I want to focus your hash rate on this compatible chain or not.

559
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,339
And they'll go like, OK, here's a chain that's about to launch.

560
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,339
Let's like hash the craziness out of it for like the

561
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:48,010
next two weeks and then we can pre mine everything,

562
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,530
we can control the stuff.

563
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,069
So there's a,

564
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:55,930
there's a liquidity market in hash rates depending on how old your hardware is,

565
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,849
what algorithms it supports.

566
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:01,239
-- So it could be, it could be related to that as well.
-- That is awesome.

567
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,300
All right, we are nearing the end of our time.

568
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,979
So Dave, I will give you the last word before we.

569
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,420
Thanks Josh. It's been great to talk with you today.

570
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,880
It's been great to talk about how cipher trace works with Cryptocurrency

571
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,000
exchanges with individuals who might have

572
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,949
had stolen currencies with the regulators,

573
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:26,400
with the banks to grow the Cryptocurrency economy.

574
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,630
We're working across the world with all of these individuals and these companies,

575
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,709
we want to see Cryptocurrency become a dominant player in the financial markets

576
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,079
-- and that's our goal.
-- That's awesome. What a cool goal. All right.

577
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,939
So I will put links to all of this stuff in the show notes.

578
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:45,500
So anyone listening, don't worry about writing it down,

579
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,800
just head over to the show notes, find it.

580
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,339
And

581
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,410
yeah, I guess. Thank you, Curt and Dave.

582
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,380
This was absolutely fascinating and of course,

583
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,369
lovely off topic at places as always, but it is, it was fun.

584
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,349
