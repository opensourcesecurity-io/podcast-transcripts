Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,090
Kurt Siefried and my partner in connecting the dots.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,670
-- Josh Pressers
-- connecting the dots.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,869
I suppose we're kind of doing that today.

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,229
I always remember those when, when the activity books, when we were kids,

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,899
they had those dot connecting things.

6
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:22,110
And

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,500
if you just like obviously being the the rigid engineering mind, I am

8
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:30,290
the shortest distance between two points is a line.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,069
So I of course,

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,419
always drew the straight line whereas you obviously had to give some curve and

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,450
form to them to actually look like the thing you were trying to do.

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:38,540
So anyway.

13
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,619
-- Well,
-- so, so there's a really fascinating article in wired about stolen bicycles

14
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:43,810
and how

15
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:46,799
like there's a lot of stolen bicycles to the point where like

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,520
even in my local police force is saying use bike index.org,

17
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:50,290
like straight up there

18
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:53,283
advice on bicycle theft is register your bike with bike

19
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:54,513
index.org

20
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,542
and like that's it, there's no part to it.

21
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:58,652
It's like trying to like good luck getting it, not stolen.

22
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,792
-- Like, I mean,
-- you're never going to get it back.

23
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:04,093
Well, no, actually quite a few people do get their bikes back.

24
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:07,322
Well, not quite a few, some people get their bikes back now because, you know,

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,212
the police, well be because the police, you know, for example,

26
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:13,313
when they're pulling people over who are on bicycles,

27
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:16,623
-- but maybe they don't own and then they check the index number and
-- voila,

28
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:17,932
the police check it

29
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:20,096
or when they recover stolen property. Right.

30
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:23,055
Like they, you know, they're like, find a garage with, you know,

31
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,195
whatever a shed with a bunch of bicycles in it.

32
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,706
Like that crazy story where that guy,

33
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,935
they found something like several million dollars and stolen,

34
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,236
used tools in a storage locker.

35
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:35,416
Yeah, that, over like a decade this person was just stealing tools and

36
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:39,066
-- doing nothing with them apparently. Yeah,
-- that was weird. Right.

37
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,136
Anyways, but back to this.

38
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:40,286
So,

39
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,776
so somebody actually decided to do

40
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:44,575
some investigation and basically long story short

41
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:45,445
there's like

42
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:51,049
a bike ring theft being run by a guy in Mexico who gets bikes stolen in the US, shipped

43
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:52,418
all over the place

44
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,778
and then, you know, sold because I guess bikes,

45
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,698
high end bikes kind of keep their resale value pretty good.

46
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,859
You know, like a lot of things when you steal them and try to pawn them, you're gonna,

47
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,418
you're gonna get pennies on the dollar.

48
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,009
-- I
-- mean, you're still getting like,

49
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:07,899
50 cents on the dollar or less when you read the article.

50
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:08,038
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:11,179
But still that's a lot more than five cents on the dollar, like, for a power tool.

52
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,819
I mean, that's fair. But, and also

53
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:13,229
there's a lot,

54
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,352
a lot of people who would be happy to buy a $5000 bicycle at

55
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:20,722
half price and not carefully check the serial number that it's stolen or not.

56
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,462
Well, in bikes are weird like that. Like, I have a bike.

57
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:27,182
It's, it's not super awesome, but I, I ride it a lot, like 1000 miles a year,

58
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:28,701
give or take and

59
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,061
it is strained.

60
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:34,401
Like every now and then I will look at you the used bike market and it varies widely.

61
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,932
Like sometimes there's bikes that are selling for a couple 100 bucks.

62
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:38,731
It's like, that should definitely be way more than that.

63
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,001
And there's other times it's like

64
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:40,852
that's the new

65
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:44,845
price. Why would anyone buy your used bike for the same price? It's very strange.

66
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:47,125
-- It's a weird market.
-- Well, same thing with the PC market, right?

67
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,835
L TT has done this where they go through some

68
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,824
of the online PC sales and it's kind of like,

69
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:51,035
you know,

70
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:53,744
it's like twice what it would cost just to buy the parts and build it yourself.

71
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,184
-- Like,
-- what the hell? That's fair. That's fair. Ok. Anyway,

72
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:57,235
but back to this. So

73
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:00,065
I know what was most interesting to me is that

74
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:03,675
I don't want to say this is the perfect crime, but it's very close,

75
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,024
I think in some ways because it's like the Superman crime, you know, we we,

76
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,548
we steal a fraction of a penny from every transaction and nobody notices.

77
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,787
And that's the thing with bike theft. Like

78
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,667
when you go to report a bike theft, you know, it's like the big Lebowski.

79
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:16,227
It's like, oh, yeah.

80
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,468
You know, we'll have detectives working on that triple shifts,

81
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:19,587
like around the clock.

82
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:20,667
No, like,

83
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:24,188
has a bike theft ever been properly investigated?

84
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,908
Well, in this case, it was because they actually,

85
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,447
once the guy brought the evidence to the cops, it was kind of,

86
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:32,158
I think it's one of those cases where it's so shameful that they kind of have

87
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,947
to investigate because the next step is going to the news and then of course,

88
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,147
the news is going to be like, you know,

89
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,710
so and so found a bike theft.

90
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,951
The cops don't care,

91
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,591
they don't.

92
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:46,830
Ok. But this, I think ties in with some other more security oriented topics

93
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:47,660
where

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,380
it feels like everyone is getting breached right now,

95
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,430
which I think is the opposite of the bike story

96
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,671
because they are. Well, no, no, it's not just that they are.

97
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:59,511
It's that this is, this is, this is the,

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,421
I think the other side of the coin to the

99
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,791
bike theft story where like there's always been bike thefts.

100
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:04,753
It's always been,

101
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:05,634
we'll say

102
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:07,983
small scale theft

103
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,033
that you go to the police and they just don't care.

104
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:14,554
It's like everyone has always been breached, but now they have to talk about it.

105
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:17,593
Thanks. To the SEC and other federal rules.

106
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:20,233
Actually, one quick point, it's not that the cops don't care so much.

107
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:23,403
But for example, one time my license plate got spray painted,

108
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:24,273
right.

109
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,854
And I'm like, why would they spray paint my license plate?

110
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,834
And then my neighbor was complaining that they did as well.

111
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,414
And I'm like, hey, I'm glad they didn't spray paint my car.

112
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,040
They just spray painted the license plate. Why?

113
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,510
That was literally my question.

114
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,390
So I took a picture, went to the cop shop because it's close to where I used to live,

115
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,089
to report it.

116
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,519
Right.

117
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,100
And it's funny because the cops like he's like, you want to report this, I'm like,

118
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,269
yeah, I just want to report this like I know you're not gonna do anything.

119
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,709
He's like, oh, ok. And he gets the form and hands it to me,

120
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,429
right?

121
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,239
And because I'm like, yeah, if I don't report it,

122
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,670
you guys don't know about it and like, nothing's gonna happen.

123
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,519
Like there, there's no possibility of change.

124
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:03,869
But at least, you know, because if 1000 if this happens once in a while, yeah,

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,989
whatever, who cares?

126
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,079
But if it's happening consistently, the cops will be like, yeah,

127
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,239
maybe we'll have a patrol drive through your alley way once in a while or something.

128
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,880
Funding of police work is driven by data.

129
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,826
So if they don't have any data showing any crime, they're gonna be like, cool.

130
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:19,147
Like, why would we send officers over there.

131
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:22,777
We have enough, like, we have so much real crime to deal with

132
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:24,907
and that's kind of the nature of security work too.

133
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,736
It's like, like I have a bunch of backup projects to do at the CS A, like,

134
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,916
I've backed up our core stuff,

135
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:32,066
but there's a bunch of stuff we should really back up better and more regularly.

136
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:32,596
But, like,

137
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:35,147
and, you know, it hasn't caught fire, it's pretty reliable.

138
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,506
I've got all this other,

139
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,914
honestly, more high value work to do.

140
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,553
So I'm going to go do that.

141
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:41,553
You know what I mean? Like,

142
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,493
and I think that's a big part of this is this.

143
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,414
I, I love the idea of this,

144
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,294
not just mandatory reporting but mandatory reporting

145
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,264
to a centralized source that then collates

146
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:54,273
it and sees patterns because we've had this happen in Canada with car fires,

147
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:57,574
car fires are not, like, really reported. And so

148
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,454
sure there was the Mercedes.

149
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:03,121
Was it Mercedes smart cars or it was, I think it was some brand of Mercedes was like,

150
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,161
just catching fire.

151
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,760
And at first they're like, oh, yeah, that's fine. It's your fault, whatever.

152
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,580
But then it turns out like 40 or 50 of these cars have caught fire and they're like,

153
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,950
-- oh, yeah, I guess we have to do a recall.
-- Yep.

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,860
-- I remember that you told me about that a while back.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:19,621
And this is, I think the difference is like the train derailments.

156
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:22,121
In the US, remember, train derailments were so hot last year

157
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,750
and it turns out of all people,

158
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,079
NASA runs the train derailment safety reporting program

159
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,700
that all the train companies promised to join

160
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:31,809
and didn't.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,140
Well, yeah, I mean, they're never going to unless you make them.

162
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,369
I mean, that's the other part of stories like this, right? Is that

163
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,950
the, the, like, like voluntary reporting and things like that

164
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,309
-- is, it doesn't happen
-- well or they report it but it's like, oh yeah,

165
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,750
we had a minor train

166
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,309
related incident

167
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,160
and you know what they mean is like there's like

168
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,160
400 rail cars on fire and like toxic smoke and like

169
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,200
a small town like that time, a small town burnt down in Quebec, you know,

170
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,649
like because a train derailed

171
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,399
and that's the thing like so

172
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,480
there I think there not only has to be

173
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:07,799
reporting but sort of structured

174
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,570
reporting like, like

175
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,239
how many people died, how many people were injured, how

176
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,160
they injured?

177
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,890
Somebody has to come up with the standard kind of

178
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,119
like the health reporting standard like bitten by turtle,

179
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,000
bitten by turtle second incident apparently is a thing.

180
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,489
-- Yeah,
-- people laugh at that. So for anyone who doesn't know

181
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:25,589
in the, I don't, I,

182
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,209
I imagine this is an international standard but there's

183
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,470
all these codes that when you're doing health care,

184
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,850
you have to type in like what,

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,420
what happened to the person and

186
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,739
there's like ridiculous things like you know,

187
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,799
bitten by whale or something like that.

188
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,690
And there's an enormous number of possible things you can

189
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,980
claim had happened to a person which you make fun of it because it is funny.

190
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:52,010
But at the same time, you need this kind of data.

191
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,519
Yeah, but somebody put that code in there because it happened enough times

192
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,369
that they went, we need to actually have a structured code for this.

193
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,609
Uh fun fact, the US uses I CD nine

194
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,649
and Canada uses I CD 10.

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,529
So you're just a version behind us, which is interesting.

196
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:06,779
Well,

197
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:10,809
we have more centralized healthcare so it's probably easier to deploy updates.

198
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,750
-- Right.
-- That's probably true.

199
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,869
That's probably true and whatever,

200
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:17,019
it's, it's interesting. Ok. Now

201
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,700
we hear about the bike story,

202
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,190
we hear about everyone getting hacked which they are and I'm not,

203
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,109
we're not going to recount all of them because it's,

204
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,549
you know, like Ticketmaster and Snowflake and A MD and everyone's on the list.

205
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,309
You know, it's bananas.

206
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,869
Technically, I think snowflakes still denying it a bit.

207
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,349
-- Even though it's pretty clearly them,
-- they're busy trying to blame someone else.

208
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:35,929
I think

209
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,109
it's,

210
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,469
it may be someone else's fault. We don't know it doesn't matter.

211
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,030
And in fairness if it is credential stuffing,

212
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,239
ok? But they really should have forced two fa or M fa and that's another show.

213
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,510
But we gotta, I think we gotta start talking about what are basic table steaks

214
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,250
and like things like two fa and M fa and single sign on are no longer a nice to have.

215
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,799
They are

216
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,179
-- like tying your shoelaces in the morning.
-- Ok.

217
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,669
We will talk about this soon because here's my comment about that.

218
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,929
It is easy to say that multi factor authentication is a table

219
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,179
stake and it's definitely something that absolutely everyone should be doing,

220
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,450
but it's still too hard to do.

221
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,010
-- Like,
-- yes, that's the problem. And HTTP S used to be too hard to do and we fixed it.

222
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,030
It was yes,

223
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,130
between Cloud

224
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,960
and Lutz and Crypt. It worked. Now.

225
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,039
That's right.

226
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,010
I'm not saying m fa can't be done.

227
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,130
-- I'm just saying some investment is needed to make it more possible
-- tangentially.

228
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,820
There was a recent past Keys event this week and it was

229
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,309
fascinating because it was a security event from the past key five

230
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,330
to alliance blah, blah, blah.

231
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,409
And it was pretty much everything was focused on usability.

232
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,130
It has to be, yeah, I know. Right.

233
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,450
But to me there's actually that hope now of like usability first and then hopefully

234
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,119
we can get some security out of it versus the old style of like security,

235
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,210
security, security

236
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,750
f the users. And of course they don't want to do it. So we don't get the security. But

237
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:53,130
back to this, the other fascinating thing is,

238
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,039
is like without that centralized reporting, you know, it's just kind of like, yeah,

239
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:58,419
I hear a bunch of bikes are getting stolen but is it really that bad?

240
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,280
Is it 5 55,000?

241
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,289
Like, those are very different numbers.

242
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,349
Like, if, if the city of Edmonton had five bike thefts a year,

243
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,789
I mean, wow, that would be awesome.

244
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:10,429
You know, for a million people in the metro area,

245
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,150
I'm assuming it's more than five.

246
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,750
But is it like 555,000? I have no idea of even like what logarithmic scale to use

247
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,989
little in the number.

248
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,099
Well, and this is the same thing with breaches,

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,830
right?

250
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,070
And, and this is funny because

251
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,489
the, the cybersecurity insurance industry

252
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:34,369
-- is starting to tease this kind of stuff out
-- because they don't want to pay out.

253
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,289
-- They're getting tired of it.
-- Exactly.

254
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:40,849
And so they're like, the insurance industry is notorious for having

255
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,929
tons of data for anything they're doing.

256
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,210
And obviously they're going to be able to recognize and what I love though too,

257
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:51,489
like the insurance industry, like anytime you're talking about statistics,

258
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,796
there's a whole, you know, correlation is not causation.

259
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,656
The insurance industry doesn't care

260
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,895
if they found correlation.

261
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:02,015
They're, they're going with it. You know,

262
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:05,856
if red cars get in more accidents, they're charging more for red cars,

263
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,226
-- they don't care why
-- causation doesn't

264
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,736
matter as much as people think it does

265
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:14,395
in the sense of causation really only matters if you're trying to fix it.

266
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:18,575
And by definition, insurance happens after the event like it's too late.

267
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,976
That's true. That's a good point. Actually. And security

268
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,281
in general happens after the event, I think more often than not.

269
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,581
Yeah, we built it like five years ago and now it's broken.

270
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:27,971
Oops,

271
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:33,771
I want to tie in one last thing now to this cornucopia of stories we're talking about.

272
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:38,502
And this is a blog post from Trevor Dunlop who we know from GSD things.

273
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:41,932
He was a student at North Carolina State University doing

274
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:45,202
a bunch of research around vulnerability statistics and information.

275
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:48,262
He's at uh Chain Guard now. He wrote a blog post

276
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,947
link to it on the chamber blog.

277
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,788
And he basically has he titled Vulnerability Fixes in plain sight.

278
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,007
How your scanners are missing hundreds of vulnerabilities.

279
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,838
And basically what this is

280
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:59,268
is Trevor has done the research

281
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,507
to and, and I, I'll,

282
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,547
I'll explain the research and I'll explain what Kurt and I told

283
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,187
Trevor when he came to us like years ago with this,

284
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,607
but he did this research and he basically found that

285
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,148
if you look at change logs and open source software,

286
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,567
you can find boatloads of a fixed security vulnerability

287
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,833
that either they fix them,

288
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,653
not knowing they were security vulnerabilities

289
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,124
or they knew they were vulnerabilities and

290
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,874
just never bothered to get like a CV ID for this stuff,

291
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,573
right? Because it's a pain in the butt. That's why.

292
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:29,734
So I remember Trevor came to us with this research a long time ago and he was like,

293
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,593
look at what I found and he was a student at the time and it was like,

294
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:34,843
if you give this to people, they're going to hate you

295
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:35,794
because

296
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,554
people can't handle the amount of work they have today.

297
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:42,833
And if you show up with like, an enormous amount of new work, they aren't going to

298
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,219
take it.

299
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,500
Well, and I think I've talked to,

300
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,280
I bet four or five people who've done similar work to this and the response is

301
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:54,119
always the same word is like universal disdain of we're going to kill the messenger.

302
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:54,590
Yeah,

303
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,200
-- absolutely.
-- Which is sad

304
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,530
dude.

305
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,270
Same thing happened to the guy who wanted doctors to

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,599
wash their hands after handling dead bodies before they,

307
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,369
you know, help pregnant women deliver their babies.

308
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:07,640
Yeah. They, what they, the doctors made so much fun of him. They drove him insane.

309
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:10,080
They had him declared insane,

310
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:11,599
right? Same guy,

311
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,599
the guy that won a Nobel Prize for, you know,

312
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:16,130
proving most stomach ulcers are just take a course of

313
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,919
antibiotics for 10 days and you're good to go,

314
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,159
right?

315
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:19,479
Like,

316
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,049
and he infected himself and then cured himself and ended up getting a Nobel Prize.

317
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,229
But like straight up there was a huge industry of like, oh, you're stressed.

318
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,229
That's why you have a stomach ulcer,

319
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,520
take this pill every day for the rest of your life.

320
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,559
Yada yada yada.

321
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,270
And it's kind of almost worse than shoot

322
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,070
the messenger because like a perfect example,

323
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,409
like pick literally any the open source project that

324
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,429
is big and not a CV numbering authority,

325
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,119
which is basically the default because there's only 400 CNAs globally.

326
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,580
And half, more than half of them are companies.

327
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,200
-- Very few open source projects are CN
-- A

328
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,440
S

329
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,780
like a very simple example, you look at Korda, right,

330
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,260
big Blockchain project thing written in Java.

331
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,630
And they have like three CV S3 CV S

332
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:01,570
from 2019 and like they have a very, actually a well structured change log with like

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,359
security issues, labeled us security

334
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,729
updates and issues.

335
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,479
-- Before
-- we go too far, we have to clarify one very,

336
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:13,530
very important thing about this topic, which is if we talk about bike,

337
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,330
we just talked about bicycles and how it's under reported.

338
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,570
Then we talked about

339
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,049
the federal requirements for reporting breaches.

340
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,809
And now we're talking about open source and

341
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,770
a bunch of hidden vulnerabilities in no way.

342
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,690
Are we suggesting there should be like some sort of federal regulation

343
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,070
man dating open source projects,

344
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,140
report security vulnerabilities because they already are overworked enough.

345
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,869
This is 100% not a job the, the project should have to do.

346
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,219
So I don't want anyone to think we're going to say that.

347
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:44,869
-- Uh
-- just a thought experiment for a moment.

348
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,150
What if you had a federal requirement that if you sold a product or service

349
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,380
you had to number one do s bomb.

350
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,979
Let's agree on that as stage one,

351
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,400
like you got to know what your shipping kind of thing.

352
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,159
Right. And that's, that's kind of start going to happen.

353
00:14:57,219 --> 00:15:00,450
-- I bet
-- Kurt's going to invent the cr a, let's see if he doesn't

354
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,059
basically.

355
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,289
And then the second question is what if you had to

356
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:08,679
then report in a structured manner to a centralized source.

357
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,820
And I'm going to say CV, because there's nothing else at this point that can do it.

358
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,210
And CV, as broken as it is, it's all we got

359
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,049
for now.

360
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,130
And you know what if they basically had to then

361
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,789
essentially put the, the incentive, well, not the incentive.

362
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,690
Well, the incentive would be, you know, a paddling

363
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,530
but you put the work on to the vendor

364
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,590
shipping the stuff to like actually look at their open

365
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:31,309
source change logs and search for the word security and they have to go get the CV S.

366
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:36,260
-- You almost invented the CR A almost you're
-- close. What is the CR A for those of us?

367
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,859
That's the Eu Cyber Resiliency Act,

368
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,900
the European Union is putting it together. They have some originally,

369
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,869
it was going to cover all open source projects and thank goodness a

370
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,900
bunch of open source foundations like banded together and got them to,

371
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,096
to that silliness, but it does mandate things like, you know,

372
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:55,955
vulnerability reporting and, and S bombs and,

373
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,306
and things like that and tracking your

374
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,625
dependencies that are included in your products.

375
00:15:59,635 --> 00:15:59,885
Well,

376
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,226
I'm saying not so much vulnerability

377
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:05,265
reporting but it mandating vulnerability searching,

378
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,825
right? I understand that and it's not there yet.

379
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:12,226
That could be a logical next step. But yes, you are absolutely correct that

380
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:16,306
the consumers of open source should bear much

381
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:19,752
-- more of this responsibility for things like this.
-- Well, they also get the benefit.

382
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,452
Now, of course,

383
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:23,591
obviously there's all the downsides because like every product would then slow

384
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,711
down their updates and wait for other people to update first,

385
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,831
to report the vulnerabilities first and do the work first.

386
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:31,471
And I guess that what I'm proposing would absolutely probably be far worse than we,

387
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,271
we have today.

388
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,531
It's not that we can't put this on the open source.

389
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,552
It's that we can't, in the sense of like, it's physically impossible.

390
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:41,911
Like arguing with a black hole that it does not exist. Can't put this on open source.

391
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:44,197
There's multi pull angles to this, right.

392
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:48,728
There are projects that are just too busy because they're one person or whatever,

393
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:48,978
right?

394
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,458
And they don't care about doing the grunt work of vulnerabilities and that's fine.

395
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,398
There's nothing wrong with that.

396
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,437
Now, at the same time, there's nowhere they can go for help.

397
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,357
There are projects that have security people but they,

398
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,447
they've tried to get CV ES and they can't be bothered to do it.

399
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:05,588
I love that CV E and CV S scoring has gotten so painful that curl

400
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:06,338
and Linux Kel

401
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,738
-- became CNAs.
-- Actually, it's probably less

402
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,523
painful now than it used to be.

403
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:13,483
I mean, it still sucks, but it's, I think it definitely sucks.

404
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,894
-- Less
-- minor fun fact tangent.

405
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:20,542
So you know how the NVED labels vulnerabilities with their CWE, their root cause.

406
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,104
No, they don't. They use the simplified view of CWE.

407
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:29,843
So I actually asked them to correct ac we in, in an item

408
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,583
to, for it to be correct. And they said, yeah, we don't support that.

409
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,024
CWE, we'll use the parent of it, which is more

410
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,069
in general and because they use a simplified view of CWE,

411
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,670
which I did not even know this.

412
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,280
And I've been doing this, I'm on the board of CWE and I didn't know this.

413
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,089
I used to be on the board of CV E and I did not know

414
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,329
that the NVD uses a simplified view of CV. We, so their data is wrong.

415
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,770
It's not as fine grained as it should be.

416
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,640
-- It's
-- not wrong, it is wrong. It isn't as good as it could be.

417
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,890
Well,

418
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,290
they're using, it's like using CWE 20 input validation.

419
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,020
-- It's, it's a meaningless, it's useless
-- there. Some of them are, I agree.

420
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:08,069
So in this case, they use CWE uh

421
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,510
the parent which is way less fine grained

422
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,839
and doesn't narrow down what's actually the problem.

423
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,770
Ok. I have two comments for you.

424
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,400
Number one,

425
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,780
the fact that you can mail NVD right now

426
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,780
is impressive because it's basically been dead for months.

427
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,160
Congratulations there.

428
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,030
But more importantly is if you look at actually the Cwes

429
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,520
and their CBS S scores and all the things they do,

430
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,439
the volume of vulnerabilities they handle is enormous

431
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,270
and

432
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:34,880
it's,

433
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:35,219
the

434
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,040
data quality is bad.

435
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:37,640
They,

436
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,160
well, yes, you could say that the community help except they don't

437
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,599
because they're paying a contractor and,

438
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:47,280
and the community helping with federal projects is some weird thing that,

439
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,829
that kind of can't happen.

440
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,439
But, yes, I mean, fundamentally

441
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,310
the issue is that they used all of CWE,

442
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,150
it would slow them down even more than they already are slowed down.

443
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:00,329
And my guess is they would screw it up even worse

444
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,560
than they do now because if you look at the Cwes,

445
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:03,939
they get a lot of them wrong a

446
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,619
lot.

447
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,180
Well,

448
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,060
and also people parsing the data would have to like

449
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,410
all of a sudden handle like twice as many Cwes.

450
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,579
-- That's
-- irrelevant. The people processing this stuff are doing it all automated.

451
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,885
They don't care if it's right or wrong or anything. They're just,

452
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,244
they're just showing people whatever it says we don't care.

453
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:22,935
-- But
-- back to this, like the thing that gets me is this is, it's a,

454
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:27,444
it's a scale problem of, it's essentially, I don't want to say it's intractable,

455
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,354
but it's almost intractable in the sense of

456
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:31,484
there's not enough money

457
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:34,199
to pay a, like there's not enough

458
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,300
to have a single centralized source, do it quote unquote properly. Right.

459
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,079
It would require so much money to get it done. Right.

460
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,760
And I think what

461
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,079
I would say is is ideally we want to make like a best effort,

462
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,910
kind of a reasonable commercial approach.

463
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,260
Like, you know, it's not reasonable to spend 1000 hours on a single CV, E, like

464
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,300
-- half an hour or an hour
-- unless it's log for shell. Yeah.

465
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,859
Well, and, and that's a, yeah.

466
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:58,410
And, well,

467
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,619
and that's interesting because that's more of the detection side of things.

468
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:01,859
I,

469
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,969
I think conceptually we have to split the

470
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,579
vulnerability kind of reporting from the vulnerability mapping

471
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,500
because

472
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,520
it doesn't matter how much I know about the world,

473
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,800
there will always be something I don't know about that uses this.

474
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,079
-- So
-- here's how Trevor kind of ends his, his piece.

475
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:23,290
It does turn into a shameless plug for chain guards product, which I guess, I mean,

476
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,469
corporate blogs, whatever.

477
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:24,609
But

478
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,189
the idea is, I mean, yeah, that's fair.

479
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:31,479
That's kind of the point of corporate blogs like is to bring people in

480
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,130
and show your product and show the value which in some cases like this,

481
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:39,107
-- there is actual value. Thank goodness. So
-- here's the thing, the the intent

482
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:43,577
is he says we should instead of focusing on vulnerabilities which

483
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:46,006
is upgrade all of our stuff as fast as possible.

484
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,327
And I've been thinking about that for longer than I should have.

485
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:53,786
And I don't think that is a, I think that is just as ridiculous as expecting

486
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:54,097
it's a

487
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:58,906
pipe dream. Every project to acquire CD ES for everything because like

488
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:04,114
people can't upgrade all of their dependencies as fast as they can. They just can't.

489
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,994
Well, and it creates a lot of friction work.

490
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:09,703
Like, uh let's say I have a bunch of docker containers using an old version of docker,

491
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:11,734
but it's on an internal network only and hard to attack.

492
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:11,984
To me,

493
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,774
part of the problem is what is the value

494
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:16,083
of actually updating all this stuff on the fly?

495
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,813
And the thing is to get to the point where

496
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,813
you can safely update all the stuff on the flight.

497
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:23,654
You need a huge level of maturity and testing and everything, right?

498
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:24,303
Like the outside

499
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:24,571
bills.

500
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,480
Colonel, most of us just don't and can't

501
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,041
exactly it because you can't run a business like that. Right.

502
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,281
So I want to tie this back now. Well, we'll kind of head head backwards where

503
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,331
if you look at the rules like the SEC

504
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,081
has for filing these reports for breaches and stuff,

505
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,321
there's a bar to reach, you have to be a certain size company.

506
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:44,801
Well,

507
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:46,921
you have to be publicly traded and then

508
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,171
even the breach has to follow certain requirements,

509
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:49,441
right?

510
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,969
And so it, it's very similar like that, like all of these security things that,

511
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,479
you know, going from the bicycles to the sec to open source with all this stuff is

512
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,239
there's these like there's these bars you have to hit

513
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,089
because people say like it can't be every single thing,

514
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:04,300
right?

515
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,339
If every company had to report every single possible security incident that the

516
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,880
SEC would need to hire 10 times more people than they have.

517
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,560
Right.

518
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:18,119
Because anyone who's ever worked, like, in a sock at, uh, a large company security

519
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,699
center, you probably have somewhere between 10 and 100 like,

520
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,869
active investigations at any point in time.

521
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,709
Now, granted, 99% of them are nothing but

522
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,339
they exist. Right?

523
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,800
The one thing that gets me is at some point we kind of have to have uh

524
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,979
like, and when I say structure data, I don't mean like super

525
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,640
JSON structured like CV scheme, OS V scheme or whatever.

526
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,439
But I mean, just even like putting in some, taking some keywords like security for co

527
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:45,969
and

528
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:46,670
law

529
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,290
in a change lock is immensely helpful. And I do think that

530
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,319
that might be a reasonable thing to ask these projects to say like, look, no,

531
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:58,760
I don't think it is if you know, or think reasonably

532
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,589
that this is a security related thing,

533
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,109
then please put the word security in your commit message in your change log message

534
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,869
in your whatever message so that at least I have a chance of finding it.

535
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,079
I don't think that's

536
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:11,579
apply

537
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:13,114
suggestion.

538
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:16,015
-- I think,
-- well, I don't think it's plausible in the sense of it'll happen.

539
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,224
I, I don't think it's, it's reasonable at all.

540
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:21,895
I think open source projects just they're already really busy

541
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:25,984
and giving, putting even something that sounds as minor as that on top of them.

542
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,935
Is going to create a ton of mental burden because now you have to be like,

543
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:31,354
is it a security vulnerability?

544
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:34,625
Is it not a security vulnerability? Should I maybe add the tag just in case?

545
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,175
It's definitely,

546
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:39,319
it sounds simple but it's not,

547
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:42,760
it's, it's a very mentally taxing thing.

548
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,000
So it's fixing a bug.

549
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,410
-- Yes.
-- But they want to fix the bugs because they like doing that.

550
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,979
-- They don't like thinking about security.
-- I don't know.

551
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:53,380
I just let me give you a great example of this. I have a perfect example.

552
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,439
I edit this podcast every week.

553
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,155
I like editing the podcast because I get to make myself sound smart.

554
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:03,314
And if I want to, I can make Kurt sound dumb

555
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:04,694
sometimes I do.

556
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,064
But no, I'm kidding.

557
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:07,885
But I enjoy

558
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:10,994
the art of audio editing because I've learned a

559
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:13,285
lot and I learn something every time I do it

560
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,895
when I am done,

561
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:18,364
I have to think of an episode title

562
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,064
which I'm not very good at

563
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,175
which is fine.

564
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,199
But then

565
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,369
I have to add the keywords, the tags

566
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:30,270
to the post, to the, the blog post and the podcast.

567
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,920
I hate adding the tags

568
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,410
that feels super minor and compared to literally

569
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,500
spending an hour editing audio and constructing show notes

570
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,439
and coming up with the show title

571
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:46,140
and editing the graphic that goes with the podcast.

572
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,099
-- I thought those were all dally generated or whatever
-- now. No, I haven't.

573
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:51,880
No, I quit using A I because all the images were crap that I came

574
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,369
with.

575
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,060
So I just, I go back, I went back to Pix A Bay

576
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,140
and then I usually crop them and make them into what I want.

577
00:24:59,319 --> 00:24:59,989
You get the point.

578
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,739
Like I do all of this, like incredibly,

579
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,579
like I would say detailed work that is not simple at all.

580
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,760
And then when I have to think of like five words to describe the podcast,

581
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,420
I literally hate doing it.

582
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,449
And I, I've,

583
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,010
I've stopped editing

584
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,300
and like gone to bed because I don't want to come up with those stupid tags.

585
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,339
Like for real, why don't

586
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:20,550
I?

587
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,420
No, because he'll do it wrong. But,

588
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:26,739
but anyway,

589
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,150
the, the point is asking someone to add a word,

590
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,910
one word to a commit message sounds trivial, but I promise you it is not,

591
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,890
I know it's not trivial.

592
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,369
But at the same time, see, there's what's fascinating to me is

593
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:41,589
on the one hand, we say you should not have expectations from open source and,

594
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,099
and the license is explicitly say, you know, like there's no guarantee, blah, blah,

595
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:46,469
blah.

596
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,420
But at the same time, there is sort of this expectation of

597
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,530
you should ship software that's not malicious.

598
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,189
I think we would all agree on that.

599
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,849
Like it's not containing malware or malicious or,

600
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,170
you know, like when left shift or um the he put in that denial of service, you know,

601
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,089
loop in the code.

602
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:03,319
It

603
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,050
everybody got upset.

604
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,250
There's a general expectation that you should sort of fix things.

605
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,869
So a good example is uh youtube downloader was broken for like a year.

606
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,030
There's like a one line or two line code fix

607
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,449
to handle the new youtube I DS and they hadn't,

608
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,170
they put the code in but not built a new release of it.

609
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,250
People have an expectation of it should be fixed

610
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,589
and kind of fit for purpose to some degree.

611
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,890
But at the same time, like, yeah, obviously, well, it's free and it's,

612
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,729
you didn't pay for it and you don't even know who built it.

613
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:30,329
So, like,

614
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:31,890
really can you expect this?

615
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,890
You know, like if you put out a food hamper,

616
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,369
you're expected to put out food that's not going

617
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,400
to kill somebody and have like poison in it.

618
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,439
That's true. That's true. That would be illegal.

619
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:40,930
Yeah.

620
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,020
And so, like, at some point I'm not saying this is like a legal thing,

621
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,260
but there are sort of societal expectations

622
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:49,880
that, you know, like when people jaywalk, I'm ok if they jaywalk,

623
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,910
if they look and like, don't run right in front of my car.

624
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,599
Like if they Jaywalk intelligently cool. You do that.

625
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,729
I get it because it's a long walk to go to the corner.

626
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,530
But on the other hand, I see people like, just, you know,

627
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,530
on their ipod with their earphones on, staring at the phone, like,

628
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,790
just blindly stepping up into the middle of traffic and I'm like,

629
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
on a practical level,

630
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,280
you're gonna get smushed

631
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:08,130
at some point.

632
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:09,410
And

633
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,430
I kind of feel like that's the thing with open source.

634
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,699
Like, on a practical level,

635
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:16,339
if you don't take some accountability for what and how you're using open source,

636
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,099
you're gonna get smooshed.

637
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,849
Like an attacker is gonna find that you're using a way out of date thing and

638
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,250
be like, cool.

639
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,060
And I go,

640
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,729
I mean, so

641
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,849
this is interesting because I think you drastically changed your

642
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,400
point and maybe accidentally at the very end is you,

643
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,890
you started out talking about the societal like implications.

644
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,810
Well, what I'm saying is it's all levels,

645
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,199
-- it's both the provider and the user,
-- but the right.

646
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,920
So I think this is interesting and I need to think about this because

647
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,479
we generally talk about open source from the the kind of

648
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,939
expectation

649
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,859
and

650
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,260
we generally talk about open source talking

651
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,619
about like the responsibility of the developer,

652
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,239
which then it's easy to say the developer owes us nothing.

653
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,459
Open source owes us nothing.

654
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,209
So we're going to claim the creator

655
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,270
technically has no responsibility.

656
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,219
And the open source license even says they don't,

657
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:16,739
I think the the responsibility of the consumer is a topic not discussed very much

658
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,449
and we probably should, I think it comes up maybe more and more where there's,

659
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,989
there's a more prevailing attitude of like if you're using open source,

660
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,489
you need to be responsible for it.

661
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,010
It's more just risk management.

662
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,790
Yeah, I mean, it is risk management,

663
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,339
but it's more than that I think because risk

664
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,719
management is obviously just very focused on yourself.

665
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:35,400
But when we're talking about responsibility of a consumer of

666
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,849
open source that suggests there's some sort of bidirectional channel

667
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,150
and I,

668
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,369
I need to think about this. I think that's profound,

669
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,410
-- but I don't understand what I want to say yet.
-- Yeah, I see.

670
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,949
And this is a bad analogy, but for example, like,

671
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,609
it doesn't matter how bad the jaywalker is, they

672
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,729
have the right of way.

673
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:59,449
So even if they are breaking the law by walking across a highway and,

674
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,770
and they'll get a ticket for that,

675
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,550
they still have the right of way and you're not allowed to run them over.

676
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,170
-- Yeah,
-- if you hit them, you're in trouble.

677
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,250
I mean,

678
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,489
they will also get a ticket for being on the highway when they shouldn't have been.

679
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,089
But

680
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:13,275
yeah, you're not allowed to just be like, I ran him over no big deal.

681
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,324
I always love that when like I'll,

682
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,675
I'll cross the street at like there's those blinky lights,

683
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,564
you push the button and the lights going through the crosswalk and all that, right?

684
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:23,885
And I'll cross that one day, some old man started yelling at me and I was like,

685
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,724
if you hit me, it's your fault, like shut up,

686
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:32,324
-- like stop yelling at me.
-- It's basically always the car's fault essentially.

687
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,255
You know, it's like rear ending

688
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,885
it's always your fault for rear ending the other person.

689
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,994
-- That's right.
-- Exactly. It does it right. If, if

690
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,520
it doesn't matter what happened,

691
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,260
like it's your fault. Exactly. Anyway, ok,

692
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,239
I want to end this show because I need to think about

693
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,729
-- what you were talking about just now to add a
-- wrinkle to it.

694
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,729
I think there's also an element of how shall I say, of,

695
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,880
sort of practical responsibility.

696
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,579
So, for example,

697
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:55,859
my Children have the right of way crossing

698
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,640
the street at a crosswalk with blinking lights,

699
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,939
but I have also taught them to look both ways for moving cars.

700
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:02,959
Yes, I do agree with that.

701
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,520
So there's a sort of realistic element

702
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:09,035
where I, but I don't want to slip into victim blaming of saying like, oh,

703
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:11,964
you didn't look both ways before you cross the street and got run over too bad.

704
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:12,525
Right. Because,

705
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:13,474
you know,

706
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:16,334
like an old lady got run over in a marked crosswalk by a city bus and

707
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:19,765
I'm like a city bus has pretty good visibility except for the one pillar apparently.

708
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:22,714
And it's a professionally trained driver, you know, blah, blah, blah. Right.

709
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:23,435
But that's the point, right?

710
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,935
It's not just some like 20 year old or whatever, an 80 year old.

711
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:29,314
It's, it's a professional driver driving a commercial vehicle with other people,

712
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:33,435
like he's the captain or she is the captain of like a little ship basically in my mind.

713
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,800
Um So yeah, you can get married on a bus by the bus driver.

714
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,520
Small

715
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:41,189
-- dude, I
-- don't know it's Canada.

716
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,199
Canada is a weird place. Alright.

717
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,630
Um but,

718
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,949
but so there's like there's I wanna say like there's

719
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,650
that sort of practical real world element of responsibility of like

720
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,915
looking both ways when you cross the street, even if you have the right of way.

721
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,045
This is a lot to think about. So, thank you, Kurt, thank you ever for listening.
