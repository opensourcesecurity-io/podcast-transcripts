00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,270
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,609
Episode zero with myself Kurtz Fried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,050
Josh Pressers. Is it episode zero? Yeah, it would be zero, wouldn't it?

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,299
Yeah, it's zero.

4
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:20,889
Assuming we have an eight bit counter, we started counting at one. Now we're at 256.

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,770
So it's zero. Yeah,

6
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:22,629
eight bit counter.

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,739
It would, it would wrap around because if we're,

8
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:29,715
if we're counting an eight bit integer, that means we are unsigned.

9
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:34,735
So it does not support negative values. So happy episode 256 everybody.

10
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,814
You mean zero? It depends how many bits I can't count that high. I have nine bits.

11
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:42,014
Now you're a nine bit episode Kurt. Oh, we're trinary.

12
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:43,935
Trinary is hot.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,340
Is trinary hot.

14
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:49,669
I've, I've, I'm no, the Russians experimented with it and there's been some,

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,450
some stuff with like data storage.

16
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,110
What is trinary for anyone who has no idea what you just said?

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,349
Oh, it's three, it's three bit computing instead of two bit computing. No, no, no.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,630
Well, ok. Sort of

19
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:05,580
three bits means, but three bits means something a bit is a zero or a one. Well, ok.

20
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:07,089
Sorry, sorry. Three states.

21
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,474
Yes. Sorry. States not bits. I'm, I'm so used to a bit.

22
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:11,305
Yeah.

23
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,074
So, the idea is in, in, well,

24
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:15,794
basically it boils down to what's the smallest piece of information.

25
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:18,194
Yes. No. Cold hot on off

26
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:19,724
two states.

27
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:20,355
Right?

28
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,474
Because one state is, well,

29
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:25,724
you can't change state and that makes your computer slightly useless.

30
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:28,315
And so the idea with trinary computing was that

31
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:30,235
you'd have a possibility of three states and you

32
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:33,160
could hold bigger numbers and less space and blah, blah, blah.

33
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:38,559
And it turns out, yeah, it's just not a great idea. It had some physical limitations.

34
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,849
I looked into this when I was in college because

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,870
it came up in one of my engineering courses.

36
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,110
And I'm like, wow, this sounds amazing. And then I was like, nope, just, no.

37
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,940
Anyway, and I apologize. It's not

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,889
trinary, it's

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,480
ternary,

40
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,680
whatever. Who cares? Nerds.

41
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,220
Yeah.

42
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:54,925
So, anyway,

43
00:01:55,105 --> 00:02:00,144
I am so excited that we made it to nine bits of episode numbers.

44
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:04,625
But however, well, technically, I mean, if we get hit by a bus after this episode,

45
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,745
we never made it to nine bits.

46
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:06,675
But next time

47
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:10,264
I will make sure I edit and stage it quickly.

48
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:13,035
So there will be minimal chances of that happening.

49
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:16,225
I think just after the pneumonia, I'm a little bit more aware of my mortality.

50
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:21,009
Yeah. Right. I could have gone all the way wrong. I need a backup podcast host.

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,080
Now, that's what we need.

52
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,470
I'm pretty sure you could just rehash recordings of me through an A IML

53
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,229
thing and love it and then it could just be like

54
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,919
a random noise generator or something. It sounds great.

55
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,529
I believe I already qualify as one of them. I

56
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:38,240
want my co host to be a speak and spell. There you go. Oh, like Toy Story.

57
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,020
So, actually I have a speak and spell one of the originals. They, they re releases it

58
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,229
and the voice is different and they're like, oh original voice live.

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,690
And the thing is,

60
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,623
I love like the terribleness of the voice because it's so hilariously awesome.

61
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:56,302
I remember using speech recognition software dragon dictate 20 years ago

62
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:57,143
when you, you know,

63
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,462
bought a special headset with a special microphone and

64
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,302
it was terrible and useless and speech generation.

65
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:07,503
Of course, you know, oh, I, my first sound cards came with doctor Spa.

66
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:11,382
So, you know, dad and me how you feel. Those are awesome.

67
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:15,052
I love the voice of the, the text to speech. Anyway. Anyway,

68
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,735
we're not talking about synthesized speech today. Maybe another day.

69
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,725
I keep meaning to hack my speak and spell,

70
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,065
but we should do a deep fakes episode at some

71
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,115
point because that has really gone all the way wild.

72
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:29,916
It's fascinating. I keep meaning to try to deep fake you someday, but I'm lazy.

73
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,936
So it doesn't happen if anyone wants to be podcast famous, just deep fake.

74
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,936
Kurt send it to us. There you go.

75
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:37,636
Please don't make it too embarrassing.

76
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,255
We'll mention you potentially on one or more episodes.

77
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,326
No, I mean, technically I'll be mentioning them whether I like it or not.

78
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,360
Anyway. Anyway,

79
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm excited to talk about eight bits and this sounds like a weird topic,

80
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:53,050
but it is something close to my heart for a variety of reasons.

81
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,679
And most importantly, we are now at 256 episodes.

82
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,490
And you know what I keep thinking of in my brain

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,360
is when you zero index something because obviously when you have eight bits,

84
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:06,289
you can actually represent the numbers 0 to 255.

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,130
And so I like,

86
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,139
I've literally been thinking about this all week is

87
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,360
should we have done this in episode 255?

88
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:11,970
Instead,

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,089
I'm like

90
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,798
too late. It doesn't matter, it's too late because it's 256 day.

91
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:17,947
And that's one thing I love is I,

92
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,608
I think I actually successfully explained counting from zero versus one

93
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,488
to my son. Basically saying, look in classic math terms,

94
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:30,028
you're counting the end of an object. I have one apple, I have two apples.

95
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,558
But in computer terms, we're, we're basically,

96
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:36,388
it's more like a street address in that I need to go there and then

97
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:39,648
read or put something, which is why we start at zero.

98
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:43,355
I'm not talking about a ray addressing this episode.

99
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:47,015
This ties into the thing I like about eight bit computing is,

100
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:51,406
it's something a human can actually understand versus a modern CPU.

101
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,665
No. Like if you pretend to understand a modern computer

102
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:58,045
the other day, I, I hit the keyboard combo function.

103
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:01,545
Sound up to turn up the volume on the computer and on my computer when you do that,

104
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:04,696
it brings up the volume thing and whatever is currently playing noise.

105
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,235
So if like youtube's on playing noise, it,

106
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:09,006
it shows youtube and I can pause and start it using the mouse.

107
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,716
Like it brings that up in the corner anyways, it brought up Spotify.

108
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,623
I'm like, but I'm not playing Spotify on my computer.

109
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:16,514
But then I realized I had been playing Spotify on my phone while I

110
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:19,884
was in the car and I just paused it and walked in the house.

111
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:23,074
So the computer basically talked to the Spotify app,

112
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:26,183
Spotify app knew that I was playing Spotify on another device and was like,

113
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:27,444
do you want to continue playing your music?

114
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,104
And I'm like, yeah, hit play magic.

115
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:32,084
We're talking networks, we're talking wireless, we're talking

116
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:35,354
two completely different computing platforms plus whatever's on the server side.

117
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:36,194
I don't know.

118
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,313
So that I can basically hit volume up and be like, oh yeah,

119
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,683
I want to keep hearing my music.

120
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:40,523
It's all magic

121
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,161
that, that's too complicated for me to understand.

122
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,731
I would be shocked if any one person could explain how that works.

123
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,522
I think there's lots of people who think they could. But I bet you realistically.

124
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:51,481
No, no, you can't.

125
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,752
So, anyway, but eight bit computing, you can totally explain that. Right.

126
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,772
Well, you can build it on a breadboard yourself.

127
00:05:56,802 --> 00:06:00,372
Well, ok, there's that I was even, I wasn't even thinking of that aspect of it.

128
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,161
I was thinking if you look at this in the context

129
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:07,962
of like the Commodore 64 or the Nintendo Entertainment system or,

130
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,932
you know, pick one of these really old

131
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,380
just computing platforms.

132
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,260
And I'm going to,

133
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,190
I'm going to pick on the Nintendo entertainment system

134
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,899
here just because I have much knowledge in this

135
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,540
space because I love learning about it because that

136
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,350
was my first console when I was a kid.

137
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,700
That's how old I am. Everybody.

138
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,859
The thing is so one of the really cool things that's starting to happen now in this

139
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,700
space is there's all these games and I'm going to pick on the legend of

140
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,470
Zelda because I literally watched a video about this last night is so for example,

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,470
when you play the game, the legend of Zelda and you defeating enemies,

142
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,890
enemies sometimes drop money or life or whatever, right?

143
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,410
Random drops, drop loot,

144
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,640
you know, loot. Yeah, we call it loot today.

145
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,640
I thought we called, no, it's been called Loot since D and D

146
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:51,130
it was, did we ever call it loot? I don't know if you ever called it loot.

147
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,779
Well, I didn't but sure

148
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,329
it doesn't matter. And,

149
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,850
and D and D came out at what, like 7775 probably give or take.

150
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:58,839
It was

151
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,450
different.

152
00:06:59,755 --> 00:06:59,994
But, yeah.

153
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:00,584
Right. Right.

154
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:01,385
Anyway, anyway,

155
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,565
so what these people have done now is they're taking

156
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:09,404
these old eight bit programs and they're doing this amazing

157
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:12,515
analysis of them to say this is exactly what is

158
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,325
happening inside of the application while it is running.

159
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,880
And it's absolutely fascinating because they've got

160
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,239
these emulators and you can put information

161
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,549
up on the screen and you can pay attention to certain memory addresses.

162
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:23,839
You can.

163
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,570
And it's super easy to understand what's going on. Which I think from

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,720
the angle of I want to say, write an exploit that runs machine code.

165
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,440
This kind of knowledge is invaluable. I, I've been playing,

166
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,244
I have six on my computer and I have a pretty beefy computer

167
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:41,214
and it still takes a while for each turn

168
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,464
to complete like the computer is doing and I check

169
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:48,385
my CPU graphs and like all eight cores are like at 80% and you're playing on easy mode,

170
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:48,665
right?

171
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,605
Prints or Chieftain or whatever.

172
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:54,135
But yeah, basically three levels up from like I'm a child and on hard mode.

173
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:57,375
I don't even want to think about how long a turn will take on hard mode. I

174
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,785
assuming you just don't die in the third round.

175
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,500
Yeah, the,

176
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:07,070
the A I is in civilization are freakishly smart. It is ridiculous.

177
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,179
And the bat played on an ipad and it runs the battery

178
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,769
down in an hour and then get a little surprised by that.

179
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,820
I've specifically warned my son, he wants to play it on his mobile devices.

180
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm like this will kill your mobile device battery.

181
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,690
You need to play it plugged in and even then

182
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,369
the battery will slowly lose charge because it's using that much.

183
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,410
That's amazing.

184
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,519
Yeah, like my ipad gets warm to the touch. Like I got an ipad pro.

185
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,160
Like, it's not some old ipad.

186
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,619
So, yeah,

187
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,590
that's awesome.

188
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,369
That's awesome. No, I haven't played Civilization in years. It is.

189
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,299
Civilization is one of those games that I is,

190
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:43,690
is a danger because it will consume my life if I touch it.

191
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,340
And so I purposely avoid it at all costs.

192
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,859
The other thing that's annoying is you watch, like,

193
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:51,179
the spiffing brit play it and he just abuses the heck out of the game and wins,

194
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,260
you know, with one city and not doing anything other than

195
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:56,900
some game hack. I'm ok with abuse. That's

196
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,120
fine. It's, you're just hacking the game, right? That's, that's cool.

197
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,750
But it's also really hard because you have to learn a lot of weird tricks

198
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,760
that no normal person would ever do.

199
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,630
So anyway, we're talking about eight bit computing today and back to the,

200
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,791
actually understanding the entire state of the system.

201
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,630
And that's one of the biggest things in security is

202
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,161
people think they understand the entire state of the system,

203
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:23,111
but there's some mismatch or some glitch somewhere or something,

204
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,512
not quite behaving as they expected.

205
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,291
Yeah. And, and then the attacker finds that in game over.

206
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:32,281
Let's just be clear, I think in any modern computing platform,

207
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:38,601
even what we would think of as the absolute simplest, it is impossible for any.

208
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,591
I would even say a single team to have a

209
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:44,721
grasp of what's actually happening in the environment because we've

210
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,252
just reached a point of complexity that you have to

211
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,322
draw a line and say I will care about every

212
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:50,672
from this line forward.

213
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:53,833
And I cannot like, do you know what kernel version you're running?

214
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,393
Do you know what the libraries are in your container orchestrator?

215
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:58,533
Do you have a container orchestrator? You know what I mean?

216
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,773
There's literally millions of questions.

217
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,793
How many people think they understand a bug, write a patch and it's not

218
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:08,293
the full solution. Oh my gosh, that's one of my favorite things I have.

219
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:13,153
I have one of my favorite stories I have on that is so I remember a long time ago I,

220
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:15,432
when fuzzing was brand new, I wrote my own fuzz

221
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,823
because it was the cool thing to do. And I started fuzzing fonts

222
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:22,143
and there's a font library in the Linux world called free type.

223
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:25,383
And so I start fuzzing fonts and I had

224
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:29,184
a ridiculous number of crashes and I did the right thing where I was like, OK,

225
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,754
this font crash is here.

226
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,104
This font crashes you know what I mean?

227
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,364
I was making sure they weren't duplicates because obviously when

228
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:36,343
you fuzz something you're gonna get lots of duplicates.

229
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:41,383
I tried to do the right thing and I send this incredibly detailed write up end of patch

230
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,275
to the free type people, right?

231
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:44,835
With basically like here's what I found,

232
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,304
here's reproduce or here's a patch that makes it go away step.

233
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:47,755
And they're like,

234
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:50,525
oh all of these problems are caused by a missing

235
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:53,794
check way over here in this particular bit of code.

236
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:57,405
Whereas it was obviously like three function calls beneath where I was at.

237
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:58,474
And I'm like,

238
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,835
they're all the same bug every one of them. And it was hilarious.

239
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,955
One good quote I heard was a programmer needs

240
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,825
to understand the abstraction above and below them.

241
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:07,994
In other words, you need to,

242
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,424
you have your little kingdom

243
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,919
and you go to the walls of your kingdom and talk to the other kingdom next to you.

244
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,179
And yeah, I like that. And so quite frankly, like,

245
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,080
I will never care about my colonel again.

246
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,909
I, no, I just won't. I mean, I barely, but I don't have to,

247
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,030
I run a mix of Windows,

248
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,530
Linux and Mac Os and you know what I don't care because they all support bash,

249
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,549
they all support

250
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,340
new set and a

251
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:37,299
they all support like the tools I actually want to run like chrome web browser,

252
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,270
Firefox,

253
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,280
uh an email. Well, I don't run an email client anymore. I use the webinar face to join.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,070
It's magic. Yeah.

255
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,919
So why would I care what operating system I run when

256
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,544
I'm just sitting in a web browser all the time.

257
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:49,504
That is fair.

258
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:53,143
The only time I know what my kernel is is I own a pine

259
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:57,104
Book Pro which is a little arm laptop and it is always broken.

260
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:57,734
So

261
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,804
I have to pay attention to my kernel because it's like, oh,

262
00:12:00,814 --> 00:12:01,953
I'm running this kernel now.

263
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,184
I need to downgrade to that kernel or whatever.

264
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:09,104
And it's really funny because it's, it's one of those things where like, I'll,

265
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:11,713
I'll turn it on and everything works and then I'll literally like,

266
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,374
turn it off and turn it back on a little while later and like, nothing

267
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:14,848
works.

268
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:18,098
And I'm like, I didn't even change anything on this stupid computer, which is,

269
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:21,607
it's very much like running Linux in the nineties.

270
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:22,288
You

271
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,567
no idea what's going to happen. I love it.

272
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:27,158
The other thing I love too is I'm running software

273
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:31,898
that runs seamlessly on three very different operating system platforms.

274
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:36,778
And actually I ordered a Mac M one, the Mac mini M one which has an arm chip,

275
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:40,007
exciting totally different architecture at the CPU level.

276
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,617
And I know that everything will just work.

277
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,711
Yeah. Well, everything I use will just work well.

278
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,351
But the beauty is here from a security point of view and

279
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,601
this has been proven many times is that by supporting multiple architectures.

280
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,041
You pop out weird bugs. That is very true.

281
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:55,401
I remember the GEN two crew was really good at this

282
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:58,151
back in the day because you not only had weird architecture,

283
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:58,442
it's,

284
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,851
but you also had weird combinations of things because with Gen two,

285
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:04,992
for those who don't know, Gen two was a Linux.

286
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:08,562
I think Gen two is still around. Oh Yeah. Yeah. Slack. We still around. That's true.

287
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:08,981
But

288
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:09,111
if

289
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:09,242
you

290
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,125
that actually died was the D razzle.

291
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:12,565
I don't even know.

292
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,276
But anyway,

293
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:17,986
so Gen two was a Linux distribution that you basically built everything yourself.

294
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:21,406
And so you could say like, oh, I want to support this but not that or this and that.

295
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:25,406
And so depending upon the features you would add to what was called your use flags,

296
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,825
you would build applications in different ways.

297
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,445
And so obviously you can end up with

298
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,986
these bizarre combinations of libraries that no one

299
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:35,046
ever imagined a contractor pointed out once he

300
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,806
loved Gen Two from a security point of view

301
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,619
because every single system, even if you configured them all the same,

302
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,739
every single one had different return addresses.

303
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,900
That's true. Now though, thanks to address space randomization.

304
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,900
Well, and now that nowadays that wouldn't matter,

305
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:54,460
but back in the day 20 some years ago, that it made a difference.

306
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:58,020
I mean, I guess you could argue that because, you know,

307
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,739
calm exploit codes would just fail on your Gen two machines all the time.

308
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,349
Well, they were hard coded to only work on, you know, one vendor package.

309
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,510
That's how things used to work.

310
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,369
Those were the good old days when ex flight writing was easy.

311
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,849
Yeah. No, that, that time is done. But I mean, while it was there it was,

312
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:14,219
yeah.

313
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:14,719
Two.

314
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,179
Yeah, that, I remember gen two,

315
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,190
like just the weirdest freaking bugs because of those weird combinations.

316
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,479
And

317
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:22,599
so, ok,

318
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,719
so I want to use this to pivot us back into eight

319
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,530
bit computing because that's what we're supposed to be talking about.

320
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:29,510
And

321
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,140
for some reason we got off topic. So OK. OK.

322
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:36,219
So I think you bring up an interesting point when you talk

323
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:39,880
about kind of weird combinations and different architectures and all this stuff.

324
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,250
And

325
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,739
so, I mean, you have to imagine so in the eight bit world,

326
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,169
a significant amount of what was done was written in assembly, right?

327
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:46,840
Which is

328
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,659
bananas to think about today. Well, because what other tool did they have?

329
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,679
I mean, there were, you could use C to a degree for some of this.

330
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,750
They had basic, actually,

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,940
most of the eight bit computers came with a basic interpreter

332
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,469
and a not like if you're into Commodore 60 fours,

333
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:05,390
a nontrivial amount of the software for the Commodore 64 was just literally

334
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,289
written in basic and then stored on a literal audio cassette tape.

335
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:16,000
Anyway. Anyway, and so you have to think about it. So today you have a web browser that

336
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
will work on

337
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,380
almost any computer you can touch.

338
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,479
And I don't even like calling it a web browser anymore.

339
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:25,840
Because for example, it has a virtual machine capable implementation

340
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:26,359
of

341
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,619
javascript. Like

342
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,619
you can run Linux in your web browser.

343
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,859
It's a higher level operating system, it is what it is.

344
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:37,440
But the point is so in the, in the, in the olden days in the eight bit universe, right?

345
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,710
Like

346
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,299
if you wrote a piece of software for say, the Nintendo Entertainment system,

347
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,700
the Nes, I'm just going to try to call it Nes from now on.

348
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,479
That's the only place it ran, right? You couldn't port it to something else.

349
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,770
Like when people ported software and this is, this is fascinating

350
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,780
when you ported software,

351
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,020
you didn't like start with a code and then make it work on another platform.

352
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:02,210
You usually looked at it, you took the graphics and you rewrote it from scratch.

353
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,650
Like there was no that, that, that's what we call parting. That was, that's bananas.

354
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,890
Yeah, but I mean,

355
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,729
well, a part of that is this whole ecosystem thing, right?

356
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,929
Like I looked into this in Rocketry and we had all

357
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,369
the ideas to make Rocketry work for quite a while.

358
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,510
But for example, we didn't have the alloys,

359
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,679
you know, to make engines that wouldn't melt

360
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:27,950
or we didn't have the flight control understanding to make things not veer off

361
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,719
course you mentioned alloy and I have

362
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,830
something fascinating for everyone to think about.

363
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,520
So I love space and I watch as much space content

364
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,260
and news and I listen to space podcasts and it's like,

365
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,510
it's my side hobby that I adore and

366
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,880
there was, I think it was,

367
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,359
I forget which

368
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,640
one of the up and coming commercial space companies was testing a rocket.

369
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,030
And in the video,

370
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,190
the fire was coming up green and the people were like, oh, look green fire,

371
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,390
that means it's burning itself up from the inside.

372
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,590
I'm like, that is,

373
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,540
that's wild. Like that old advice where, you know, you can throw your old night

374
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,030
a batteries in the fire to make pretty colors. Right.

375
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
But, yeah, I mean, they, they saw the green and of course,

376
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,020
they were super calm about it, which I think is always funny because

377
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,569
you're standing in a bunker at a safe distance, hopefully.

378
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,819
And the rocket is literally burning itself up for

379
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,126
inside and they're like, oh, it's green

380
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:22,366
and it was just like, ah, it's, it's one of those things that it,

381
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,347
until you hear someone say it, you're like, holy crap.

382
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:26,926
That's true. I mean, there's,

383
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,467
there's fire coming out of the bottom of this thing.

384
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,227
Of course, it's going to burn itself up.

385
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:31,697
Well,

386
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:35,177
not necessarily because they do clever hacks like alloys that don't melt as much,

387
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,677
or they run the fuel in a tube around the,

388
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:44,286
the nozzle to pre heat the fuel and to cool down the nozzle so it doesn't melt itself.

389
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,745
Like that's one thing they had to do with those, um, those, what are they slam jets?

390
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:47,885
You know,

391
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:51,776
the ones that basically just have an air engine intake that compresses the air,

392
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:54,715
they shoot the fuel and because the pressure is so high it auto ignites,

393
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,056
you know, we're talking speeds of mach 10 to 20

394
00:17:57,755 --> 00:18:00,296
scramjet scramjets. Yeah. Anyways.

395
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:00,946
And so, you know,

396
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,625
they were doing things like running the fuel through the nose of the vehicle to

397
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,904
pre heat the fuel but to also prevent the nose of the vehicle from melting.

398
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,894
I remember learning of this when there was a

399
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:14,443
time in my youth when I adored conspiracy theories,

400
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,754
which I would not suggest anyone do anymore, but there was a,

401
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,744
supposedly an aircraft faster than the sr 71

402
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:24,043
that people were talking about at the time.

403
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,604
And I don't think it ever came out if there was or wasn't,

404
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:29,134
but it was fascinating to learn about all the crazy things

405
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,654
they have to do to run an aircraft at that speed.

406
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:36,621
I just love that the sr 71 fuel tanks can't be properly sealed.

407
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,462
So they just leak when it's on the ground and then once it gets up to speed,

408
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,862
the metal expands and it seals that whole

409
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,371
airplane and they build it with slide rules.

410
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:45,332
I mean, it's

411
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,771
ridiculous.

412
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,222
Well, and Titanium, you know,

413
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:52,312
purchased from the Russians through intermediaries, but everything's fine.

414
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,121
Here everybody.

415
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:53,761
It's,

416
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:54,342
yeah.

417
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,741
Well, on the 747 slide rules,

418
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,020
I know. I know. It's amazing. And I guess so, actually that's a good point.

419
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:04,359
Like you can do a lot with a bit computing if you know, you like the Apollo,

420
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,000
the Apollo missions.

421
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,060
I wonder, did they even have a bits?

422
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:12,339
I have no idea what that their computer was an amazing creation for sure.

423
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:12,910
And there's,

424
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,989
there's fascinating stories and videos about it out on the internet

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,160
that I'd encourage everyone to go just read 15 data bits

426
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:21,699
and one.

427
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:24,615
So, actually that's a funny topic to us.

428
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,326
So, back in the day of the eight bit universe,

429
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:31,156
it would not be uncommon for a computer to have a weird number of bits.

430
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,156
Like, I think there was an old mainframe that had 13 bits,

431
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:39,276
just like weird bizarre combinations and it was just because it was add a few bits.

432
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:40,595
It's fine. Right.

433
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:43,855
Well, look at your askew table. You actually only need half your

434
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,826
Asy table. Seven bits, man.

435
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,781
Yeah. Like, I remember finding out about the stuff above 128 and I was like, what?

436
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:50,011
It's

437
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,692
got the little smiley face who doesn't like that

438
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,972
and the bell, everyone liked the bell. Yeah.

439
00:19:55,982 --> 00:20:01,121
And the pound sign and the little, the single and double lines to make your menus.

440
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:01,621
Oh, yes.

441
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:05,371
I remember those, like, straight up when I discovered that I was like, just,

442
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:08,322
it literally blew my mind, you just use dashes and pluses.

443
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,171
It's fine. Exactly. Ask you.

444
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:11,699
Oh,

445
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,900
my goodness.

446
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,680
That brings it back anyway. Anyway, a bit,

447
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:15,900
a bit.

448
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,540
I think it's the reason this is sort of important is by knowing where you come from.

449
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,770
It gives you an understanding of where we are and how

450
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,739
we got here because there's so many security things that have,

451
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,579
like, people complain about things, say with certificates and I'm like,

452
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:30,579
when they built this 20

453
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:34,425
years ago you couldn't do that 20 years ago

454
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:35,625
or more. Yeah.

455
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,354
Uh, you know, things like, oh,

456
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:39,984
you just want to run a website that's

457
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:42,625
globally available 100% of the time to everybody.

458
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:45,734
You couldn't do that 10 years ago with less than a billion dollars.

459
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,675
And now it's, I think you have to pay klopper

460
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,555
$0 a month

461
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,750
and I think you get the always on thing or maybe it's 20 bucks a month.

462
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,589
I mean, pretty much.

463
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,469
Ok. Ok. Here's what I want to talk about.

464
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:01,099
We talk about, you know, knowing where you came from,

465
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,619
being able to learn and do things.

466
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,670
And so I want to use this and I have a great example. What is the largest number you can,

467
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,709
I guess, just store

468
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,479
in eight bits, right?

469
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,390
You have eight bits.

470
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,569
Well, I mean, if you start counting in multiples of one then theoretically 256

471
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,449
right? But I know that you can go higher but, but well. Ok.

472
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:26,229
Yeah, you can combine the integers and bits and whatever. I don't care about that.

473
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,630
So, now that, but that's an unsigned integer, right? And

474
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,829
so there's signed and unsigned integers and signed integers I would

475
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,709
say are probably more common and useful to most people.

476
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:40,369
So, what's the largest signed integer you can represent with eight bits?

477
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,609
Well,

478
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:45,489
depending on where you start counting negative because it's going to be 127 or 128.

479
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,630
Yeah,

480
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,170
that's true because there's different ways to portray

481
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,010
negative numbers and we won't get into that.

482
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,189
Well, it also depends.

483
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:56,150
Do you negative 127 to positive 128 or negative 128 to positive 127 because

484
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,770
you've got that zero in the middle splitting it generally raps to the negative

485
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:00,733
largest number.

486
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:04,633
Well, what I'm saying is you can't have it 120 to 128 because you also need zero.

487
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:08,262
Well, is there a negative zero in your counting method as well? There are,

488
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:11,863
there's ways to represent numbers that have negative zero and positive zero, but

489
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:14,572
we're not going to get into that. We're not, we're going to pretend like normal,

490
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,772
we're just going to pretend it's fine, it's fine.

491
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:18,412
Like here's my favorite example, right

492
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:21,453
on an Nes Super Mario brothers, right

493
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,532
in level 3-1 there is a famous trick we call

494
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,282
turtle topping that lets you get essentially infinite lives.

495
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:29,733
So, if you can't have infinite lives because

496
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:34,536
guess what happens when you cross the 127 mark of number of lives you have,

497
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:38,135
you get negative lives, I guess for the game things when you have negative lives

498
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:41,776
game over. Yeah, same thing in SIV. Nuclear Gandhi.

499
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:46,215
Oh, nuclear Gandhi is the greatest bug in the history of video games.

500
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:49,036
Explain what that is for people who don't know in SI,

501
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:53,105
I forget, oh, this is SI five. Wow, that is a long time ago.

502
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,635
I forgot how long it was between these games. Anyway, in SI

503
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:59,676
51 of the characters is Gandhi. Although I think he's been a character since ever

504
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:00,670
and

505
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,069
Gandhi is, yeah, he's very peaceful. Very nice. Nice man.

506
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,479
Right. Exactly. His peace score increases

507
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,349
until it integer overflows and becomes

508
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,030
that one actually. Underflow. Oh, underflow. Sorry.

509
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,109
It's an aggression score and his is like zero.

510
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:15,770
Yeah.

511
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,560
Sorry and well, yeah, he basically goes from very, very, very nice to very, very,

512
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,939
very, not nice.

513
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:25,180
It basically goes from 0 to 255.

514
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:30,859
And usually at that point in the game he has nukes, right? And he nukes everybody.

515
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,400
Although in fairness, if you may, if you survive the game that long,

516
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,579
you're doing pretty well.

517
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:40,189
Yeah, but the bug is still there. I guess they was not a bug anymore.

518
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,040
It's like a feature

519
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,660
but there's still the ability for, for Gandhi to become like super aggressive,

520
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,214
which I think is one of the greatest features in any video game ever love it.

521
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,234
It makes me smile every time I think of it.

522
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:57,964
I just, I like that. It reflects the reality of things just sometimes go sideways.

523
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:01,824
But, and so here's the thing, right is when we talk about video games,

524
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:05,265
you can have these weird bugs, you can have integer, overflows, integer underflow,

525
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,704
whatever buffer overflows doesn't matter.

526
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,790
And it's funny,

527
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,839
well, you know, it does matter because like, for example,

528
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:15,459
it used to be people played against the computer and if you abuse the game cool.

529
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:18,040
I watch these massively multiplayer online role playing

530
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,589
games or like things like Rust or,

531
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,739
you know, escape from Tarko

532
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,020
and the cheaters make the game suck.

533
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,579
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.

534
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,074
You know, and so they get back banded or whatever. So I would argue

535
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,755
when you're just playing against your own

536
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,665
computer or fiddling against your own computer.

537
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,385
It's like a test lab situation. Who cares what you think? We're talking about.

538
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:39,324
Eight bit, eight bit video games, right? Big deal.

539
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,204
But, well, and that's the thing,

540
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:43,555
eight bit video games didn't have to deal with multiplayer games except

541
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:46,165
when you were playing Mario Kart with your little brother or something,

542
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:46,444
you know.

543
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:46,724
But

544
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,885
then he can just punch you in the arm. That's true.

545
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,089
Stop looking at my screen.

546
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,150
Oh, my favorite is all those ones where the people have the cardboard rigged up.

547
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:55,530
Like, I

548
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,410
never did that. But the first time I saw that I thought, why didn't I think of that?

549
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:00,739
Yeah.

550
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,369
So the deal is basically you just, you tape cardboard, like to the ends of the TV,

551
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,010
either horizontally or vertically to split the screen

552
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:10,969
and so that you can't be technically stream sniping, I guess

553
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:11,880
the time

554
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,709
for it now. Yeah, I guess, I guess anyway, anyway,

555
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:15,469
like

556
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,989
those kind of bugs are funny though, right?

557
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:19,607
Learn though as well.

558
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,996
Sometimes like I didn't even know what an integer

559
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:26,057
overflow was when I was playing Super Mario Brothers.

560
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,116
And then when you start understanding what this stuff means,

561
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:34,327
it's a fascinating way to learn what is happening inside of the computer, right?

562
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:38,526
In a way that you can understand because in 64 bit computing, when you overflow,

563
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:42,036
an integer, you're talking about like an unreasonably large number,

564
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:44,276
I just keep coming back to the whole

565
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:47,744
understanding what's going on also having language for it

566
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,394
and not just words for it, but what do those words mean?

567
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:54,163
And that's something I'm seeing with a lot of newer security stuff,

568
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:54,923
especially around.

569
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,583
Give me an example, what is an integer overflow?

570
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:57,734
Well,

571
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:02,793
there's a formal definition for that versus an integer underflow versus a buffer,

572
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:05,423
a buffer overflow versus buffer underflow versus

573
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,663
buffer overread versus buffer under read,

574
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:07,874
right?

575
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,624
Those four things in the buffer world are very, very different

576
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:14,144
and they're formally cataloged and classified, for example, in the CWE project.

577
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:14,744
But for example,

578
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,831
in the Blockchain space and the cloud space,

579
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,211
there's a whole bunch of stuff that we don't even have words for,

580
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,490
let alone definitions.

581
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,901
And so security's a bit of a disaster there because how do we even talk about

582
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,691
it? That's an interesting observation actually.

583
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:29,961
And I think it's a good point to kind of work ourselves out of

584
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,370
this on is you're correct when you don't have words to describe things,

585
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,811
it changes everything.

586
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:38,711
You can't fix a problem when you can't describe the problem.

587
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,911
I have something even more fascinating for you and I will try to dig this up.

588
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:46,267
There is a video, the internet where someone was discussing colors

589
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:51,598
and the names of colors. There is a group of people in, I think it's in Africa

590
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:56,037
that their native language doesn't have a name for. I think it's green or blue.

591
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,017
I forget which color.

592
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:01,958
And you can like, if you showed us a picture with like a bunch of green and blue on,

593
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:05,647
say a wheel, we'll instantly say like that one's blue, that one's green, right?

594
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,708
No questions asked.

595
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:10,147
And if you show this to these people, they'll tell you they're all the same color.

596
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:14,104
And so it's, it's looking like as you have names for things,

597
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:17,864
our brains change the way we even see them and understand them,

598
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:23,344
which is absolutely fascinating having names for things I think changes the entire

599
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,324
universe in the way we see it and how we interact with it.

600
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:29,185
Well, and so in western music it's mostly what,

601
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,675
like four time beat or maybe a three time beat,

602
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:34,114
if it's a waltz and I forget there's an

603
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,564
eastern European country where they have seven time music.

604
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,665
I've never heard of that.

605
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,852
And so, well, they did a study and essentially to us it sounds like noise

606
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:43,781
But to the people with that grew up with the seven time music,

607
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:46,072
not only do they understand and hear the seven time music,

608
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:49,052
but they can also very easily parse the four time music

609
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,732
because in a way it's very, it's simpler, interesting.

610
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:55,212
And so I, I like, like I keep coming back to this.

611
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:59,202
How do we discuss a problem, let alone try and solve a problem if we can't even discuss

612
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:02,232
the problem and have words to identify it.

613
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:07,291
You know, there's new words now that I have had to learn as an adult unconscious bias.

614
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,619
The, these are not words I grew up with, they didn't exist when I grew up. It's true.

615
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,900
And, and so it, I, I have had to change how I think about a lot of things in the world,

616
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,900
you know, and it's possible now I couldn't have done this 20 years ago because, well,

617
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,410
to go on 1984 you know, with Orwellian double

618
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,060
or what is it good speak or whatever it was.

619
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,939
Called, you can't discuss a revolution if you don't have the word revolution.

620
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,189
That is true.

621
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,189
And so I'm really glad to see now that we're,

622
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,780
we're aware of this problem and people are fixing it.

623
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,750
You know, people are coming out with these terms. What do they mean?

624
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,989
How do they apply?

625
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,079
You know, and in computer security we've had that happen right now,

626
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:46,109
20 years ago it was all Black magic and now there's courses and really nice books.

627
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,939
There are, there are, it's so easy now, compared to 20 years ago,

628
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:53,229
there is one thing I want to end this on that.

629
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,849
I've been thinking about a lot lately and this is,

630
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:01,250
this is related to open source licenses which we will discuss in the future.

631
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,390
But Kurt and I are still hashing out ideas.

632
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,130
But when we talk about language and we talk about

633
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,569
what the definition of things are and you know,

634
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,689
what, what the, what you mean by what the definition of is is sort of thing.

635
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,599
I know

636
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,790
I went there

637
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,589
for anybody under the age of 30

638
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,010
let them

639
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,819
look it up, let them look it up, look it up anyway.

640
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,920
So, but here's the thing, right? Is

641
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,859
there are powerful forces

642
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,609
in charge of almost everything now.

643
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:30,510
And this is if you look at basically every foundation on the planet,

644
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,750
look at the members, right?

645
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,949
It's all the same members and all the same

646
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,660
foundations and they're basically all driving the bus.

647
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,239
And I think this is one of the challenges for us as practitioners is

648
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,969
we have to be prepared to define things in a way that is accurate

649
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,209
and make sense.

650
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,729
Because there are other people who want to define

651
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:52,630
things in a way that accommodates their worldview.

652
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:56,489
You can absolutely manipulate language to get what you want. Exactly.

653
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,589
And we see that all the time in the news cycle,

654
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,910
you look at various news channels and the way they use words and how they,

655
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,969
and which words they use.

656
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:03,709
It's shocking

657
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,000
and security is no different.

658
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,540
There are things that aren't defined or are defined incorrectly or are used wrong.

659
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,900
And sometimes it's because people are confused and

660
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,760
sometimes it's because people have an agenda,

661
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,180
they're pushing marketing.

662
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:20,380
Right. I would say that's agenda you're pushing.

663
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:25,650
But. Right. Right. Exactly. And so it's a unique challenge we have. It's not unique.

664
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,630
It's, it's pretty global, I would say to everything.

665
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,650
It's the story of humans instead of creating

666
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,079
value and making the world a better place.

667
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,890
There's a bunch of people who just want to capture existing value and sit on it.

668
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,589
Yeah. And that's exactly right. Right. Change is hard.

669
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,619
And I guess that's,

670
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,709
and thank goodness we've changed from eight bit computing because holy crap,

671
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,180
it's, I love talking about it with nostalgia,

672
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,056
but I'm so really glad I don't develop on AIC computers.

673
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:51,635
I love that systems on a chip now that run on like a

674
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:54,975
watt of power are more powerful than my desktop 20 years ago.

675
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:55,995
They just run Linux

676
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,296
now. It's awesome.

677
00:30:57,676 --> 00:31:01,895
Like my, my legal control brick boots up and says Linux kernel version,

678
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:04,265
some ridiculously small version and I'm like,

679
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,615
whatever. Exactly. I don't have to worry about.

680
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:11,656
Oh, this loop needs 1000 instructions, but I can only give it 800. So, how am I gonna?

681
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,895
Like, I don't care.

682
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:17,881
It doesn't matter. I have infinite resources at my disposal. Now.

683
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:20,472
Anyway, anyway, I'm, I'm going to call this.

684
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:26,442
This was a lovely trip down a bizarre memory lane. We'll call it. So, thank you, Kurt.
