Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 100 with myself,

1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,279
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:15,649
-- Josh Bresser. We're
-- joined today with a friend of mine, Steve Mazak. Say hi, Steve.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,809
Hey, everybody

4
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,280
and, and Steve tell us, tell us what you do.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,530
So I'm the lead of the Solution architecture team for Elastic,

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,770
the company behind Elastic Search Cabana Log stash Beats and many other projects.

8
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,590
Uh Yes, Elastic. I think I've heard of them before.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:31,760
Yeah, you may have.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,479
Cool. So, so anyway, I know most people probably like uh sales guy.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,599
What's up with that?

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:37,939
So,

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,799
actually I talked to Steve and it occurred to me

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,959
at some point we were talking about podcasts actually.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,279
And

16
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,270
I realized that security people,

17
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,240
at least all the ones I've ever interacted with kind of suck at buying stuff.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,369
They often don't know what to do or how it works.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,560
And, and so I thought it could actually be really interesting

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,799
to kind of pick Steve's brain for a little bit about

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,459
what, what does it mean to purchase security products and, and how as a buyer can,

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,620
can we do things better So I guess why don't we kick this off,

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,349
Steve give us like the the five minute rundown

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,150
of how does a typical sales process work?

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,870
Right. And this is not, not too specific, of course, but just in general.

26
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:15,800
Yeah, it's good.

27
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:20,050
So typically it starts by somebody getting connected with somebody else, right?

28
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:20,629
And, and

29
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:22,559
the way that it can work is that

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,639
we send out

31
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:27,760
marketing emails or we do webinars and we have content that

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,879
we put out on the web for people to come and consume.

33
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:34,400
And if they consume that, typically there's like a registration form or something.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,199
And that's one of the ways that we get in touch with people,

35
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,910
there's many different ways, but that's typically how it starts.

36
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:43,319
If somebody comes to us or we reach out to them through a mutual connection,

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,830
once that starts,

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,489
it really is then kind of a discovery

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,760
process where the prospect is discovering us at the

40
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,989
same time that we're discovering them and their business

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,839
and their problem that they're trying to solve.

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,120
And that takes many different forms. I mean, it can be

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,699
you just have an initial conversation on the phone with a uh account exec

44
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,599
and

45
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,440
they, you know, do their best to understand what the

46
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,110
customers trying to solve or the prospects trying to solve.

47
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,440
And then from there they determine how they decide they're going to buy. And

48
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,570
there's lots of different ways you can buy as you can imagine some

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,399
people know exactly what they want because they've done all the research upfront

50
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,639
and they just come to us and say, I just need a quote. I've already done

51
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:27,639
my research. I've already talked to customer references or,

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,880
you know, done my research in the community. I'm ready to go

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,339
uh other people, they want to see references or they want to do a,

54
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,800
they want to see a very,

55
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,300
you know, in depth demo. Sometimes they want to do

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,699
POC

57
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,160
do an rfirfp things like that.

58
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,059
-- All right, let's, let's,
-- I was just gonna say, what's an RF I?

59
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,360
There

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,839
we go.

61
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah. So it's request for information.

62
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,600
This is one of those things I love and hate as a solution architect.

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,779
The reason I love them is because

64
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,179
they're great to ramp a new solution architect onto the team.

65
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,339
You give them this spreadsheet that could be,

66
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,119
you know,

67
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,380
hundreds and hundreds, if not, maybe even thousands of rows long.

68
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,009
And you say, hey, go answer all these questions

69
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,270
and it gives the,

70
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,429
the essay a chance to really understand the

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,899
types of questions that they're going to be encountering

72
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,100
in the field as they learn their job and go out and talk to more customers.

73
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,729
The reason I don't like them

74
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,250
is because there's potentially 1000 rows or more on

75
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,259
these things and they take a long time.

76
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,529
And if you are not

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
engaged with the customer in the very beginning

78
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,619
of their buying process to help them define

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,250
what success looks like for the next piece of software.

80
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,910
They're trying to acquire your chances of winning that. That customer

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,309
is slim to none.

82
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,300
And I think there's probably statistics out there that say

83
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,220
eight out of 10 or nine out of 10,

84
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,139
you lose.

85
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:47,259
We have had pretty good success at elastic in my experience.

86
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,100
But I think part of that's because we're open source and there's

87
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,470
no barrier to entry when the customer wants to try our software.

88
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,500
Whereas you're probably familiar with a

89
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,339
lot of places where they say, hey, you want to try our stuff,

90
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:01,050
you got to get in touch with us first.

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,570
Right? Oh my goodness.

92
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,410
I hate that. That's not ideal.

93
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,570
Yeah. So, so as we go through

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,940
that process, eventually,

95
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,190
there's a point at which we start talking about timelines

96
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,059
and hopefully we know that early on in the process.

97
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,809
So we know what we're marching towards.

98
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,608
We validate budget, you know, how much do they have to spend on this project?

99
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,100
How much is going to hardware versus

100
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,570
software versus consulting and professional services?

101
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,839
And then we just work towards that,

102
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,799
that agreement or that, that deadline as we work together. And,

103
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,089
you know, I'm not naive enough to think that

104
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,369
most of the time we're the only vendor talking to a prospect,

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,559
they're probably talking to lots of different vendors.

106
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,660
And the idea is to try and understand as

107
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,059
much as you can about their problem and their preference

108
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,920
so that, you know, how to position your software to the things that they care about.

109
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,459
And this is where

110
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,679
honesty in the sales process becomes a really important thing.

111
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:50,220
You know,

112
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,700
that one of the reasons I love being in

113
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,690
open source is because there's already a presumption that

114
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,459
things are open and people are open and transparent.

115
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,019
And that's how I operate.

116
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,630
My goal is not to, to win based on, you know,

117
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,500
telling lies about all the other software vendors and what they can and can't do and

118
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,079
you know, say my, my software can wash cars.

119
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,609
It's much more about really understanding what they're trying to do,

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,290
seeing if there's a match and if there's a match doing the best

121
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:18,350
that we can to prove that we're the right solution for their,

122
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:18,989
their problem.

123
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,209
And then after that, it's all, if they agree to buy,

124
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,450
then it's about, you know,

125
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,089
going through the legal process to get papers signed and things like that

126
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,309
and then it, and then it becomes a thing.

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,309
And if you're like elastic, it's a subscription business. So it could be,

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
you know, a one year subscription,

129
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:38,149
it could be a two or three or even four or five year subscription.

130
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,750
And, you know, we, we believe the longer the better.

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,899
And I think the customers also agree based on my experience that

132
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,149
if you enter into a multiyear agreement with a vendor,

133
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,239
you typically get,

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,019
you know, maybe a

135
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,910
discount or at least some sort of price locked in for the long term.

136
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:54,829
Does that make sense?

137
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,149
Yes. That, that is awesome. I, I guess

138
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,630
we can pick that apart a little bit now where I

139
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,230
think you hit on something really important some time back.

140
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,149
We talked about professional services and I think that's,

141
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,959
that's one of the things people don't always think about is

142
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,109
it's not just a matter of buying a piece of software and, and

143
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,260
I think for, for many people,

144
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:18,029
at least in the beginning and this was something kind of I experienced long,

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,720
long ago in my career was, it's not like you go by a video game

146
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,440
and then you play it right where when you're enterprise software is,

147
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:29,109
it's a process and you generally need help from the vendor. Right.

148
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,480
That's exactly right. I mean,

149
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,200
I've seen a number of projects fail in my time where

150
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,230
the customer overestimates their ability to implement something successfully.

151
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,519
And,

152
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,239
you know, you've probably all seen this before.

153
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,450
I'm sure I've suffered from it myself too. It's very easy to think I can do it. I got it.

154
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,320
I don't need to buy professional services.

155
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,929
Early in my career, I worked for a large electrical,

156
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,839
like an industrial electrical contractor is their it guy

157
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:57,190
and they were replacing their accounting system and it ran on Sco

158
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,649
UNIX and I was like, oh, we can probably, just because back then,

159
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,399
Linux had a so compatibility

160
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,429
layer, whatever you want to call it. I was like, oh, we can probably do that.

161
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,920
And then I, I literally spent like half an hour

162
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:07,929
kind of looking at,

163
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,429
well,

164
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,820
basically do I want 500 angry electricians on a

165
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,540
Friday afternoon blaming me for not getting their paychecks.

166
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,880
And the answer was no, absolutely not.

167
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,320
And so the accounting software, you know,

168
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:21,000
it was this bespoke monstrosity because the, you know,

169
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,799
the construction industry has crazy billing

170
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,880
issues.

171
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,480
And uh yeah, no,

172
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,359
they provided a school box at like some horrendously inflated price.

173
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,720
But you know what not my problem.

174
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:35,950
And I think that was, that was sort of my first moment of it. Maturity

175
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,899
was where I literally was like, yeah, you know what,

176
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,109
I do not want to be responsible for this because

177
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,100
I cannot be in between 500 guys in their paycheck.

178
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,010
That's, that's not a good place to be.

179
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,019
-- Yes,
-- it's very forward thinking of you. I mean, I've been in situations where

180
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,260
people say, look, I have more money than time

181
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,140
and

182
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,040
sometimes it's the opposite. I have more time than money.

183
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,299
And, you know, they,

184
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,500
they think that because they have a team of engineers,

185
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,369
they can go and implement this stuff that it's almost like a sunk cost in their mind.

186
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,809
You know,

187
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,910
and I always try to help people understand that you're investing

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,959
with time and money no matter how you do this,

189
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,010
it's just a matter of what skill level and how fast you

190
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,920
want to move and how much you're willing to pay for that,

191
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,320
that

192
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,559
reduction in time to get something from inception to production.

193
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,910
Well, and the other thing I would add to that too is, is, you know,

194
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,359
is it a core competency?

195
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:28,679
So like I'm also the director of it for the CS A for the cloud security lines

196
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,469
to put it bluntly, the cloud security alliances are core competencies

197
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:36,229
are not running a bunch of servers, right? That's not what we want to be doing,

198
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,010
you know, um Netflix, apparently very good at that.

199
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,130
You know,

200
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,570
they have this monstrous cloud infrastructure and they

201
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,099
also happen to have a ton of content.

202
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,059
Um but, you know, in the CS A's and it's

203
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,140
my thing is always, you know, how much of this can I outsource because,

204
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:53,130
you know, I don't want the CS A to be like an it powerhouse. We're,

205
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,929
we're a standards and, you know, uh organization body, right? Not,

206
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,140
you know, we don't want to run servers for the sake of running servers.

207
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,789
And I see that with a lot of people, you know, where

208
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,890
um I've even had people, I don't know jokingly or not, but like, you know,

209
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,820
we should build our own white box

210
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,820
rack mount servers,

211
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,479
right? Like we can order the cases, we can order this, we can order that.

212
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:21,200
And in fairness that does make sense like when you're the size of Google.

213
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,770
Right. Then it makes sense to do that.

214
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,049
But like, you know, when you're doing a dozen servers or 100 servers, it's like, no,

215
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:27,690
please.

216
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,250
No.

217
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,599
And, and so that's one thing I've seen a lot of, especially technical people,

218
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:31,929
you know,

219
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,419
they've done it once successfully on their own. And that's cool.

220
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,200
But then, well,

221
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,599
like we keep saying this law of large numbers pops up

222
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,090
right when you want 100 of them or 1000 of them or

223
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,840
yeah, you want elastic search to be processing some, you know,

224
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:48,010
unimaginable amount of data quickly.

225
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,900
Well, you know,

226
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,549
it's interesting because the core competency thing is something I think

227
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,900
about a lot and we could use Netflix as an example,

228
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,630
is Netflix's business to

229
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:00,270
produce and provide entertainment content for the world or

230
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,059
is it to be really good at running infrastructure?

231
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,820
I think they would argue that it's both.

232
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:06,729
But

233
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,700
it makes me wonder,

234
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,929
could a could a competitor to Netflix pop up

235
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,299
and be great at producing content yet outsource all the

236
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,349
the the quote unquote non core competency activities like running that

237
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,250
-- infrastructure
-- there. It's a lot like it's a it's a core,

238
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,330
it's a strategic piece that not many people can do.

239
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,099
I mean a great example of that is like Walmart and Amazon with logistics,

240
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,650
right?

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,909
Almost nobody on the planet can get boxes to my house in two days, reliably,

242
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,789
right? I don't care how it happens.

243
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,929
But when I buy stuff online, you know, sometimes it takes weeks or months

244
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,049
and I think that's part of it, you know, is

245
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,549
people can adopt these things,

246
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,280
uh,

247
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,820
and use it as, you know, part of their moat to keep the competitors at bay. But,

248
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,250
yeah, to successfully execute that.

249
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,130
I mean, how many people tried doing what ebay or Netflix did and failed miserably,

250
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,750
or it's like, you know, back in the

251
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,320
late nineties, early two thousands. How many grocery delivery services?

252
00:10:59,969 --> 00:10:59,979
Oh,

253
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,549
-- pets.com
-- was the

254
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,729
best because I was like,

255
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,489
they're going to deliver my 25 kg bags of kitty litter, like, for

256
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,640
-- free.
-- Yeah, like, sweet.

257
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,580
I know, we, we used to order Taco Bell from cosmo.com

258
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,140
just to see if it would work and it worked. But how are they going to make money?

259
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,099
-- So,
-- back to the sales because that's one thing I, I, because I've,

260
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,559
there's been a couple of companies where I, you know,

261
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,020
I looked at their product or their service or whatever and it was,

262
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,080
you know, it's too good to be true almost. Right.

263
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,780
And especially in the security world. Right.

264
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,770
I mean, that's a very common thing, like, oh, you know,

265
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,479
this product stops all network attacks and I'm like, really?

266
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,099
And so I'm kind of wondering is, well, a part of that would be, I mean, how do

267
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,450
you, how do you set, how do you sort of set,

268
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,919
like, realistic expectations about what your product actually?

269
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,159
Does for customers.

270
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,919
Yeah. It's a great question.

271
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,159
Basically how I think about it is

272
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,400
I'll go back to something my dad told me a long time ago is basically believe

273
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,109
none of what you hear and half of what you see

274
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,760
and what he was trying to tell me was validate everything for yourself.

275
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,359
And I take that philosophy to my customers.

276
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,479
You know, I don't want them to take my word for it.

277
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,840
I want them to try this software out. I want them to talk to people.

278
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:16,400
I want them to see it in action because I believe this seeing is believing.

279
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,440
And one of the ways that elastic is fortunate is that we have a

280
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,010
lot of people that are using our software and talking about it publicly.

281
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,820
So, you know, if someone's wondering if, if what I'm saying is true and accurate,

282
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,059
all they have to do is go look online, they'll find people,

283
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,270
they'll see stories of customers that are using our software and being successful.

284
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,460
And

285
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,650
for me, that's a really hard thing to get by when you're on the buying side

286
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,229
is how do I know this person is telling me

287
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,260
the truth?

288
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,320
Right? So, so let me ask you about that though, Steve is.

289
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,750
So, you know, this is kind of advice time, let's say I am a buyer

290
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,549
and I have a company

291
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:58,809
that, that sounds like they're selling me a pile of lies.

292
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,580
Like what's something I can do to try to, to figure this out, right?

293
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,030
Like what, what's appropriate for me to ask them in, in terms of, you know,

294
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,609
kind of let prove it, you know.

295
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,330
Yeah. So it's a good question.

296
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,809
I mean, when it comes to prove it, there's a number of ways you can do it,

297
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,690
you can get a demo and then have your technical

298
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,890
people in the room to ask all the hard questions

299
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,010
you can come, you know, go through that really long and complicated

300
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:23,099
and I think sometimes beneficial RF I process.

301
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,169
Um

302
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,840
you could even go talk to ask them for references,

303
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,250
like give me a customer name of someone that's implemented this successfully

304
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,919
with the same use case that I'm about to implement it with.

305
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,479
And we get those asks too.

306
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,429
-- So those are some things that you can do.
-- One thing I've always wondered.

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,289
I mean, because I get from the vendor side that

308
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,109
just the amazing

309
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,020
um

310
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,669
having reference customers, right? You know, especially good ones

311
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,099
that are like, yeah, this works great. We did this with it and solve world hunger.

312
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:50,630
It's awesome.

313
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,960
A stupid question. But why do reference customers? Why are they willing to do that?

314
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:57,760
Like because one thing I've encountered too is a lot of companies that, you know,

315
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,520
really want to keep their it and their sort

316
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,719
of special sauce secret as much as possible.

317
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah, it's a good point.

318
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,119
There's a lot of use cases that customers don't want to talk

319
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,039
about for exactly that reason because it is secret sauce and if they

320
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,159
let the cat out of the bag, then their competitors will be able to catch up.

321
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,729
But on the other side of that, you know,

322
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:18,039
why do people talk about their use and why do they become a reference for us?

323
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,849
And I think there's a lot of people out there that

324
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,210
become champions for a piece of software because they've built their career on it.

325
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,669
And they, it's almost like they owe a debt of gratitude or they feel they do

326
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,140
to that vendor or that technology because of

327
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,280
how successful it's made them in their career.

328
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,489
I'll give you a good example. We had a customer down in Texas that

329
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:39,390
had been working with a piece of technology for about 10 years.

330
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,390
He was a self proclaimed champion of that technology.

331
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:45,630
And after he encountered our, encountered our software,

332
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,349
he started using it and trying it out and he realized that he

333
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:51,630
could do so much more with our stuff than he was with the,

334
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,950
with the existing software.

335
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:54,070
And he

336
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,750
over the course of months and probably longer than that,

337
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,309
he started to become a champion for us

338
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,520
and leaving his software in the dust. And

339
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,859
it's the same thing he said to me that he's going to

340
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,530
build the next 10 years of his career on our software.

341
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,830
And so he's willing to talk about it and almost become an evangelist for us.

342
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,940
And I think if you think about this outside of the software world,

343
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:14,880
when you,

344
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,340
when you own something

345
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,619
that you really love and, and you cherish,

346
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,700
I think you want to talk to people about it. I mean, I'm a musician so I buy

347
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:24,840
synthesizers much to my wife's

348
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,210
chagrin

349
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,690
and there are certain synthesizers that I tell everybody

350
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,340
about because I love them like they are amazing

351
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,479
and I want everybody else to know partly because

352
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,429
I want that company to be successful and build more stuff like that.

353
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,289
Well, I mean, yeah, in fairness earlier in the convers, well,

354
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,289
before we actually got going and you were doing the setup,

355
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:44,469
you mentioned you had a Samsung Go

356
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,590
mic and my response was like, yeah, that's a good mic.

357
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,369
You know, that's actually what me and Josh started with.

358
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,330
-- We,
-- we did a long time ago,

359
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,909
you know, they're great.

360
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,429
You

361
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:52,580
know,

362
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,840
it's amazing how far that thing's got me for 30 bucks, I think.

363
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,969
Seriously, man, it's, I carry it everywhere with me.

364
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:02,849
It stays in my backpack all the time because it's super small and it's fantastic.

365
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,340
Yeah,

366
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,969
I have a yeti in the closet that I don't use, but I love it.

367
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:09,570
But I bought that. I bought that because of a recommendation from a friend.

368
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,340
Nice. Very cool.

369
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,710
And in fact, that's how we ended up with our mics is a fellow podcaster.

370
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:19,390
Told me to buy uh Road podcaster mics and so I told her,

371
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,799
-- like, go buy this mic, like we need new mic
-- also know,

372
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,140
as the microphone you can beat a man to death with.

373
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,820
It's true. It's like cast iron, it weighs a ton.

374
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:29,104
It's awesome.

375
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,695
You might need that on the subway once in a while.

376
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:33,255
So

377
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,484
I'm also curious.

378
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,784
So because I've actually, I was just thinking about this,

379
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:39,325
I've never actually bought expensive software.

380
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:39,835
Like I've

381
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:43,294
probably the most I've I've ever been responsible for is, you know, well,

382
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,025
it was basically Gmail for, you know, a pile of users

383
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:48,684
which adds up. But, you know, gmail is a very safe bet.

384
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:51,224
So it's not really that risky a thing to buy.

385
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:52,375
Um

386
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:55,505
So, you know, obviously for some of these projects, we're talking, you know,

387
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,465
hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars even.

388
00:16:58,169 --> 00:16:59,400
And I'm just wondering like

389
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:02,510
from the customer's perspective kind of,

390
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,348
yeah, what, what can they do to protect themselves?

391
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,729
You know, because

392
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:10,380
there are definitely some less scrupulous vendors.

393
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,209
I would say, you know,

394
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,489
I've heard some horror stories about vendors that will just promise the moon or,

395
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,060
or my favorite example was a friend, worked for a company where

396
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:20,530
uh they were a technical person and, and the engineers are like, ok, well,

397
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,390
we sold this and here's the um

398
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,550
the uh the contract and the software engineer

399
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,660
response was our software doesn't do that.

400
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,798
And the sales guy response was, well, yeah,

401
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,838
but we told them it would soon,

402
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,520
you know.

403
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,819
So, yeah, I mean,

404
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,239
like with demos and stuff but, I mean, just, um,

405
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,540
yeah, how do you kind of tell the snake oil salesman? Because, like,

406
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,030
I look at some sectors like antivirus and it's clear

407
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,439
that there's like a lot of shenanigans going on,

408
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,869
like, really bad shenanigans.

409
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:50,510
It's interesting because, like, the antivirus stuff,

410
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,839
I think there's a lot of consumer, consumer based software that's really hard to

411
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,479
prevent the shenanigans. And, you know, I,

412
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,390
I send emails and text messages to my wife and daughter about things that I find out.

413
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,329
It's like, hey, if you're downloading this piece of software,

414
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:04,439
don't things like that.

415
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,050
So I do my best I can to protect them.

416
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,989
But on the enterprise side, I think the industry is changing this for us,

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,380
like all of us, not just the sales side, but the,

418
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,790
the customer side.

419
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,229
And part of the reason is because the cloud and the try before you buy mindset,

420
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,969
um open source is also changing this.

421
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,410
It's a little bit self serving because I work for elastic. But

422
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,660
all these opportunities that you have now to try before you buy. I

423
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,250
think that's one way that you can protect yourself really well because you get to

424
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,709
see if it's actually going to work for the use case that you need,

425
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,189
need to implement it for.

426
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,380
You know, we have a cloud trial for elastic that you can go on 14 day free trial.

427
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:43,219
If you like it, you swipe your credit card.

428
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:47,750
It's, it's, you know, a few dollars a month to get up and running and you start to build

429
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,000
trust on that platform

430
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,500
and it just kind of blossoms

431
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:55,640
like I, you know, I adopted this uh tool called a Sauna at Elastic.

432
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,209
And I started it because it was free.

433
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,329
I started to see if it would work for what I wanted to use it for.

434
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,930
And as I got more and more comfortable on it and, and realized that it would,

435
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,290
then I just kind of entered into a subscription agreement. Eyes wide open.

436
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,709
I tried it before I bought it.

437
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,890
So I think as the industry continues to go down the subscription path

438
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,640
and we, you know, we become consumers of that.

439
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,449
I think it's gonna get easier for us to protect ourselves

440
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,510
from predatory practices and sales.

441
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,630
But on the consumer side, that's a whole another thing I'm not exactly sure about.

442
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,969
And I think the consumer side is a little different because let's face it.

443
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:31,349
You're usually talking about a couple of bucks. Right. You're not writing

444
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,430
six and seven figure checks

445
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,140
-- for at least I hope you want.
-- And that's

446
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,489
part of the

447
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:35,869
challenge.

448
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,660
You know, when I'm, when I'm looking at products that cost 50 bucks,

449
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,349
it doesn't make sense to spend, you know, 50 hours

450
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,380
figuring out which one is absolutely correct. Right.

451
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,760
And that's, that's one of the challenges I see with this is,

452
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,459
you know, people ask me for recommendations and I'm like, uh

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
like that, that's usually my answer to most of their questions.

454
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,290
All right. So, so let's turn this question on its head though.

455
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,910
So let's say Steve, I am an enterprise buyer and I just wrote a giant freaking check

456
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,560
and it doesn't work.

457
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,089
What do I do now?

458
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,030
Well,

459
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,640
after you're in the unemployment line, you mean,

460
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,660
let's say I'm the second guy, right?

461
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,339
I'm the one who just, I was, I was just promoted to clean up the mess from the first guy.

462
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,770
So I've never been in that situation before. But if I were to speculate on it,

463
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,650
I think what I would do is

464
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,329
I'd probably do what I've seen done before, which is, you have to kind of pause

465
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,680
and re evaluate.

466
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:34,969
And I've,

467
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:38,079
I've been a part of sales processes where we get caught

468
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:41,569
in this cycle where someone made a decision about a technology,

469
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:42,969
it didn't work.

470
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,760
They

471
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:47,770
get exited out of the building, they bring in someone new and that new person,

472
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,869
their job is to

473
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,989
fix what's broken. And so what they end up doing is they,

474
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,349
they go through this re evaluation and it's really painful for everybody because

475
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,150
not only do you have to go back and see, ok,

476
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,469
what happened, what, what requirements are not fulfilled by the software,

477
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,290
you basically have to start over from

478
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,500
scratch to look at other technology solutions.

479
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,550
And hopefully there's some

480
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,229
prior art there from the ones that were evaluated before they made their decision

481
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,069
and then go down all the way through that process again. Now,

482
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,930
sometimes what I see is companies just kind of bite

483
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:22,010
the bullet and they customize the heck out of the software

484
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:24,280
to make it work for what they bought it for.

485
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,489
And they spend exorbitant amounts of money on this

486
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,880
and it, it, you know, sometimes it works

487
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,729
and

488
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,010
what ends up happening is no one likes the software upgrades become impossible.

489
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,520
And it's just kind of like you're, you're kicking the can down the road to failure.

490
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,520
Well, and, and to be honest, well, in Canada, right now we're going,

491
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,160
the federal government is going through this thing called the Phoenix Pay

492
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,800
project where they, they've now blown, yeah,

493
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,400
over a billion dollars Canadian on this federal pay system that's never worked.

494
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,180
And it sounds like they're finally going to pull the plug on it.

495
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,520
But the problem is they can't, because

496
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,750
you can't just pull the plug on a payroll system. Right.

497
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,869
You actually have to replace it with something like before you do that. And so

498
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,369
it seems like there's a lot of these, you know, just gigantic, it, disasters.

499
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,910
And part of me wonders if it's just part of the nature of the beast. Right?

500
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,270
Like building a large building seems to always be fraught with difficulty.

501
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,770
-- Um, and, yeah,
-- I mean,

502
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,130
I have my own theories about like why some of these big projects fail.

503
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,180
I think there's a lot of

504
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:22,459
nefarious things going on behind the scenes

505
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:25,140
quite honestly and relationships get complicated and

506
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,020
um we could probably talk for hours about this. But

507
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,359
there, there are, there is that kind of

508
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,709
human nature thing where I've already invested all this time and money

509
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,400
and I don't wanna

510
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,319
let go. Right. I just got to see it through to the end, even though, you know,

511
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,479
deep in your gut

512
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,229
that you're heading towards a cliff,

513
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,050
it's the most,

514
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,439
it's a cost fallacy. It's like

515
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,400
people just can't stop and take the emotion out of it.

516
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,439
Like most people identify with that type of thing

517
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,089
with the software project.

518
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:01,229
Like, you know, if I buy this software, it's now me, I'm on the line, like I've,

519
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,410
I've identified with

520
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:02,849
a

521
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,160
-- champion of software X
-- I think because you

522
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,650
mentioned several times now try before you buy.

523
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,729
And I think maybe that's one of the problems with some of these larger projects is,

524
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:15,650
you know, just either by their nature or by the type of organization it is,

525
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,489
they don't do that.

526
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,609
And, you know, they just,

527
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,219
they go through this like waterfall process,

528
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,030
create a 600 page document of requirements and then like,

529
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,989
OK, now we're going ahead with it, right?

530
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,750
Uh They don't do any like small scale testing or anything,

531
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,609
I think maybe that's because that's one thing I've

532
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,109
seen consistently where things start to break down is,

533
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,880
you know, where projects kind of try to go from 0 to 60 in one step rather than,

534
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,640
you know, like 10 smaller steps.

535
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,420
And so obviously, yeah,

536
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,689
with open source and with you like having a cloud service where I can like,

537
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:48,910
start trying it for free or for a few bucks a month based on usage.

538
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,800
You know, clearly those small steps I can start to

539
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:52,949
validate that.

540
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah,

541
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,050
this thing actually exists and works to some degree or it does

542
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,000
exactly what they claim it does and what I need it to.

543
00:23:59,790 --> 00:23:59,959
Yeah,

544
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:02,630
it's almost like buyers should take the agile methodologies

545
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
and apply that to how they buy software.

546
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:04,849
Right?

547
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:09,780
I remember I did a project for a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider

548
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,709
in Oregon once and we were evaluating salesforce.com

549
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,030
to build the software on

550
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,099
and,

551
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,000
you know,

552
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,290
I was at a consulting company at the time and we organized a

553
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,699
team of architects that had done implementations in Java for a long time

554
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,420
and we were looking at the force.com platform at the time. And so

555
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,400
when we had these meetings with sales force and with the customer,

556
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,099
we had many,

557
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:34,180
many conversations about the requirements that we were trying to implement.

558
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:38,430
And because we had such a good experience, experience, team of architects

559
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,619
that knew

560
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,119
where the the

561
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,680
I guess bear traps were in implementation.

562
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:47,020
We were able to work through all those complicated issues beforehand.

563
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,199
And what we ended up with

564
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,079
was an architecture that was mostly on sales force.

565
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,939
But then we had to implement some things on the back end on Tomcat because

566
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,959
we couldn't do everything on sales force. But

567
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:01,260
we discovered that during the, the procurement or the sorry, the discovery phase.

568
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,760
And so it saved the project, I think.

569
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,170
And here we are years later,

570
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,410
I haven't worked there for years and that project is still up and running.

571
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,939
So I think that's a good thing. Like if you get good people and they can vet

572
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,089
the solution that you're trying to, to do,

573
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:16,619
you're trying to implement. And that's always a good thing.

574
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,459
Um

575
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,079
And, you know,

576
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:21,530
maybe there's unrealistic timelines out there and people just don't have the,

577
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,300
they don't think they have the time to do that. But,

578
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,829
you know, I think they're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

579
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,599
-- Quite honestly,
-- it sounds like you're in a catch 22 as a

580
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:31,489
organization often that, you know,

581
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,449
if you have the people with the expertise to do this, you would simply do it right.

582
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:36,489
And

583
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,010
clearly, if you haven't done it yet,

584
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,449
you probably don't have the people that can do that.

585
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,660
And I guess that's where bringing in the outside because, you know,

586
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,410
that's one thing I always struggled with was understanding, you know,

587
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,640
why would these companies that are huge and have tons of talent,

588
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,869
bring in outside consultants and contractors?

589
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,680
Right. Because

590
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,290
why would you need that, you know, you have 100,000 people

591
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,369
and,

592
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,469
well, yeah, I mean, obviously,

593
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:58,880
like very niche or specific knowledge about sales force and like, where

594
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,560
not to use sales force but build a custom back end.

595
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:05,680
Yeah, I'm guessing that's probably not very widely known or, you know,

596
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,489
that's a very niche skill for, you know, a small handful of people.

597
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,900
Well, it goes back to your point,

598
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,869
Kurt about the core competency thing, like we were building a, a

599
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,449
core business system for the

600
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
the healthcare provider.

601
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,609
And so they had all the domain knowledge.

602
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,849
So it was up to us as architects to go in and understand

603
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:27,390
the actual implementation details and the business

604
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,119
rules that we would need to implement.

605
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,550
And then

606
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:33,170
look at salesforce with a skeptical eye quite honestly to make sure that

607
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,569
it could do all the things that we needed to know that we were going to do. Now,

608
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,300
I think that the

609
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,550
provider was smart in saying we can't do this ourselves, we need some outside help.

610
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,099
And so they enlisted the help of our consulting company.

611
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:47,510
But

612
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,000
again, it,

613
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,020
I don't know,

614
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,099
I don't know how these people decide on whether or

615
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:54,680
not they're gonna bring outside vendors in versus inside because

616
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,329
you know, we could,

617
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,880
you can speculate on how often Netflix brings out

618
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:04,400
the experts, right? They fly in the the snipers basically to go implement some

619
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,560
system for them versus use their own internal engineers

620
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,069
that are on staff already to do it.

621
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:12,050
Well, it actually sounds kind of like we're in Dunning Kruger territory of,

622
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,949
you know, some people

623
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,750
know, so they,

624
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,979
they don't know enough about something to

625
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:17,709
know that they actually don't know enough about

626
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,310
it, you know.

627
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,160
And then there's the people that know enough about it to know that. Like,

628
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,910
like

629
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,069
that. Yeah, I should, I need to go find some experts and pay them money,

630
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,310
you know, like I, I just recently went through that.

631
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,189
I had some exterminators come to my house and do some stuff with poison

632
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,069
because, yeah, I know, I know enough about poison to know that.

633
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,849
Like, I, yeah, I don't want to die

634
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,739
or, like,

635
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,650
you know, melt half my brain.

636
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,739
Um,

637
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,910
and I, I guess that would be one of the, the catch 20 twos again of, you know,

638
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,209
some of these organizations,

639
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,369
yeah. How mature or how willing are they to bring in

640
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,180
help,

641
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,000
you know, to admit that they don't know.

642
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:52,760
Yeah.

643
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,339
I think it takes some self awareness and some, some ego checking quite honestly.

644
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,280
Like you just said, I,

645
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,979
sometimes I'm on the weekend,

646
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:02,459
the plumber at my house and most of the time I regret doing a project

647
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:06,079
that I did because it took three times as long as I expected it,

648
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:09,160
it costs twice as much and I'm left with cuts.

649
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,959
You know, my wife laughs because I cut myself with a hammer.

650
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:13,439
How do you cut yourself with a hammer.

651
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,079
That's so,

652
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,119
you know,

653
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,160
II, I do these things

654
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,170
because I overestimate my ability and I think it's simpler than it is.

655
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,369
And that's on a micro scale.

656
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,560
The same psychology applies at a macro scale.

657
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:29,329
It does actually. And, and you've really, you've hit upon something and

658
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:31,410
so I, I do the same thing, Steve where I,

659
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,869
I try to fix things on a regular basis and then I

660
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,959
usually end up wasting a weekend and then calling a plumber.

661
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,969
So I lose twice

662
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,280
and, and I guess this is,

663
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,609
this is what's going through my head right now is the fact that,

664
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,060
uh, we, I, I think especially in security,

665
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:50,010
we have a very negative view of sales people

666
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,500
and, and I don't think that's unearned from some organizations,

667
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,180
but I think at the same time

668
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,380
it is probably prudent

669
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,930
as a security person to at least talk to

670
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,239
a, a group that could potentially solve your problem and,

671
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,069
and see what they get because, like, I know from your perspective from,

672
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,780
from my dealings with you, you're obviously,

673
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:12,599
you know, you, you're brutally honest in, in these dealings.

674
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:15,829
And so, like, you're going to tell someone what's up when, when you call them and,

675
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,319
and I have a feeling that

676
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,449
if, if more security people found

677
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,410
sales organizations they could trust

678
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,530
it would be a very different world.

679
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,689
Yeah.

680
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:28,180
It, it would be

681
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,329
like, if, if I were a buyer today

682
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,400
I would do my darndest to go into every interaction

683
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,930
with an organization as skeptical as I can be.

684
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:41,400
And I would even plant questions in there that I know their software can't do

685
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,719
to see what they say.

686
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,810
Because one of the ways that one of the ways

687
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:47,000
that we earn trust actually in the field is by

688
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:49,520
being honest about what we can't do,

689
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,729
you know, a lot of people confuse

690
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,069
our software with things like hadoop and they just assume

691
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,160
that they can use it in a batch oriented way.

692
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,069
And it's like, well,

693
00:29:58,369 --> 00:29:59,790
not really, it wasn't designed for that.

694
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,000
It was designed for speed scale and relevance,

695
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,469
not batch oriented back office processing.

696
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,150
We have a role to play there. But

697
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,989
if you're thinking about using us to replace a dupe, depending on the use case,

698
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,349
it's probably a bad idea.

699
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,709
And if you can

700
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,359
now that doesn't come up in every sales conversation, you know,

701
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:19,300
you can't go into a sales meeting and,

702
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,349
and try to expose everything you can't do like no one wants to do that.

703
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,319
But

704
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,939
as a buyer, you have to be able to ask these tough questions.

705
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:30,739
You, you need to put the vendor on their heels a little bit

706
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,900
and see what they say. And,

707
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,760
you know, it's funny because at, at,

708
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,579
at uh

709
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:40,339
elastic right now on my team anyway, we're, we're doing uh some sales training and

710
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,180
one of the trainings that we had was, it's called conscious selling,

711
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,810
which I loved the title and I love the, the content.

712
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,420
But the, the trainer was talking about

713
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,060
body language and tone of voice and how much that matters and how, how,

714
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:57,939
what you actually say matters so little.

715
00:30:57,949 --> 00:30:58,640
I mean, the,

716
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,349
the diagram he put on the powerpoint was basically

717
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,699
your words are about 7% of what you're saying.

718
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:06,579
The rest is in your body language and your,

719
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,270
your uh tone of voice. So

720
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,829
as a salesperson,

721
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:13,260
you have to believe in what you're selling.

722
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,540
If you don't, the customer will pick up on it.

723
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,869
They may not know consciously that they're that you're

724
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,339
that you don't believe what you're saying,

725
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,250
-- but they will pick up on it.
-- Here's a question. You just mentioned that because I was,

726
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,969
you just mentioned you had sales training and I'm wondering

727
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,420
because I've never heard of this now that I think about it.

728
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,260
Is there such a thing as buyer training?

729
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:32,969
-- That's a great question. There should be.
-- Yeah.

730
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,430
No, I'm dead serious. Like I'm just thinking about this and I've literally

731
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,469
obviously marketing people and sales people have tons, you know,

732
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:43,229
they get together every year for their big thing and then they have like,

733
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,109
you know, like

734
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,469
there's always training and you know, all these things

735
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,550
and, and I literally, I can't think of ever having heard of buyer training.

736
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,719
It's funny, I just did a Google for buyer training and it looks like there are

737
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,689
well and I know there are for like specific, you know, for,

738
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:02,099
like when I worked for that electrical contractor, for example,

739
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:03,040
they had two people,

740
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,239
their whole job was estimating and buying.

741
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,040
That's it. Right.

742
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,729
They would look at a set of blueprints and they'd say it's going to cost you x,

743
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,989
you know, and if the contract went through they would then get on the phone and order,

744
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,329
like, you know, literally like $3 million worth of stuff.

745
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:19,550
But, you know, it's a very well defined, they had like binders,

746
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,949
they knew exactly what they were getting and I'm just looking for software

747
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,810
sort of buyer training. And

748
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:28,089
-- so
-- Kurt check this out on this course that I found,

749
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,160
there's a section of bullet that says, spotting,

750
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,949
handling and stopping scam artists, hustlers and

751
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,500
that's awesome.

752
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,619
Uh Send me the link Steve. I'll put it in the show notes.

753
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,030
I will, I will now that you got me thinking about this,

754
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,250
I should go through this training.

755
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,089
Wait, that's me.

756
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:51,989
So anyway, all right, let's, let's, let's take it home like this. So let's say

757
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,790
I'm, I'm a buyer

758
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:54,869
and

759
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm in some high pressure sales situation and I'm looking for an escape hatch.

760
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,550
How do I get out?

761
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:02,449
So you

762
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,069
by escape hatch, you mean, I,

763
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,750
I no longer want to deal with? That's right.

764
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,650
Like I've got some pushy sales guy who's just, he's,

765
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,630
I'm feeling super pressured and vulnerable and like I need out, what do I do.

766
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,939
Well, there's a number of ways my preference is to be direct.

767
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,380
Says, look, I'm not going forward with your solution.

768
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:20,459
That's that.

769
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,579
And you, you have no obligation to reply to that sales rep after that, in my opinion,

770
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,660
uh the other one is to give him what we call tennis balls.

771
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,699
Now, like you can just say, oh, go fetch me a customer reference, go fetch me a TCO,

772
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,890
go fetch me an Roy and you just keep giving them errands until they,

773
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,150
they get tired of dealing with you.

774
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,119
This sounds exactly like how people break up.

775
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,569
Either that no means no or oh, I have to wash my cat that day.

776
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:48,079
Yes. Yes. They just make excuses. I I stop answering your emails.

777
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,219
I stop answering your phone calls and my wife and I joke

778
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,859
that this is basically the equivalent of unfriending someone in real life.

779
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:54,859
Like how do you do that?

780
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:59,709
That's hilarious. That's awesome. Alright, sweet. So I guess

781
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,150
any, any, any parting thoughts for us, Steve.

782
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,800
So I, I think right now on the security space especially,

783
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,159
I think there's a plethora of new providers and new vendors coming up every day.

784
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,790
I mean, Josh, you and I were at Rs A we saw this first

785
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:13,290
hand.

786
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,570
So

787
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:18,070
I just encourage people to be very skeptical and

788
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,260
you know, do your best to try before you buy,

789
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,989
ask questions of the of the seller that you know,

790
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,739
they can't do just to see if they're being honest with you

791
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,889
and really pay attention to body language and tone and see if they're

792
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:31,899
being,

793
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,840
you know, authentic versus just nice and, and

794
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,458
pushy and high pressure

795
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,358
and, you know, in the, again, in the security space,

796
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:41,978
the other thing I think I would say is make sure that when

797
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,958
you adopt a technology right now that it plays nicely with other technologies.

798
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:46,819
Like if you're,

799
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:51,248
if your technology does not have an API to integrate with other technologies,

800
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:52,549
something's wrong.

801
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,309
Is that even a thing anymore?

802
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:58,479
It is like a, a buddy of mine calls calls it a bag of doorknobs,

803
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,069
which I love this analogy

804
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,079
because you have this bag of doorknobs, none of them work with each other.

805
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:05,039
You gotta go to the door and try each of them out

806
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,239
and it's, it's a painful experience. So if you're evaluating software today,

807
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,949
there's a reason that the developers of the world are going api first and

808
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:16,879
you should be making sure that that software will integrate with other things.

809
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,389
Awesome.

810
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,540
And, and I must say Beador

811
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,830
Knobs sounds like a great band name.

812
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,689
But

813
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,750
all right. So anyway, thank you so much, Steve. It was, it was fascinating.

814
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,149
I'm, I'm really glad you came and, and I guess thank you, Kurt,

815
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,350
