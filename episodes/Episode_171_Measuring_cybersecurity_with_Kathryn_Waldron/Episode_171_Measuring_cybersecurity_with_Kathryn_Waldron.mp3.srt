Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,920
Episode 171 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,739
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,329
Hey, Kurt.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,510
And today we are joined with Catherine Waldron,

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,409
who's a fellow at the R Street Institute.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,870
-- Say hello, Catherine.
-- Hi. Thanks so much for having me.

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,510
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,639
And the reason Catherine's here talking to us today is there is

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,829
a white paper she wrote that's titled Resources For Measuring Cybersecurity.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,180
And as anyone who's listened to the show for any period of

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,669
time knows that measuring cybersecurity is kind of one of our,

12
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,209
I don't know if I'd call it a pet peeve, but maybe our, our, our wish.

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,189
So why don't you tell us what you've done, Catherine? And then we can,

14
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,950
-- we can discuss.
-- Absolutely. So

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,860
the white paper, um it's a bibliography of resources for measuring cybersecurity,

16
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:51,810
different methods,

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,419
um different companies that are out there, different academic approaches.

18
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:59,720
And it's really part of a bigger project that my team at my,

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,726
the think tank where I work DC is working on, on measuring cybersecurity,

20
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,364
which is we're trying to see.

21
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,185
We don't really think people are doing a very good

22
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:10,206
job of measuring cybersecurity in a way that's very,

23
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,716
that's quantifiable,

24
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:15,276
uh that's transparent, that's easily adapted

25
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,416
and easy to assess across sectors.

26
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,486
And so as part of this project,

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,685
we want to sort of take the temperature of the landscape out there, you know,

28
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:23,325
see what's out there

29
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,132
ready, what approaches people are taking.

30
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,611
And that's, that gave birth to this first iteration of the project.

31
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,861
This white paper we're hoping for it to be to eventually become an online sort of

32
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,491
portfolio bibliography of like on that can be

33
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,291
updated ongoing as we come across new methods.

34
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:43,071
But this this first round was really just to sort of see what's out there. And so,

35
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,872
you know, the things we include, it's not, they aren't

36
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,809
necessarily the things that we think are best or worst there.

37
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,010
There's no, we're not recommending, you know, use this for your company.

38
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,830
-- It's really just what's out there, what are people doing,
-- right.

39
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:59,230
And in fact, you say in your intro, it's not an exhaustive list, but I must say

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,430
the list is intimidatingly long.

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,129
And that was kind of the first thing that jumped out at me was the fact that with,

42
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,979
I mean, this is already a really hard problem

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,008
and

44
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:15,029
there's just how do you pick? I mean, this list, it's enormous.

45
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,850
-- That's, that's all I kept thinking
-- looking at this list for me.

46
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,699
The thing I thought like,

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,600
so one of the projects that cloud security lines has

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,860
done is that cloud controls matrix where they basically took,

49
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:23,250
I guess, like,

50
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,179
15 or 20 different standards and tried to kind of map them to each other and, you know,

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,820
they did a pretty reasonable job, but

52
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,740
it really drives home

53
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:31,710
for me.

54
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,279
At least that, I think the worst part about all these standards is that they're

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
almost the same, but really not

56
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,759
-- quite the same.
-- You're exactly right.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,740
There's a lot out there and they're all, a lot of them are very similar,

58
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,800
especially on the frameworks approach.

59
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:45,270
So,

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,660
you know,

61
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,789
probably the bulk of the paper that first section has to do with people with

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,380
different frameworks and like just lists of security control and a lot of them cover

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,376
more, less the same ground.

64
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,975
Like we did the most well known ones like NIST are obviously up there.

65
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:58,535
But it's like,

66
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:03,876
how exactly different is it gonna be if you use like n standards or like the BS A

67
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,046
framework?

68
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:08,695
A lot of them are very, very similar in regards to like it being exhaustive.

69
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,805
It's nowhere near exhaustive.

70
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,365
It's, it's a long list and,

71
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,192
but it's nowhere near the list of like academic papers and,

72
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:19,311
and other companies that I have saved somewhere in

73
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,722
the back of my computer that uh didn't make

74
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,632
the cut because they were too abstract or too

75
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:26,472
academic or didn't add something new to the conversation.

76
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:27,962
And actually, since being,

77
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,852
since we've released the bibliography,

78
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,901
I've gotten also several emails from people being like, hey,

79
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,311
would you please put my company uh on this list as well?

80
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,270
So I'm still getting those and,

81
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,910
and we do want to update it actually with more resources.

82
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,210
Even since uh

83
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:46,119
it, we sent the paper off to the editing process.

84
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,550
We've had conversations with different companies and organizations who are doing

85
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,119
really cool things that didn't make it in this first round

86
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,000
in terms of like, how did we decide what to pick?

87
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,429
Because we're in Washington DC and kind of in the policy business.

88
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,389
We were trying to pick things that you are going to be very well known.

89
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:05,149
They were kind of like leaders in the standards industry

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,169
or were very, very approachable.

91
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:12,679
I didn't want to, you know, give policymakers a list of like 20 academic papers that

92
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,570
if I can't understand it, they can't understand it for sure.

93
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,140
And my background is not in it, it's actually in economics and policy.

94
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,449
-- So
-- I think that was one of the most interesting things was on page

95
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,808
six where you actually broke down the different types of standards because I,

96
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,239
I'd never really thought about this clearly before.

97
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:29,489
So, you know, you've got the frameworks and scorecards which yeah,

98
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:30,509
I'm familiar with those

99
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,199
and then you've broken it insurance metrics which

100
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,648
yeah, I know that that is a very much different thing,

101
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:38,000
you know, the Roaro si ones,

102
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,779
then the cybercrime ones and then something I've never heard about before this,

103
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,869
I don't know how to pronounce it.

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,029
-- Siri Siri.
-- I don't know. I think it's Siri.

105
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,350
Yeah, it's the work done by the Department of Homeland Security at the moment.

106
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,500
-- So,
-- what I found most interesting about that though was,

107
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,279
was especially for me was that

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,549
difference between number 12 and three I

109
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,220
think was the biggest because looking at some

110
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,700
of these standards now they make a lot more sense in the context of,

111
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,429
oh, this isn't

112
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,834
framework. This is like for the insurance industry.

113
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:03,304
Yes,

114
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,234
yes.

115
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,484
And we've, we've talked to people and so as part of as part of this project,

116
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,554
we're talking to different organizations and different

117
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,834
companies to kind of see what they,

118
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:12,785
what approach they use.

119
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,144
And so we've talked to a couple of people in the insurance.

120
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:18,315
Um the difficulty with talking with companies like that is obviously

121
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,274
they're not going to share their mathematical numbers with us.

122
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:25,024
We don't, we don't get to see their equations. And so determining the exact

123
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:28,390
how, how good their metrics are can actually be difficult.

124
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,269
But I do think that determining uh depending on which one you pick,

125
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,529
whether it's a framework, whether you're using some sort of insurance metric or ro I

126
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,869
that's going to lead you to make very different decisions.

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,529
It's going to have very different like policy implications if you're

128
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,970
in Washington or it's going to lead you to make different like business decisions.

129
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,750
If you're like the CEO or the head of a company.

130
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,279
And I think that's one thing that keeps boiling down to me

131
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,739
is even when we start using a specific framework or standard,

132
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,019
how do we measure success?

133
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,130
Because most of them don't really seem to address that very well.

134
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,440
We're hoping to get a quantitative answer.

135
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,010
And right now, I feel like cybersecurity is very qualitative.

136
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,140
Like there are things we know,

137
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,940
we know that it's better to have a password than not have a password.

138
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,299
And we know that your password should not be the word password.

139
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,600
Um But it's hard to say at this point that, you know,

140
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,940
if I implement this cybersecurity control, you know,

141
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,589
I will be like 5% more secure and therefore

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
it's worth spending X number of dollars on it,

143
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:24,119
right?

144
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,679
And you clear, I mean, I mean,

145
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,269
this is a point you bring up on it at some

146
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,440
point and kind of near the intro of the framework section

147
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,790
is the fact that there's following too many frameworks could potentially

148
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,269
have a negative impact on the security of a business.

149
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,470
Which kind of my, my head exploded a little bit when I read that because I mean,

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,959
when you say that it's like, duh,

151
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,119
but at the same time, that's never, that's never the impression I get.

152
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,790
It's always, oh, we're following these 12 frameworks, people say, and it's like,

153
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,040
well, why?

154
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:54,510
Right. It doesn't make sense.

155
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,510
Yeah,

156
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,940
I think the framework was the most personally interesting because I think that's

157
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,609
where a lot of people go when they are first starting to look and be like, hey,

158
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,829
am I cyber Secure?

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,230
How can I like, work on my cybersecurity.

160
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,549
It's like, oh, they're easy, like frameworks are easy.

161
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,750
They're, they're accessible, they're well known,

162
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,704
but they can leave you in some kind of alarming

163
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:15,484
directions if you're not really careful about how they're implemented.

164
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:18,684
For example, one problem that we've seen is that

165
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:21,725
if you implement a framework and then

166
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:25,165
you don't update it regularly as the threat landscape updates,

167
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:26,684
you might have a false sense of security.

168
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:30,165
You might be like, oh, I'm checking the box on these five items, I'm safe,

169
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,484
especially if, if the person making that decision,

170
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,734
you know, isn't someone with an it background,

171
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,725
maybe it's someone higher up the management chain

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,179
and they're like, no, we're following this framework.

173
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,019
We've got these things in place. We're good.

174
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,450
And then the other, you know, other issues is, you know, a,

175
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,369
a company could be investing too much in cybersecurity

176
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,510
actually, or they might be investing in the wrong things in cybersecurity.

177
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,339
They might be like, oh, well, we're gonna check off the box on these small,

178
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,559
on these areas

179
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,399
when really those are not the threats they need to be concerned about.

180
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,940
I have a related question to that, I guess.

181
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,920
And I think you're in a unique position for this answer, Catherine, as you said,

182
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,660
your background is around economics and policy.

183
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,459
Yes. And I look at this list of frameworks and it is enormous.

184
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,480
And like you said, there's even more you didn't include.

185
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,130
And I'm curious,

186
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,440
is this a problem unique to the cybersecurity industry

187
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,910
or is this a problem other fields have?

188
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,420
I don't know that it's unique to the cybersecurity industry.

189
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,269
And this is a problem that was reoccurring, not just with frameworks,

190
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,500
but a lot of these different metrics

191
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,429
is that because it's still a new industry

192
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,650
or, or newer industry, we just don't have as much data

193
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,380
to recognize which ones are truly the superior approaches

194
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,750
and what's more the threat landscape is evolving,

195
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,479
I think at a much faster rate

196
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,130
than in other types of industries.

197
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,580
So, you know, if you're talking about physical security,

198
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,969
there's only so many different ways that that's gonna happen.

199
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,820
If, if you're, you know, protecting a building or something,

200
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,739
you're gonna put a lock on the door and things like that.

201
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,299
But people aren't coming up with,

202
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,840
they aren't typically coming up with that many new ways to,

203
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
you know, break into a house. Whereas with,

204
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:07,539
with cyber, there's so many different ways to,

205
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:11,869
to approach cybersecurity and hackers are always innovating as to how to break in.

206
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,059
And so that's, it's a much faster moving industry.

207
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,200
And also as new technology comes on board, you know, the internet of things A I five G,

208
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,450
there's also so many more risks from other people that are in your network,

209
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:25,395
in your supply chain.

210
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:25,994
Sure.

211
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,674
I mean, that, that's fair. I think that makes sense.

212
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:32,784
I was talking actually about your paper with a friend and he had a question was,

213
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:33,955
which was basically

214
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:38,875
what do we do with the types of risks that are sort of the existential threat risk?

215
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,614
You know. So for example, well, to go all science fiction,

216
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,385
you know, somebody hacks a nuclear power plant and, and

217
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,640
you know, manages to make it blow up or whatever

218
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,500
it seems like. That is something, those sort of Black Swan events.

219
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,679
That's something most of these frameworks and

220
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,070
strategies really don't really deal with.

221
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,219
I mean, I think,

222
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,530
I think you're right that I think most of these approaches don't

223
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,599
really deal with the Black Swan event and that's kind of alarming.

224
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,750
I think that's something companies need to be thinking about

225
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,619
quite seriously is how do we recover from that?

226
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,570
We can't imagine.

227
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,270
And I don't know if that comes from,

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,559
people need to get better at imagining the future be that

229
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,640
creative think tank sessions collaborating with people outside the industry.

230
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,969
Maybe we need to start talking to science

231
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,020
fiction writers more.

232
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,659
But I also think what you bring up about how

233
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:26,859
this could this could have very catastrophic implications if,

234
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,729
if foreign actors choose to engage in malicious activity.

235
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,760
That way, I do think there's,

236
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,119
there's hopefully going to be slightly different results if they get a hold of the

237
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,700
nuclear power plant as opposed to if they

238
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,539
take down a company during Christmas shopping,

239
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,820
I'm sure that the company will probably feel like they're on the same level.

240
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,719
But as a national security expert,

241
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:50,309
I'm not really as concerned about one as the other, but it is true that we're still,

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,070
we're really figuring out what counts as a act of war when it comes to cybersecurity.

243
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,669
You know,

244
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,549
the US has refrained from really determining from saying, you know,

245
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,070
this is exactly what is going to count when it comes to the cybersecurity landscape.

246
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:12,059
And it's a very gray area. And so, well, it's a slightly separate issue.

247
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,159
I, I do think it's something that is related in terms of like,

248
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:19,340
how do we measure what's a cyber attack as opposed to an act of war?

249
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:20,659
What's cyber crime?

250
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,630
What do we do when, you know, it's a very gray area?

251
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,739
What do you do when it's like sponsored by the Chinese government?

252
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,510
But it's act, it's not like officially part of like,

253
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,320
it's some sort of patriotic hacker who's trying to

254
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,349
break into an American company to steal their IP.

255
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:39,119
And is that, does that count as an act of war or is that just crime?

256
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,549
-- Like it's a gray area?
-- Is there anybody?

257
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,710
Because that's one thing I keep seeing is, you know, what is trust, what is security?

258
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,890
You know, what, what are the definition of these words?

259
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,070
And that seems to be something our industry doesn't even have yet.

260
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,940
You know, we can't, I mean, we can barely agree on what a buffer overflow is,

261
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,760
let alone something much bigger.

262
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,760
Like what is risk,

263
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,559
you know, what is a threat

264
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,080
-- and then
-- what is, like, acceptable

265
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,500
risk? Yeah, 100% agree. What is acceptable risk?

266
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,450
-- What is acceptable to eat or to, to allow to happen?
-- Because I think most of us agree.

267
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,780
We're probably, and, and maybe policymakers don't agree with this, but, uh,

268
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,559
we're probably, we're never getting to the place where we're 100% secure.

269
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,559
-- So, how much risk are we allowed to? Uh, like, let slide
-- essentially.

270
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,830
I mean, you have a whole return on investment section here.

271
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,659
And,

272
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean, that's kind of the point, right?

273
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,859
Is if we take on this risk, what does, or doesn't it cost us later? Right.

274
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:30,830
Yes.

275
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,109
Can you speak on that?

276
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,520
That's something I always struggle with is we exist

277
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,419
in an industry where if we do our jobs,

278
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:38,570
nothing happens.

279
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:40,219
That's nuts.

280
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,070
Well, that's, I think that's why it's hard for certain people in business,

281
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,140
especially to sort of wrap their minds around it because

282
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,570
you are the, you're spending money and hoping that, you know,

283
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,520
you spend the money and that, that's it.

284
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,080
You know, you're just trying to prevent

285
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,830
an even greater loss.

286
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,010
And so

287
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,039
that is a slightly different way of thinking than

288
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,400
when it comes to other inputs in your business

289
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,530
where you're like, OK,

290
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,219
I spend my money on this and instead I'm gonna get something back,

291
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,200
I'm gonna get a profit back.

292
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,960
Whereas the

293
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:13,187
cybersecurity you're really just trying to ward off disaster.

294
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:16,978
And that can be like, I can understand why, you know,

295
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,268
CEO S look at that bottom line and they're like,

296
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,127
uh I don't know if I want to spend my money there.

297
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,828
And on a related note, I mean, coming from an economics background.

298
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:27,098
So what's your thinking on the whole Externalizing of costs?

299
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,557
Because it seems to me like most of these data breaches, for example, you know,

300
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:31,968
with the privacy implications.

301
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,278
Well, that's largely an externalized problem for the company of eight.

302
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:37,495
They don't actually, you know,

303
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,226
suffer and have to deal with somebody taking out

304
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,976
a credit card or a mortgage in their name.

305
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,236
And so far,

306
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,476
I don't think we've seen any legislation anywhere that

307
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,926
actually really holds companies to account for this.

308
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:49,976
The issue of externality is to put it in economic term is,

309
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:53,276
is a real issue with cybersecurity for, for a couple of reasons.

310
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:54,346
Number one is that a

311
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:58,325
lot of times companies can sort of push the cost onto the

312
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,455
consumer in the case of a breach or something like that.

313
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:03,616
Obviously, they will suffer some reputational

314
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,953
damage, especially if it gets well publicized.

315
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:07,703
But depending on how much your average

316
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,744
consumer cares about a cybersecurity breach,

317
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:13,453
a company may be able to avoid some of the worst of that damage.

318
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,314
And then the other issue is that a

319
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:19,333
lot of times because of the supply chain, if you're so integrated,

320
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:22,833
you know, if you don't implement your cybersecurity controls correctly,

321
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,973
maybe it's the company down the line that ends up

322
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,843
taking the hit because they're in your supply chain.

323
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:30,064
And that's where, you know, the hackers, maybe that's their true aim.

324
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:30,994
They're not, they're just using

325
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,392
you to get to someone bigger.

326
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,442
And so that's, I think something,

327
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:37,901
the cybersecurity insurance actually from is going to have to deal with a lot,

328
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:43,322
figuring out where to appropriately attribute blame and how to make sure that

329
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,791
the people you're securing aren't just implementing

330
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,252
good cybersecurity hygiene on their own,

331
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,932
but are also making sure that people in

332
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,392
their supply chain have equally good cyber hygiene.

333
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:55,791
So I want to pick on that one actually. And

334
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,231
I know you, you submitted

335
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,380
II, I know you had at least a written testimony to,

336
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,299
I forget which committee right now.

337
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,539
I, I found it on the internet while I was cyber stalking you prior to the interview.

338
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:07,469
And

339
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,099
yeah, basically, you talk about some of these, you know,

340
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,780
hygiene and supply chain issues that we see in the industry.

341
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:15,869
I think that's,

342
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,609
that's a fascinating problem

343
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,409
because I don't think people always understand that

344
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,130
when you're kind of the end producer of

345
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,650
something and one of your suppliers three levels deep

346
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,020
is a flaming me

347
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,270
on fire.

348
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,010
That's your problem

349
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,729
because you're kind of the, you're the, I guess

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,219
customer facing piece of that product, especially in cybersecurity.

351
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,049
I feel like that, that concept is often lost.

352
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,119
Yeah, it's a huge, I think it's a huge issue because if you are the end producer,

353
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,419
you are the face that people are going to recognize

354
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,669
like when something goes wrong they're going to be like,

355
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,159
oh yeah,

356
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,286
it was their fault and they're not, I kind of think, oh,

357
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,806
it was actually their supplier all.

358
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:55,885
Let's like, put the target incident back in,

359
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:59,226
I think it was like 2013. Where was the H VAC supplier?

360
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,426
But no one thinks, oh, no one's gonna think about the H VAC supplier. Only.

361
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:06,065
People are only going to think about Target. So, yeah, it's, it's a huge issue.

362
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:07,645
Definitely. Right. Right.

363
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:11,546
And I mean, that one's especially bizarre because if I was

364
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:12,591
concerned with

365
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,372
securing my infrastructure, I mean,

366
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:18,822
-- now I would consider H VAC but I think back then I'd be like, no
-- one

367
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:19,711
-- would
-- back then.

368
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:21,502
-- Right. It's just H
-- VAC. Exactly.

369
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:22,281
And as we like,

370
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:26,562
rely and integrate like internet of things and things more and more into our system,

371
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,021
there's just going to be things you don't think about.

372
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,611
No one's going to think. Oh, my smart scale is a security threat.

373
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,099
-- Right.
-- Maybe my, is it my coffee maker?

374
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,270
Like no, actually,

375
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,210
so Kurt has a smart scale and we probably talk about it more than we should on this.

376
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:40,710
Show.

377
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,979
-- So
-- I basically given up and I just buy the cheapest

378
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:46,580
stuff I can because I know it's all a flaming pile.

379
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,119
And,

380
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,799
but on the other hand, like,

381
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,520
I refuse to buy a smart door lock and it's not because I'm afraid, like,

382
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,159
a hacker will hack it and get into my house.

383
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm actually more afraid that, like,

384
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,840
one day it won't work and it'll be minus 40 outside.

385
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,080
And, like, I want to get into my house when it's minus 40.

386
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,880
-- I think that's
-- a very, very fair

387
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,679
concern.

388
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,239
I've lived in very cold places.

389
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,880
Right. Right. Exactly.

390
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,890
Ok. So I'm, I'm also curious, one of the things I read in

391
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:11,680
this,

392
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,239
this paper you have is you said that, that our street

393
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,640
is, you're starting an initiative to kind of build a consensus around this.

394
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,540
So I'm curious, like, what does that mean? Right.

395
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,680
Is there, is there something we should be paying attention to?

396
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,569
There's something we can do to get involved? Like, what's the deal? Yeah.

397
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,339
Well, we're starting as part of the project. We're engaging in dialogue.

398
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,359
We're trying to, you know, if, if there is an answer out there

399
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,010
and we're not 100% convinced yet there is or there isn't.

400
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,650
Um, but we, we're looking for it and so we are

401
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,930
like engaging with just about everyone we know

402
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,520
to try to be like, hey, what's your approach? Do you think this is possible?

403
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,209
And it's kind of interesting my colleague,

404
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,849
um, actually recently put out a paper,

405
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,380
I think in law there on like the feedback we've

406
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,890
gotten and essentially we've gotten three different types of feedback.

407
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,329
We've gotten people who say,

408
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,770
hey, you know, it's essentially like the, the large corporations, the, the,

409
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,939
the people you would hope would be on top of their cybersecurity.

410
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,030
And a lot of them are like, hey,

411
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:05,939
you know, we've got

412
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,459
this, we have our own internal types of measurement, you know,

413
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,010
don't worry about us and then we go, ok, that's great.

414
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,400
Can you show us what you're doing?

415
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,680
And they go, no, we can't.

416
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,650
Um because that's private and internal and would

417
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,140
tell people all our cyber security flaws.

418
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,709
Um And, you know, we're, we're pro business.

419
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,829
So we get that, that,

420
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,750
that gives you a leg up on your competition

421
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,380
and that you don't wanna advertise your security flaws.

422
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,180
But at the same time, we're like, so you just want us to trust you.

423
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,500
Ok.

424
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,550
Um And then the second response is really people who are like, yeah,

425
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,579
this is never going to be solved ever.

426
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,540
You're hopeless. But thanks for asking, I guess.

427
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,819
And then we have people who are more or less like, yeah,

428
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,380
we don't know the answer either.

429
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,640
But when you find out the answer, let us know.

430
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,329
Right.

431
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,099
So no answers

432
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,410
-- yet.
-- I think Josh and I also would be in that camp.

433
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,369
I flip between the nihilistic camp and the let's keep looking camp.

434
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,670
So it just depends what day of the week it is fair

435
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:02,530
enough.

436
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:05,880
Yeah. Ok. So that's, that's really interesting.

437
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,780
Actually, I'm, I guess when you say that that is exactly what I would expect

438
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,969
because

439
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,050
I,

440
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,569
I know I've dealt with enough organizations to understand that half of them

441
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,459
do legitimately have very interesting security efforts going on.

442
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:23,680
They don't want to talk about and I think the other half

443
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,810
are just lying and they don't have a freaking clue.

444
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,400
So, well, maybe it's less than half now

445
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,619
-- and
-- we just don't know which ones are which.

446
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,160
So it's being able to distinguish between who's lying and who, who's being honest.

447
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,119
I fully believe

448
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,630
that there are lots of companies who are doing great jobs and I

449
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,069
believe that there are companies who have no idea what they're doing and,

450
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,229
but it's hard, you know, if you're a consumer, if you don't know which one's which?

451
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,569
-- Right. Right.
-- Exactly.

452
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,619
I literally just had the experience of looking at a,

453
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,589
a cloud service providers web page and they, they

454
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,469
proudly use this piece of software that I click on the link to it.

455
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,479
And the,

456
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:58,329
uh github page literally says this software hasn't been maintained in two years,

457
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,479
do not use it, go use this other newer thing.

458
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,979
And so I asked the company about this on Twitter and they're like,

459
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:05,880
please contact us privately at our about page and I, I go check the,

460
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,000
the web page and they,

461
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,119
they disappeared that information off the web page and they're like,

462
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,439
please take this private and talk to us.

463
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,599
And I'm like, oh, good. I,

464
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,199
ok.

465
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,640
Yeah. Fantastic.

466
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,062
And, and, you know, it could just be the, the web page was out of date.

467
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:18,942
Maybe they've updated.

468
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:21,182
I, I don't know, but I, you know, at this point I'm like this,

469
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:23,383
this smells kind of weird and doesn't look quite right.

470
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:25,442
Companies have an incentive to protect their reputation.

471
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:29,402
They don't have an incentive to always tell consumers everything they need to know.

472
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:29,503
So,

473
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:32,782
-- so
-- it's interesting you say that actually because

474
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,363
you come from the policy world and companies

475
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,512
don't always have an incentive to tell people what they need to know.

476
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:41,995
But they, there are certain regulated industries that like for example,

477
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:47,975
you can't say your product is gluten free when its first ingredient is wheat,

478
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:48,595
right?

479
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:51,215
Like there are certain industries

480
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:55,076
that have certain rules. And so I'm curious, kind of from the policy perspective,

481
00:20:55,326 --> 00:21:00,725
what are your thoughts on cybersecurity and potentially some sort of regulation

482
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,520
enforced on us from the government? So

483
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,640
-- I'm a little bit anti regulatory in general, um just throwing that out
-- there and,

484
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,839
and that's fine, that's fine.

485
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,589
Not because I don't think that there, there are,

486
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,640
I think there are good things that can come out of regulation.

487
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,349
My wariness,

488
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,310
it goes back once again to the fact that

489
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,959
this is such a quickly changing landscape and that

490
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:25,150
I worry that something set in place through a regulatory body

491
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,069
doesn't have the nimbleness to be updated appropriately.

492
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,930
I worry that it'll be, you know,

493
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,349
it,

494
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,920
it's gonna get put in place and it's gonna be great at

495
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,180
the moment and then one or two years down the road,

496
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:40,270
it's no longer gonna be applicable and that companies will be there,

497
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,250
you know, evolved around it

498
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,310
or they will be constrained in a way

499
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,939
that actually hinders business and could hinder security.

500
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:50,800
-- In fact.
-- Well, I mean, we've already seen that with the cookie warnings for GDPR

501
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,050
that totally works.

502
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:53,810
Informed consent.

503
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,359
Right. Right. And actually I,

504
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:59,189
I know we've spoken with a number of guests in the past

505
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:03,250
specifically on this topic and, and that, that seems to be the,

506
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,689
the overall consensus I would say for the most part, at least in,

507
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:09,410
in the people we kind of kind of hang out with, I'd say.

508
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,209
And I mean, so, so that's one of the dangers here. Right.

509
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,319
And I guess that's the question, right.

510
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:14,930
Can we,

511
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,130
do you think we will ever see a point where

512
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,709
regulation could keep up with security or security slows down?

513
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:25,209
-- So, regulation and security you are in lockstep? I
-- don't think we're there yet.

514
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,489
I don't want to say we could never get there because II, I don't know how, well, um,

515
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,010
politically, I, I find that hard to imagine just with the way, um,

516
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,459
governing bodies tend to be set up and the amount of bureaucracy that,

517
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:41,050
that's almost always involved, you know, we might be able to get,

518
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,290
get there somehow through technology someday very far in the future.

519
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,160
Maybe A I will save us all.

520
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,650
But I don't, I don't think we're there yet.

521
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,930
I, I'm confident they're going to take over someday

522
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,680
and, and

523
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,010
be our benevolent rulers, all the movies I think, say that works out fine

524
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,609
so

525
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,969
well, then, then they can be in charge of the regulation.

526
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,910
Let's see how that

527
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,199
-- works,
-- right?

528
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,859
And the other thing I keep running into is so even like,

529
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:10,020
even I literally know people who are like one person companies

530
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,609
and they're international,

531
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,050
like everybody and everything is international a lot. Like if you sell T shirts

532
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,329
and you have a website,

533
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:20,109
chances are you're gonna mail at least one outside the country, you know,

534
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,560
a yearly or whatever.

535
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,859
And so the thing I have been struggling with

536
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,660
because I've been looking at a lot of privacy,

537
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,260
sort of law and compliance.

538
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,599
Great. So there's like 100 and 80 countries with

539
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,910
many have multiple jurisdictions. I think

540
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,719
America has something like several 100 different jurisdictions with different,

541
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,469
you know, slightly varied laws. Like, uh what is it?

542
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:44,130
Ohio has different, you know, biometric laws than California and

543
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,250
San Francisco banned facial recognition. And I'm just like,

544
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:51,810
I didn't know you could do law at the city level in the US. That, that was a Canadian

545
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,770
horrifies me. Because that's,

546
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,349
that makes it so complicated.

547
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,170
Yeah, it's really complicated if,

548
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,930
if you're a business owner and you're working on that scale.

549
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,739
Good luck.

550
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,319
Ok.

551
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,140
Right.

552
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah, I guess that answers my question because, yeah,

553
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,420
I've just been looking at this and I'm like, how,

554
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,689
how do I even become aware of all this?

555
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,900
You know, I, I, it never, it never occurred to me literally to look for, like,

556
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,339
city laws with respect to tech,

557
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:17,859
you know,

558
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:20,189
like I get parking enforcement and having laws about

559
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,079
who can sleep in the park overnight or can't,

560
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,880
you know, but like online privacy at the city level.

561
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,339
Yeah, I think this is an issue that I mean, at the city level, I think,

562
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,839
I think eventually we will see a push in the US

563
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,140
um for more standardization

564
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,380
um across cities and states actually to make things

565
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,719
like that so much to make that easier essentially.

566
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,780
But I do think the issue of like having to

567
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,839
with different rules and legislations uh like across the

568
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,770
globe is only going to get harder and harder.

569
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,020
Um as,

570
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,930
as countries become more concerned about issues like

571
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:55,329
privacy and implement like data localization laws.

572
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,369
I think that that's going to become very difficult for certain companies

573
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:04,069
that then begs the question with the hundreds of frameworks we have available

574
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,069
and there's probably going to be hundreds of privacy laws in the near future.

575
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:13,959
Like what the heck? Right. How does anyone even possibly keep track of this stuff.

576
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:14,439
Yeah.

577
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,430
I mean,

578
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:18,520
even I can't keep track of everything that's going on.

579
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,680
Find something that you, like, like mist and, and try to keep an eye on, like,

580
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,680
when things are that when they're getting updated for sure.

581
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:30,199
But it's, it's difficult. We actually should probably, we could do a little,

582
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,719
probably fewer frameworks and maybe just better ones. Right.

583
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:39,030
No, I, I, I agree with that 100%. It, it always reminds me of there's, although

584
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,260
there's that XK CD Comic where it

585
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,520
says something like, what is it?

586
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,500
There are 13 standards and someone says, oh,

587
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,810
I will make one standard to unify everything and

588
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,140
then it says later there are 14 standards,

589
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,619
right?

590
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,650
I've been on the receiving and now over I

591
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,770
think half a dozen vendor questionnaires this year alone,

592
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,260
you know, and

593
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,170
one of them was 30 tabs

594
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:00,439
in Excel and these

595
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,420
are not small tabs like, and this is a, you know, this is a very large entity with like,

596
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,339
actually really good cybersecurity.

597
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,430
But man, like,

598
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:10,520
yeah,

599
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,500
if it makes you feel any better, they probably didn't read any of your answers.

600
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:19,380
Huh?

601
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,900
-- I don't know if that made him feel
-- better.

602
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,550
-- It wasn't supposed
-- to, I suspect because I, yeah, just, yeah,

603
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,099
it's,

604
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,650
I don't know at this point what to do anymore.

605
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,369
You know, it's, it's like your paper points out.

606
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,050
It's, it's a very large complex problem

607
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,109
to some extent. Like you should have a marketplace for ideas.

608
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,910
So to some extent, you know, these frameworks,

609
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:43,089
they can all compete with each other and may the best one win.

610
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,810
The difficulty is when you can't even figure out

611
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:46,839
how who's competing in the marketplace at all.

612
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:49,390
Right? And I guess that's partially what you're doing, right?

613
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,910
Is you're going to help us figure out which one of these frameworks are worth

614
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,170
using and which ones maybe aren't.

615
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:56,359
Yeah,

616
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,000
I would say like the goal of this bibliography initially is essentially to say, OK,

617
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,239
who is in this marketplace for ideas at all, like who's playing, who's competing

618
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,569
and it's not even, it's not even an exhaustive list of the competitors, but it's a

619
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,520
if it'll let you know who some of the bigger players are.

620
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:15,650
Sure. And, and that's fantastic because I'm not gonna lie to you.

621
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,589
I, I thought I knew about most of these frameworks and there were a lot on your list.

622
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,189
I had no idea even existed.

623
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:26,349
It was sobering to say the least because I think no matter how much you think,

624
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:26,949
you know,

625
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,619
that, you know, it's what is it, the more you learn, the less, you know? Right.

626
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,400
That's exactly what this is.

627
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:31,989
Well,

628
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,079
and speaking of which do we have any idea of how many people use these frameworks?

629
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,930
Because I, I like, I know Nist is popular in the US because Nest.

630
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,619
But

631
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,380
yeah, like some of these I was looking at and I'm like, well, I know that name or,

632
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,849
you know, like the swift customer security control framework,

633
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,000
all the swift customers have to use that.

634
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,010
I would assume actually.

635
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,260
Yeah, let's make that clear. I assume that's the case.

636
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:58,180
I don't know. So that means basically, like all the banks are on there but

637
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,959
looking at some of these, you know.

638
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,739
Uh,

639
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,660
yeah, I have no idea.

640
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,699
Yeah, I don't have numbers for any of these but we did,

641
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:10,219
I did try to like only pick ones that seem to be used like fairly widespread.

642
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,900
Sure. Because of course, you know, anyone, anyone can

643
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,209
make their own framework or standards. So

644
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,020
that's true. We should, we should do that. Kurt, we can get it on this.

645
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,609
All right.

646
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,729
So we're nearing the end and I have one more question for you,

647
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,930
Catherine and I think it is the most important question of all.

648
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:32,530
And that is you work for the R Street Institute.

649
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,770
It's on New York Avenue.

650
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,400
What's the deal with that?

651
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,650
I get that

652
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,130
answer. Why aren't we on our street? I get that a lot.

653
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,199
It's the number one question people ask me, which is, are you on our street?

654
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,239
And then I have to explain it.

655
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:46,290
No, we're not.

656
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,239
I think, I think our original office was closer to our street than we are now.

657
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,020
Um, because there isn't, there is an actual our street.

658
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,400
Um, but it, it actually the name comes from, um,

659
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,650
the idea that, that our street in DC is kind of

660
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,829
um it's where residential neighborhoods kind of meet

661
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,589
uh the downtown, the the policy um sector.

662
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,969
And so it's this intersection, it's like the symbolic intersection, especially

663
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,410
like policy and people's everyday.

664
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,599
It is clever, except for the fact that we have to constantly explain, we're not

665
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,030
located on our street.

666
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,760
And I guess for those of you listening who

667
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,390
aren't necessarily familiar with the layout of Washington DC,

668
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,310
there are, it's often denoted by, by the street

669
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:31,660
and, and it's letter streets, right?

670
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,349
And, and kind of like K streets when you'll hear a lot about, for example,

671
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,739
because all the lobbyists are in K street and our street

672
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,900
is, it, it's a bit farther away from the Capitol we'll say.

673
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,560
But obviously, because they go in sequential order as one would hope.

674
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,699
Right.

675
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,040
Wonderful.

676
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,199
All right, Katherine. So, so we're going to wrap up.

677
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:52,979
Why don't I'll give you the last word here before we end it. So the floor is yours?

678
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,430
Well, find something that works for you because some,

679
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:59,369
some cybersecurity is better than no cybersecurity.

680
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,660
I, I agree. I think that's really good advice actually.

681
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,810
And now if people want to get a hold of you,

682
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:09,520
I can put some contact info in the show notes and if people want to get involved,

683
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,170
I guess the best thing would be to do what

684
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:15,520
uh contact me and I can, I can get that figured out.

685
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,880
Um Yeah, feel free to let me know if you have a method

686
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,515
that needs to be in

687
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:21,724
