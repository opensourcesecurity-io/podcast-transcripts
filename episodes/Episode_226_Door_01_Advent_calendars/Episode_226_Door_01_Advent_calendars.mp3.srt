Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,520
Kurt Siegfried and my partner Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:11,340
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,540
-- And
-- it is our advent calendar holiday extravaganza.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,239
Story number one,

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,069
you don't just get one Christmas specialist here. You get a whole,

6
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,034
a whole pile of them.

7
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:25,504
You're going to get 2424 days of the

8
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:28,915
open source security podcast in bite size increments.

9
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:31,825
-- And
-- the bad news is it's not chocolate or beer behind the door.

10
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:34,154
That's right. It's just pain and suffering

11
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:35,404
and,

12
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:38,474
you know, Kurt talked me into this and I am,

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:41,599
I'm quite certain I will regret this decision.

14
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:44,439
Honestly, if I, if I was the one doing the sound editing,

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,310
I probably would not have suggested it.

16
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,950
-- So
-- I actually did some, some I crunched some numbers and

17
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,729
24 5 minute episodes

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,919
is two hours of content,

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,159
which is exactly how much content

20
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,575
-- we would basically produce in four weeks.
-- Well, yeah, four weeks, right.

21
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:03,514
But a month is more than four weeks, almost.

22
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:04,824
Trust me.

23
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:07,764
We, we might take some time off after this one. So

24
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:11,364
we'll see, we'll see anyway, 24 episodes.

25
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:15,614
-- Also, we're not stopping if the bus school. Less than 50. We all die.
-- Ok.

26
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:16,495
I guess.

27
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:16,915
Anyway,

28
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:18,444
Reeves.

29
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,205
No, I get it. It was,

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,190
I,

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,410
I just don't understand how we speed up or slow down the bus.

32
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:27,389
-- But,
-- well, I'm saying the bus has to keep moving or we all die.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,709
That was the point of the film, right?

34
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,930
-- Like, that's why they had to run over the stroller full of tin cans.
-- Anyway.

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,809
Episode number one.

36
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,050
Well, no, no, no, no, not episode door number one. Ok.

37
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,769
Door number one, door, number one, that's better. Door. Number one.

38
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:44,550
-- So
-- I was looking into portable X ray machines mostly because

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,870
you know those legs, Lego mini figs,

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,250
I'm familiar with them.

41
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,169
-- So
-- I just, I wanted to be able to buy,

42
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,470
here's the thing though,

43
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,559
if I say I'm familiar with them, you can't just start talking

44
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,940
-- someone listening. I was
-- about

45
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,449
to say so it's basically,

46
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,250
it's a, it's a plastic bag

47
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,279
with a Lego mini fig inside,

48
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,569
right? With some special, like it's like a special Lego mini fig like

49
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,760
-- a
-- plastic bag you cannot see

50
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,529
through, correct? But you can feel through it.

51
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,199
But they also put a piece of paper in their image,

52
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,229
make difficult but a lot of the Lego mini figs like the Ursula or whatever they

53
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,130
have like really weirdly specific pieces that you can often kind of get a feel for

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,919
anyways

55
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,169
and they come in a box, I forget how many Lego it's like 40 or 50 packages to a box.

56
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:25,089
It's not like a completely even distribution, right?

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,770
Some are more common than others.

58
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:30,210
And also, of course, some of these mini figs, some are more popular than others.

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,050
Right? Like llama guy or a corn dog guy or hot, oh, hot dog guy. Hot dog guy was very big.

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,529
And so basically I looked into buying a portable X ray machine

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,460
so I could basically buy a box of these because normally

62
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,070
the way it works is you buy a box of these,

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,169
you rip them all open and then you sell them on

64
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:48,190
ebay for between like a dollar and like $10 each.

65
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,149
Right? And I was assuming I had the idea that like

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,339
if I could guarantee what's in the bag,

67
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,250
it's probably worth more because it's unopened.

68
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,860
-- I mean, maybe
-- why would I believe you,

69
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:59,179
you know,

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,750
because my seller rating on ebay is like five out of five or whatever

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,000
or basically I post a picture of the X ray next to the image

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,860
-- and
-- that could be kind of neat.

73
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,350
Yeah. Well,

74
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,955
but basically, and then I realized also because uh Playmobil does this too, right?

75
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:15,535
Playmobil sells individual playmobil people with, you know, accessories, a core

76
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:18,035
again in a non see through plastic bag,

77
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:21,434
which annoys me because you have to like before COVID it was fine,

78
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:24,565
you could sit there and squish the bags, put one down, squish the bag, put it down,

79
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,214
squish the bag.

80
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,095
Oh, that's the one I want, you know, put it to the side and

81
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,029
like, literally, I remember once going to chapters a local bookstore,

82
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,050
I started doing that and the lady's like, oh, don't bother.

83
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,910
I'm like, what? And she's like, oh, somebody already did that.

84
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,190
Somebody had already, you know,

85
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,229
fondled all the bags and gone through them and gotten the good ones.

86
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,509
What's the point of the story?

87
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,190
So the point of the story is you can actually buy a portable X ray machine,

88
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,470
you can get a prescription for it.

89
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,750
Why do you need a prescription for an X ray machine?

90
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,179
-- That's the part
-- I haven't figured out yet.

91
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,149
So if any of our listeners know, please tell us what on earth, like what possible

92
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:54,755
medical condition would you have

93
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:59,514
that requires a prescription of a portable, like a small, like an X ray machine?

94
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:02,554
And what does this have to do with advent or security?

95
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,804
-- Because you want to see what's behind the door? Number one?
-- Oh, I see.

96
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,395
So we're using an X ray machine to look behind door number one.

97
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:10,875
-- Well, to scan the whole thing, even
-- though we've, we just flung it open

98
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:11,595
and,

99
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:12,244
and now,

100
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:16,483
although no one knows what the rest of our advent calendar looks like.

101
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:17,945
Oh, it's probably horrific and full of

102
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:18,983
Kulu and evil.

103
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:19,829
I

104
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,489
mostly just stupidity and poorly informed decisions.

105
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,959
-- So
-- information security is an industry representative of

106
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,438
an advent calendar or us.

107
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,519
-- Well, the whole stupidity and full of craziness.
-- Maybe.

108
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:34,509
I think there's a lot of good intentions.

109
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:38,278
I think there's a lot, dude, like there's

110
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,100
like World War One was full of good intentions.

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,010
-- I
-- guess.

112
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,450
-- I, I feel like this is,
-- you know, we'll, we'll take that piece of land,

113
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,040
just ignore the germs with machine guns over there.

114
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:52,809
-- All right.
-- Maybe we're going to find out, I guess as we embark on this journey.

115
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,929
So, I guess, welcome to Christmas, everyone. We'll see you on December 2nd.
