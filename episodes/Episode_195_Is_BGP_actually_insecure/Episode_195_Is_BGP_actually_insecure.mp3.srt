Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,329
Josh Pressers and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,930
Curtsy Fried.

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,090
Oh, my goodness. It's not even funny.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,689
It's not meant to be funny.

5
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:16,920
The point is I'm

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,389
Josh Press

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,840
and I

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,059
said,

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,459
yeah, and why shouldn't we believe you is probably the right question. So

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,899
now people are wondering what's happening.

11
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,930
We're gonna talk about B GP today and the insecurity and madness of it all.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,209
And apparently I'm KT now.

13
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:35,130
So

14
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:36,909
let me, let me,

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,919
let me make all the terrible noises you generally make, I'll just smack my mouth and,

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,700
and say like too much.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,720
So, one of the funny things, actually, I mean,

18
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,310
just kind of to change the subject for just a second is that it always amuses me when I

19
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,360
listen to a podcast and then I listen to a

20
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,060
real person and it's like if it's been edited,

21
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,459
right?

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,009
You take out all the little ticks.

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,990
We all have various words we use too much when I edit the show. I take a lot of that out.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I take out weird pauses.

25
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,639
I take out we have certain men will make little

26
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,540
clicky noises with our mouth occasionally and that's all gone.

27
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:12,139
But when you talk to someone in real life, it's all there. And I love it.

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,180
But anyway, anyway,

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:20,099
-- I digress B GP. Tell us about B GP,
-- Josh. So, back in the day you had one computer

30
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,379
and the computer was happy

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,699
and then we had more than one computer and the computers wanted to talk to each other.

32
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,019
So we had routing and we ended up with TCP/IP.

33
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:30,800
Thank God and not like some BS like Net Boy,

34
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,220
right? So TP IP supports routing.

35
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,099
Now, the question is, how do you handle routing when you have

36
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,970
not just millions of computers but millions of networks under the control of,

37
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,540
you know, thousands or tens of thousands of different people.

38
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,900
I think we just have a static text file

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,209
-- that actually worked for a while.
-- It did work. Yeah.

40
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,459
So when

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,860
long story short, we end up with this thing called border gateway protocol.

42
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,779
And the principle basically boils down to

43
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,339
you have autonomous system networks.

44
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,180
So an autonomous system network is, is generally speaking a single entity,

45
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,419
like say my ISP tell us or Verizon or Comcast or the big boys that are, you know,

46
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,639
like level three.

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,800
and also some providers are big enough now, you know,

48
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,320
like Amazon Microsoft right there, you know,

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,940
they have enough IP space that they get to play the routing and transit game.

50
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:24,690
So basically you have an entity like say Amazon and they announce routes for

51
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,729
their various sites either in aggregate or broken up depending on what they want.

52
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,580
-- Right.
-- Right. Well, you should say sites, you should say I

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,130
blocks networks. Networks is better. Yes.

54
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,570
No,

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,990
because you can do any cast and you can

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,369
announce a network block multiple times for multiple sites.

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,830
I mean, that's true.

58
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,800
That's what Cloudflare does. And that's why, you know, cloud flare has 200 sites.

59
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,020
So when you look up

60
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,000
cre.org and you get the cloud flare IP of whatever it is,

61
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,940
you end up going to the closest cloud flare network,

62
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,600
which is great because it's faster.

63
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,399
So the idea basically is you own a network block

64
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,899
and you get to decide how you advertise it.

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,100
You know,

66
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,759
you could advertise it in one location for

67
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,160
one network link only or multiple network links or

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,210
you can do any cast. And anyways, and this was fine like this works absolutely great.

69
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:12,789
Still

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,250
so malicious comes along and goes, hey, I want to, for example,

71
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,080
see all of the traffic coming from, say Google's network.

72
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,289
So they pretend to be Google,

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,270
they announce I am whatever Google's IP network blocks are.

74
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,759
And of course, these networks go OK, like you have

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,020
announce this and I trust you. So

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,470
here's my Google traffic.

77
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,289
And of course, back in the day that that was pretty rare,

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,860
it was more of a fat finger type of situation or you know,

79
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:37,899
somebody did something stupid.

80
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,619
It wasn't really malicious. Typically

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,740
it was very difficult to mount that attack because you

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,740
needed a certain amount of hardware that nobody had.

83
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,684
And you know what this actually reminds me of,

84
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,854
I was just thinking about what you were talking is we

85
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,934
talked about hacking Voyager one a couple of episodes ago.

86
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:57,854
And yeah, it's very similar where if you have an enormous,

87
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:02,695
-- nobody would own a satellite dish that big.
-- Well, ironically if someone did,

88
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,815
the spy satellites would find it.

89
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:05,725
Right.

90
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,380
But obviously in this case, we're approaching a universe where it is practical,

91
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,600
impossible for literally anyone to stand up enough infrastructure to accept,

92
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,380
say Google's traffic and,

93
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,760
-- you know, falsely reroute it to Google even
-- worse than that.

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,329
You don't even have to stand up infrastructure, you can just rent it

95
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,450
well. Right. That's what I mean. Exactly.

96
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,809
There were a variety of proposals to fix this

97
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,750
and basically what we boiled down to is classic,

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,339
you know, PK

99
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,489
I layered on top so that, you know, the routes are signed, you drop out routes,

100
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,450
blah, blah, blah.

101
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,660
Honestly, it's not

102
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,649
easy,

103
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,380
but it's also not impossible.

104
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,100
I would say it's ba it's basically on a pretty much the same level as DNS Sec.

105
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,230
No, no, no,

106
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:53,010
let's not compare it to that because DNS Sec has its own set of ridiculous problems.

107
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,350
But I'm saying from a,

108
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:59,450
from a perspective of complexity and for the effort to stand it up, it's, it's on par.

109
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,619
-- I mean,
-- that's probably fair.

110
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,420
And, and so actually, here's why we're talking about this though.

111
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,059
Cloud flare, they started this kind of marketing push to

112
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,190
point out

113
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,170
large networks that aren't signing B GP.

114
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,220
Well, not just not signing B GP, but also accepting improperly signed routes,

115
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,619
which is even worse.

116
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,609
Ok. Right. Right. Yeah, because that's true. There's, there's two sides to it and

117
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,940
functionally what they're doing is they're

118
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,369
trying to exert public pressure against

119
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,049
pretty much anyone not doing this and they have a little tool you can run.

120
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,170
That'll tell you is your ISP doing the right thing.

121
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,570
-- Are they not doing the right thing?
-- Well, it's even simpler than that.

122
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:40,619
It's a website that has a couple of elements and basically, if you can contact

123
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,260
the one element that means it correct.

124
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,989
And if you can contact the other element that means it's being done wrong.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,899
Like it's, it's hosted off a network that you should not be routing to.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,619
And, and so, I mean, essentially

127
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,880
they're making all this noise about it and ironically, people are pushing back for,

128
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,429
we'll say hilarious reasons.

129
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:58,459
Oh,

130
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:58,600
my

131
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,910
God. Yeah. So

132
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,959
where do you even begin with? This

133
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,970
is ok. Well, let's, let's first do

134
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,320
is this whole B GP RO signing and RPK I and all that stuff totally secure.

135
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:14,140
No, of course not. It's PK I, you can subvert it, you can attack it, you can hijack it,

136
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,140
but it raises the bar significantly.

137
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:20,725
Just like with websites is http S the be all, end all for, you know,

138
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,665
ensuring that you're actually talking to walmart.com and that

139
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,065
your traffic is 100% safe between you and Walmart.

140
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,385
No, of course not.

141
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:30,165
But it's good enough. And honestly,

142
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,035
it's the whole B GP security thing.

143
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,855
If you're running a network big enough that it

144
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:40,704
sends out and consumes B GP routing information and you are

145
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,424
not competent to do this or set this up reasonably,

146
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,929
then you're really not that competent to run that network.

147
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,850
I would agree with that 100%.

148
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:49,410
Right.

149
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,119
I'm sorry. It's just that simple. Like,

150
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,980
like if you can't get a website up and running without HTTP S

151
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,690
in this day and age with like LS encrypt and free SSL hosting

152
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,679
like 20 years ago when it cost 20 grand for a secure web server. I get it.

153
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,529
It was not easy. But now it's, you know,

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,899
IOT devices have a secure web server built into them. So,

155
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,899
right. First argument that, oh, it's not completely secure.

156
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:15,980
Well, no, it's not completely secure, but it will keep out

157
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,700
99% of Attackers.

158
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,929
I've been harping about this for years and I will probably harp about it until I die.

159
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:27,820
Is saying something isn't completely secure is the same as saying we're not going to

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,290
do anything because nothing is completely secure and you have

161
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:34,859
to make various steps along the way to improving security

162
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,640
and just saying all or nothing,

163
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,880
you just pick nothing. There is no such thing as picking all.

164
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,820
So anyone who uses that argument

165
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,420
either knows what they're doing and they know

166
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,820
that nothing is the outcome or they're just,

167
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,760
like, functionally, not aware enough to be making any decision at all.

168
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,529
Well, and it's worse than that in that

169
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,299
you have to make these baby steps that are often wrong

170
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,940
in order to figure out what's right.

171
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,869
Well, unless you're DNS se and then they're just all wrong. But that's,

172
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,510
but, um, anyway, so, is it 100% secure? No, but it's like 99% secure.

173
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,890
Which is good enough.

174
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,019
Second argument. Oh, it's too hard and complex. Yeah. Sorry. No, I don't buy that

175
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,089
-- the fact that
-- B GP is hard and complain. Yeah.

176
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,790
Like the Wikimedia Foundation has done this.

177
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,429
-- I bet
-- they're more competent than most networks.

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,309
True. But, I mean,

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,450
when you see the ones that are not doing it at all, some of them, ok.

180
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,459
Apparently a Hurricane Electric is on there.

181
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,950
But apparently they are doing some of this but they're not,

182
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,989
they basically just haven't turned on certain aspects of it completely yet.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,630
-- And
-- look in the case of someone like Hurricane Electric, they, they're a very

184
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:38,914
large backbone provider.

185
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:41,513
Most of people have never heard of them because why would you?

186
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:44,174
-- Well,
-- and they're traditionally known for being very competent, right.

187
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,223
They were the ones running the Six Bone tunnels and doing a lot of, you know,

188
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,554
experimental I PV six stuff to push it ahead.

189
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,203
Thank goodness.

190
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:53,403
My, my suspicion is if they haven't turned something like this on,

191
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:54,713
it's not because they don't want to,

192
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:57,124
it's because they're very careful and methodical of

193
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,184
what they do and obviously just flipping the

194
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:03,234
switch one day is the best way to make sure your whole network goes down.

195
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:07,340
Well, and this is a, it's a case of this is one of those security things of when it does,

196
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,609
when somebody does do BG P routing attacks,

197
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:10,109
it

198
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,169
usually gets noticed reasonably quickly and then gets shut down, right?

199
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:18,200
But there have been documented cases of B GP attacks where, you know,

200
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,409
some bad things did happen because,

201
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,479
you know, a few minutes of traffic is, is enough in some cases to launch your attack.

202
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,820
I'll dig up the story,

203
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,500
but somebody essentially rerouted a bunch of traffic from a crypt

204
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,484
exchange

205
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:35,085
in order to steal Bitcoin. And like the attack, technically speaking,

206
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:38,255
is very sophisticated and extremely impressive.

207
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:41,734
And in fact, prior to that story, I was like EB GP,

208
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,405
we maybe we'll fix it someday, whatever. It's not that big of a deal.

209
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:48,604
But after that, I'm like, holy crap. We need to fix B GP right now.

210
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:52,195
And the, the thing that really frustrates me is that well,

211
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,664
they fixed B GPA couple of years ago.

212
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:56,965
-- Just people need to turn this on. Well, ok.
-- No, no you can't,

213
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,770
that's a complicated answer because you can't say it was fixed a couple

214
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,260
of years ago because any time you

215
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,450
propose changes to like fundamental infrastructure,

216
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,250
-- it takes years, sometimes decades to deploy this stuff.
-- True.

217
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,169
But at this point all working from home now, so there's no longer the case of,

218
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:14,609
you know,

219
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,840
the internet has gone from,

220
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,609
-- nice to have to absolutely critical for the world
-- to

221
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,650
fight whatever it's been critical for a long time.

222
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,460
Now. We just know.

223
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,559
My favorite thing is the argument.

224
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,109
Oh, now is not a good time to start messing with our networks.

225
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,640
You know, there's this pandemic on and I'm sorry,

226
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,039
but there's never a good time for stuff like this.

227
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,400
Right. Right.

228
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,840
Like I need to get my yard fixed and so it's basically a case of, ok,

229
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,979
as soon as it dries out out there, I'm having a guy come by to dethatch

230
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,950
it and, like, do as much as he can

231
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,880
and then I'm going to, like, seed it and you know what I mean? There's

232
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,960
the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago or, you know, now.

233
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,280
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. I, yes, I will agree with that 100% in the context of this conversation.

234
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:58,520
I just, I still can't get over some of these people, like the,

235
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,890
this major ISP came out against it and it's just, you know, let me put it this way.

236
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,580
Would you buy email service from somebody who doesn't

237
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,679
do spam filtering and refuses to provide spam filtering.

238
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,869
-- Does
-- that
-- even exist anymore?

239
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,643
It doesn't because it would make email completely unusable.

240
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,672
-- It would be completely unusable.
-- And,

241
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:19,603
and see, that's the thing,

242
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,913
it's not like you can take additional corrective action to protect yourself.

243
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,172
Right?

244
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,473
And that's the other thing is this is a situation where

245
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,992
you have to rely on your network provider to do this.

246
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,002
You cannot do this.

247
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,752
This isn't like email spam filtering where you

248
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,953
could do it yourself on your own machine

249
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:34,822
or you could firewall on your own machine or run a V on your own machine.

250
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:40,023
-- But
-- Kurt, it's not a valid comparison because I, I don't know anything about B GP. My,

251
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:40,255
my,

252
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:45,495
my network providers B GP route could all be hijacked right now and all of this

253
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,435
whole conversation could be routed to some foreign

254
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,075
country while they're laughing at us for being

255
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:50,375
idiots.

256
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,306
I would have no idea.

257
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:58,705
And it honestly, for like 99.999% of people, it wouldn't affect me in any way.

258
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,346
Spam affects me.

259
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:04,466
Well, until they use attack crypto exchange or until they, you know,

260
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:07,935
um what was that case where I think China did a major

261
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,809
a hijack a few months ago.

262
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,299
Yeah. But how did it actually negatively affect people? Right? Like

263
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,760
-- how many crypto exchange users were there actually
-- all

264
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,909
-- of
-- European like or

265
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,460
a major chunk of European mobile traffic was sent through China last summer.

266
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,289
-- And
-- how did that affect people? Realistically speaking?

267
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,260
I bet very few people were affected.

268
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,239
Well, I mean, ok, so how does it affect people if I get a complete database of,

269
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,330
you know, everybody's P I?

270
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,799
Well, it doesn't affect them right now but it allows me to do bad things later.

271
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:38,656
I mean, yes,

272
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:42,306
but that's part of the problem is human beings

273
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:45,395
are terrible at saying this will matter later.

274
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:48,885
We're like, no, it affects me right now or it doesn't exist.

275
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,786
There's nothing else in between. I mean, look at literally

276
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:55,875
every crisis that has ever happened in the history of humanity.

277
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:59,335
How many, I mean, every one of them is, it's kind of like, you know,

278
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,556
you know what's funny is there have been a lot

279
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,325
of tweets lately that talk about every disaster movie starts,

280
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,771
the scientists being ignored.

281
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,752
And now I understand and like that is every crisis ever in the

282
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:13,271
history of humanity started with someone being ignored every one of them.

283
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,651
And, and I think that, I mean,

284
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,671
this is one of the challenges with B GP is it's not in your face.

285
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:20,771
And that's what cloud FFL is doing with this site actually is they're making it in

286
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,932
your face and I think people are getting

287
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,151
angry because now they're getting questions asked.

288
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,731
You know what it reminds me of is, it reminds me of CVS and that

289
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,479
vendor has a security flaw,

290
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:34,309
cool vendor has a security flaw and somebody assigns a CV to it and, oh, crap.

291
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,659
Now it's public and the clock starts ticking at a lot of companies

292
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,640
and they get,

293
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,330
like,

294
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:42,580
so many organizations I dealt with, like, literally if it has a CV, then, ok,

295
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,359
we need remediation in 30 days or whatever

296
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,140
and,

297
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,750
-- but no CV, whatever, it doesn't matter, it doesn't exist.
-- Right. Right.

298
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,950
And I understand that completely because once it's visible and let's face it,

299
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,419
getting a security flaw, a CVE makes it visible now that I

300
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,130
Ocean can focus on it.

301
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,530
And without that,

302
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,750
it's just a fuzzy thing off in the distance.

303
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,960
And, and I think this B GP thing is the same cloud flare is, you know,

304
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,200
they're standing up yelling, hey, everyone, look over here, look at me,

305
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,929
look at me and the guys we're not looking at that aren't doing anything.

306
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,289
They're like, wait, this isn't fair. You're, you're playing dirty.

307
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:17,929
It's like, you know what? They're not playing dirty. They figured it out.

308
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,489
Well, and it especially annoys me because these are not small mom and pop shops that

309
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,739
don't have a few bucks to put on this.

310
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:25,840
Like

311
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,549
that's not what they want you to believe.

312
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,080
You know, I mean, these are,

313
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,539
these are I SPS that are literally entire countries or while spanning many,

314
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,450
many countries.

315
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:35,500
And

316
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:40,710
so one of the other funny things about this is the gear that routes, network,

317
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,869
traffic costs millions of dollars for the box.

318
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,109
Right. We're not talking about the $200 router you bought at Best Buy last weekend.

319
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,359
No, no, these are enormous machines.

320
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,109
Well, and we're, we're talking about rack mounted

321
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,330
equipment that it's not. How many units of rack does it occupy?

322
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,450
It's how many racks does it occupy?

323
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,489
Right.

324
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,520
-- Exactly. Exactly.
-- Yeah.

325
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,900
You know, things where, yeah, the amount of,

326
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,440
like ra M is measured in the hundreds of gigabytes.

327
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,119
Yes,

328
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,359
this is one of the challenges I think is why we're seeing some of this pushback is

329
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,440
I have no doubt that some of this gear is probably too old to sign B GP,

330
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,549
which means some of these organizations are now going to have to pony up

331
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,549
-- new gear.
-- I'd say it's worse than that.

332
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,859
It's a lot of the gear will support it, but they'd have to, you know,

333
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,109
actually pay for their maintenance contracts or upgrade the software.

334
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:30,770
Which is,

335
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,150
that could be too.

336
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,270
You think people that run databases hate upgrading software,

337
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,630
go talk to your core network engineers.

338
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,900
Oh, man, I, I, no, I remember this so many years ago. I worked at a very small

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,390
ISP and this, I mean, this is back in dial up days,

340
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,270
we had a one line that serviced the whole ISP, which now is hilariously small.

341
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,340
-- That's 1.544 megabits per second. Yeah.
-- Right. Right. And

342
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,380
now it's ridiculous to think about,

343
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,969
but back then it sort like I think we had probably thousands

344
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:02,530
of users all on like 14 to 4 dial up modems.

345
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:03,219
So it was fine.

346
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:04,119
And,

347
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,590
yeah.

348
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,919
Yeah, I, I remember our network gear once that was working,

349
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:10,869
nobody touched it because if you touched it,

350
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,859
it broke guaranteed and there was nothing worse than breaking the internet.

351
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,919
I personally really like this because there's been

352
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,500
a number of network testing sites to see.

353
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,250
For example, you know,

354
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,150
does your ISP support DNS E queries or is

355
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,070
your ISP monkeying with your traffic in some way,

356
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,179
you know, for example, doing ad injection or?

357
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,280
Right. Right.

358
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,909
Oh, my all time favorite is, you know, oh,

359
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,159
you made a DNS query to something that doesn't exist.

360
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,543
Let me show you this helpful page.

361
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:37,043
You know, I ran into this problem where my, my code just

362
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:41,252
wouldn't air out on bad DNS. And I'm like, what like did

363
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:42,112
I mean

364
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:43,413
that how

365
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,312
like I literally couldn't understand what I was doing wrong until I,

366
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:51,083
I finally figured out like at some point that ISP had started serving

367
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:54,982
all the DNS no matter what right. NX domain is no longer an option.

368
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,322
Well, not with them.

369
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:56,763
I mean, this is,

370
00:16:56,773 --> 00:17:01,562
I think why the popularity of things like 1.1 0.1 0.1 which Claude Flair also does

371
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:02,893
is such a big deal.

372
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,105
Well, even Google, like as much as I know,

373
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:07,826
Google is trying to like learn everything about me.

374
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,375
I trust my ISP less than I trust Google, which that says,

375
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,615
I agree.

376
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:14,974
I agree. 100%.

377
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:18,005
I might trust Facebook more than my ISP.

378
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,786
I mean, that's how bad it is.

379
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:20,556
Oh, I'd have

380
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:28,145
regardless the fact that we can't come up with a quick answer to that question,

381
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,855
I think, says everything like that.

382
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,985
This should not be a contest.

383
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,719
I, I like this because it, it makes it concrete, it makes it understandable and it's,

384
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:39,140
I, I hate to say this but

385
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,280
cloud flare is technically correct, which is, as we all know, the best kind.

386
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:49,199
Absolutely. I hope that they get more providers on that is B GP Safe yet.com list.

387
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,199
You know, it reminds me of the, uh, the two factor authentication site.

388
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,089
There's a really great website, two factor

389
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:54,885
dot org.

390
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,656
And it's got a pretty comprehensive list of

391
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,885
all the things from like banking to finance,

392
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:04,725
to hosting, to legal, to whatever, if they support, uh, two factor

393
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,145
off or not and even some information on it.

394
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,495
You know, what kind of like is it S MS, is it a phone call? Is it email?

395
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,546
Is it a hardware token? Is it a software token?

396
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:16,121
And, you know, you can make a much more informed decision and as to, you know,

397
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,952
which provider do you use, which, you know, for some of these, like,

398
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:18,852
say online betting.

399
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:21,491
Yeah, there's real money there. You will get attacked.

400
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:21,921
Oh,

401
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:23,082
yeah, totally.

402
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,921
So, I, I like this because, so much, well, not so much,

403
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,031
too much security is

404
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,241
just not being done because, well,

405
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:34,021
they can get away with it not being done because it's really hard to expose,

406
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,891
like for a person like you or me

407
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,719
to figure out if an ISP is doing this B GP security

408
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,349
or not like to stand that stuff up to test it is,

409
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,589
I don't want to say impossible.

410
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,869
Basically, like the amount of effort it would take is ridiculous.

411
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,780
It is. Right. Right. And, and additionally, as an end user,

412
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:56,989
I'm never going to see the results of them doing or not doing this.

413
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,630
But if cloud flare points me at it and says, hey, look over here, I can say, oh,

414
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,489
that's neat.

415
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,489
And, and actually, I was almost sad because my ISP has the, the,

416
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,239
the fancy good job for Cloud flare.

417
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:12,260
And I was like, man, I was really hoping to write some letters or something.

418
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,839
You know, I was,

419
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,609
you know what, this reminds me of his I PV six support back in the day.

420
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,420
I literally remember phoning my VPs,

421
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,550
like my hosting provider and it wasn't VPs

422
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,280
rather it was actual physical co location.

423
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:25,619
And like, they were like, basically their response was what's I PV six? And I'm like,

424
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:29,020
and in fairness, they did start supporting it about two years later.

425
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,300
But like my then ISP Shaw again, they were like, we, we have no plans to support this.

426
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,810
-- Why would we,
-- there's plenty of IP addresses and I PV four, we'll never go

427
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,900
-- there
-- again.

428
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,579
You know, it, it,

429
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,459
I PV six is a little bit different

430
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:43,485
and that there was actually something pushing like,

431
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,306
yeah, there is no, I PV four space to buy anymore.

432
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,125
Or rather

433
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:48,306
the fact that

434
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,505
you have to buy it now you can't just go and get a network block from one of the,

435
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:53,135
you know, a PN.

436
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:56,245
Yeah, whatever you've had to buy it for a long time. Yeah.

437
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:59,296
-- But now the price has actually gone up.
-- Well, yes, it's real money now.

438
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:03,745
-- It used to be basically
-- free and B GP, you know, the, the B GP security stuff there,

439
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:04,505
there's no,

440
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:08,345
there's no push, there's no incentive like that other than people, you know,

441
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,776
banging on pots and pans and yell

442
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:10,232
at their

443
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:10,791
isps.

444
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:15,511
I mean, functionally, yes, until, like people start doing mass B GB hijackings and,

445
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,592
you know, make it so bad that we notice it.

446
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:18,972
-- Even
-- if they did that

447
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:19,552
even,

448
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:20,962
I don't think you'd ever notice it because

449
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:22,911
obviously the whole point of hijacking the traffic

450
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,251
is to make sure no one does notice it because as soon as they do,

451
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,222
they shut you down.

452
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:29,881
But then more importantly is it's the typical human problem of

453
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:33,991
the negative implications from this activity will be in the future.

454
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:38,192
-- So I don't care.
-- Well, or it's, you know, it's part of such a targeted attack that

455
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,410
those entities assuming they even notice again, they can't really, you know,

456
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,930
I hate to say this but even,

457
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,609
let's assume tomorrow the US government said, look,

458
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,359
all of our I SPS have to do B GP security.

459
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,849
What? You know, how long would

460
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,160
it? No, that, that isn't even enough to push it,

461
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:54,890
-- you
-- know.

462
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,670
Well, you could,

463
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,459
but it would still be like a two year roll out period because that's what,

464
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:00,770
probably what they need is my guess.

465
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:01,670
I don't know.

466
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:06,050
And, and, but even then, even then, let's say the US said we're going to do this,

467
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,050
the US is just part of a large network. And so,

468
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,963
for example, I guarantee that I do things where

469
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:17,322
the traffic ends up in another country, let's say, or,

470
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,162
or region that maybe wouldn't fall under that jurisdiction.

471
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:22,802
And so that's how you, that's how you do it, you know, true.

472
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:27,703
But it would vastly reduce the incidence of either the, well within the US.

473
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:30,853
Nobody would be a, would be affected by US

474
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,682
prefixes being hijacked,

475
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:34,353
right? Because they'd all be secured

476
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:35,802
-- in,
-- in the US, right?

477
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:38,363
But obviously, even once you left, you could start, you know,

478
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,316
gobbling things from other countries.

479
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:44,115
And so, I mean, yeah, it's got to be a worldwide effort for sure.

480
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,395
I think this is very much an all or none is where we have to be.

481
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,615
I disagree because the thing is there are,

482
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,615
let's say you've got every major transit network and every major cloud provider,

483
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,076
right?

484
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:54,336
That,

485
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:58,515
that is a major chunk of the traffic and that would prevent a lot of the propagation.

486
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,725
Sure. Right.

487
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,286
The brutal truth is with this BG P security stuff is you where you really, really,

488
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:06,235
really need it is those core networks,

489
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,819
the ones that connect to the networks that's fair. Not like my dinky little.

490
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,510
And when I say dinky little, I mean, tell us is, you know, there,

491
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,150
I do a trace route and it like pops out in the US

492
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,770
with,

493
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,069
tell us names like they own a network that spans North America and goes to Europe

494
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,390
and I would consider tell us small because they, you know,

495
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,260
they're not like level three or, you know,

496
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,670
one of those people that own transatlantic cables like Google does

497
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:31,630
that, you know of,

498
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,550
-- I don't know their names offhand.
-- Yeah. Yeah, I'm glad I don't anymore.

499
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,410
I'm just glad that network mostly works.

500
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,310
I, I, I'm happy with networks these days.

501
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,050
I remember running Cisco routers a long time ago and

502
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,189
I won't say I was ever particularly good at it.

503
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,900
I was functional, I'll say, but it was definitely one of those things that

504
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,189
I feel like networking is for a certain kind of person. And I'm not one of them

505
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,640
like Sudoku,

506
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:54,760
maybe, you know,

507
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,469
you know what actually I started playing some time ago was

508
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,250
there's another game called Ken Ken which is similar to Sudoku,

509
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,969
but it involves like math

510
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,589
and

511
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,420
-- that one where? Yeah. Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah,

512
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,709
you got, like, the plus sign.

513
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,540
Like, this line needs to be six and this line needs to be

514
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:08,930
right.

515
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,339
It's so,

516
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,140
it's so difficult to find though because for whatever reason,

517
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,540
it's just not very popular

518
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:20,150
and, like, I do enjoy Sudoku. Don't get me wrong. It's a fantastic game.

519
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,640
But, yeah, Ken Ken is my new favorite and

520
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,280
I can never find it anywhere and I, I prefer paper because,

521
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,229
oh, first of all, I don't want to print off copy.

522
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:32,949
So please don't send me like some, some Ken Ken website. Like I'm too lazy to do that.

523
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,270
I want one of those books I wanted in the newspaper or something.

524
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,150
Oh, yeah. You want the old people book of time waste.

525
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,520
I like those though because I can write all my weird little

526
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,589
notes down about what I think things are going to be.

527
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,550
I know there's soft,

528
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,910
like I was actually watching sadly a guy

529
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,270
do a really tough Sudoku puzzle and they've got

530
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:52,699
dedicated software that allows you to set like the value in the square or to set,

531
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,670
you know, provisional values in a small font.

532
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:57,430
I would assume somebody has that for Ken Ken,

533
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,109
the Sudoku on.

534
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,689
I haven't found it yet but the Sudoku game

535
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:05,520
on Brain Age for the Nintendo DS is phenomenal.

536
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,910
It is by far the best because you get to use a pen, which is hugely important,

537
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,579
in my opinion.

538
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:14,010
You get to use a pen and you can click around and actually draw like you, like,

539
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,209
if I want it to be a one, I draw the number one and it turns it into a one.

540
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:21,130
-- It's
-- marvelous. There's something to be said for that physicality.

541
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,530
Like I,

542
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,660
there are papers I print out and go through with

543
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,329
a red or blue pen to more actively read,

544
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,479
interact with because I just can't do it on the screen.

545
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,420
I don't even like printouts of stuff. I like having,

546
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,880
I don't know what it is.

547
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,439
There's something about, like, for example, let's say I want a book,

548
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,560
like I want a paperback of something and I could

549
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,380
say print it out and I've done that before.

550
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,540
You print like a couple 100 pages or whatever. I still prefer the bound nice book.

551
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,790
There's a, there's a certain feel to the pages,

552
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,979
the ink looks a certain way and there's just, I'm a sucker for that and like,

553
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,989
even newspapers, I read my newspaper online now because it's

554
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:54,849
like

555
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:54,989
a

556
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,150
-- 10th of the price.
-- Can you even get it delivered?

557
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,010
Yeah, I can.

558
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,250
But it's literally 10 times more expensive than what I'm paying online.

559
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,810
And so just from a financial perspective, I didn't want to justify the cost.

560
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,000
But like, I miss sitting down and opening a real newspaper,

561
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,750
-- I think it is one of the true joys
-- I will admit like,

562
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,469
something like the few times I got a copy of, what was it?

563
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,349
The New York Sunday Times. I mean, that is just,

564
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:21,859
-- that's, that's a satisfying way to spend a couple hours on Sunday.
-- It absolutely is.

565
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:23,709
And I love it. I absolutely

566
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,150
love reading the newspaper and I don't anymore.

567
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,920
But again, like playing the weird little puzzles.

568
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,239
I used to love playing Sudoku in the newspaper specifically in the newspaper.

569
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,239
Right. Not,

570
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,890
not online, not print off the sheets or whatever. But I don't know.

571
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,319
I'm a weirdo like that. It is. Everyone's got their thing. Right. That's mine.

572
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:44,239
So, ok. Anyway, we should get back on track.

573
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,390
B GP.

574
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,619
We are obviously in complete agreement that everyone should sign their B

575
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,500
-- GP routes and
-- also ensure the routes consuming are signed and correct.

576
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,140
-- Well, I think that goes hand in hand, right? If, yeah,
-- you say that.

577
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,619
-- But again, we also tell people to floss, I
-- floss every day.

578
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah. And you're like literally the only human being I know

579
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,209
that does that.

580
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:08,140
I especially,

581
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm especially particular about my teeth right now because I really don't

582
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,469
want to have to try to find a dentist right now.

583
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,349
-- Yeah,
-- that is a good point.

584
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,829
Yes, I was thinking about that.

585
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:21,130
-- I thought, what would I even do?
-- I had that cracked tooth earlier or last year rather.

586
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,719
And luckily I got in like four days, they had a cancellation. I got in four days.

587
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:25,489
But like that,

588
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,510
I'll be honest, I've had like my appendix try to kill me as an adult.

589
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,739
I've had my tonsils out as an adult

590
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,449
and I mean, with my cracked tooth,

591
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,060
the amount of Tylenol three they prescribed to me after the surgery.

592
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:42,030
I was like, I'm not sure this is like safe and I ended up only taking three.

593
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,160
-- Yeah, like it, that was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
-- That's wild man.

594
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,380
I have been very lucky with my teeth and I hope to stay that way.

595
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,939
So I'm very particular now about caring for them

596
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,079
because

597
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:59,050
it is one of those instances where as a human, it's easy to be like, oh,

598
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,500
I don't need to worry about this right now.

599
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,920
And then my brain says, yes,

600
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,400
I do because in 40 years you're going to have

601
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,199
the same teeth in your head you have today.

602
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,479
So take care of them.

603
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,410
-- But it's hard man,
-- every day,

604
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,839
all knocked out in dentures.

605
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,699
Well,

606
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,280
there's days I think about that, but like seriously, every,

607
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,650
every day I go in the bathroom and I think, oh, I won't floss today then I think.

608
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,420
No, you have to floss. Like it's,

609
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,800
there's like a battle in me every day, every day and it never gets easier.

610
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,520
I won't lie to you.

611
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:26,780
Well,

612
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,800
my understanding is this is one of the leading

613
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,540
reasons for death in a lot of wild animals is

614
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,290
really,

615
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,790
I mean, that doesn't shock me in any way.

616
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,369
Well, if you're a lion and you got a broken tooth,

617
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,500
it's going to get infected and you're going to die. Yeah.

618
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:43,849
Well, even if it doesn't get infected, if you can't eat right, you die.

619
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:46,010
And you figure if, if you're one of these

620
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:46,689
large,

621
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,689
my

622
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,449
cat,

623
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,770
my previous cat

624
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,540
had at the end,

625
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,619
one good tooth and it was so cute because when she slept the one tooth would stick out,

626
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,099
it was one of her incisors.

627
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,869
It was either the top left or top right and a little bead of drool would form.

628
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,300
That's awesome. And it was so cute.

629
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,880
But the point is if she wasn't a house cat with full medical and dental and soft food,

630
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,609
she'd be dead.

631
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,949
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

632
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,369
Because I imagine if a lion doesn't eat for probably

633
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,079
-- a week
-- most house cats after three or four days,

634
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,229
their kidneys get all messed up.

635
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,609
Oh, really? That could be,

636
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,599
yeah, if your cat doesn't eat for three or four days, like,

637
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,329
I did not know that I know nothing about cats.

638
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:27,150
I've had one cat and it unfortunately had a genetic disorder that

639
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,869
came to an untimely demise. And,

640
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:34,290
yeah, I've, I've, I have dogs, I like dogs. They can eat garbage and they're fine.

641
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,520
I'm a dog person. Right.

642
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,250
Because if he accidentally eats trash, I'm like, he'll be ok.

643
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,369
It's no big deal,

644
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,050
you know,

645
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,780
maybe call the vet and be like, hey, the dog just ate garbage again. Should I wear it?

646
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:50,729
My, my one cousin had a dog that ate a septic puck for a toilet.

647
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,420
That's cool.

648
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,939
And she, like, literally phoned poison control.

649
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,790
And they're like, well, if a human did that,

650
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,219
we would tell them to go to the hospital so they don't die.

651
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,790
And she phoned the vet and the vet's like, e just keep an eye on him.

652
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,959
Yeah.

653
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,609
That's like the most dog thing ever. I love it.

654
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,079
And the thing I remember with this dog is we put a pint or not a pint, sorry,

655
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:14,500
a gallon tub of ice cream outside to freeze it faster because it was, it was in winter.

656
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,339
But anyways

657
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,250
and, yeah, of course, then somebody's like,

658
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,109
why is that dog running around with a cardboard thing?

659
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,069
-- That, that was a lab,
-- wasn't it?

660
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,469
It was part lab.

661
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,089
That

662
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,540
lab. That's,

663
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:25,369
I

664
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:28,250
love labs. They're so awesomely stupid.

665
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:31,410
But they mean, well, they mean, well,

666
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,650
so I was talking to my kids about this actually because we have

667
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,449
some friends with labs that are always up to shenanigans and it's,

668
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:39,770
it's hilarious because they're smart enough to get into trouble,

669
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,640
but dumb enough to still get in it, you know, I love it.

670
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,550
Yeah. Well, just like my, my kids were like, feeling they were using the, the Google

671
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,300
comment function on documents to talk with each other

672
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,930
in class and then their teacher caught them.

673
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:52,369
Oh, that's sneaky.

674
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,650
But what I love is, well, no,

675
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,890
it's not because every time you leave a comment on the school box,

676
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,959
the teacher gets an email.

677
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,839
Ok. Ok. So, no, they figured that out weirdly.

678
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,020
And, but the best part is Felix's one comment was like, hey, guys,

679
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,540
I think the teacher might catch us.

680
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,739
Never admit that. That's admitting guilt.

681
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,640
I guess the moral of the story is if you're clever enough to get into trouble,

682
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,520
don't get into trouble you can't get out of.

683
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,030
And I would say this is the B GP people. Like

684
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,040
if you're going to run the B GP network,

685
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,640
-- run it securely, please. And thank you.
-- I agree.

686
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,689
And secondly, uh, send us your hilarious dog stories about them eating things.

687
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,890
They shouldn't because

688
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,099
we could all use some shearing up today.

689
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,310
All right, the security of dogs. That sounds like a marvelous future topic anyway.

690
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,599
And that's why we domesticated them.

691
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,579
That's a fascinating story too.

692
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,579
But, ok, so thank you, Kurt. Thank you

693
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,640

694
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,290
source Security podcast.com. I'll put in all the show notes you can use ipos

695
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,349

696
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:52,140
and Kurt have a fantastic rest of your day.

697
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,810
-- You too. Thanks everybody. Thanks
-- everyone. Bye bye

698
00:30:59,500 --> 00:30:59,689
going.
