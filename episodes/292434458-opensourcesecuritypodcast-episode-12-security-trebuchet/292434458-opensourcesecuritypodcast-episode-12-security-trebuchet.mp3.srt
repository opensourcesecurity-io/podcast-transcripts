00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:10,069
Welcome to another exciting edition of the open source security podcast, the post

1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,600
election show. Ha Yeah, let's talk about politics.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,760
So this week, Kurt is again out,

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm assured by him that he'll come back next week to grace us with his presence.

4
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,079
He's at a CV E board conference.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,829
So once again, I'm being helped by the honorable Dave Seine.

6
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,049
Say hello, Dave.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,250
Hey, everybody. Thank you so much for helping out. I appreciate it.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,129
It's always a treat,

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,370
not a problem.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,819
So

11
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,299
Kurt is at a CV E board conference next week,

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,819
I think we're gonna talk about CV E actually and what that

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,099
means and some of the things he learned at his show.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,599
So

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,490
I, I'm sure it will be

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,779
an enlightening episode to say the least.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,729
It, it'll be, it'll be riveting.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,799
That's right. As exciting as CV E can be. Right. Right.

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,200
So

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,849
I'm gonna start with, with listener feedback, which I was ecstatic to receive.

21
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,060
There's a fellow who I,

22
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:04,599
I think his name is Co Coh cos musings is the name

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,930
of his blog and there'll be a link in the show notes.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,379
And

25
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,449
basically this guy took what we talked about in the, the primal

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,889
of prime numbers, which I still don't think primal

27
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,089
a word, but whatever that I love the title,

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,680
uh,

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,930
and, and, and kind of tore it apart and, and talks about the,

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,889
the actual real math behind a lot of this prime number stuff and,

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,300
and it's a fascinating read.

32
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:29,449
I'd highly suggest anyone who has any interest in this

33
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,449
to take a look.

34
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:31,970
Right. Yeah.

35
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,389
It, it, it, you know, looking through it and uh you know, II,

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,190
I pulled it up again this morning just to,

37
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,129
just to kind of glance at it real quick again and it's, it's

38
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:43,550
just the side of a master's thesis, right? On, on prime numbers in the math behind it.

39
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,449
And um you know, I, I've, I've,

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,209
as you said, this is, this is great,

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,809
this is a great feedback because we're not experts in everything, right?

42
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:52,209
You know,

43
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,839
I'm an expert in nothing.

44
00:01:55,639 --> 00:02:00,750
Yeah. II, I cringe when anybody introduces me as an expert quite frankly. But uh

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,980
you know, it, it,

46
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,019
it, it helps,

47
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,540
you know, we talked on, on this podcast a lot.

48
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,258
You and Kurt talk on this podcast a lot about um

49
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,389
you know, the, the education and,

50
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,449
you know, we as security professionals, you know, how do we give back?

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,389
How do we, how do we help people with that? Better understanding? This is perfect.

52
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:24,630
This is, this is, I, I believe exactly what we talk about when we talk about

53
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,820
you know, how do we get there? How do we get there as a, as a profession?

54
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,300
I completely agree.

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,009
And, and I guess there's two things that, that come to mind when I look at this is,

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,850
first of all,

57
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,699
I feel like we weren't completely wrong, which I consider a success. Mostly wrong.

58
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,880
I can live with. Completely wrong.

59
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm not ok with.

60
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,740
But then the second thing always, and,

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,759
and this is something I love about the internet is

62
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,020
there is always someone smarter than you.

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,509
There is nothing you're going to do that. There isn't someone smarter than you.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,179
And, and if you're in the lucky, well, I guess here's the thing. Right.

65
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,380
So you can take two views of this.

66
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,940
You can either say

67
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,130
I don't like this guy because he's smarter than me.

68
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,509
And, and he wasn't very nice or you can

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,320
elate in the fact that there is always someone who can teach you something

70
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,570
no matter the topic on the internet, which is awesome.

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,550
Right.

72
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:20,559
And, and, you know, iii, I will elate in the fact that, that he took time out of his,

73
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,940
I can imagine very busy schedule to

74
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:24,539
educate,

75
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,679
educate us. Right. I, I mean, it,

76
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,220
and, and, and did it in, in a way where it's like

77
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,460
informative, not

78
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
demeaning

79
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,149
because

80
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,610
seriously anyone who has this level of knowledge clearly just watches TV, all day.

81
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,000
Right.

82
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,839
Exactly. Right.

83
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:45,389
Right. Yeah. You know, he's on hour 30 of his Netflix Binge right now.

84
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,880
But, but it's, and, and it, it,

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,960
it heartens me. Right. It, it, to, to see this kind of effort to, to educate.

86
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah. Oh, totally. It, it's fantastic.

87
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,660
So, so I guess co if, if that is your name, if it's not by all means, uh,

88
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,179
shame me on Twitter.

89
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,320
But thank you so much for the write up. It is, it is absolutely fantastic.

90
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,539
And, and I love it. It,

91
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:12,210
anyone else who wants to do a technical write up of why we're wrong, please do.

92
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,559
And we would be happy

93
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,039
to give you a shout out on the show.

94
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,390
And II, I don't think, I don't think you mentioned this, Josh, but um, I'm,

95
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,290
I'm sure we'll put a link to this in the show notes.

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,089
Oh, absolutely

97
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,880
without a doubt. And, and,

98
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,880
and the show notes will be an open

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,850
source security podcast.com for those of you playing along at home.

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,190
So by all means, go check it out. It's awesome.

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,700
Open SSL Day.

102
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,390
Uh It is open SSL Day

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,989
who doesn't love open SSL?

104
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:37,869
It is,

105
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,190
we have an election

106
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,350
that, that maybe was hacked. Probably not.

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,350
But uh

108
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,589
no, I shouldn't say that

109
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm gonna rouse someone up

110
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,459
open SSL. We, we'll talk about open SSL.

111
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,910
So there was a new release of Open SSL, like literally earlier in the day.

112
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,750
This is uh Thursday morning and I think it was an hour or two ago.

113
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:57,910
It is, it is world ending. Right. Dave, should we, uh,

114
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:05,359
as, as, as, as with all, uh, open SSL releases. It is, uh, the criticality is high.

115
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,750
Um, yeah, I mean, it,

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,549
it's always, it's always good to see work being done, um, on open SSL.

117
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:16,839
It's in everything and I think you, and you and, uh, Kurt spent two shows, uh, uh,

118
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,359
-- talking about Open SSL
-- and certainly we've talked about it at least twice.

119
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:21,739
It is.

120
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,589
it,

121
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,679
um, but it's, it's

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,750
just a nice, a nice reminder that, that it's out there,

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,450
it's everywhere and it's consistently being updated.

124
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,570
Um, you know, looking at the, looking at the release notes here.

125
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,290
Um, you know, we've got uh

126
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:36,480
cha cha

127
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,529
20 Polly 1305, you know, head buffer overflow fix, right?

128
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:41,529
Um

129
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,959
You know, so that's uh

130
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,480
interesting,

131
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,100
I guess.

132
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,440
Yeah. No, I mean, it's fair.

133
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,309
It's, they, they, now that one is the important part there,

134
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,440
I guess is it only affects version 1.1 0.0

135
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:54,600
which,

136
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,899
and oh man, Openness cells, like I've never cared for their,

137
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,940
their versioning scheme.

138
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,420
So the latest version will be 1.1 0.0 C

139
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,679
and my brain doesn't, numbers and letters don't mix well.

140
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,720
So I, I've always struggled with that,

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,140
but I guess the point is this is, uh

142
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,299
unless you're running the latest and greatest, which you're probably not.

143
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,140
But even if you are, the world will not end,

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,929
it's

145
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,079
it.

146
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah,

147
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:26,959
don't please please people don't create an, a logo for this. It doesn't deserve it.

148
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah. No, seriously. And,

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,109
um, that, that, that, you know, you good, good point there. Uh uh Josh is,

150
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,679
know, know, know what versions you are running, right.

151
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:37,730
Yeah,

152
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:40,619
because you said 1.1 0.0 is super new and I

153
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,369
think most things out there are probably running 098 something.

154
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,720
Uh, some iteration thereof.

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,600
Yeah. Well, I it's 09 end of life.

156
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,200
Um, it is, but it's still shipped with a lot of stuff. It,

157
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,279
since, since when does end of life mean people stop shipping it.

158
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,149
Well, there's ok. Yeah, man, we should have a conversation about this someday.

159
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,750
It's, it's complicated because there are, well, there's two end of life.

160
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,049
There's the upstream end of life,

161
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,709
which means open SSL isn't supporting that version anymore.

162
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,630
But then you have things like Linux distribution such as Red Hat or Debian or whoever

163
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,910
that will continue back. Courting security fixes for the older versions. Right.

164
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,600
But then there's also people who took the upstream version and put

165
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,079
it in their product and it has never been updated ever.

166
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,700
Not once since it was added to whatever it is they have

167
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,750
and it's still vulnerable to heart bleed and nobody knows or cares.

168
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,019
Yep. Let's, let's, let's not dive back into the IOT.

169
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,010
Right. Because that's,

170
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,609
that's exactly, that's exactly what that is. Right.

171
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,279
We're, we're gonna bundle all these libraries into this thing.

172
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,329
That's just going to go out there into the wild and never, ever,

173
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,970
ever see an update ever again

174
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
and it costs $2

175
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,130
$2. That's exactly,

176
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,989
actually, it's so funny enough. The mirror botnet

177
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,049
is

178
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,959
been something that normal people have talked about.

179
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,920
Well, they don't know what it is. They just talk about the internet broke. Right.

180
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,140
That, that's kind of their,

181
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,440
the most elaborate way they can describe what happened.

182
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,989
And I've gained an immense amount of joy

183
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,600
explaining to them

184
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,350
kind of the,

185
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:17,700
the nuance behind IOT and its cheapness and the

186
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,690
inability to update and the fact that quite frankly

187
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,839
nobody cares and they don't have a reason to care

188
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:23,510
and,

189
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,929
and like everyone you talk to, they got like, oh, but this one thing we'll,

190
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,029
we'll do this, we'll do that and everything and by the end of the conversation,

191
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,690
like you can just see the, the horror in their face and then I know I,

192
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,130
I have a job well done at that point.

193
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,929
That's, that's exactly right. You know, that's exactly right.

194
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,539
Because, you know, and I think, I think you've mentioned it on the show before where,

195
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,130
you know, people aren't gonna wanna spend the $5 extra, the $10 extra for a device

196
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,419
to have it up update.

197
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,150
Right.

198
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,469
I'm a security guy and I'm pretty confident I would save the $10.

199
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,200
-- That is. Right.
-- Right. Right.

200
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,140
But, but we are, we are our, we, we, we're the worst hypocrites out there. Right.

201
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,950
You know, to tell, tell people they need to do certain things and then we,

202
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,429
-- we, we know better.
-- I'm special, Dave. So the rules don't apply to me.

203
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,369
Right. Right. It, it won't happen to me. Right. That's the,

204
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,349
that's right.

205
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,940
And speaking of being special,

206
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,289
there was an election on Tuesday which I know

207
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,450
we both stayed up far too late paying attention to

208
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,609
and then we woke up on Wednesday and the

209
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:28,849
world didn't end in open SSL release on Thursday.

210
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,309
The world still hasn't ended.

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,090
So there's still, there's another day this week for the world to end.

212
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,020
One.

213
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,460
-- Come on
-- Universe. There's, there's one work day, there's there.

214
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,909
You got the weekend too, right? Yeah.

215
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,890
World keeps spinning.

216
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,469
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

217
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,169
So

218
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,750
I will, I will have no comments on politics on this show

219
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,059
because

220
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,260
nobody cares what I think.

221
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,080
At

222
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,989
least of wit me, Josh.

223
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:55,880
That's fair.

224
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,469
That's fair. So, uh

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,750
Red Hat released a security API command line interface tool,

226
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,700
which is about the most exciting name you could ever give something.

227
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,869
So why don't you tell us about this, Dave?

228
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,530
There's actually some really cool stuff going on here.

229
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:13,159
Yeah. So, uh this is, this is actually a very interesting tool. Um

230
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:23,109
So those who may not know, uh Red Hat has a uh security data api uh for,

231
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:27,299
for customers to be able to access our security database.

232
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:30,169
Um And what that means is you have access to

233
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,760
uh all our information on CV ES, you know, the, the scoring, the,

234
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:35,469
you know,

235
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,619
what packages are affected, you know, where

236
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:45,190
uh the Rh SAS are. Um you know what the R hr H SAS are for the uh for the fixes.

237
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
And that's um

238
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,809
the Red Hat security advisory.

239
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,890
That's, those are the um Arata that get released for CBES.

240
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:51,960
Um

241
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:55,130
And what this tool does is it gives you a handy

242
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,450
uh command line interface to be able to access that data,

243
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,510
you know, on the fly as you're sitting there,

244
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,359
you know, at your terminal and somebody mentions a CV E,

245
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,729
you can quickly just fire off uh uh uh

246
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,090
search via the command line and get all the

247
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,229
information you're gonna need on that CV E.

248
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,710
Yeah, that's, that's very cool. It's,

249
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,609
it is one of those things that I think

250
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:20,690
people don't appreciate the value in until they need it

251
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,900
because there's nothing more annoying when you were like,

252
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:26,440
I wonder about this particular thing and then you have to figure it out.

253
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,419
So, I mean, it's cool, like something fun.

254
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,989
I'm glad we did it.

255
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,559
Yeah, absolutely. Um

256
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,229
You know, I, I think it's a, it's a nice little uh

257
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,549
it, it's, it's a nice little gap filler, right? Um

258
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:40,219
For,

259
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,020
for, for the quick, for the quick analytics, you know,

260
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,679
outside of things like satellite or, or insights.

261
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,960
Um you know, which also give you, give you this information. But

262
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,619
you know, this is that quick one off. Hey, I need, I just need some quick information.

263
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,989
Let me get that. Uh

264
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:55,500
you

265
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:56,429
here totally.

266
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,669
And,

267
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,510
and I'll put a link in the show notes and there's

268
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,330
kind of an example of running it because I mean,

269
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,479
as exciting as showing off command line interface tools can be

270
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,229
which we should all create videos of these things happening.

271
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,619
It's a kind of AAA cut and paste sort of deal on, on the, on the website.

272
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,349
So yeah, go, go check it out. I if

273
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,349
even if you're not a red hat customer,

274
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,030
you could probably gain some interesting insights from trolling through the data.

275
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:21,539
That's right.

276
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,739
And, and you know, I, I think uh I think I'm, you just inspired me, Josh,

277
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,510
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna create a youtube channel solely to

278
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,900
curate uh uh the best command line utility youtube videos out there.

279
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,330
You totally should and make sure that the resolution is

280
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,500
small enough that I can't read what's on your screen

281
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:38,900
while you're typing away.

282
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,280
That's, that's

283
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,080
a, that's, that's one of the requirements. That

284
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:42,340
would be

285
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,000
one of the

286
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,419
criteria.

287
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:47,130
And, and I would suggest you put the microphone very close to the keyboard

288
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,609
so I can hear all of the typing you're doing as it goes on.

289
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,140
Uh Yeah. Oh Absolutely. Absolutely.

290
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,309
As close to the keyboard as possible and as far away from your mouth as possible.

291
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,830
-- That's right.
-- That's right. Yeah. Yeah. It's much echo and background noise,

292
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,530
man. God bless you too.

293
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:03,119
Uh,

294
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,659
actually, you know, funny enough.

295
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:05,530
So my kids are like,

296
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,359
obsessed with trying to make youtube videos of them

297
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,239
playing Minecraft and stuff and it's like they are like

298
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,640
these are bad guys. I'm sorry.

299
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:13,960
Right. Right.

300
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:14,429
Oh,

301
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,270
yeah. It, it starts, it starts young too. Right.

302
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,239
You know, my, my oldest right now, uh, every time I'm taking pictures or I'm, I'm,

303
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,650
you know, take a video of them or something.

304
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:26,039
It's, are you gonna put this on Facebook? Are you gonna put this on youtube?

305
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,969
Where is this gonna be? Can I get a Facebook? Uh

306
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,479
-- God help me.
-- Well, in effect, you know, it's so funny enough. My uh my son is 10

307
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:39,400
and he carved shovel night into his pumpkin this year for Halloween,

308
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,700
which for those of you who don't know shovel Knight is a video game character.

309
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,700
They, this company, I forget the name of them even now. They made a

310
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,369
like retro style game where it looks like a bit Nintendo esque in

311
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,799
its graphics

312
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,630
and, and he loves this game

313
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,489
and he carves the, the the character in like it's eight bit glory, right?

314
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,159
Like it's all cubes and squares.

315
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,070
And then he says, dad put this on the Google and I'm like, what?

316
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,169
That doesn't even make sense. What are you talking about?

317
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:08,289
And like he wants to type in shovel night pumpkin and see a picture of his pumpkin.

318
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,849
And I said, I'm like, buddy, I, I can't make that happen.

319
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,809
Like that's not how things work.

320
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:13,340
A,

321
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:18,000
a after we get off this, uh, af after we close out the podcast,

322
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,080
-- I'm totally gonna Google the shovel night pumpkin and there's
-- a couple of

323
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:27,359
his has not appeared yet as he asks me almost daily to search for it.

324
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,890
Oh, the web crawlers haven't found it yet.

325
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:34,580
Well, look, I, I posted it to Twitter to shut him up. Like

326
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,690
let's seo optimized Halloween pumpkin pictures.

327
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,530
I mean,

328
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:42,840
anyway, anyway, anyway.

329
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,809
All right, we've got,

330
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,929
why don't you talk about this o

331
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,599
of two problem since you are, uh, way more expert than I am at, at of two.

332
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,229
And this is kind of,

333
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,210
this is one of those things that I, I think really interesting in, in, in the lab,

334
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:04,559
but I question if it will have a ton of validity in the real world.

335
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,650
Yeah. So, um,

336
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:12,789
where I get all my news, you know, I saw this story pop up on Twitter earlier this week,

337
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,330
um,

338
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,479
where it came out that Facebook and I believe it was Facebook and an older,

339
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,320
uh, implementation of

340
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,229
OO two.

341
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,989
the way they implemented it left it

342
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,630
vulnerable to, uh, um,

343
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,460
being compromised and,

344
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,340
and, and

345
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,539
basically they're, they're talking about how this, this can be used to,

346
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,549
to pop both Android and I OS devices,

347
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,400
um, via this faulty implementation of

348
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,549
OO

349
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,119
two.

350
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,559
And

351
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,559
I think I

352
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,380
while it's, while it's an interesting lab experiment and, and uh you know, you,

353
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,299
you may not be

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,210
sold on the the implication in real life.

355
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:56,739
Uh This, this speaks volumes to how prevalent um

356
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:00,330
you know, ID PS are becoming, right? You know, things like O

357
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:04,390
A two and Sam ML and open ID connect and things like that, right?

358
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,820
Where, you know, you're using different authentication mechanisms, you know,

359
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,760
hey, I, I want to look into my bank using my Facebook account,

360
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,770
right?

361
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:12,299
Uh I

362
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,710
please please don't take that advice

363
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,309
from my phone.

364
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,929
If, if, if, if you, if you work on the, if you work on the web team for a bank,

365
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,859
please please don't take that advice.

366
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:25,489
That's awful, awful advice. But um

367
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,690
you know, it

368
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,429
the prevalence of using these other, these other authentication providers,

369
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,200
you're really depending on that underlying framework and,

370
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,640
and the implementation, right?

371
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,090
Because

372
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,210
while the protocols are, are,

373
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:40,760
are good and solid and the standards are good and solid.

374
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,409
Um

375
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,909
implementation is a case by case basis. And

376
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,719
um

377
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,359
yeah, II, I just think that this opens the,

378
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,020
yeah, this just, it opens up the the the prominence of, of that,

379
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,090
you know, sso infrastructure and, and how it can

380
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,270
really cause a lot of problems.

381
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,699
It can, I mean, so there's two sides to that argument though,

382
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,969
you can say that using some sort of centralized identity

383
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,449
is poses a risk which it certainly does.

384
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,020
However, having 10 million passwords

385
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,130
also poses a risk because they're all gonna be crappy. But more importantly

386
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,189
is if you have like the two bit web form.com

387
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,150
that you're logging into using your own user name and password,

388
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,410
you know,

389
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,449
they're not protecting the user names or password

390
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:39,050
or any of the personal identification pi I data

391
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,359
in that case. So I think

392
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,810
even if these large identity providers are

393
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,819
po pose a certain risk,

394
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,719
I still suspect the risk is lower than

395
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,579
rolling your own identity for every single service.

396
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:55,459
Sure.

397
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,579
Yeah. No. And, and I mean,

398
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,900
I'll, I'll be open and honest here, right?

399
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,199
And personally, you know, for things like,

400
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,619
you know, Bob's discount, chicken and waffles, you know, forum, right?

401
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:08,380
Uh I'm,

402
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,489
I'm not super careful with the passwords that

403
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,119
I choose for those types of environments,

404
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,349
right?

405
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,290
But, you know, when it certainly, when it comes to things that are more important,

406
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,160
you know, I use the tools that are available to ensure, you know,

407
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,680
as solid a password as possible or, you know, please implement, you know,

408
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:24,609
two factor authentication anywhere you can.

409
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,339
But yeah, this and, and I use it all the time, right? You know, I use the,

410
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,270
please sign in with your Facebook account. Right? Yeah, sure, no problem.

411
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,109
Um

412
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,160
But it, it,

413
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:35,229
you know, again,

414
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,079
how careful are people uh when they, when they choose to do that?

415
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,839
-- That's the problem. That's the question.
-- Well, well,

416
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:42,750
and,

417
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,579
and you're speaking in the context of this

418
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,189
issue for clicking sign in with Facebook now.

419
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:50,310
No, but here's the thing though too. I don't know how much you read about this.

420
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,400
I, I'm not an expert. I won't, I won't say I am, but

421
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:56,089
it sounds like the target is mobile users.

422
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,180
And

423
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,060
you also need a

424
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,869
man in the middle proxy installed on your phone, which that's kind of right.

425
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,569
That's the, that's the hand wavy part of, you know, step one steel underpants,

426
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,609
step two, you know, oh install the man in the middle proxy on your phone.

427
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,550
Um And then step three, we steal your password.

428
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,170
It's like, whoa hang around there guys.

429
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,630
Now that said,

430
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:23,680
I think it is important to not disregard things like

431
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:26,140
this even though it has a difficult to improbable.

432
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,790
Snap

433
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:31,310
is that's how research starts. I my favorite example here right now is Row Hammer

434
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,609
where Ro Hammer started, we're looking, we're like, yeah, whatever

435
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,709
it lab only. No big deal, right?

436
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:40,229
And now we're like, oh crap like you can use like a web browser to trigger Ro Hammer.

437
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,949
This is terrible. What you know, why didn't we pay attention to this?

438
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,790
So lesson learned guys

439
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:48,430
and and that that basically happened in the last week, right?

440
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,920
The last week, week and a half, you know,

441
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,030
people are really building on top of that

442
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,869
and the attack has been out for probably a couple of years now.

443
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,790
So it's,

444
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:01,410
it always takes and, you know, this is like any industry, I guess, is

445
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,349
research comes out that people think is a waste of money or ridiculous.

446
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,630
And then a couple of years later somebody figures out

447
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,510
how can we do something awesome with what was silly

448
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,989
or impractical research from a couple of years ago?

449
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:15,790
Right.

450
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,150
Yeah. No, exactly. Exactly.

451
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:21,880
Um, but you know, one la, one last point on the, on the oo

452
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,750
two

453
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:27,109
issue here, you know, the, the hand wavy man in the middle.

454
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,229
Um you know, IO I can see, you know,

455
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:34,229
having less of an issue here because the uh as far as I understand the,

456
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:39,260
the app store is still very controlled uh under, under Apple's control.

457
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,469
Um but when you talk about Android devices, right? Um

458
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:47,540
It's still pretty, it's still pretty wild west out there with, with the

459
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,119
Wild

460
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,520
West

461
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,739
is generous.

462
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,750
So, you know, so somebody can be like, oh, well, hey, this game looks interesting.

463
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,790
Let me check it out.

464
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,400
And by the way, I'm gonna go ahead and install this, uh this proxy while I'm at

465
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:01,939
it because I

466
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,180
read

467
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,030
how, how many people actually read, hey, this,

468
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,349
this requires these permissions to run.

469
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:08,109
Right.

470
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,699
Nobody, nobody does.

471
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,020
Right. Right. It's like it's like reading the itunes user agreement. Right.

472
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:18,500
Yes, that's,

473
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,650
oh my goodness.

474
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,010
It's, now, I will say though,

475
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,709
one of the really cool things Android has done recently is

476
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,650
in, in the newer version, I don't remember if they added this in version five or six.

477
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,810
I don't, I don't even remember version one now. But

478
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,229
when an app needs permissions,

479
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:36,010
you don't

480
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,170
just accept it blanket.

481
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,219
When you install it,

482
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,920
it will ask you as you're using it when it needs the new permission.

483
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,949
So it kind of has two advantages. Firstly,

484
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,729
if an app doesn't act like for example, if you're using something that doesn't

485
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,150
uh access a camera

486
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:52,020
ever,

487
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,189
it won't ever ask for that permission even if it could in theory. Right?

488
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,510
And secondly,

489
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,849
people don't just be like, wow, that's a lot of crap, you know, install.

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,829
So they have to actually see

491
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,829
these warnings that pop up.

492
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,209
Now on the downside though,

493
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,989
you will get security fatigue with a certain group of users

494
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,869
if you continuously pop up things for them to click,

495
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,329
accept or deny or whatever.

496
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:13,589
So

497
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,229
it's kind of back and forth.

498
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,390
But for, for like my selfish purposes,

499
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,910
I love the new way because I always read those pop ups.

500
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,300
I do too, right?

501
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,020
Because it's like, oh, hey, something is looking to do something new,

502
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,920
what's going on and I love that it breaks it down per uh per request, right?

503
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,780
Per requirement.

504
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,819
Um And it's not just that blanket, here's this long list of things that this app can do

505
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:39,300
-- except for deny totally.
-- And I love that I can also

506
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,500
kind of go in and twiddle permissions if I want

507
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,329
because then, you know, yes, app.

508
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:46,489
I'd love for you to tell me more about that, you know,

509
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:49,420
notifications off there problem solved.

510
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,180
Right.

511
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:50,810
Which, ah,

512
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,300
man, that, that's something that drives me nuts. That's been

513
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,609
III, I always feel

514
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:59,040
similar during election season as I do with, like,

515
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,979
all these apps that have all these crappy pop ups.

516
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,699
It's like, no, I don't care. Stop telling me this stuff. It does not matter.

517
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:05,689
I do not want

518
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:05,880
it.

519
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,260
Right. Right. Right. Right.

520
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:07,939
Yeah,

521
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,140
it, it, you know, when you open up your phone,

522
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,829
first thing in the morning you got 3030 little alerts across the top of it.

523
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,189
He's like, why, why do you do this? Not me.

524
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:19,790
Although it always, it always horrifies me when I'll, I'll be talking to somebody,

525
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,979
they'll pull their phone out and I'll just see across the top.

526
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:26,119
Like it's completely filled with a little alert icons and I'm just thinking like,

527
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,910
what kind of monster must you be?

528
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,469
Keep ignoring these horrible things. Come on, man. Like clean up your mess.

529
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:33,530
But

530
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:39,430
in, in my, uh wisdom, I no longer yell at people. So II, I accept their decisions.

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,680
Right. Right. Right.

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,810
Free will and all right.

533
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:45,239
Um No, no, they're wrong but it's fine.

534
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,479
-- I, I accept it as them being wrong and making poor choices. That's
-- fine. That's fine.

535
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:51,449
But they, they can freely choose to be wrong.

536
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:51,939
That's the key.

537
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,130
-- We'll say
-- that.

538
00:23:56,189 --> 00:24:00,689
Uh So anyway, I guess the, the real story here is stay tuned folks.

539
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:05,209
Let's see what comes out of this because we have no idea.

540
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:08,609
But I'm certain there will be something interesting and, and I guess as well as,

541
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,410
as o

542
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,239
of two becomes more and more popular and more and more important

543
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,689
there will be more and more people looking at it,

544
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,920
which is just the nature of the universe.

545
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,930
And that's a good thing though.

546
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:21,650
That's a good thing because as researchers find problems,

547
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,650
we can fix the problems and that just makes things better for everybody.

548
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,510
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, e even at the, even at the enterprise level, right.

549
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,640
You know, it's not, it's not just logging into some web form, you know,

550
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,790
enterprises are looking at SSO and they're looking at, you know,

551
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,520
all two and Samuel and

552
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,250
ID,

553
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,420
you know, to solve a lot of real problems. So,

554
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,640
you know, it's, it's, it's important to keep, keep an eye on these things.

555
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,239
I mean, man, I remember even,

556
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:47,000
it's probably 15 years ago

557
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:48,000
when

558
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,969
there was no centralized authentication. Every Linux machine I logged into.

559
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,770
I had, uh, well, the same password,

560
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,449
you know, essentially a password for each one of them.

561
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,689
And it was,

562
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:02,010
-- oh, it was terrible be
-- because, because when you built the new box,

563
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,569
you just copied over the Etsy password and Etsy shadow file, right?

564
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:07,750
-- But like any good admin did, uh,
-- did I even do that?

565
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,699
And I think I was too lazy to even do that.

566
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:10,560
I just,

567
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,910
and so all my, all my U I DS were different across all the machines and, yeah,

568
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,650
whatever, who cares?

569
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,170
It doesn't matter. No shared home directory, whatever. That's too much work.

570
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,150
I'll just like SCP things when I need them

571
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:20,910
and,

572
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,170
oh,

573
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,219
man, those are the dark days.

574
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,849
I don't want to think about it.

575
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:25,619
All right.

576
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,030
So, let's move on to a happy topic.

577
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,750
Let's encrypt. Do you use, let's encrypt, Dave.

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,770
Oh, I do use, let's encrypt.

579
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,250
Uh, man, I was, I was on, I was on that boat, you know, when it, when it was in beta,

580
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,300
it was a

581
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,880
game changer. A game. It is a game changer for me. Right.

582
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,969
You know, especially since, uh,

583
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,790
as far as I know the let's

584
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,439
encrypt, uh, root C A is now shipped standard, right?

585
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:52,349
Um, if you, if you were to go pull NSS right now, it comes as part of that,

586
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,469
-- that
-- all the browsers support it.

587
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,150
And

588
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,910
I won't lie. I was late to the game. I had a free certificate from my website

589
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:03,780
and I waited till it expired to get let's encrypt because

590
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,699
I'm like, uh, it works, it works, whatever. And then it expired.

591
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,239
And I thought all right, it's time because,

592
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,660
and now it's great because I'll never have to think about it again.

593
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:10,819
You know,

594
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,829
magic,

595
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,020
magic, magic htps.

596
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:14,810
But, but the,

597
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,180
the purpose behind bringing this up is there's a a report

598
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:21,089
that came out and I know Mozilla has done something similar,

599
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,750
but uh chrome just released that

600
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,369
half of the website is loaded with chrome because

601
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,310
Google is totally not spying on everything you do.

602
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,079
Half of the websites loaded with chrome

603
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,540
are loaded. Uh http S now, which is,

604
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,680
that's a crazy number half

605
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,189
and, and they do, they, they actually call out let's encrypt as

606
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:43,469
the primary driver behind this because then let's face it.

607
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,810
Nobody wants to pay for a certificate

608
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,329
and not just even that, even if they were free. Have you ever

609
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:55,180
-- gotten a certificate from, uh, uh, I guess a traditional C A,
-- you, you're, you're,

610
00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:57,420
you're, you're talking to our resident PK I guy Josh.

611
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,130
But

612
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:58,810
yeah,

613
00:26:58,989 --> 00:26:59,109
so

614
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,459
it's terrible. It's a hassle.

615
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,770
-- It's a huge hassle
-- apart from screwing up the

616
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,880
certificate probably two or three times during generating it.

617
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:07,699
Right.

618
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,199
Then you have to send it off to somebody else and then what magic happens and

619
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,890
then they send you back a sign certificate which usually takes a period of time.

620
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,130
It's not instantaneous

621
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:21,979
and it's, it's a huge pain in the butt and let's encrypt it.

622
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,219
If you, if you've never used it out there,

623
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:29,619
you literally run a command and it basically does everything for you. It's amazing.

624
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,319
Exactly. Right. You know, and, and that you hit the nail on the head. Josh. Right.

625
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:35,900
You know, because historically speaking,

626
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,439
you had to know how to generate a CS R. Right.

627
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,040
Um, and

628
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:47,209
Google is full of bad advice on how to generate CS RS.

629
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,420
Oh, it totally is.

630
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,660
Well, let's face it.

631
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,670
And I'm even guilty of this when I needed to generate certificate.

632
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,439
You know, things we'll say

633
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,979
just search for it. Oh, stack over.

634
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:02,329
I'll pick that one, you know, copy and paste the first thing that, that's

635
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:02,790
listed

636
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:03,119
the

637
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,459
first result. And, yeah, that's good enough. It's fine

638
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,060
-- change variables where applicable. Right. You know, if
-- you're lucky.

639
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,869
Yeah. Right. If you're lucky. Right.

640
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,469
You know, so, and, and that's, that's the, that's the problem that,

641
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,280
and that's where, that's where let's encrypt is, is,

642
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,920
you know, the game changer for a lot of people. Um,

643
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,550
because it does simplify that

644
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:23,829
well, in, in, so the important thing I guess I,

645
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,589
I like to talk about is there's free as

646
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,089
in money where let's encrypt doesn't cost money,

647
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,869
but it's also, I won't say it's free as in time,

648
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,630
but the time investment for let's encrypt is substantially lower

649
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,750
than a regular C A and that I think is the key.

650
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,030
Right.

651
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,560
Yeah. No, it, it is because time is money. Right. Yeah.

652
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:46,520
You know, people want to spend more of their time doing new,

653
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,479
innovative things than going back and doing the housekeeping of,

654
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,109
oh, well, let me go ahead and, and get this, uh SSL cert renewed.

655
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,920
Oh, by the way, my C A provider doesn't have a, have a mechanism for renewing certs.

656
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,839
So I got to generate a brand new CS R to get a brand new cert signed and,

657
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,719
you know, it's, it's a hassle.

658
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,810
Yeah.

659
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:08,760
Oh, totally, man.

660
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:12,339
-- Oh, I'm so glad I never have to do that again.
-- And,

661
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,890
and, and it's, it's, it's funny because, um, you know, iii, I remember

662
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,819
the time an abstract for me but,

663
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:23,229
um, I, I remember some time ago, uh, you know,

664
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,760
people were talking about Litz and Crypt being,

665
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,280
you know, the place where, you know, malware providers are going to be getting,

666
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,780
you know, legitimate certs, you know,

667
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,849
for free to flood the internet with problematic things.

668
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,420
Right. And I, I just have not seen that bear, you know.

669
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,849
Well, I mean, ok, so let's face it. There are unquestionably

670
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,420
bad guys using glitz and crypt,

671
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:51,280
but they also use like electricity and they eat food and, and it is,

672
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,810
it is normal part of society for the bad guys to

673
00:29:55,819 --> 00:30:01,199
use the infrastructure that exists in some way that benefits themselves.

674
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,829
Right.

675
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:03,359
Exactly.

676
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,750
And this is kind of Bitcoin is another example. I love this.

677
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,150
You like, oh,

678
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,640
if we didn't have Bitcoin ransomware wouldn't exist and it's like it would,

679
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,199
it just wouldn't work with Bitcoin.

680
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,989
Right.

681
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:17,459
-- Right. Criminals
-- are opportunistic.

682
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,510
That's exact. That's exactly right. They'll use whatever tool is best for the job.

683
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:25,630
Exactly. And, and, and, you know, II, I laugh at this sometimes but I mean,

684
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:29,829
crime inc in terms of cybersecurity now is

685
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:31,599
I, I fear

686
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:37,000
getting ready to eclipse the good guys in terms of, I guess, knowledge and tooling

687
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,530
and,

688
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,849
-- and maybe they have already
-- and not just not

689
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,650
just knowledge and tooling but innovation as well.

690
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:43,729
Totally

691
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,280
because, you know, the news flash, you know, a spoiler alert,

692
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,199
crime isn't hampered by,

693
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,119
you know, overhead a lot of times. Right. And,

694
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:57,280
and you know, institutional and institutional curmudgeon.

695
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,760
Oh, so, well, not only that man is crime inc is a

696
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,760
they generate revenue

697
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,849
whereas security in most organizations is a cost

698
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:08,449
center.

699
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:09,239
So

700
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,469
historically speaking, if you are a revenue generator,

701
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,869
you get more attention than the cost centers do because

702
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,430
obviously you want to put as much investment into revenue as

703
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:23,349
you can and as little investment into cost as you can.

704
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,349
And so

705
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,109
this is the great challenge we have is,

706
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,729
and I, I wonder if this

707
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,869
does this problem exist elsewhere

708
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:39,219
where you have essentially a a revenue generating adversary against a cost center.

709
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,170
And I mean,

710
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,199
maybe, I mean, you could maybe talk about support in this context,

711
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:47,989
but I don't think that really applies either because in in the case of support

712
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,750
you, you, I I had to say to use the word adversary in the context of the white board, but

713
00:31:52,949 --> 00:31:54,489
you know, the the customer

714
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,380
is

715
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:01,449
-- not looking to ruin you, they just want some help.
-- Right. Right. And I mean, ex

716
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:06,900
Exactly. Yeah. And the the there are nuanced arguments that could be made about how,

717
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:07,699
you know,

718
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,630
the support isn't necessarily a call center

719
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,489
-- because the improved customer experience could result
-- in

720
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:18,979
ignoring that argument because I'm, no, I'm not gonna go there. But

721
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,699
it's,

722
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,260
I mean, you kind of have loss prevention in retail where, you know,

723
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:28,280
people are going to be essentially stealing your stuff and

724
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,010
you just accept that as part of doing business.

725
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:31,699
But even,

726
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,900
yeah, I don't know. I mean, outside of that example, I can't think of anything

727
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,979
that really applies in this context.

728
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:41,260
No, because, you know, the, the,

729
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,349
the only other analogy that I can think of

730
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,300
that's often used in these types of scenarios is,

731
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,790
you know, militaristic, right? You know, you have the arms race where,

732
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,630
um, you, you know, they,

733
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,280
your enemy builds a bigger wall, you build a bigger trebuchet,

734
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:55,750
right? I, I mean,

735
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:59,160
the way, the way it works today is building, building,

736
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,260
you know, bigger, bigger walls and building bigger trebuchet

737
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:07,229
are both revenue generators for a lot of different people. So I, I think that analogy

738
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:07,650
part.

739
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,150
Exactly because in,

740
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,910
in the military context there are

741
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,489
defense contractors making freaking fortunes and

742
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,949
like, yeah, you guys should totally build a bigger wall.

743
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,310
That would be great, you know, sign here.

744
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,189
And

745
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,359
like,

746
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,030
that's not exactly the case in

747
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,250
cybercrime.

748
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:27,619
This is, oh, man, every time I think about this, my head starts to hurt and it's,

749
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,800
it's already starting.

750
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,099
I don't, I

751
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,489
don't think this week I can handle this conversation

752
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:34,969
but it's, it's such a weird problem. I,

753
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:37,069
I have no idea. And the,

754
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,319
the thing that frustrates me to no end is

755
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,859
in so many of these security conversations,

756
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,410
they just end with like me throwing my hands in the air

757
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,609
and decrying as we're doomed and there's nothing we can do.

758
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,530
Right. II, I mean, ho honestly, short of

759
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,589
having,

760
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,160
short of taking the cost burden away from

761
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,979
the enterprise and putting it somewhere else where

762
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:01,540
just a team of researchers works on building

763
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,339
that bigger wall or building that bigger trebuchet

764
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:07,849
to stay ahead of crime. Inc I think, I think it's always gonna be,

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,870
-- you know, reactive, super reactive.
-- I want to build a security trebuchet.

766
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,860
I don't know what that means, but it sounds awesome.

767
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,080
Security tribute.

768
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:18,679
OK?

769
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,090
-- All
-- right.

770
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,159
Figure that out.

771
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,889
I'm gonna put, I'm gonna put that down on my white board.

772
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:26,070
-- I'm gonna do some word, I'm gonna do some word clouds about it right.
-- There you go.

773
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:27,159
I like it. I like it.

774
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,438
You can start a consulting company, right?

775
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,649
How to build your security

776
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:31,929
buche.

777
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:34,388
That, that, that'll be the company's name.

778
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:34,638
Rebut.

779
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:38,309
I like it. I like it. This is, this is the best idea yet.

780
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,080
We won't fix anything, but we'll make a lot of money making the problem worse.

781
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,520
No, goodness. No, we'll throw a git hub up and

782
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,600
the community will take care of everything else.

783
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,110
-- We'll just collect the checks,
-- the community's magic.

784
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,688
Oh, my goodness.

785
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,800
So, anyway, I guess in summary if you're not using lets encrypt you totally should.

786
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,909
So, get on that. I, I'll second that.

787
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:01,790
And

788
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:02,919
all right,

789
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,840
the last topic I have here

790
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,050
is a

791
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:06,879
doozy

792
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,550
and this,

793
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:10,590
I will

794
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:12,830
do my best

795
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,250
to stay neutral.

796
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,550
So, for those of you who don't know,

797
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,419
Google recently disclosed an issue

798
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,270
with, with Windows

799
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,280
to Microsoft and they gave them seven days to fix it

800
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,780
and it's, it's a pretty serious issue.

801
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,169
And so the disclosure debate of course erupts at this point

802
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:38,520
and the disclosure debate essentially comes down to the fact that

803
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,199
when a researcher finds an issue

804
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:42,080
and

805
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,929
they're reporting it to whoever needs it.

806
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:48,879
In this case, Google is the researcher, Microsoft is the organization,

807
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,040
it's being reported to

808
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,489
what should the rules be in the way these groups interact

809
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,760
if Google says we're going to disclose this in seven days.

810
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,449
And Microsoft says, can you give us 10

811
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,850
for example? And I know that's not exactly true,

812
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,610
but in Microsoft did release a fix for this.

813
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,879
So it's like twoish weeks, I think maybe about a week after it was disclosed,

814
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:09,969
it got got released.

815
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,090
But anyway, where,

816
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:14,290
where do we draw the line here? Is

817
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:18,590
I if, if the company asks for more time, the researcher says, no,

818
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,070
now they hate each other.

819
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,649
It's

820
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,870
or the company says like I want a year

821
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,330
is, it's so

822
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,989
it's such a crazy conversation. I've been on both sides of this more than once

823
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:30,870
and

824
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:34,669
I do not have an answer to any of these questions

825
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:36,429
there. I

826
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,070
don't think there is a good um

827
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,389
the, the there's no good answer to this, right? Because it's a case by case basis.

828
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,429
There, there is

829
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:50,239
n nearly no way to set some sort of guidelines or framework around

830
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:55,639
when to disclose vulnerabilities and how to disclose vulnerabilities. right?

831
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:56,120
Because

832
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:56,899
uh

833
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:01,070
you know, if somebody asks for a year on a super critical bug or

834
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,790
the

835
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:03,810
how,

836
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:07,729
how do we know that that's not gonna get found in the wild and exploited

837
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,899
within that year.

838
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:10,689
It, it, it probably will be.

839
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:15,250
And so in the case of this windows problem, the reason Google Google usually gives,

840
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,290
I think 90 days

841
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:21,330
and they gave seven to Microsoft because they knew it was being exploited in the wild

842
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:26,409
and that does change the rules a little bit. I I will not disagree.

843
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:28,550
So it's,

844
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,290
this is such a weird problem and well, in fact,

845
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,959
there was they, they just released something for Mac Os

846
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:36,159
where in the time when they talk about like apple

847
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:40,149
executives contact Google executives and and get extension of deadline,

848
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,600
right?

849
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,090
So

850
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:44,790
maybe Microsoft just didn't talk to the right people when they,

851
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,659
when they wanted their extra days instead

852
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,540
or,

853
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:54,070
or it could have been, we're Microsoft, you're going to give us the extra days and

854
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,689
also plausible, right?

855
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:00,020
But

856
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,979
Uh, yeah.

857
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:04,320
And, you know, it's, it's interesting the, the disclosure debate because,

858
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,070
you know, timing, timing is one thing and,

859
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,540
you know, II, I think it ties into this a little bit. Um, you know, to

860
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,610
speak of those who aren't here, Kirk, uh,

861
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:20,969
he had a, a poll on his Twitter, uh, this week as well. Um, asking about

862
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,729
internal, um,

863
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:27,800
internal disclosures are internal CV ES versus external CV ES. Right.

864
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,330
You know, should you keep CV ES internal right there, there's,

865
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,929
there's debates about how to,

866
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:38,360
how to even deal with uh vulnerabilities on software that's just in house, you know,

867
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:38,969
-- in
-- house.

868
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,649
So I, although I, I think in that case

869
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,030
that

870
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,129
II, I think that's less of an issue because this would be like,

871
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,370
let's say

872
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:52,850
you have your own personal dictionary with words in it. You won't share with me

873
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,139
that doesn't make sense.

874
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,389
And that's kind of the, I, if it's, if you're using CV ES,

875
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,800
there's really no purpose in not publishing them

876
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,110
because it is a public database of artifacts,

877
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,500
this would be like you making up words and not sharing them with anyone else. And then

878
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,570
what purpose would that even serve?

879
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,330
Nor, nor would you even use the words outside of your own home? Right. That why,

880
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,340
that doesn't make sense.

881
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,060
Right. Right. Exactly. Um, but it, it, it doesn't make sense.

882
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,800
But I think, um, you know, in fact, I think, I think I'm, I think I'm sidetrack the,

883
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,919
the more important discussion around their timing and how to,

884
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:32,290
and how to disclose vulnerabilities.

885
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,580
But,

886
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,820
um you know, I, I think it speaks to, you know, even if you're doing it internally,

887
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,030
if you're speaking the same language and you have the same

888
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,669
syntax and you have the same framework in which to,

889
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:49,310
to document and follow and track um and disclose vulnerabilities like CV E,

890
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:53,199
I think that's, that's of huge importance to even, you know,

891
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:55,360
inside uh inside of an enterprise.

892
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,100
I think you actually just hit on a really important point. Dave is having

893
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:02,080
the correct vocabulary and frameworks

894
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,110
is really what's important because I mean, at the end of the day,

895
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:11,550
researchers and organizations are probably never going to agree on everything.

896
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,149
Even if someone said here is the new disclosures policy of the world

897
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,229
and they laid out a bunch of dates and whatever numbers,

898
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:20,770
no one's going to agree

899
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,709
it. You will never make everyone happy. That's the reality of it.

900
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,629
And so in that context, I think it is more beneficial to have common language

901
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,229
and common concepts.

902
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:33,729
So even when there are disagreements,

903
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:37,699
people are at least on the same page enough to even understand they are

904
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:41,120
disagreeing because let's face it too back in the early days of disclosure,

905
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:41,649
like

906
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,560
nobody even knew what was going on and there'd be

907
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,379
companies that like they just didn't understand what was happening.

908
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,979
And then all of a sudden there's like a, you know, some horrible o day dropped on,

909
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,449
on full disclosure and they're like, ah, we have no idea what's going on.

910
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:55,419
You know,

911
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:58,280
it's talking, talking about wild west. Right.

912
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,689
You know, to bring, to bring that back up. It was,

913
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:01,439
uh,

914
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,580
awful. Right.

915
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,939
And, and I think, I think we're moving towards that, uh, a good direction and I,

916
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:07,110
people,

917
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,340
people need to agree that,

918
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:12,610
you know, the tooling that's in place today and, and, you know,

919
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,820
I'm sure Kurt will talk more about it next week, you know, after he gets back from his,

920
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,300
his uh CV E boondoggle, right?

921
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,159
Um

922
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,459
uh that, that,

923
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:26,780
you know, e even for internal issues, even for internal issues,

924
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,479
if you stay within that same framework, people are gonna understand,

925
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,840
people are going to be able to

926
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,800
understand what you're talking about and figure out how

927
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,050
to act based on the information that they're given.

928
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,370
And uh you know, and not just, not just your own internal people,

929
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:44,360
like your admins and your, your security practitioners inside your walls, but,

930
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,919
you know, say you've got auditors coming in, right?

931
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:48,290
You know, I,

932
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,239
I'm probably speaking a little out of school here but I'll,

933
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,649
I'll bet you dollars to donuts.

934
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:54,540
If you had an auditor come in and they saw

935
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,229
that you had a facility in place that mapped to

936
00:41:57,439 --> 00:42:02,250
the CV E framework for internal security issue, uh disclosures,

937
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,550
they would be

938
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,399
ecstatic,

939
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:05,989
right?

940
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:10,010
Because they understand that they can follow that and they can see that,

941
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:12,780
you know, you're at least trying to do your due diligence. Right.

942
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,350
You may be right. I, I don't like it

943
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:15,979
when,

944
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,840
when people are right. And it's about private things

945
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:24,239
but, but you, you have some very valid points. I will, I will think about this.

946
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,860
Now, now, we should start talking about, uh CV E NAT

947
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:31,840
where you have special internal only CV ID pools that anyone can use. Right.

948
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:34,459
Oh,

949
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,669
goodness, I'm gonna, I'll add that.

950
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:40,129
I'll add that to the white board and I'll, I'll, I'll submit it to

951
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,689
-- you. I'll submit it to NIST. Right. You know, we'll get it
-- approved.

952
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:45,770
Oh,

953
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:46,459
man.

954
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,979
Yeah. So, so anyway, anyway,

955
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,639
rather than dwell on the disclosure debate for too long, I guess it's,

956
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,659
it's interesting to point out

957
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:57,489
that

958
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:59,699
two giant organizations

959
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:03,439
that probably should have more in common than not,

960
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
can't even come to an agreement here.

961
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:09,030
And I think that's one of those instances where,

962
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,620
like you said, it's easier to just have tools to communicate

963
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,989
than it is to even try to solve

964
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,939
this problem because it is almost certainly unsolvable.

965
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:20,669
Yep.

966
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,100
Let's just, let's just make it a little bit easier on the people.

967
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,939
So now in our list of uh solved versus unsolved problems,

968
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:33,540
the solved category is still empty and unsolved is enormous

969
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:36,350
a job well done.

970
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,050
We're, we're, we're, we're gonna, we're gonna overflow some,

971
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,250
some memory here on the, uh, the,

972
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:44,000
uh the, the, the un unsolved problem,

973
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,070
man. That, that table, yeah, that, that, that tables wrapped about 10 times now.

974
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,419
I think it's, it just, it never ends true story.

975
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:55,439
Oh, my goodness. We're doomed. Dave, we're all doomed. That, that's all I can say.

976
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,409
Uh, yet the world, the world continues to function even though it shouldn't.

977
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:00,510
-- And we don't know what
-- it's right.

978
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,889
We're all doomed. But just

979
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:05,469
put that smile on, keep moving forward, just keep doing the best you can do.

980
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,370
That's my philosophy.

981
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,360
But I'm, I'm, I'm forever the hopeless optimist.

982
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,780
-- Josh, that's,
-- that's why I, it's a funny thing is,

983
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,379
is I always have to pull that out after I've,

984
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,419
I've scared people to death explaining why,

985
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:18,020
like everything is broken from the security perspective and,

986
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,520
and occasionally someone looks like they're ready to cry.

987
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,860
And so it's a matter of, but, you know, uh

988
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,340
everything still works

989
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,620
and so

990
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:29,459
we're probably wrong then, then the world is fine again.

991
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,219
And so

992
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:34,850
I can see no, no better note to end the podcast on

993
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:36,610
than admitting we're all wrong.

994
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:40,040
And you've probably just wasted like 50 minutes of your life

995
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,810
and, and just, and,

996
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,010
and just remind people that security started with locks on the door and

997
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,560
to this day it

998
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,409
still doesn't work, right? Uh And,

999
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,290
um,

1000
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,699
you just reminded me, I don't know where my, my locks are.

1001
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,699
I should go find them. I, I, if you know, black picking man is fantastic.

1002
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:02,060
And I just realized I, I don't,

1003
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,340
I thought they were in a box right on the shelf over there.

1004
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,689
But I look and it's gone. So which either means my Children have stolen them or like,

1005
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,419
or I misplace them

1006
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,439
and I'll put a, I'll put a link in the show notes.

1007
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:16,530
Uh There's an interesting gentleman. Uh, uh, I think his name is, uh Skyler.

1008
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,199
Um, I forget his last name.

1009
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:19,959
Uh, He,

1010
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:23,979
I'm a member of the Richmond Information Security Users Group and we have a,

1011
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:27,449
a yearly conference and he, he comes there, he does lock picking,

1012
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,320
he brings all his locks and his picking tools

1013
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,439
and he has a little lock picking village because

1014
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:34,350
every good security conference needs a lockpicking village. Right?

1015
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,639
Uh And,

1016
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:39,840
and he's done some presentations on the history of locks

1017
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,959
and the history of locks and security and it's,

1018
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,239
you would think that it would be the dullest material ever,

1019
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,649
but it's super interesting.

1020
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:50,479
I should, uh, actually in all seriousness, you should give me a copy of that

1021
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,159
because this is something I've been really thinking about a lot for a long time is

1022
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,679
if we look at the parallels behind specifically locks,

1023
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,879
what does that look like if we parallel it to computer security?

1024
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:07,560
Because I, I'm not gonna say it's gonna line up. Exactly.

1025
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,379
But I suspect there's gonna be some very similar

1026
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,850
coincidences there. Like, like an example is,

1027
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,729
you know, a couple of 100 years ago, even

1028
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,540
doors just didn't have locks because they were obviously very expensive

1029
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:24,459
and you probably didn't have anything to steal anyway. So, what did you care?

1030
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,850
And, and that's obviously not the case anymore and, and like, let's face it

1031
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,379
20 years ago with computers,

1032
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,439
you didn't have anything worth stealing was generally what, what happened there.

1033
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:39,239
But now

1034
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:44,020
a lot of organizations have very valuable things

1035
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,300
but they lack the locks to protect them.

1036
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,739
And so I'm curious if we look historically,

1037
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,379
how valuables and society have driven locks

1038
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,419
because obviously locks did not build society, right?

1039
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:56,739
I mean, that that's the reality of it.

1040
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:59,060
So, yeah, totally. Um,

1041
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:00,469
and we should talk about that at,

1042
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:04,239
at a future date because I think this is a super interesting topic.

1043
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:04,639
So

1044
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,330
I guess with that, thank you so much, Dave for helping out.

1045
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,479
I can't wait to have you on again at some future point.

1046
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:12,020
I'm available.

1047
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,010
It, it, it's fantastic.

1048
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,770
I, I do appreciate it and, and, and Kurt will come back next week.

1049
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,489
So I'm told, assuming he doesn't die in a horrible plane crash on the way home.

1050
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,689
But, and,

1051
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,780
and we'll have what I'm sure is the most

1052
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,870
interesting conversation about CV E held in history,

1053
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:30,560
which the bar is very high here, I imagine.

1054
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,870
And so with nothing else, uh folks,

1055
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:36,290
if you wanna catch any of the links we talked about,

1056
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,189
it's open source security podcast.com.

1057
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:40,550
Thank you so much for listening. I appreciate it.

1058
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,149
And with that you all have a fantastic week. Thanks, Dave.

1059
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,129
Thank you.
