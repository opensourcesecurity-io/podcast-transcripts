00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,009
December 8th door number eight.

1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,690
We're getting ever closer to the final day

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,699
security periodic system security check on open BS D.

3
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:12,159
-- Why is it,
-- why is it on day eight

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,609
though?

5
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,970
Because it's

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,079
section eight of the Man pages,

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,090
-- which means what most people don't even know what Man pages are
-- anymore. God,

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,010
you're right.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,420
Old man yells that cloud.

10
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,469
So man pages were

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,399
uh uh

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,619
so like section one general commands then system calls library functions,

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,479
PERL library

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,119
and

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,389
you

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,549
keep a

17
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,919
man space command.

18
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,080
And so some commands existed more than once.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,680
Uh like in the sense of like, um

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,549
-- I'm trying to, I can't print F.
-- Print F is an easy example

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,889
because print F is in lib C which is in what? Section five I think?

22
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,119
No, that, well, depending on is that Linux

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,959
-- bs D is
-- different, whatever

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,650
I use. Linux.

25
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,709
And then obviously like Bash has a print F command also.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,480
That would be in, I think two or is two. Li I don't know whatever

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,089
matter it doesn't matter anymore. I haven't, I haven't looked at man,

28
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,410
well, I shouldn't say that I look at Man pages all the time.

29
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,650
I, I still read Man pages once in a while because I just got to find that, you know,

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,290
like, it's like, I know this will do it.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,949
Which freaking switch because, like, I tried hyphen hyphen volume.

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,110
Oh, it's like hyphen volume or like,

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,599
because I know it's not hyphen V because that's verbosity. Right.

34
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:32,305
Except when it is hyphen capital V or, or just,

35
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,425
right. This isn't an episode on Man pages though

36
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:39,904
-- or, or it could be.
-- But anyways, it's just, it's comical

37
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:44,705
that this old stuff because this came up on Twitter a while ago about, you know,

38
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:45,135
the links to

39
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:47,495
Australia security guy. And I'm like, this stuff is so out of date.

40
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:48,754
It's hysterical, but it's like

41
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:52,285
this is what I love because it basically assumes that you have a system

42
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,089
and that's it. Like you have a system,

43
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,889
right? Nowadays, we have, I believe virtual machines and also

44
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,849
more than one computer because computers kind of got cheap. Like

45
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,620
I'm trying to,

46
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,610
I think I have three Raspberry pies floating around my house right now.

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,730
I have at least that I might have more

48
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,169
-- 10, so
-- it's interesting,

49
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,229
this is the angle you're going because I was

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,250
thinking about this in a completely different way,

51
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:14,850
which is

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,979
so this the security command and open BS D

53
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,050
and I will obviously put a link in the show notes,

54
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,149
it runs every day and basically sends you the crown output.

55
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,880
And I thought the interesting part of this is, it was all about, like,

56
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,160
let's just automate some really simple checks.

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,740
Even though you could argue today, they're kind of useless.

58
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,020
But like that automation is key.

59
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,395
Well, they were useful 20 years ago but now they're useless.

60
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,345
But 20 years ago they actually matter because you

61
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:42,916
had more than one user on your system.

62
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:47,916
Yeah, that would have been super common and just doing this automatically is huge.

63
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,766
Well, here's the thing I love about automation is it does

64
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:54,686
four main things. Number one, it automates it. So it actually gets done.

65
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,936
Even if you don't feel like doing it, it gets done. Number two latency,

66
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,201
things that are automated tend to take less time and

67
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:02,432
things that require you whipping a human to do.

68
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,341
Number three, it forces you to like write down your assumptions

69
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,572
and essentially

70
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,841
what does this actually do? Oh, we're doing a security check. No, no.

71
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,261
What does your security check actually check? Oh, all checks this and this.

72
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,981
What about this? 00, crap. We should check that too.

73
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:22,261
Sure. Number four is it allows you to, to then iterate and improve it

74
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,369
and share it right? Because

75
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
like I can't, I can say blah, blah, blah,

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,729
cool.

77
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,479
I give you a bash script. That's, that's shareable.

78
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,279
This comes back to I think the long running theme

79
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,119
on the podcast of artisanal security is bad and dangerous.

80
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,720
Oh God, yes, I'm going through this with threat modeling.

81
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,559
I'm using spreadsheets so we can share it.

82
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,240
That's it, we can cut and paste and share it.

83
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:46,199
-- It's
-- massive.

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,360
Even though this,

85
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:51,960
this program is almost definitely out of date for the threats of today.

86
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,610
-- The concept behind it is
-- check user home directory permissions.

87
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:01,149
Like how would they even get wrong? I it happens and more to the point

88
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,649
why would you have more than one user on a system?

89
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,860
Now, you would just container those buggers.

90
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,970
It's uncommon now.

91
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,339
So actually, in all seriousness,

92
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,500
I could see that check being hugely important because one of the favorite

93
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,449
tricks we would use back in the day when we were pranking our friends

94
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,690
is we would get them to do something that

95
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,149
added the right permission to their home directory.

96
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,148
And once we had that we were home free,

97
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:28,729
-- do
-- I remember back in the day when home directories weren't secure?

98
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:29,748
Like in the sense of

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,319
only Bob had access to Bob's home directory,

100
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,609
like it was just world readable by default.

101
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:35,209
Well, right,

102
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,628
you make it world readable because then you can tell people to just

103
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,109
jump in your home directory and copy some stuff out of it.

104
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:43,148
I remember Linux back in the day didn't do that.

105
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,510
-- It was just everything was public by default because wouldn't you want to
-- share it?

106
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,750
It was way easier, man.

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,609
Like honestly, in all seriousness when I was in college,

108
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:54,980
we had a lot of shared systems and it was super common to say, oh, I've got it in my,

109
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:57,950
you know, whatever directory in my, in home, go grab it from me.

110
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:58,140
Just

111
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,309
read

112
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,220
it like we did that all the time and it was no big deal.

113
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,570
But today that sounds horrifying to me

114
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,910
because it is.

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,779
Yeah.

116
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,279
Right. Anyway, anyway,

117
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,399
so I

118
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,100
like, I love how security evolves and changes and gets better,

119
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:15,380
but at the same time the basics, like automating stuff

120
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,350
are the same.

121
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't think automation is a basic but it should be,

122
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,269
-- you
-- know, I agree. Yeah, you're right. Automation.

123
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,119
See,

124
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,239
you

125
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,079
see you December 9th.
