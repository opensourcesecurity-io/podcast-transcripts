Hello and welcome to the open

1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,449
source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,739
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,710
So, what's new?

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,520
Uh, it's spring, which is nice.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,690
-- I think we had our last snow last week.
-- And

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,620
is it not where I live?

7
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:22,270
-- Like, freaking still winter here?
-- What do you consider?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,790
Like, I consider there's not gonna be any more snow

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,270
-- that spring?
-- It literally snowed yesterday here.

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:29,979
-- Oh, that's not too
-- bad.

11
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,180
Whatever.

12
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,900
Sick of winter, it didn't stay, it melted right away, but still

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,689
snow should no longer be falling from the sky in the month of April.

14
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:42,490
-- It's
-- better than rain in January

15
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,169
because

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,639
in January freezes

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,590
that well, or,

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,340
or it's the impending doom approaching due to environmental catastrophe.

19
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:58,029
Well, we have that but we have like a like this year was a brutal freeze thaw cycle.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,369
Like the potholes on my are just

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,830
really bad this year.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,388
So I was in Chicago

23
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,739
over the weekend, my, my kids had their spring break.

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,830
So we spent a long weekend in, in Chicago now,

25
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:14,790
for anyone who doesn't live in the Midwest or has ever kind of been to Chicago.

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,190
Chicago is legendary. For potholes. They,

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,220
it is just,

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,949
they have a lot of roads and a lot of potholes

29
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,660
and not nearly enough time or money to fix them all.

30
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,389
But I felt like this year the number of potholes

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,180
I had to deal with driving around Chicago was ridiculous.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,589
And that's all it was just, I, I've never seen it so bad. And

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,660
now I will also say though, I finally went to a Microcenter since I was there.

34
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,220
What's a micro,

35
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,199
oh, the store that sells electronics?

36
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,970
-- Yeah,
-- that like that, that, like epic computer store.

37
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,720
It was nice. I liked it. But I, I think though I was a little spoiled because I

38
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,779
also spent a great deal of time at fries. Electronics back in the day.

39
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,389
And micro center is like,

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,849
if you just kind of chop fries in half and only had

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,760
the computer stuff and didn't have all the other cool stuff,

42
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:02,599
fries used to have.

43
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,669
So it's like this is cool. But,

44
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,129
you know,

45
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,880
there's no oscilloscopes and there's no telescopes and there's no keyboards and

46
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,320
like music, keyboards and all that jazz. But

47
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,160
it was cool.

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,199
Like, I'm old enough to remember when Radioshack had radio components.

49
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,919
Like those, those kind of walls of little packets of little components,

50
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:26,770
you know, like straight up, like all the little things because, well,

51
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,160
part of it too is there's no internet to order that stuff on.

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,729
No, no,

53
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:32,750
just destroyed that market.

54
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,979
Yeah. I mean, I did the same thing.

55
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,080
I would go to radio shack with my parts list

56
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:39,190
for whatever the thing is I was going to build

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,479
and I would acquire things.

58
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,110
But now, like, my basement is like a radio shack because when I'm on digi

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,440
key or something and I'm like, oh,

60
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:53,139
I could buy 10 resistors or I could buy a 7000 pack of resistors for only $2 more.

61
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:53,550
So

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,479
I'll just buy that. Oh, and now I need this storage for all my resistors.

63
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:01,464
But yeah, I have so many electronic components. No, it's, it's lovely.

64
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,104
Yeah.

65
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:02,985
Anyway,

66
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:05,145
what are we talking about today?

67
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:09,065
That leads the story segue into uh emergency data requests, which

68
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:14,414
I love this like was actually not only was it done on the TV show Mr robot

69
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:16,815
but like the way it was done on the TV show Mr robot

70
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:20,104
is he literally Googles like how to do an emergency data request?

71
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:20,985
And then does that

72
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:21,835
hold on

73
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:26,024
-- back
-- up to the beginning and explain what this story is?

74
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:26,625
OK.

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,720
So the idea is typically when you request information from a company,

76
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,160
you need some sort of like

77
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:36,020
legal document that says you can do that otherwise it's, you know, it's basically,

78
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,679
hey, Josh, can you tell me your PIN number?

79
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,820
And you're like, no,

80
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,160
and especially for law enforcement, there's typically, you know,

81
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,720
some checks and balances because the power of the state is,

82
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,320
well, it's, it's all powerful basically compared to an individual.

83
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:50,259
And so the idea is you're supposed to have a warrant or something.

84
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,800
But having said that of course, there are,

85
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:57,440
um, well, in legal terms, one of them would be, you know, exigent circumstances,

86
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,919
you know, like you're in hot pursuit or something.

87
00:03:59,169 --> 00:03:59,869
And so

88
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,710
there's this idea that you can have an emergency data across like, oh, you know,

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,350
we don't have time to get a warrant because for example, you know, Bob just phoned sue

90
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,210
and now sue phoned 911 saying Bob wants to hurt himself planning to, you know,

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,789
self harm.

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,669
And so sue is like, worried for 911 and of course, 911 is like,

93
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:20,178
we don't know where the hell Bob is, but Bob's cell phone company knows where Bob is.

94
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,549
So we can ask the cell phone company and be like, where the heck is Bob?

95
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,350
We need to know right away. We don't have time for a warrant.

96
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,429
It's a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

97
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,600
And of course, that completely lends itself to,

98
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,160
well, social engineering.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,119
Right. Right. Exactly.

100
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,700
Especially because there's, there's no framework for this.

101
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,019
I've always wondered that, you know, when the police say, you know,

102
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,489
if a policeman pulls you over and you don't feel safe, you know,

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,399
you can check their warrant card or their, their badge and I'm like,

104
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,920
I don't know what that looks like.

105
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,779
That's right. You know,

106
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,019
and now in fairness what you can do is call 911 or whatever,

107
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,290
your local emergency number is like 110 or

108
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:54,459
999.

109
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,829
And that works because obviously, you know,

110
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,380
that dispatcher should be able to tell pretty quickly that, oh, yeah,

111
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,329
you're actually being pulled over by a cop.

112
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,579
So, like, do what they say or, yeah, we have no record of this going on.

113
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
We're sending a real cop,

114
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:07,660
you know.

115
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,170
Well, that's happened locally.

116
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:12,549
There's been a couple cases of people were being pulled over on

117
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,839
the freeway by somebody who turned out not to be a cop.

118
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,679
Right. Right. Right.

119
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:20,399
-- So hackers are
-- so it's a great way to social engineering

120
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,679
using social engineering

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,799
to abuse this system.

122
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,980
Well, and not even good social enduring,

123
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:28,410
like they're just sending an email saying I

124
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,989
want this information and they're getting it.

125
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,059
-- Right.
-- Right. Well, because

126
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,579
most companies

127
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,869
are set up to efficiently respond to law enforcement requests and not

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,989
ask too many questions because that usually just gets you into trouble.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,720
Well, somebody also pointed out if you kind of stall on each of these requests,

130
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,209
eventually, a real one's going to come in,

131
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,260
somebody's gonna get hurt and there's going to be a lot of bad press about it.

132
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,350
That's probably true

133
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,140
versus you just kind of give away people's information. Yeah.

134
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:56,190
Some of them will complain. But

135
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:59,799
does the, does the press really care about privacy stories anymore?

136
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:05,649
-- Yeah, that like that shit burnt down with Facebook about 10 years ago. So,
-- anyway.

137
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,350
Ok, so we understand this.

138
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,619
And now you said Mr Robot did this now, kind of an fy I, for anyone listening,

139
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,989
I've never seen an episode of Mr Robot and

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,739
everyone keeps saying you need to watch a show,

141
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,670
you'd absolutely love it.

142
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,519
And I feel like at this point I would

143
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,510
doing a disservice to the universe by actually watching it.

144
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:22,609
Like,

145
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,779
well, so like what I love is

146
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,399
and I hadn't really thought about this because I'm a Canadian.

147
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,769
But in the US, there's something like 18,000 policing agencies because you have,

148
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,670
um, you know, you know, federal and, and the thing is the US, of course,

149
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,019
-- never has one federal police force you have,
-- of course,

150
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,929
and then there's

151
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,880
state level

152
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,209
and there's so many states

153
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,420
50.

154
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,660
-- Yeah.
-- Plus

155
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,690
Puerto Rico and Guam and a bunch of other protectorates or whatever.

156
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:52,390
That's a good

157
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,690
point.

158
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,239
And I,

159
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,019
I would hope that they have police probably, then there's

160
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,329
the next level down is my understanding would be county.

161
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,500
That's correct,

162
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,369
followed by municipal.

163
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,970
Uh and you can probably go even deeper than that because like, for example,

164
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,079
when I was at university,

165
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:13,350
the university was in a city and the city had their own police department.

166
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,250
And then the university also had a police

167
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,540
department and the campus police were actually like,

168
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,890
deputized by the city.

169
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,774
So they can like, legally arrest people and stuff like that.

170
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,855
Well, and we're also going to ignore things like, you know,

171
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:26,554
the Department of Treasury or the Department of

172
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,875
Education having their own quasi police forces or,

173
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:32,695
-- you know, the postal inspector,
-- actually I found out the other day on Reddit,

174
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,695
the United States Postal Service has a police force.

175
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:36,570
Yeah,

176
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,309
of course it is.

177
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:39,970
Dude.

178
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,269
-- Have you looked at their powers?
-- The Postal Service police.

179
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:48,500
I was actually a long time involved in somebody did some mail fraud,

180
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,179
Uh retrospect to an organization I worked for.

181
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,029
And

182
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,029
that was a mistake because

183
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,549
mail fraud in the US is like, oh,

184
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:57,890
like it's worse than

185
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,470
it's a worse basically.

186
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,829
Anything you do with the US. Postal Service is an automatic federal crime,

187
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:04,420
right?

188
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,019
You rob a post office, bam. It's a federal crime

189
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,160
like you done screwed up, son.

190
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:14,859
And so anything with mail fraud is almost always also across state lines.

191
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,850
Uh That's probably true.

192
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:17,850
Yeah, you just,

193
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,209
you just made a big whoopsy and they came down on this guy like

194
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,380
a sack of hammers and he went to jail for a long time.

195
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
But I digress.

196
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,329
So,

197
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,640
but so part of the challenge like I live in Canada

198
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,920
and we have a federal police force basically the RC MP.

199
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,530
And then

200
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,859
we have a couple of provinces with provincial police forces, you know,

201
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,179
like the OPP or the Sirte

202
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,960
to Quebec. But like Alberta doesn't have one. BC doesn't have one.

203
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,919
And then we have municipal police forces like

204
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,929
Edmonton Police service or Calgary Police Service.

205
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,469
Right.

206
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,599
Well, that's it.

207
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:51,909
I, I've stopped because that's it because for example, like a smaller town like

208
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,590
Luc or, you know, the province of BC or, well, the province of Alberta

209
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,280
essentially outsources their policing at that level to the RC MP.

210
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,340
I mean, that feels app for,

211
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,150
to me

212
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,599
it is. Right. And so,

213
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,330
you know, if you get pulled over, like, in the Duke or whatever,

214
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,799
it's going to be an RCMP and,

215
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,010
yeah. Oh, and well, ok.

216
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,539
Also that technically now we have Alberta Sheriffs as well as a

217
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,799
new thing in Alberta and they kind of do freeways and whatever,

218
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:16,369
blah, blah, blah.

219
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,380
But the point is like the, the number of police forces we have in Alberta,

220
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,469
I think I could count on two hands

221
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,619
roughly like we basically have over four or

222
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,640
five municipal police forces in the RS MP.

223
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,090
But in Dunk, that's it. And the Alberta Sheriffs.

224
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,739
So it's,

225
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,460
and, you know, it's easy to kind of track them down.

226
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:38,210
There's not a lot of weird domain names.

227
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,559
For example, you know, the city of Edmonton,

228
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:44,409
Edmonton dot C A links to the EPS website very clearly.

229
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,190
And for example,

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,750
I was looking at where you live trying to find the official website

231
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,690
for the police force of where you live and I can't find it.

232
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,609
I found their Facebook page,

233
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:55,500
like their Facebook page comes up right away, but there's not a link to their

234
00:09:56,109 --> 00:10:00,489
like they, they literally say email us at what? At mail.de

235
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:04,369
pair.org, what the heck is de pair.org? That's not even your government website.

236
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:08,830
It might not be. I have no idea. Anyway. So I, I, for the people listening,

237
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,049
you're, you're pronouncing it wrong

238
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,289
because this is America. So we don't pronounce French things correctly.

239
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,000
So, while the city was named by the French in the 16 hundreds

240
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,640
and it is spelled de space P er E and a

241
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,809
French person would call it de Pair because it's the father,

242
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,830
obviously,

243
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,489
how else did you say it?

244
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,219
We call it deep here, deeper,

245
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,770
-- deep here,
-- deep here. Like,

246
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:35,770
like

247
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:36,755
it's

248
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:36,924
a

249
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:38,414
all right, there's,

250
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:42,085
there's a tweet I saw the other day that basically said

251
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:46,094
anything with a French name in the Midwest of the United

252
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,724
States is pronounced in the most unf French way possible.

253
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,284
And that sums it up.

254
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:56,460
I won't even get into some of the other French named things around me

255
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,679
because it is as atrocious as you can imagine. Now, to answer your question though,

256
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,880
I live in what is functionally a suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin Green Bay being a

257
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,390
reasonably sized city. My city is very small.

258
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,020
We technically have a police force but we lean on Green Bay

259
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,919
in the county to do most of the heavy lifting for us.

260
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,750
And so that's why like we don't really have a website because the

261
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,340
county and the city of Green Bay are doing all of the work.

262
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,330
-- Anyway. Well, there is a sub
-- page on the De

263
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:27,659
Pair

264
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,010
W

265
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,619
i.gov. You're still pronouncing it wrong,

266
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,799
which is actually where de pair.org redirects to. So that's nice.

267
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,059
But

268
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,469
anyway,

269
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,090
so that

270
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:36,400
the thing,

271
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:37,309
right? Like how,

272
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,510
like if I'm in Canada and I get a request from, like, you know, the RC MP,

273
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,380
it's going to come from the RC MP domain, which is pretty clear.

274
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,099
Sure.

275
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,739
You know, same thing for any municipal police force. There's not a ton of them.

276
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,419
And of course,

277
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,210
well,

278
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,219
there's not a lot of provincial police forces in Canada, it's again, single digits,

279
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:58,969
you know, so it's not hard to kind of put that in a spreadsheet and, you know,

280
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,390
collect it as time goes on.

281
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,659
Right.

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,750
But the US having, what is it? 18,000

283
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:05,890
state

284
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,929
county and sheriffs and,

285
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,349
and of course, there's no like actual sort of national accreditation type deal.

286
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,979
Like there's no central authority

287
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,700
and, and even in the United States

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,140
municipalities make up their own domain names and use them.

289
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,929
So if I registered, you know, city name, police.org

290
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,270
and started sending email requests and put up a website that looked plausible.

291
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,349
I'm pretty sure most companies that received

292
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,169
these emergency requests would just be like,

293
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,070
yep, looks legit

294
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,049
or you just do an off by one or like a two eyes or something.

295
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,429
That's true too.

296
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,830
Like, like, because I've also lived in Germany and in Germany, you have the,

297
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,869
you know, you have the, um, well, you have the German police.

298
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,950
That's it. Like there's the German police,

299
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,260
whether they should surprise anybody, I guess.

300
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,179
What's the point of this conversation? Other than just,

301
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,820
there's no way to secure this?

302
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,380
No, there really isn't

303
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,219
right there. Like,

304
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,380
I know we need police department NFTS.

305
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,690
-- That would almost certainly solve this problem.
-- But how do you validate that?

306
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:11,750
Basically.

307
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:12,530
How do you do

308
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,580
KYC, How do you do know your customer?

309
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,780
-- How do you do know your customer with this thing?
-- Right?

310
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,770
You don't

311
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:18,580
it?

312
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,580
I mean, look, so this is one of those examples I think and,

313
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,500
and the intended purpose of this discussion which

314
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:29,103
we're now what like 15 minutes into with no conclusion

315
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,703
is anytime you hear

316
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:35,932
anybody, especially like the FBI talking about, oh,

317
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:39,903
the back door will be safe because only we will have access to it. Like

318
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:43,302
this is the reality of that statement.

319
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:47,002
Yes. Only law enforcement agencies will have access to it.

320
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:51,255
-- And law enforcement agencies include clever people with domain names
-- or

321
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,216
people who get elected sheriff in some little podunk place.

322
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:57,536
You get that too. Yes, that's another one in the United States.

323
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,145
We elect our sheriffs in certain locales.

324
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:03,335
So you could literally like, I have zero law enforcement experience.

325
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:06,116
I could run for sheriff and be elected.

326
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:09,656
Like what? Actually in my city we don't do that. But there are places that do.

327
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,056
One thing. I didn't realize is

328
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,400
like,

329
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,260
again,

330
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,200
we have standards around policing

331
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,299
and education requirements and training requirements

332
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,200
and

333
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,020
it,

334
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:24,929
I did not realize in the US that there are states and counties that

335
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,979
they don't have that. Like, you can be elected sheriff and, and you could hire me.

336
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,840
That's terrifying. I,

337
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,380
you know.

338
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:32,830
Yes,

339
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:33,419
it is.

340
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,039
And

341
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:34,780
it,

342
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,219
it works exactly the way you think it does in your mind right now.

343
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,919
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. That

344
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:44,000
anyway,

345
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:44,770
so,

346
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,739
so,

347
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:50,030
and what's fascinating to me is that people think this can somehow be fixed.

348
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,809
Uh It, it probably can't be

349
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,359
because here's the thing, even if you had some sort of certificate authority,

350
00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:00,869
central authority that vetted and did KYC on all of these and actually,

351
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,619
you know, kept up to date records and blah, blah, blah,

352
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:04,969
I mean,

353
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:10,000
18,000 departments, times how many people in each department need access to this is

354
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,919
that's a lot of people to bribe

355
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,070
potentially

356
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,010
like it just,

357
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,450
you know, I always love these companies are like we want to keep this data secure,

358
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,570
but we also need to give it to everybody in sales.

359
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,619
And I'm like, well,

360
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,750
um,

361
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,619
uh, I

362
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,400
got some bad news for you,

363
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,440
you know.

364
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,059
Yeah, pretty much.

365
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:32,919
Yeah.

366
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:38,020
Look, we all know what the answer is gonna be, right. Sales wins that every time

367
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,780
it, it, look, I think

368
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:44,460
this is a really good example of

369
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,020
we exist in this space

370
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:48,469
right now

371
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,570
of we're kind of teetering on the brink of the old way and the new way,

372
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,109
right where there is, everything's becoming digitized.

373
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,510
We need to find ways to work together. We need

374
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,760
-- things like authentication is a huge deal.
-- Everything was digitized.

375
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,359
-- Well,
-- no, no, it's becoming more so than it's ever been. It's too late. It is too late.

376
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,280
But I'm saying

377
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,580
there,

378
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:14,669
the solutions to these problems don't yet exist and it's nothing we have to do.

379
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,130
So anyone talking about like

380
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,919
NFTS or a single sign on or zero trust or certificates or P GP or whatever,

381
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,830
no,

382
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,609
none of that crap solves these problems. This is a new paradigm

383
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,630
in technology that we don't yet understand.

384
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,369
And obviously as these things tend to go,

385
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,219
the bad guys are years ahead of us.

386
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,750
Well, they don't have to play by the rules. That's literally kind of their stick.

387
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,210
Right. Right. You know, like you can set up rules. Well, a perfect example. Right.

388
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:47,900
Every time.

389
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,280
Like, how many people have you heard?

390
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,010
Oh, that's not supposed to happen.

391
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,570
I say that every day, all day.

392
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,130
-- Yeah.
-- No, it's not supposed to happen.

393
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,025
But you didn't build the, the system took physically, technically, whatever,

394
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,604
actually prevent that happening.

395
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:02,184
So it did.

396
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,505
That's what Attackers do.

397
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:08,265
You know, I, I love, well, the R Street Institute, you know, with the whole,

398
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,625
you can make actual good legislation.

399
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,915
But yeah, if you have a room full of, you know,

400
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:16,233
lawyers earning a couple of grand an hour, they're going to come up with something,

401
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:16,645
you know,

402
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:19,665
or these tax avoidance strategies. Right. It's,

403
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:20,223
yeah,

404
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:22,530
I mean,

405
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,390
and it's just way too

406
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,140
easy. Well, and here's the other thing that gets me is

407
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,449
if the attacker fails, there's no repercussion.

408
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:39,719
Right. There's not like, like, let me put it this way. If you rob a bank and fail,

409
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,640
you're probably going to jail for a while.

410
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:43,180
Right.

411
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,209
Whereas if you send an email from some similar domain

412
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,400
and try to get some information and they go like,

413
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:48,829
ha ha

414
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
you're a bad guy. We're not going to give you that information.

415
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,680
Well, yeah, they're also not gonna like chase you down.

416
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,060
Right. Right.

417
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,160
And track you down online and arrest you

418
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:58,859
assuming they could even find you,

419
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,780
assuming you're even in a jurisdiction that you know,

420
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,180
has an extradition treaty with the US.

421
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:06,770
So

422
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,500
yeah, I mean,

423
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,550
and that's what gets me with all this

424
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,550
online scamming and like text phishing and blah,

425
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,390
blah, blah is that

426
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,790
there's no downside like it's like trying doorknobs on cars and being like,

427
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,939
oh, you know, I was not doing anything officer

428
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:24,790
actually, you know what you just reminded me of, have you seen the uh like

429
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,869
the the browser in browser phishing

430
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,550
demo that, that people have given lately? Like that's brilliant.

431
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,930
So, I mean,

432
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,760
basically what it comes down to is normally like

433
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,489
you'd hit the log in with Google button,

434
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:35,869
right?

435
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,030
And then it pops up a little Google window and you click the Oh yes, please log me in

436
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,359
and then it goes back to the original site and you're logged in because the, the oo

437
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,420
magic happened behind the scenes.

438
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,479
And

439
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,540
what and of course, when you do that you can see in the browser window that Oh yes, the,

440
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,579
the location bar says google.com.

441
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:55,239
So I know it's like the bad guy.

442
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,209
Well, it's, I don't think it's bad guys even I think it's just the demo at this point.

443
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,010
But basically

444
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,670
they pop up a browser window that says log in with Google

445
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,839
except everything is being rendered in the browser window using CS

446
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,454
S. So you're not logging into Google,

447
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:12,854
you're still on the original website that just makes it look like you're

448
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:16,364
logging into Google and the location bar looks right and all the,

449
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,244
the little check boxes and lock symbols and all that

450
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,805
all check out.

451
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,064
So when you click log in with Google, it's going to say,

452
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:27,765
oh type your user name and password in which is not uncommon that happens

453
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:31,724
except now you're typing your user name and password in into the bad guys website.

454
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,819
What's fascinating to me is about is two things about

455
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:37,060
this number one is that this was predicted years ago.

456
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:40,339
And actually there was a, a test thing in windows where they would actually

457
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:44,300
like you would choose sort of a theme or like a wallpaper type deal

458
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,060
that it would

459
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:49,530
put around actual real system windows.

460
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,500
So you would know if it was a real system window or like or like a faked one like this.

461
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,000
And you could also,

462
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,979
I guess do this within a web browser kind of

463
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,170
-- maybe sort of anyways point is doesn't matter
-- well.

464
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,489
And this is why windows made you press control alt

465
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:03,619
delete to log in

466
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,560
because a

467
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,979
malicious application could not capture that keystroke,

468
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,380
like only the operating system could capture control alt delete.

469
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,729
This is one of the reasons we're getting UB keys deployed across the CS A because it

470
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:18,459
takes the meat bag out of the question of making this kind of mistake

471
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,079
to put it simply,

472
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,050
right? Because it's part of the authentication chain.

473
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,369
Yeah. Right. Right. Now, it should be noted that

474
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:25,670
UI

475
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,609
key is do the web

476
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,439
a authentication, which is where the URL

477
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,209
in the location bar is part of the

478
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,550
like magic token that's sent into the UI

479
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,189
key.

480
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,469
And obviously that can't be spoofed

481
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,430
in that regard

482
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:41,800
it,

483
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:42,160
part of that

484
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,949
initial set up when you actually assign a key for that site and everything.

485
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,770
So it's like locked to it.

486
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,229
And

487
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,170
this is why like having passwords at all is is becoming dumb.

488
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,390
Whereas just literally like having a UB key and maybe

489
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,900
sending an email is vastly superior to having someone type in

490
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,160
-- a,
-- it's actually worse than dumb because if you do passwords properly,

491
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,869
by definition, you have to have a unique, strong password for each site.

492
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,369
Yeah, we can't do that. We're humans

493
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,089
unless there's some sort of, you know, Savant with an identic memory.

494
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,729
You have to use a password manager.

495
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,680
And here's the thing, if you have to use a password manager, now,

496
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,550
you're at the point of,

497
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,170
well, why not just use like a software authentication token?

498
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:28,359
-- I mean,
-- I agree. And that's functionally what a password manager has become.

499
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,229
Right. That's what it is.

500
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,719
Now, on the downside, you do have the,

501
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:37,109
the issue of if someone steals your master password, you're pretty hosed.

502
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,170
Which

503
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,089
is

504
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,550
again, if you have a, a software authentication token, it's the same problem.

505
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:47,780
Well, but the beauty is that, that master password, for example, again,

506
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,050
we're rolling out UB keys.

507
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,760
Right. Right. Yeah, for this exact reason.

508
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,500
Right. Like,

509
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,199
and now granted I get that because it's managed, you know,

510
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:59,750
Bob can lose his key and that's ok as an individual.

511
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,839
It's tougher because,

512
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:03,619
well, how do you then do recovery securely?

513
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,150
And that becomes the whole can of worms that the Attackers exploit and blah, blah,

514
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,319
blah.

515
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,579
Right. Because, like, no offense.

516
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,709
But why would I break into your account when I can just do an account recovery

517
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,119
and

518
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,829
the account recovery reset the phone number to, you know,

519
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,949
because that's happened with banks where people like to reset their

520
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,920
phone number and do account recovery at the same time.

521
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,530
And I love how the banks are like, well, we're not supposed to do it that way,

522
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,630
but your money's gone too bad.

523
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,829
You know. You know, my favorite thing about the bank is always, is so

524
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,170
when I go in

525
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,750
to get into my safe deposit box, which I do like, once or twice a year,

526
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,930
I have to, they used to just check your ID and then let you in.

527
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,890
Now I have to type in my, my safe deposit box pin

528
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,170
-- except I have no idea what it is. I never, I never remember.
-- See

529
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,920
-- here
-- we just

530
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,089
all the banks that you just basically

531
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:46,119
put your debit card in pin number and they're like, hey Mr Siefried.

532
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,800
Yeah, but that's the thing. It's not my right. It's not my debit pin.

533
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,060
So I I try my pin like 10 times and it doesn't work.

534
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,650
I don't know what it does and they're like, well,

535
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,209
I have to reset that for you here type a new pin in

536
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:04,140
and I'm like, what is the point of even having me do this step? Like this is absurd.

537
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,969
This is why I ended up keying my parents' cab or no,

538
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:09,459
I was going to keep my parents' cabin to the same key as my O key.

539
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,609
So I just didn't have to bring

540
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,329
I didn't have to remember to bring a key

541
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:13,670
Ive,

542
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,209
Ive. Alright. Anyway, anyway. Ok,

543
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:16,750
I

544
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,260
I want, I want to, but before we run out of time

545
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,540
I want to move us over to this crazy Z

546
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,390
live issue

547
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:27,510
that just got a, it is 2022

548
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:34,869
and the CBE is CBE dash 2018-25 032,

549
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,969
which people are looking at and saying

550
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,390
what the F is going on

551
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:40,469
with this issue.

552
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:44,459
-- So we're gonna tell you
-- apparently the deal was that

553
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,500
this was

554
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:49,619
identified as a security fix back in 2018 and fixed in

555
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:50,969
zip back in

556
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,140
2018.

557
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,609
And because it did not get a CV identifier or, you know,

558
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:59,650
strongly identified as a security fix, everybody's like, cool.

559
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,729
-- Yeah, great.
-- Well, it, it wasn't strongly identified. It was called a crash

560
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:05,880
and

561
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,619
-- no one seemed to care.
-- Well, and that's the thing, right? Like there's a be jillion

562
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,180
security bugs that start as a crash and then somebody has to look a lot deeper.

563
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:15,589
In some cases.

564
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,479
You don't have to look that deep, but in some cases you have to look really deep.

565
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,869
Every crash in Z

566
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,859
lib is a security issue like

567
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,969
that is, that is all I'm, I'm going to stand behind that statement.

568
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,660
Well, I would say, yeah, things like Zed Lib or lip J peg,

569
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,729
things like that must eat any data.

570
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,939
Yeah. No, I agree.

571
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:40,329
Now, funny enough, this is a bug when you're encoding data, not decoding data,

572
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,780
which makes it extra hilarious because it's like, wait,

573
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,560
what I remember reading Tavis email and I was like, hold on a second

574
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,060
and I read it three times because I'm like, I can't be reading this correctly.

575
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,260
How do you trigger

576
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:55,839
this kind of bug encoding data? And then I thought about it for a while.

577
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,459
I'm like, OK, I kind of get it. But anyway,

578
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,150
why, let me, let me start at the beginning.

579
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:07,109
Why does this have a 2018 CV E ID when we are sitting in the year 2020 two?

580
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,160
So the theory behind CV, identifier, the year in it

581
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,510
is that you use the year

582
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,219
that that issue was

583
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,780
known as a security issue. So uh as a simplistic example,

584
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:20,939
if somebody

585
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:25,869
commits a fix to code that says this fixes a security bug in the year 2018

586
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,530
and

587
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:27,849
it gets CV

588
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:27,979
at

589
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,709
some point in the future, it gets a 2018.

590
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:33,829
Now, if you have like a very subtle flaw that's fixed

591
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,310
and then for whatever reason, somebody goes back and looks at old commands and goes,

592
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,760
oh, you know, this is actually turns out to be a security issue

593
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,969
that would be like

594
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,780
when the person did that research and found out later,

595
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:50,579
whatever year that is in the future would be the year that they use.

596
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:51,839
But more to the point,

597
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,739
it just doesn't really matter that much.

598
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,880
It, it shouldn't matter.

599
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,520
-- But
-- it's, it's basically, and the problem is people expect it to behave that way.

600
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,270
So, OK, we do it that way. But

601
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,810
in some cases, I mean,

602
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:08,969
I've seen long discussions and arguments about what year to use on a CV,

603
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,410
where it's like, does it really, like,

604
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,719
shouldn't we just get more of these out of the door quicker?

605
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:16,319
-- I mean,
-- well, ok, look, here's the problem. I see.

606
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,390
And in fact, there was a tweet where, uh, uh, Dan Lawrence,

607
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,869
who we had on the show a long time ago, he basically was like,

608
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
what the heck is going on here?

609
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,589
And he kind of, he,

610
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,270
he detangled it and he wrote a Twitter thread and he added us at one point.

611
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,770
But anyway, the point is

612
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,250
like, the security people don't even totally understand what's going on here.

613
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,660
And fundamentally,

614
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,790
we exist in a place now where when you look at the year in an security identifier,

615
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:44,560
you make the assumption rightly. So that, that is the year something was actually

616
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,660
assigned

617
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:47,010
and became a thing.

618
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:54,439
So when I see a 2018 CV ID, I assume the CV E was assigned in 2018, not in 2022.

619
00:26:55,285 --> 00:27:00,905
Now, what's happening is people are seeing this assigned 2018 ID and they're like,

620
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:01,704
oh, my goodness,

621
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:04,025
it's been four years. Why didn't you fix this?

622
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,885
And it's like, because it's been out for four freaking days,

623
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:09,994
like I'm getting there and obviously updating Z

624
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,344
live is nontrivial

625
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,510
and you've got to jump through all the hoops.

626
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,890
And I would actually argue that there's an actual, much worse,

627
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,349
more subtle problem to this,

628
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:19,439
which is

629
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,910
CV goes by that everything must be completely 100%

630
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,319
basically proven to be a security flaw before we'll go to CV.

631
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,589
And that's not how the world works and,

632
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,630
and actually hasn't for 20 years and especially not now.

633
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:33,829
And what,

634
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,709
and this is one of the things global security database

635
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,040
is doing is we're looking at not so much,

636
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,660
just 100% provable vulnerabilities, but this is security

637
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:43,589
related.

638
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,760
This is security information and we're gonna

639
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,699
take stuff that is like a vulnerability

640
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,280
as a vulnerability so that you can ignore kind of all the maybes.

641
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,699
But the point is there's, well a perfect example of this like,

642
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,699
yeah, like you said, every time there's a crash in Zed

643
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:56,209
Lib, yeah,

644
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,069
probably somebody with a security background should take a peek at that,

645
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,130
but it should automatically get an identifier.

646
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:05,410
It should automatically get an identifier,

647
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,760
an investigation and further processing

648
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,189
because like it said, Lib, man, like here's the reality.

649
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,709
It's like the, it's,

650
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,319
it's basically like log for shell, it's everywhere and it's a pain to update.

651
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,369
So it's not going to get updated unless

652
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:22,339
there's a screaming good reason to do it.

653
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:25,510
That's right. That's right. Right. And that's the thing because

654
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,819
let's be real.

655
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,630
So if all this stuff was easy and fast to update

656
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,420
security would be trivial because it would just be run current,

657
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,949
which is impractical.

658
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,810
And even though we,

659
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,229
we, we constantly go back and forth on this topic but

660
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,630
it

661
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,229
-- is impractical.
-- Yeah. Like in my perfect spherical cow world

662
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,780
run current. Perfect. But, like,

663
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,729
my smoke alarm needs to function.

664
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:52,000
And it, well, and the other thing too is I don't want my smoke alarm getting like,

665
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,400
a software update every day because at some point it's probably gonna break

666
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,729
because even if the chance of breaking is one in a million.

667
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:57,839
Yeah.

668
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,859
Or those poor people who bought that stupid Wi Fi barbecue

669
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,660
and every time they try to barbecue something,

670
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,599
it has like 10 or 15 minutes of updates to run before they let them barbecue.

671
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,670
Oh, that's exciting. It was on Twitter, man. It is brutal.

672
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:14,109
But yeah, like, I don't want my software constantly being updated on my light bulbs.

673
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,959
I just want my light bulbs to turn off and on.

674
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:19,640
That's right. So, anyway, anyway, the point is this is why

675
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,359
this stupid issue has a 2018

676
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,839
CV E ID

677
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:24,959
because

678
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:29,660
it is a relic of the past that is still being clung to.

679
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,420
So if you care, come and help us at Global Security database.org,

680
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,219
I think that's right.

681
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,939
I'll put a link on

682
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,280
it.

683
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:37,319
Uh

684
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,260
