Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siegfried

1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,770
and my partner in using open source. Josh

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,390
Reser.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:12,930
Uh

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,029
I do use open

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,390
source. We all do. That's

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,640
true.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,809
Well, it's,

8
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,500
I mean, I, I use it, use it. So,

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:19,659
no,

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,739
no, I

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,680
have, I have a good example of this. So Anor

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,450
has two open source projects called Sifting Gripe. Right? Sift is the

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,219
bomb scanner. Gripe is a vulnerability scanner and

14
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,549
I run Fedora on my laptop.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,669
Like we are literally recording this show with me running Fedora on my laptop.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,790
And basically all, almost all of these shows have been recorded on Fedora on my side.

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,599
Many of them have been edited on Fedora.

18
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:44,819
Well, squad caster does the recording not.

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,080
You're making it sound like the local thing is recording it.

20
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,020
-- Look,
-- Kurt

21
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:49,119
getting Linux

22
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,830
to work in like any capacity is a feat.

23
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:52,520
So don't,

24
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,409
don't degrade my effort.

25
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:57,090
I used to spend two weeks every summer forcing

26
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,450
myself to like run whatever version of Fedora Linux,

27
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,009
whatever

28
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,360
and getting everything set up. And then at some point, I like

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,629
I ran Linux on my desktop for kind of the first

30
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,919
five years because it was actually better than windows and stuff.

31
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,730
But then windows caught up and I gave up, I'll be blunt

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,089
lies.

33
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,760
I've given up

34
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:14,730
anyway. So sift and gripe,

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,139
they do containery

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,470
things right where they interact with Docker and they pull

37
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,980
containers from registries and all this and I run Fedora.

38
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,419
So I thought I'm going

39
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,599
to build

40
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:24,819
and test

41
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,279
these applications on Fedora because Fedora has pod man and pod man is weird.

42
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,269
Pod man is

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,279
I call it uh like containers with hard mode enabled

44
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,230
because everything almost works but not quite. And

45
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,519
I have learned

46
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,160
an amazing amount

47
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,139
about the internals of these two applications because of open source.

48
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,059
-- And
-- well,

49
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:47,569
I always love like when you have an incumbent player like Docker and

50
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,080
then you have like a second tier kind of player like pod man.

51
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:51,699
And it's like

52
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,800
they kind of do the same thing but they kind of don't. And

53
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:55,860
yeah,

54
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,680
you very rapidly learn about what assumptions were made

55
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,269
by people that may or may not be sane.

56
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,519
That's right.

57
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:07,239
And my favorite example is still everyone's like, oh pod man doesn't have a demon

58
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,160
and it's like, yes it does. The demons called system.

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,399
I

60
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:10,559
was

61
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,240
like

62
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:12,289
you,

63
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,539
yeah. Anyway,

64
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:14,949
anyway,

65
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,660
basically you have to run system D and CD now or you can't do anything.

66
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,949
-- System D
-- is the biggest demon of them. All. We're not talking about system D.

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,309
Today we're going to talk about open source is

68
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,179
unfair and we're going to base this entire discussion

69
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,979
off of something Microsoft just did.

70
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,940
I will let you do the honors of telling us all what they've done.

71
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,339
-- So,
-- Microsoft ships,

72
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,990
Windows and Windows has an App Store and the app

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
store is generally what you would expect it to be.

74
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,020
It's

75
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,059
apps, games,

76
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,710
stuff like that, Fortnite, whatever,

77
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,789
but that has changed a bit in that Windows now has the

78
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,589
Windows subsystem for Linux now up to version two and it's,

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,470
it's really good. Like you run

80
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,059
an X program and it just pops up in sound and everything works. It's magic.

81
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,740
You have this Windows subsystem for Linux.

82
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,470
Ok, cool. Like I want to run well, Linux and stuff on top of it.

83
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,729
Where do I get my Linux thrown on top of it? Well,

84
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,229
you get it from the Windows store.

85
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,029
Now there is free stuff in there like ubuntu and whatnot.

86
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:06,020
But

87
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,699
like the last time I looked, I was looking for,

88
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,720
I think a cent toss just this was like ages ago back when I was, I think still at Red Hat

89
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,639
and there was a cent toss for like 100

90
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:15,539
and over $100.

91
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,690
And now if I quickly look like there's a Fedora remix for WSL for 1279 there's

92
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,410
um there's an X server for like $63.99

93
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,059
and some other stuff. But,

94
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,419
and the point is so there's these open source apps

95
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:30,979
that

96
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,429
they haven't

97
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,289
really done anything to it.

98
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,089
Like, they, it's not like they took a library and built an app around it,

99
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,910
you know,

100
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,750
or they basically just, like, got Fedora running

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,669
and then

102
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,100
sold, you know, packaged it in for 1279 or 100 bucks or whatever.

103
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,550
And so what Microsoft did is, and I think, because this is like,

104
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,679
because when I was looking through the app store,

105
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,059
I'm a reasonably sophisticated user and I know how this stuff works.

106
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,199
And I know my Linux distro

107
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,970
and even I had a hard time finding a good one that wasn't like

108
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,139
going to charge me an arm and a leg and do stupid stuff.

109
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,539
And so Microsoft kind of went well,

110
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,279
if you're just sort of like taking an open source app or operating system and just

111
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,770
kind of making it work and shipping it and charging a lot of money for that,

112
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,720
that's not a great experience and it kind of tricks the

113
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,919
user and they're not going to be super happy about this,

114
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:15,630
especially when they find out that it's free.

115
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,059
Like there are free versions.

116
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:18,820
And so they,

117
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,220
they basically said we're going to get rid of

118
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,480
these sort of low value open source apps.

119
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,859
And personally

120
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,660
I'm ok with that because like, it, it would have reduced the crap clutter in the,

121
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,500
in their store.

122
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,290
Well,

123
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,809
-- yes,
-- but because the problem is like, previously, well, it's not as bad now.

124
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,130
They definitely got rid of some stuff.

125
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,200
But, like, it used to be, if you searched for ubuntu,

126
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,980
it was kind of tricky to find the real ubuntu.

127
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,859
You know,

128
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,010
there's like some keyword stuffing and stuff going on.

129
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,929
Um, oh, well, yeah, there's still this thing called tunu.com and it's apps,

130
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,899
news and weather.

131
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:51,940
Um, or there's, you know.

132
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,209
Yeah.

133
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,279
But it looks like now

134
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,420
ubuntu actually pulls up just real

135
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,429
-- Ubuntu.
-- Well, and that's good and, and this is a

136
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:03,769
difficulty and they also put in their rule that

137
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,019
you can't

138
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,220
charge an abnormally large amount

139
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,339
for, I think just things in general, not necessarily open source,

140
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,329
which is funny because I actually remember paying like 500

141
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,809
bucks for an ex server back in the day.

142
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,170
So to me, I'm like, that's, that's a difference.

143
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,519
But,

144
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,730
and we've seen the same thing in the apple

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:21,970
app.

146
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:23,484
Remember early on

147
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,274
where that guy made that app that was called 999 and

148
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,295
it cost $999 and it displayed 999 and it was like

149
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:31,244
basically an expensive pet rock.

150
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:32,774
And again, it was to show you our, we,

151
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:38,045
well, to show that you were, you know, willing to spend 999 wealthy and dumb.

152
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:39,420
I

153
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,940
do like the guy that made the app where it timed how long you

154
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,779
threw your phone up in the air and the app store banned it.

155
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,850
-- Oh, that was epic. I remember that one.
-- I was, I was like,

156
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:48,070
uh

157
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:49,660
yeah, that was so good.

158
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,299
We've talked about this in the past, you know, with the apple walled garden.

159
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:55,100
But part of the expectation is if I'm going to a place with walled garden,

160
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,510
I don't want there to be weird mosquitoes and snakes and stuff.

161
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,380
I want to go see some nice flowers

162
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:00,160
and,

163
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,339
and this is

164
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,899
like, I want some degree of curation and I don't want to get mugged.

165
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,220
All right. All right.

166
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,200
Your explanation was very long, but I want to just sum it all up with this.

167
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,559
The people republishing open source applications in the

168
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,269
Windows store are technically doing nothing wrong.

169
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,010
And that is just the honest to God's truth of it all.

170
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,399
Like this is one of the places I think where open source is very unfair.

171
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,279
Where

172
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,850
if you're an open source developer, someone can totally take all of your work,

173
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,739
they can repackage it, they can claim they wrote it

174
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,010
and they can sell it

175
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,010
and that's not against the rules. It's unethical but it is not illegal or

176
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:41,529
technically wrong.

177
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,049
Like with the majority of widely accepted

178
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,614
open source licenses. Yeah, that's

179
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:46,625
that happens.

180
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:50,575
And I mean, they, they can easily comply with the license by like, oh yeah, you know,

181
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:50,915
if you,

182
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,765
if you search in the basement for the filing cabinet behind the sign that says,

183
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:57,415
but where the jaguar, yes, we left the BS D notice in there that says,

184
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,125
who actually built this, you know, but good luck finding it.

185
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:02,815
Right. Right. Exactly. Well, in most,

186
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:06,135
I shouldn't say most many companies now

187
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,239
are only allowing like MIT style and Apache

188
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,029
two style licenses which have no advertising clause.

189
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,109
And so you can literally take what someone has done

190
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,709
and pretend it's yours and

191
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,670
that's it like you're done.

192
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,380
I find the experience of the Microsoft and Apple app stores.

193
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,010
Uh, I don't use Google so I don't know what the Google Play Store is like,

194
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,190
but I assume it's roughly the same.

195
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:29,100
I find it

196
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,290
very hit and miss in the sense of like, there's the big apps

197
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,970
that are kind of like, OK, like, you know, if you want to do linkedin,

198
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,109
you get the linkedin app or reddit, the Reddit app, they're, you know,

199
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,010
they're terrible but whatever, they're free and, you know,

200
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,109
they're trying to monetize you.

201
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,470
It's, and then when you start looking for sort of specialty apps, things

202
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:47,684
-- very rapidly go sideways in a lot of cases.
-- Absolutely. Actually,

203
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,125
I just had this on Apple.

204
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,545
I was looking for a nice SSH client for my phone

205
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,915
just so I could like SSH into and reboot a machine.

206
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,595
I bought 30 of them. They're all flaming garbage.

207
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:03,119
I tried a bunch and I just gave up because I was like, whatever because it was funny, I,

208
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,670
the reason I did this is I have uh the computer that runs my TV,

209
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,299
was acting up and I, I just needed the Sschn and reboot it every now and then.

210
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,559
And I was tired of like walking upstairs to the computer to reboot it.

211
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,339
I was like, I'll just put something on my phone.

212
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,549
I would have just set a Cron

213
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,140
-- job at 3 a.m.
-- That is exactly what happened.

214
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,559
Actually, I shouldn't say that. What, what I did do.

215
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,640
I, I run Flex and I had a TV tuner plugged into it

216
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,420
and the TV tuner was flaking out.

217
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:34,010
And then I bought an HD home run device which is a box,

218
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,520
you plug into your network and then it does like weird magic like TCP TV or something.

219
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,549
And that is flawless and now I haven't had to reboot it since.

220
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,380
-- But anyway, anyway, but open
-- SSH or sorry, not open SSH.

221
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,130
Apps on the App store are a great example because

222
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,390
I tried to write an article about this probably about eight

223
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,780
or nine years ago and I bought and downloaded all of

224
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,950
them like there was about 20 or 30 at the time

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,219
and I was going, you know, I had my checklist, like, can you import a key to it?

226
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,719
Can you generate a key in it? Can you export the key from it?

227
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,739
Can it, does it show you the, the,

228
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,669
the key signatures and stuff? Right? And they were all, they all had deficiencies

229
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:10,979
essentially in sort of basic SSH usage.

230
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,659
And then I tried to track down the publishers.

231
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,630
Yeah, that did not go well.

232
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,409
Right. Like this one publisher linked to a web page.

233
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,940
They'd also done like a little card game,

234
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:20,750
you know, I've,

235
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,750
I've run into the same thing with the crypto wallets where I'm

236
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,450
trying to track down these crypto wallets who built them some.

237
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,729
It's easy.

238
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,059
Like Coinbase, crypto wallet was done by Coinbase and they sort of stand behind it.

239
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,960
Cool. And then this other one is like a collective of two guys in the, I

240
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,659
think they're in the Bahamas. I'm not entirely sure.

241
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,219
But, you know, it's just, it's like, it's just crazy stuff and,

242
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,559
and so

243
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,159
I look at the experience of just trying to find a reputable app and,

244
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,880
and even if I'm willing to pay money for it,

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,719
it's just, it's pretty horrible. And so,

246
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,219
yeah, getting rid of these kind of obvious scams, would

247
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,140
it basically, it'd be like cleaning dog poop off the sidewalk.

248
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,609
Like it's, it's not great,

249
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,750
but it's better than having dog poop all over the sidewalk.

250
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:01,270
Well, except

251
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,580
the dog poop looks like the sidewalk

252
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,229
and

253
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,940
you can't tell

254
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:07,900
it

255
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,070
the app store problem I think is something very different and very hard.

256
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,880
And I don't want to dwell on that today and I know we're going to keep coming back to it.

257
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,150
There's no escaping it, but

258
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:18,750
I, I'm more interested in this, this whole, like,

259
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:22,619
what is ok and not ok and open source because

260
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,780
like, here's, here's my example.

261
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,460
So

262
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:31,049
let's say you wrote some application, Kurt and you put it out as,

263
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,559
as an Apache two license and I take it and I package it and I sell it on the App store,

264
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,559
right?

265
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:39,289
That seems totally bogus and unfair.

266
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,770
And now if you take the same app and you put it on the App store,

267
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:45,250
right? I could charge more than you.

268
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:46,809
But still, you know what I mean?

269
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,450
-- This is one of those angles of open source that I just like, well,
-- we've,

270
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,739
we've seen this happen

271
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,859
in the security world with N

272
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,530
map with Nessus, right? Like

273
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,969
Renaud wrote Nessus Great Tool

274
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,840
and

275
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,679
a ton of consulting firms used it to make a ton

276
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,599
of money and he saw exactly $0 no bug reports,

277
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:06,690
no bug submissions.

278
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,599
And so they went with this really crazy

279
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,280
license where it's like it's still open source.

280
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,500
But if you do the plugins

281
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,159
and you want to distribute the plugins or whatever,

282
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,239
you have to buy a license or you have it, it's complicated.

283
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,630
I, I it's been a while, you know, same thing with N map.

284
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,280
They kind of like lock down their data set

285
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,219
and you know what?

286
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,340
Yeah, I don't blame them because they pour their hearts into those tools

287
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,000
and

288
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,169
like they need to eat.

289
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,780
And I think part of it is

290
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,309
in the short term, it'll work. But in the long term,

291
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,739
ironically, if the,

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,270
if the shyster

293
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,609
is successful,

294
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,869
it's kind of almost more likely to kill off the original thing.

295
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,979
Now, you can't do that with, like, Fedora or Ubuntu.

296
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,650
-- I,
-- I, I don't, I don't know if I agree with that.

297
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,530
Well, no, I mean, it's, if, if,

298
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,080
if somebody sees their work being monetized and they're getting exactly $0 from it,

299
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,650
I feel like they're more likely to kind of like, just give up.

300
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,099
Oh, I, I think that'll happen a lot.

301
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,630
I think we're seeing some of that in open source now. I mean, Tide Lift did

302
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
a survey maybe a year ago

303
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,159
where like half of open

304
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,729
source developers are basically, like at their wits end.

305
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:09,109
-- Yeah,
-- I experience existential dread on a daily basis and want to die.

306
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:10,630
No,

307
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,859
that's, that's not open

308
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,260
source,

309
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,109
that's not open

310
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,950
source's fault.

311
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,229
It's, well,

312
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,539
you know what it reminds me of is eternal September.

313
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,679
I, I, I've seen people sort of saying,

314
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,309
like these companies and stuff don't know how to use open source correctly, like,

315
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,070
in the sense of they're not nice and polite about it.

316
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,409
And it's like, yeah, they're not gonna be because they don't have to be.

317
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,489
And, and I agree with that. I think that's,

318
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,640
that's a topic I think about a lot because

319
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,549
I feel like there is

320
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,940
the kind of a couple of camps I see in

321
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,900
the open source world where there's one camp that's like,

322
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,830
yeah, open source one, it's everywhere, everyone's using it.

323
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,770
Good job, everybody

324
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,809
and there's another camp that says, wait a minute.

325
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,890
So everyone's using this stuff, they're not giving back.

326
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,539
-- They're getting mad when it breaks. Well,
-- not even,

327
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,030
they're making new demands.

328
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,650
Yeah. Right. Right. That too.

329
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,049
The classic thing being, can you fill out our questionnaire for security?

330
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh,

331
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:03,260
well, ok. Look, those are funny when they show up but they are not common.

332
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,219
I want to be clear like they happen but it's not like you're getting 10 of them a day.

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,739
But if you look at like a lot of github

334
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,280
-- issues, there's a lot of people demanding features or demanding things
-- that,

335
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,130
that.

336
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,210
So it's funny that actually just happened,

337
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,460
I think with it was gripe the other day where someone was like,

338
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:23,599
oh we would like a Phipps 1 40-2 compiled version of gripe.

339
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:24,450
What?

340
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,859
Well, my response is basically patch is welcome.

341
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,940
Like if you want this, you're going to have to do it because like we're done,

342
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,179
that is a bit more work than maybe they think it is.

343
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,979
I don't know.

344
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,299
And that's one thing that always gets me too is some of it is

345
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,510
I don't think a lot of these people are like malicious and like,

346
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,539
oh

347
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,039
ha ha ha

348
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,479
I will,

349
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,010
the open

350
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,979
source developers,

351
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,830
I think they honestly are just like, yeah, come on, how hard can this be?

352
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Like I bought this commercial tool that does it. Why can't you do it?

353
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,640
But there are sometimes adding these features or capabilities are like

354
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,299
an obscene amount of work.

355
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:55,830
Uh

356
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,380
Phipps is a big deal, especially Gripe is written in,

357
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,549
go in getting anything and go to build

358
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,070
as a Phipps 1 40-2. Just, just using Phipps 1 40-2. Crypto

359
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,400
is a huge deal. Redhead actually made it really easy, it looks like,

360
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12,289
but you have to, it, you,

361
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,460
you're building like a Frank and Go application

362
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,869
at that point because it's calling into red hats

363
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:21,280
PS 1 40-2 open SSL instead of putting it all in the GOBI.

364
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,859
So now you can only run it on the Red Hat system and it's, it is what it is.

365
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,299
But anyway, anyway, like here's the deal, right? So

366
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,570
I'm a project,

367
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,950
I get these requests

368
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:33,640
and I can of course say no, it's very frustrating.

369
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,799
But it's again, like it comes back to that like open source isn't fair

370
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,140
because there's nothing stopping people from making these silly requests.

371
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,130
There's nothing stopping people from profiting from

372
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:46,580
it and like sort of hijacking it and you know, being more popular,

373
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,919
which we've also seen happen.

374
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,710
And it's like,

375
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah, like,

376
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,630
because some people are just better at seo like search engine optimization than,

377
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,919
you know, the original developer.

378
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,520
And, and that's, and again, it's just, it's really unfair, but it's also like, well,

379
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,119
that's just kind of how it is.

380
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,039
Does that my suspicion is that is exceedingly rare

381
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,179
that that happens I think if you have

382
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,390
a moderately successful and popular open source package,

383
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,630
forking, it

384
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:16,479
-- almost never works.
-- There's, I, I, there's been a,

385
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,400
there was some articles

386
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,859
of successful forks, I can probably count on one hand.

387
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,270
Well, and there was also, you know,

388
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,799
there's the use cases where people are kind of forking it to add it

389
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,340
to their resume to make it look like they did it things like that,

390
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:28,700
you know,

391
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,830
-- And again,
-- that would be

392
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:37,000
impressive, impressively dodgy. I would, I would love to see someone CV with that.

393
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,409
Let me put it this way. I've seen people's github

394
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,500
repos where it's like,

395
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,299
like the level of your issue comments versus the level of your code.

396
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,429
These are two like,

397
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,409
you know,

398
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,210
you,

399
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:49,489
you hire somebody with a phd to write your essay about the Korean War or whatever,

400
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:49,849
you know.

401
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,000
Um, but again, and, and this is fair or not fair, this is

402
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,359
allowed, but is it fair? Is it ethical?

403
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,700
Is it moral, is it, you know, is it, and part of it too, is it sort of,

404
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,619
does it add to the sustainability?

405
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,849
And does it, does it make it a better place or is it just they're kind of littering?

406
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:11,520
Well, ok, look, this is a topic. I was curious if we would get to

407
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,520
and we did, where you asked, what does it add to the sustainability?

408
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,140
And I think if you look at

409
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:17,929
just capitalist

410
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,190
society

411
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:22,090
and this is not, I, I love capitalism. Right.

412
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't want to go on anyone think I'm

413
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,880
like some socialist or communist with this rant.

414
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,059
Oh, dude, I've read, like,

415
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,340
I've studied the economic history of Russia and it's like, nope, I do not want that.

416
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,340
That is not communism though. That is cronyism. But that's another story.

417
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:38,010
-- It's
-- not as ugly anyway, it's like democracy. It's terrible.

418
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,619
-- But it's the least worst thing we've kind of discovered.
-- I agree.

419
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:41,929
Right. So anyway,

420
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:46,130
history has shown us that corporate corporations

421
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,320
will never do the right thing.

422
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,130
And I'm using air quotes when I say, right, unless forced to.

423
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,929
And so saying, I expect companies to pay for open source,

424
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,969
I expect companies to contribute back to open source

425
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:59,070
saying I expect companies to be good citizens in the

426
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,469
open source world is almost certainly never going to

427
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,429
happen unless they are somehow forced to do it.

428
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,199
It's like saying I expect them to, you know, be environmentally conscious and,

429
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,439
you know, socially responsible.

430
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,209
-- Like, no,
-- don't pollute.

431
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,598
I mean, there are companies will literally move states and countries

432
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,848
so they can pollute like

433
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,829
it is,

434
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,880
they, they do what is cheapest

435
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:23,130
and right now strip mining open source for most of them is exceedingly cheap.

436
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,800
Well, also more to the point,

437
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,089
there's no other option

438
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:29,428
like if you need to put something together that has a web server,

439
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,149
a web server is now so complex

440
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:32,979
that

441
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,859
you can't write it. Like, like lib curl

442
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:36,869
is a great example.

443
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:43,298
There are how many hundreds of people, years of knowledge and work into a uh a

444
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,828
lib curl into a web client basically.

445
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,630
And to replicate even 10% of the functionality would be

446
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,930
tens of years

447
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,239
-- of work.
-- A competent human could probably write

448
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,270
a very simplistic http library

449
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,790
in a week. But

450
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:03,280
there are literally millions of corner cases. The corner cases

451
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,349
are what curl does exceedingly well.

452
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,180
But that's like, you know, I mean, that's like saying I could,

453
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,939
I could build a basic functioning car in a week

454
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,020
and you could, but it would probably kill you the week after.

455
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:15,750
Yeah,

456
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,260
I just,

457
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,599
I keep coming back to the fact that there is no other option for these companies,

458
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,099
like software is so complex nowadays

459
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:23,969
that

460
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,530
you can't, you just,

461
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,260
you can't. And then also

462
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:31,060
they're already stuck here like they're already in it.

463
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:33,219
It's not like they're coming in fresh.

464
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,319
No, no, they're already all here using open source

465
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,979
and there's no way out. And so how, how do we encourage them?

466
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:45,729
Maybe instead of um trying for the panacea of like, oh,

467
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,849
they'll be good citizens and contribute back and stuff,

468
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,650
but at least get them to stop littering and stop kind of, you know,

469
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:53,489
crushing the hopes and dreams of open source debs.

470
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,449
And I'm just, I, I don't think this issue can really be solved.

471
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,709
I maybe maybe I,

472
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:02,319
I think about this a lot because part of my job is to think about stuff like this.

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,770
But

474
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,239
I think

475
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,439
this is

476
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,349
we are thinking about the problem and trying to address it in

477
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,050
the incorrect way because we see people strip mining open source.

478
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,780
We see people using open source and not giving back. We see people

479
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,640
like stealing but not really because it's technically legal stealing open source

480
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:20,729
and,

481
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,459
and trying to sell it to someone else.

482
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,540
And so our obsession is focusing on

483
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,250
the unethical consumption of open source. And I don't think that's

484
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,979
the place to focus on because I don't think it works. It's kind of like

485
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,280
imagine telling a company

486
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,239
you're polluting into this park, like you need to make the park nicer

487
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,410
and they're gonna be like, great,

488
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,979
just we'll put the pipe up the other end of the factory

489
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,300
and then the park is fine, right? Because there's,

490
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,400
I think this is where

491
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,209
some of the government regulation around

492
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,369
like keeping track of the software you have

493
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,920
and having certain standards around like vulnerabilities where I think if,

494
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,880
if organizations are forced to say, create

495
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,910
bombs and keep track of them, if organizations are forced to

496
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,329
have vulnerability reports and keep track of them,

497
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,550
that changes some of the incentives.

498
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,719
Now, I think because like,

499
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,750
if I have an S bomb and I have to give an S bomb to you when I sell the software

500
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,880
and I have to give you the vulnerability report or you

501
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,829
just create your own because you have the S bomb.

502
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,319
Now we have different incentives because if I'm looking,

503
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,829
it's kind of like if I sell a car

504
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,890
it's going to have a safety rating and if it does a safety rating of zero,

505
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,949
I'm gonna be like, I don't know about that. You know, and I think some of this, like s

506
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,209
mom and vulnerability and these efforts,

507
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,380
they're not there yet,

508
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,079
but I think they're approaching that like

509
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:41,390
safety rating type territory where the incentive isn't

510
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,459
to be a good steward of open source.

511
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:50,680
The incentive is if I don't take care of my house, I can't sell on this other side.

512
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,500
Well, part of that requires mature consumption, right?

513
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,400
Like car safety is a good example.

514
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:57,040
And to be clear, I don't,

515
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,829
I, I want companies to consume open source

516
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,020
and I want open source to be healthy enough that a lot of companies

517
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,520
can consume it without giving back because

518
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,979
I don't want people reinventing the wheel.

519
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,819
I don't want people running their own web servers.

520
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,819
Like I've, I've seen what happens when that happens. It's not good

521
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:14,040
-- like,
-- well, and, and I don't, I don't think they ever will.

522
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,079
I think fundamentally most corporations are consuming open source as

523
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,729
part

524
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,119
of a larger thing, right?

525
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,319
Where they're building product, they're building services.

526
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:23,430
Well,

527
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,959
it's like I want there to be this kind of common knowledge base that

528
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,630
you can just use for free and get a certain level of standard,

529
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,550
like everybody should know at this point that if you're building a car,

530
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,439
three point seatbelts and airbags, like, even I know that I'm not a car engineer.

531
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:38,609
You know, there's this basic level of knowledge that you don't even have to pay for.

532
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:42,199
It's just, it's common, it's best practices, it's whatever you want to call it.

533
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,900
And I want there to be more of that so that we can level up the whole industry because,

534
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,479
like, I look at IOT

535
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,050
and there's absolutely no way I want them running anything but Linux

536
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,030
-- because anything else is, is terrible.
-- That's not true.

537
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,510
The James Lowe Space telescope is running the X works.

538
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,069
-- Yeah. Good luck connecting to that thing and attacking it.
-- That is true.

539
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,349
I wonder what the security VX works looks like on, on earth.

540
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,140
Yeah. So more to the point, I want my light bulbs to be cheap and functional.

541
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,180
I don't want

542
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:14,989
a James Webb level quality of light bulb. I want a light bulb that costs five bucks.

543
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,839
-- That's true. As opposed to a what 9 billion dollar
-- light bulb.

544
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,939
It's tough. I mean, I,

545
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,459
I don't know what the answer.

546
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,880
And part of me also wonders though,

547
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,760
is it maybe not as bad as we think it is because for all we know,

548
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,290
like 20% of open source is now being funded indirectly by people who

549
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,239
have jobs at these companies who are doing it on the side.

550
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:37,540
No, no, it's not.

551
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:40,689
And we, well, maybe we don't, we don't know. You made that number up.

552
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,439
I think one of the important numbers though is like I looked at all that

553
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:48,239
data and half of the popular N PM packages and half of the popular Python packages

554
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,150
are

555
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:50,780
one when maintained

556
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,089
and so a lot of them are individual and some people are

557
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,859
perfectly happy just doing it on the weekend and they don't care.

558
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,750
Some people are annoyed, everyone's taking their stuff and profiting from it.

559
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,109
There's,

560
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,900
it's the gamut and I think,

561
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:06,959
I mean, this is a trap we fall into all the time. We literally fallen into it right now.

562
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,180
It's like open source isn't a thing.

563
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,540
Open source is a million things that we put into the same bucket.

564
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,949
Well, we can't even agree on what an open

565
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,910
source license is.

566
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:17,270
Uh, no, we can.

567
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,089
An open source license is a

568
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,170
license approved by the O si

569
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,800
that is the literal definition of open source.

570
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,130
You don't have to agree with it, but it is the literal definition.

571
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,869
I would and I would argue that that is

572
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,719
incomplete because there's a whole pile of licenses that are

573
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,130
open source that they don't cover and so on and so forth. Right. Yes.

574
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,060
Yes.

575
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:38,319
And I would also argue the vast majority

576
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,699
of open source licenses today are woefully outdated

577
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,160
compared to society. Uh Bruce

578
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:44,800
Perens has,

579
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,800
I know we've talked about this before Bruce has a really nice

580
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,089
talk where he kind of goes into a lot of this stuff.

581
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,260
Well, I mean, nobody could have imagined the services stuff 20 years ago

582
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,520
-- to the degree it is now,
-- or even just open source being used

583
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:57,099
20 years ago.

584
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,900
If I would have told you literally,

585
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,219
every software product on the planet will contain open source in 20 years.

586
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:02,930
I would have been, like,

587
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,800
no way. Like that's ridiculous. Never happened.

588
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,239
And, oh,

589
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,270
-- look,
-- but economically companies love free stuff. Yeah.

590
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,550
Right. Oh, absolutely.

591
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,209
Well,

592
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,890
it's funny you say that they used to claim open source didn't work.

593
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,709
I mean, the, the,

594
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:21,739
the beginnings of the software composition analysis products

595
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,819
were based around like this concept of like

596
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,510
you have to find the open source because your developers are trying to sneak it in.

597
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,380
Right? And it was all about control and then it turned into.

598
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,750
-- But
-- then what happened is they figured out what it would cost to replace that open

599
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,300
-- with written stuff and, and the answer is you can't do that.
-- Right. Right.

600
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,020
And so then it turned into, OK, so you have open

601
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,880
source, but you need to know what it is

602
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,530
and then it turned into, oh, that GP L license,

603
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,219
you got to watch out for that because if you ship

604
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:48,979
something with GP L now you have to open source,

605
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,319
your entire application

606
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:50,979
and

607
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,219
it's complicated,

608
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:55,819
you can engineer around that and companies often do.

609
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,819
There's many ways around it. Right. Right. And,

610
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,430
and, well, it's actually funny too because there's, there's this perception

611
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,060
that if you release a product with GP L in it, you have to open it.

612
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,349
It's like, no, you don't like if it's an accident,

613
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,260
there are accommodations for that, you just replace it and move on.

614
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,209
That's another story.

615
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,859
But anyway, the point is that

616
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,819
if we look at this whole environment kind of what's going on

617
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:21,770
there,

618
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,670
there's everything from people being paid to

619
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,310
work on open source by their companies.

620
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,260
There's people doing it for free that are happy to do it for free.

621
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,469
There's people who are doing it for free that are annoyed that someone's taking it.

622
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,770
There's no easy answer.

623
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:36,290
There's no one thing to say is right or wrong. And, and I think

624
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,650
this is part of why open source is unfair.

625
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,369
Like it's unfair that some people get to work on their project

626
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,170
as their job and others don't right. It's unfair

627
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,130
that a company can take my work

628
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,589
and not even acknowledge it's being done.

629
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,589
Well, part of it though is they kind of have to at some point do that because

630
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,310
there's so much

631
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,109
knowledge and information going into a modern product.

632
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,589
I can't acknowledge every single like, oh, you know,

633
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,060
this person came up with this idea 20 years ago that we're now leveraging,

634
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,109
I mean with,

635
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,930
with software,

636
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:11,560
at least there is that sort of attribution piece that is possible because like,

637
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,349
I don't know,

638
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,410
like who decided to make tables?

639
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,160
Like, at some point,

640
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,260
somebody decided to make a table and it was a good idea as it turns out,

641
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,260
you know, so if I, if I make tables and ship them, I'm not going to be like, you know,

642
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,650
hey, this caveman og came up with this great idea.

643
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,660
We call tables and, you know, we should give him credit for it. Right.

644
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,760
The wheel, let's use the wheel.

645
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,459
A table is just

646
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,489
-- a rock. Like at least a wheel required some
-- invention

647
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,130
or something like, you know, a steel belted radio wheel.

648
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,729
Like, hey, let's make this thing out of rubber with steel belts in it.

649
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:43,770
So it's durable and doesn't blow up and like takes a beating.

650
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,859
That's a great idea. Like I, I don't know

651
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,329
that I'm not even talking about that though, Kurt,

652
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm talking about there are open source projects that like run the world,

653
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,170
right? Like

654
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:57,839
there are things in N PM. Everyone depends on. Look for Jay

655
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,099
uh log

656
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,390
for J is a great example. Log

657
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,680
for J was a couple of people kind of doing it on the side

658
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,329
and it turned out everyone was using it.

659
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:09,170
And when there was a problem with it, everyone lost their minds.

660
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,530
-- Like
-- good old Jasper Lib J peg, right?

661
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,719
The guy wrote it as a thesis defense and because it was open source and it

662
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,250
could turn a string of data into a Jpeg on your screen.

663
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,170
Everybody used it.

664
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,859
That to me is part of the beauty of open source. Like now

665
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,900
how many thousands or tens of thousands of people, years of effort did that library?

666
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,260
-- That one library safe?
-- Oh, it's, it's astronomical without question.

667
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:33,739
But,

668
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,849
but now we get to the question of companies aren't necessarily tracking this stuff.

669
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,979
Companies sometimes don't know what they're doing.

670
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,489
And so again,

671
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,319
we kind of come back to the unfair that they're profiting off of

672
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,869
work others have done and they don't even know they're profiting off,

673
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,199
profiting off work others have done.

674
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,569
Well, I, that's part of the supply chain and value add.

675
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,530
Like I, I consume this widget in a way that I get to,

676
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,780
you know, like buy me, there's a washer and a dryer.

677
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,640
The guy who made the screws is important,

678
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,359
but

679
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm sorry, you make screws, you're not, we're not gonna pay you $7 a screw

680
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,030
unless it's for the James Webb telescope.

681
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,729
That's a good question. I wonder how much they pay for a screw,

682
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,819
probably pretty expensive being that they're made out

683
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:17,050
of like titanium or some exotic craziness.

684
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,569
Right. Well, and the tolerances are probably ridiculous. But,

685
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,949
but no, and, and I think your point is valid because there are open source libraries

686
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,979
that are

687
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,329
simplistic like, like what's the, the left path? Right?

688
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,439
That was a very simple library and the

689
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:35,020
developer obviously got angry about something and deleted it

690
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,689
and it's a library that you could reproduce in a couple of minutes if you needed it.

691
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:39,250
And so

692
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,339
like, that's an example.

693
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,520
Even though it was in every project, no one's gonna be like, oh, this,

694
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,050
this library is critical, we're going to pay millions of dollars for this library,

695
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,329
right?

696
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,250
Like that's very different versus saying

697
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,939
the Linux kernel is critical and we literally need this to

698
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:55,619
be like rock solid and spot on all the time.

699
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,489
More to the point.

700
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,219
I keep coming back to uh it's a bad analogy, but it's,

701
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:02,079
it reminds me of copyright in that people are like, oh, we need copyright.

702
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,180
So artists will do work. And I'm like, no, we don't

703
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,199
cave paintings. There's my counter

704
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,660
argument.

705
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,380
No, no.

706
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,060
It always astounds me that there's like people who

707
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:14,209
work in the food services industry because when you learn

708
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,160
the hours they work and the pay they make. It's like,

709
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,140
-- why would you
-- do that?

710
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:20,650
I, I agree. I

711
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,619
think about that all the time. Why do people start restaurants?

712
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,130
Like you start prep, work at 10 in the morning and you're there till midnight.

713
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,319
I know,

714
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,699
I know, man, I know

715
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,369
what

716
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:34,150
you know,

717
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,069
and but these people have this like deep seated

718
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,310
urge or voice in their head that they need to,

719
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,910
they need to bake or they need to make paintings so they need to play music or sing

720
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,750
or like in your case, in my case, we, we do a podcast. Like we don't, like,

721
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:51,000
-- we rant about things on the internet,
-- you know, it's, and,

722
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,739
and what gets me is there's this really deep

723
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,339
seated need for people to create and express themselves.

724
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,219
And open source is one of those ways, like, how many people have written,

725
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:01,489
you know, like little scratch my h open source projects that then, you know,

726
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,910
turn into, oh, my God.

727
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,290
Like

728
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,520
now, well, likely

729
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:05,000
Tovaz.

730
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,449
I, I can't afford UNIX. So. Huh, I'll just write my own.

731
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:09,339
Right. Right.

732
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,130
I mean, I remember those days when I didn't have any money, I was like, oh,

733
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,949
I'll just build something to do that for me.

734
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,939
Just go pay for the service for 10 bucks a month rather than in the past.

735
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,430
I would have written a couple of scripts to do it.

736
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,400
That's right. Exactly.

737
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:21,920
So, exactly that

738
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,910
it, it, I think

739
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:26,089
it won't die,

740
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,449
but at the same time

741
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,410
the benefit is so massive. Like

742
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,579
I can't even fathom a world where everybody would have to write their own web server.

743
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,969
Like we, it would set the industry back 20 years.

744
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,680
-- I, I,
-- it, it, it, you don't have to because it's never going to happen.

745
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:44,829
I mean, that's the reality of it. Like we, we have these things, we have open source.

746
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,000
You are correct that

747
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,390
I think a lot of,

748
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,650
a lot of these single maintainer projects are

749
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,400
there because people want to be creative.

750
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,229
And so

751
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,880
as long as you don't like literally badger them to

752
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,500
death to the point that they want to quit,

753
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,000
they're going to keep doing it.

754
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,959
And, and I do think that's probably one of the issues is

755
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,369
you're going to see

756
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,500
somebody has something that becomes popular and then for some reason,

757
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,810
it starts getting attention

758
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:08,760
and

759
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:12,650
it's not out of the question that people will show up and create like github

760
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:15,000
issues making unreasonable requests.

761
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,310
And the problem is like, let's say 1% of people make unreasonable requests.

762
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:21,469
But if you have 10 million users,

763
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,209
that's a lot of freaking people now versus if you have 100 users, it's manageable.

764
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,010
Well, even just

765
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,239
like, even just the attention to read these issues and close them out.

766
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah.

767
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,079
And the other thing is it's not so much that they're willing,

768
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:35,420
it's not so much that they're making unreasonable requests.

769
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,500
It's that they're,

770
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,650
they're not willing to help or contribute or even

771
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,020
in many cases really speck out what they want.

772
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,510
They're like,

773
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,439
I want

774
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,000
X, well, what do you mean by X? And they're like, just make it,

775
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,319
you know, I think that's an unreasonable request. Well, that's what I'm saying.

776
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:50,869
Right? Is that

777
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,420
it's not even just that they're asking for something complicated in many cases,

778
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,819
they're not really asking a well formed question,

779
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:02,189
-- you know.
-- Well, and there's always that again, unreasonable request. Um

780
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,920
This is why I, one of the things I love is when

781
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,599
I'm part of like some working group or something.

782
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,369
And that's trying to solve a problem and there's always people that are like, oh,

783
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,400
we should do this

784
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,319
and I'll say

785
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:13,969
you should do that.

786
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,810
Like, if you want that done you need to go do it and they're like, oh, well,

787
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:18,810
I don't think we need to do it.

788
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:19,849
I'm, like, interesting.

789
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,630
So, it's ok if I do it,

790
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,390
but as soon as you have to do it now, it's not important.

791
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,780
Well, I think we all agree that putting a bell on the cat is a good idea.

792
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:30,140
Yeah.

793
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,760
Yeah. Anyway, I mean, I'm gonna call this one man.

794
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,719
We've been, we're, we're over time but like

795
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:35,949
it's,

796
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,109
yeah, open source is unfair.

797
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:39,790
That's it.

798
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:40,670
What it is.

799
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,189
I kind of can't help but wonder are we gonna get to a situation where

800
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,390
more and more developers

801
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:49,939
hopefully, maybe realize I, because I think there is maybe a,

802
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,750
I don't want to say a third way out of this, but

803
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,349
I can imagine some developers just sort of

804
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,849
doing open source development in stealth, like the releasing it publicly

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,780
but, you know, ignoring the issues, ignoring, like, just

806
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,400
really kind of making themselves unavailable.

807
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,670
-- Like, I mean,
-- you can do that now and just don't read the issues.

808
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:08,719
Well, but I,

809
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:10,420
I feel like I think more and more are going

810
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,359
to consciously choose to do this to avoid these problems.

811
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:16,849
I, I don't think so. I think the, the social

812
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:19,260
the innate social desire of humans.

813
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,229
We want,

814
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,930
we want to know people are using our creations and we

815
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:25,319
want other people to come work with us on our creations.

816
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,589
And so I think the,

817
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,989
it, it again comes back to what you're saying. It's cave paintings.

818
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,420
It's not just cave paintings

819
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,420
because as soon as someone painted that,

820
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,079
what do you think?

821
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:37,630
The first thing they did was they went and got someone else to show them what they did.

822
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,160
And that's the second half of cave paintings. And anyway,

823
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,989
all right, that man, that's probably a show in itself

824
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,040
I think. Well, if there's one thing I can say is if you are doing open

825
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,989
sourcing your stress, maybe take a step back,

826
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:53,099
you know, take a breath, take a week off because

827
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,550
realistically the world's not gonna end.

828
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,349
Not, not because of you.

829
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,880
And I, I just, so many

830
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,189
other things I feel like a lot of people get caught up in this, you know,

831
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,650
and it's sometimes you need to take a step back

832
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:07,089
because I like that happened with the DWF and, and,

833
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:10,000
and vulnerability ID assignments and stuff where I just,

834
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,958
I was like, you know what, I'm,

835
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:12,909
I'm,

836
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,800
-- I need to take a step back because this is taking up too much of my life.
-- Absolutely.

837
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,040
That's right. Take care of yourself folks. All right, I'm calling it.
