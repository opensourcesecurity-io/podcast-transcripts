Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,000
Episode 150 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,789
-- Josh Pressers. What's new
-- man?

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:18,629
-- Uh
-- Still enjoying the internet without ads for now,

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,319
right. That's exciting news, isn't

5
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:32,168
-- it?
-- Uh I did a, I did a quick set up Firefox and Firefox profiles don't work well.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,740
Like it's not like

7
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,240
chrome where you can, right click, see all your different profiles easily.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,650
Like there's probably some extension I need for Firefox, but it,

9
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,715
it's very frustrating that it doesn't natively do it very well.

10
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:43,145
Yeah.

11
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:46,974
There, there's an extension and I don't even, I still prefer the way chrome works,

12
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:47,205
but no,

13
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,314
I'm in the same boat as you as I am

14
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:54,555
now running Firefox for all of my personal web browsing.

15
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:58,174
And would you like to tell the universe why we are talking about this?

16
00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:00,314
-- So
-- apparently,

17
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:02,825
uh the nut and bolts of it are,

18
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:04,285
I'm going to give the technical bit first

19
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:05,904
and then we'll explain what that actually means.

20
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:06,184
So

21
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:11,250
there is a change coming to Google Chrome Manifest V three design, do

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,900
development blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah, blah.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,860
What it boils down to is they are making

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,419
the web request handler

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,699
observational instead of uh allowing it to actually do stuff.

26
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:31,260
So why do we care? Well,

27
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:36,519
web request uh handling allows you to do things like

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,319
lock it.

29
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:41,059
And so you can have an extension that has a list

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,029
of domains, URL S patterns, whatever

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,220
that it can block like ads.

32
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,860
And for all the people you know, like and don't get me wrong.

33
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,930
There's nothing wrong with like Pie Hole and DNS based ad blocking.

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,620
That absolutely works and will block a ton of ads.

35
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,239
But there's more and more sites that also serve ads from

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,769
their primary domain or from within their domain making it harder.

37
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:06,199
You, you just can't do DNS blocking without sacrificing the whole site.

38
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,029
And more to the point,

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,320
I just want to install an ad blocker that automatically

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,220
gets updated lists and I just don't have to see ads

41
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,970
and same thing for youtube. Right.

42
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,630
When I go to youtube on my tablets, man, it drives me nuts because I'm like, oh yeah,

43
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,279
there's ads,

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,360
you youtube feels worse than ever to me lately because

45
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,850
I will often watch youtube videos while I'm at the gym

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,070
and I feel like every 30 seconds there's an ad

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,729
and it's like I just freaking watched one of these.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,529
It's, it's not only that, ok. The ads at the beginning, I get it, the ads in the middle.

49
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,199
I hate that.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,089
But what's more annoying to me is that a lot of the ads I'm getting are quite

51
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,190
inappropriate

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,289
or especially on kids youtube.

53
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,210
Like, whoa. That, yeah.

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,830
Like, I keep getting ads for the Alberta government's opioid crisis stuff.

55
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,600
It's like a public message about opioid abuse and where you can go

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,960
some website to find out more. Which number one like? Ok.

57
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,089
Well, not really sure what I'm supposed to do with that. Number two.

58
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,809
This is an awkward conversation to be having with my young kids.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,770
You know, and it's kind of annoying, right?

60
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:08,089
Trying to explain drug abuse and everything to them, which I do plan to do.

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,000
But, you know, maybe

62
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,210
not when they're eight,

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,660
right?

64
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:15,720
You know, I'm not sure that that's quite, we need to do it this early.

65
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,820
Um And then plus, you know, both of them are just like, like the one guy just like,

66
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,990
skip a, skip, a skip a and he's like, poking away at it, like,

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,229
waiting for that button to, you know,

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,050
-- it's got like a five second counter or whatever
-- gives you something to do at least.

69
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,770
So, but I'll be blunt, like, I,

70
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,750
especially when I browse the web on my phone or my tablet now because I

71
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,710
don't have really good ad blocking there and I should probably set up Pie Hole.

72
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,789
But, oh man, I hate it. Like

73
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,770
mostly what I hate is how

74
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,369
slow the web pages are to load. Like cnn.com is especially terrible. Now with ads,

75
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:50,419
like, it takes a good 30 to 60 seconds for a page to

76
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,199
render on my phone or my tablet.

77
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,059
CNN has ads.

78
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:56,460
I, I do not know that

79
00:03:56,589 --> 00:04:01,229
I, I haven't looked at it without an ad blocker ever that I can think of.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,119
Oh, they have so many ads and they have like,

81
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,550
all that sponsored crap at the bottom where it's like quasi

82
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,669
official looking content. But

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,660
it's like this one simple stretch will, you know,

84
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,119
fix your back or find out how broccoli cured cancer,

85
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,589
you know, like literally like crap like that where it's like, yeah,

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,988
this is not II I don't want to see this.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,940
I don't want to go there.

88
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:21,970
Um

89
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:25,609
So well, so especially egregious about this chrome,

90
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:28,970
getting rid of the um the little hook that lets you do a blocking

91
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:32,369
is they're only getting rid of it in the sort of consumer facing version.

92
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,279
The enterprise version will still have this capability.

93
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,519
My suspicion for that is,

94
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,670
I bet a lot of those terrible

95
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,720
endpoint applications everyone installs use this functionality

96
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,440
to block malicious content.

97
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,250
Yes, absolutely. Well, for a white list and blacklist, right?

98
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,109
Because it used to be very easy to block web content.

99
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,640
You put a box in line with your network and it looked at all the http requests and

100
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,970
served like an error. If it saw one for something, it didn't like,

101
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,880
you know, like playboy.com or whatever. And now

102
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,660
all that stuff's ssl encrypted.

103
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,279
Right. So, you don't know what's going on anymore.

104
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,230
Well, unless you do deep packet inspection and stuff and that stuff's expensive.

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,850
Well, and you need to, they have backdoor certificates on clients and there's,

106
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,309
there's so much hassle there.

107
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,429
Just dumping something on the end point is magnitudes easier.

108
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:26,010
Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,750
It's not like some technical change that has to be made, you know, it's straight up.

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,970
Let's be real.

111
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,170
The majority of Google's revenue still comes from advertising, right.

112
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,190
They have tried

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,170
to break free of that trap, you know, like they've restructured the entire company,

114
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:42,269
right?

115
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,559
You have alphabet now with all the different subsidiaries

116
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:50,649
trying to make money. But like, what is it, like, 90% or at least 80% of their

117
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:58,049
-- core revenue is, is all ads?
-- I, I think it's more than 80%. It's a nontrivial amount.

118
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,100
And that's,

119
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,119
I mean, they, they put in their, their Wall Street statements,

120
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,369
their earning statements that ad blockers are a threat to the revenue model.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,299
I mean,

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,179
that

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,619
says it all.

124
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,100
Well, they absolutely are and like, I don't know if you've noticed,

125
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:18,700
but when you do a search on Google now, so let, let me do a search for, um,

126
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,140
I don't know, bug repellent.

127
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,540
Why not

128
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,559
summer's coming? It's

129
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,140
now. Well, what's interesting is the ads are no longer labeled as ads.

130
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:33,540
They used to the, the little green thing. It used to be a little green thing saying ad

131
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,559
now it's like black and it's much less.

132
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:41,559
Ok. It, yeah, it's, it's not as obvious, but yes,

133
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:45,790
they, they do at least still call things ads that are ads.

134
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,410
And I feel like there's more,

135
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,040
I used to feel like there was only one ad when I do a search and now I get like,

136
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,459
five or six often.

137
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,359
The, the first page of my browser is ads.

138
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,290
Yeah, exactly.

139
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:58,339
I've noticed that on mobile,

140
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,140
especially that when I try doing searches for certain things on mobile now it, it,

141
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:03,809
it doesn't work anymore because it's just ads.

142
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,410
All right.

143
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,769
So anyway, anyway, let's stop whinging about ads because we all hate them.

144
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,929
I, I don't know anyone who says, boy, I sure like mobile ads.

145
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:12,570
Yeah, they,

146
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,820
they don't exist and there's also questions

147
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,309
about whether these online ads even work,

148
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,369
but that's another story in itself.

149
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,029
And I guess here's the thing

150
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,850
that

151
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,299
I keep going back to on this topic

152
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,260
is Chrome is the dominant browser by quite a lot.

153
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,549
It's about 60 to 80% of the market most places now.

154
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,230
Right. Yes, it's, it's huge. It's a huge number.

155
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,600
And I feel like the reason they got there is they put

156
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:43,109
a lot of things before

157
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,549
the Google revenue model,

158
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,040
right? They pushed a lot of security features, they allowed plugins to happen.

159
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:54,390
They, they did all of this work, they made it fast, they did everything and in I,

160
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,070
-- I don't want to say they pulled the rug out from under us, but
-- it's, this

161
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,910
is classic bait and switch it.

162
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:03,429
-- How is this? Not classic bait and switch?
-- Right.

163
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,769
-- I have a feeling this wasn't the intent. I
-- don't think they planned it from day one.

164
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,130
Ok.

165
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes,

166
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,470
I think now it's pretty clear there's higher ups at Google saying you

167
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,630
can't do this because there's no technical reason to make this change.

168
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,429
There's no,

169
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,809
let me put it this way.

170
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:22,000
-- There's no benefit to anyone or anything for making this change. There's
-- some,

171
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,130
didn't they,

172
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,850
-- they made up some BS reason I think
-- exactly they made some claims about blah, blah,

173
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:28,209
blah.

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,410
But fundamentally, here's the thing.

175
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,030
Fundamentally so, OK, even if that's true,

176
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,049
then why is this still in the corporate version?

177
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,609
Because they're paying you money

178
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:41,908
and, and in fairness, I remember a time when you paid for a web browser,

179
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,799
like I remember when Netscape Navigator came in a box shrink wrapped with a CD,

180
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,369
it did a CD floppy disks.

181
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,109
-- Would
-- I pay?

182
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:55,129
Say, I don't know, 1020 bucks a year for a web browser that supports ad blocking.

183
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:58,419
I would strongly consider it. I don't think Google will give me that option though.

184
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:01,479
-- That's kind of what's really
-- annoying. They probably won't.

185
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,268
And that also puts you in a certain,

186
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,030
I guess

187
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,719
we say place in society,

188
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:12,090
-- there's tons of people that can't afford $20 a year for ad
-- blocking.

189
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:15,229
-- Well, more to the point. I go to a public terminal or something.
-- Right. Right.

190
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:18,909
And I already feel like we now have two internets

191
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:22,630
because when I use a computer without an ad blocker,

192
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,830
it's like what

193
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,869
this is, this place, this isn't the internet.

194
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,919
I don't even, it, the websites and everything are horrendous and

195
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,119
it's, I, I know these ad networks serve malware as well.

196
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,979
So, just from a security perspective,

197
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:41,140
the ad blockers have a huge advantage there ignoring the fact. I mean, there's,

198
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,070
I know there's lots of ethical ramifications and all of this.

199
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,510
-- Well,
-- no, I would actually,

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,169
I would strongly disagree with you because ethically speaking,

201
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,549
if a site wants to serve ads and require that you see the ads to see their content,

202
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,869
they can absolutely do that.

203
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,789
That's true.

204
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,010
And, and some do,

205
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,760
I've been to many sites now that say you appear to be running an ad blocker,

206
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,150
you know, blah, blah, blah, money, money, money,

207
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,659
please either turn it off or, or in some cases they just straight up,

208
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:06,510
don't let you see it

209
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,830
or in other cases. Uh, what is it like the Wall Street Journal now? You know, log in

210
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,479
and pay to see

211
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,710
the content, right.

212
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,119
So, my response is, well, no, I'm not going to, I'm just,

213
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,750
I'm not willing to give up certain levels of privacy and convenience.

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
So I can, you know, once a month, see an article at the Wall Street Journal.

215
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,070
Yeah, I'm, I'm comfortable with that.

216
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,250
I mean, I, I pay for my local newspaper because I want them to survive and I read

217
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,679
stories and they have one of those after the third story

218
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,890
and it annoys me because I'll forget to log in or something.

219
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,809
Like, oh, you've read your limited stories this month you can't read anymore

220
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,190
-- crap. Where's my password at?
-- So, I, I would point out that

221
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,929
it's, there's no requirement when I, like, when I request a web document from you,

222
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,469
there's no like legal requirement that I fully process it on my computer.

223
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,309
Like, what if I disable javascript? What if I have no script writing?

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,619
What if I have an old, what if I'm using E Links and I can't process javascript,

225
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:57,320
you know.

226
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,929
So my take on that is

227
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,650
no, there's no ethno ethical conundrum. It's straight up like you're a business.

228
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,510
And if you want to make certain requirements

229
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,280
for people to see or consume your content,

230
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:09,309
go ahead and do so.

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
Like you're absolutely

232
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,450
able to say no, you can't

233
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,010
see this without logging in and paying money, you can't see this without logging in.

234
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,809
You can't see this with an ad blocker running.

235
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,289
I'll, I'll, I'll let that go.

236
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:19,650
And I guess,

237
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:23,890
you know what I would compare it to is there are podcasts I listen to that have ads

238
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:24,890
and

239
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,869
I always fast forward through them

240
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,710
and I guess you can make the same argument. Am I stealing from them.

241
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:31,289
I,

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,739
I, I don't think so but I won't get into that.

243
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, I mean, there's one podcast I listen to and they have the same ad,

244
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:41,219
every single part and the ad totally doesn't

245
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,940
apply to me because I'm not doing a crypto

246
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,289
market.

247
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:49,289
Uh, I don't need to do, um, the, you know, the, the know, your customer and anti

248
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,739
money laundering stuff for a crypto exchange.

249
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,460
Ah, I got you. So, like, this ad really doesn't apply to me. Never will. Hopefully

250
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,869
so. Yeah, I mash, the, the, the skip forward 30 seconds a couple of times.

251
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,330
I don't feel terribly bad about it.

252
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,820
Yeah, that's fair. Ok. Ok.

253
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,669
Anyway, anyway, let's, let's move off of the ethical question of ads for a moment.

254
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,500
And

255
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:14,799
I guess

256
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,390
here is

257
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,190
the way I see this

258
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,059
kind of all wrapped up in, in a box is

259
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,799
Google has done something that

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,119
I don't like. You don't, like. Most people won't even know happened because

261
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,159
-- it makes the internet a worse place.
-- It does. But

262
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,559
I think they screwed this one up because I

263
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,369
think they did it while Firefox is still strong

264
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,289
and Firefox has been losing market share for a very long time.

265
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,710
And I think in a couple of years it's conceivable,

266
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:48,210
the Mozilla Foundation could find itself in is in trouble.

267
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:51,820
But everyone I know is running Firefox now.

268
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,859
Well, and I know they've done some, uh, so Mozilla gets

269
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,559
my understanding is they get most of their funding from Google

270
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,900
by making it the default search provider and so on.

271
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,900
I don't know, they switched to Yahoo or Microsoft at one point.

272
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:04,450
I think, I don't know if they're still

273
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:09,255
who. But yes, basically they gain revenue from Google unquestionably.

274
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:13,424
-- Uh
-- And the second thing is I know Google has been doing things to make

275
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:16,724
their properties generally work better in Chrome than any other

276
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,534
browser to the point where any place using Google Docs.

277
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:22,335
It's like, yeah, you you use that via Google Chrome.

278
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,645
It is functional in Firefox but it is definite,

279
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:29,455
you can tell it's crippled because you run in like my favorite example is

280
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,145
when you're using

281
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:34,010
uh Google Docs on Chrome, you can right,

282
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,760
click and click paste right from the browser menu

283
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,250
and it pastes whatever is in the paste buffer.

284
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,549
Whereas Firefox you click paste and it's like, oh you can't paste from here.

285
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,440
You have to hit control V to paste.

286
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,190
It's like, yeah, OK. Whatever, I guess.

287
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:47,609
Uh

288
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,369
yeah, this might be the shot in the arm that Firefox needs

289
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,679
to put it bluntly

290
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,440
and, and I I hope it, I hope it gets it. And

291
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,679
this is

292
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:58,580
this is something I've been thinking about a lot actually.

293
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,500
Not, not in the context of Firefox specifically, but just in, in

294
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,559
kind of tech in general is

295
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:08,109
as we see a lot of consolidation with some of these larger companies,

296
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:12,210
it is becoming more obvious as something like a web browser being controlled by

297
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:16,109
a company that also sells like 60% of the ads on the internet,

298
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,570
like

299
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,830
holy crap. What's wrong with that?

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,349
Well, and, and conversely though,

301
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,020
that's one of the only places that has the incentive to actually

302
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,150
pour tens of millions of dollars into a proper web browser.

303
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,190
Let's be clear.

304
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,090
Chrome

305
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,900
is

306
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
and well, no, I don't know about is,

307
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:36,250
but chrome definitely was by far the superior web browser for many years,

308
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:38,260
you know, the performance.

309
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,440
The for example, it's built in PDF reader and the fact that Google did things like,

310
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,020
oh, you know,

311
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,059
we need to build a secure PDF viewer because it's

312
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,719
been a bit of a train wreck in the past.

313
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,765
And so they did things like OK, well,

314
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,984
let's just build a corpus of PDF documents that

315
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,674
exercise every code path in the PDF browser.

316
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,974
Oh, it turns out we have that because we have like a copy of the internet,

317
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,104
you know,

318
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:00,914
and so they took something like what was it? Remember?

319
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:04,575
It was like 21 point something terabytes of PDF and basically boiled it down.

320
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,544
-- It
-- was enormous

321
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,705
and then they fuzzed them too.

322
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,715
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

323
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:10,784
So they, you know, II,

324
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:16,844
I love Google Chrome's PDF viewer because it just works so safely and reliably.

325
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,260
Mac O S's preview is mostly OK. But like

326
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:22,580
I

327
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,419
-- really, I feel safer with Google Chrome's built in PDF
-- thing when I was running Os X,

328
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,219
I found its PDF viewer to be terrible.

329
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:33,099
-- I did not care for
-- it. And so it drives me nuts. Right.

330
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:35,340
Because they built this beautiful thing. And now,

331
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,090
and I get why

332
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,270
doing it. And I,

333
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,460
again, if I was like a sea level at Google,

334
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,539
I probably would be on the other side of the fence and I get what they're doing.

335
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,590
But I don't, yeah, I don't like it and it's frustrating as heck.

336
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,580
Now, here's one thing I will say though is I started using Google Chrome

337
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,000
when I got my Mac

338
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,799
because Firefox, I'm,

339
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,200
yeah,

340
00:15:56,349 --> 00:16:00,820
-- I actually tried using safari for about an hour and then I was, I, I it's
-- so

341
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,510
what's funny to me though is safari on the mobile

342
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,539
isn't that bad?

343
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,940
-- Like it's bearable. But safari on the desktop, I
-- just uh yeah, it was, it was bad.

344
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,940
It was really bad

345
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:13,619
and, and I, I used to run Firefox for a long time. I love Firefox.

346
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,580
I used to help Mozilla with some security stuff a long time ago.

347
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,539
Well, if you run Linux, what else are you going to run?

348
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:19,940
Uh Chrome runs on Linux.

349
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:23,049
Well, it does now. True. But I mean, for the longest time, yeah,

350
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:26,570
it always has. Uh But anyway, so I,

351
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,210
and, and I started using, I got my Mac, I install Firefox,

352
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:33,159
I install chrome and chrome was clearly the superior Tros.

353
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,090
It was faster and more responsive and just,

354
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,630
it was a better user experience and I begrudgingly

355
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,630
used it more and more as time went on

356
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,549
and eventually I uninstalled Firefox.

357
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:43,710
Well,

358
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,690
it kind of uninstalled itself from my disc crash and I had to reinstall whatever.

359
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,659
But that's another story is. Uh,

360
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,500
so anyway,

361
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,840
I, I have a Linux machine now and I, I just instinctively put chrome on it and it was,

362
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,729
I mean, it's fine, you know, it's chrome, whatever

363
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:57,859
and

364
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:01,700
all this, all these shenanigans go down and I'm like, I'm running Firefox now,

365
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:01,940
you know,

366
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,680
and I'm going to take a principled stand on this and say I

367
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,060
disagree with this and I'm not going to run on Google Chrome anymore.

368
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,579
And man, like Firefox is freaking caught up in almost every way in all seriousness.

369
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,079
It's fast. It, it everything works the way other than Google Docs. Everything works

370
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,428
-- like the same. It's perfect. I love
-- it.

371
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,638
I would say, yeah,

372
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:26,828
to that with the one glaring exception being the way it handles multiple profiles.

373
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,889
Yes, that's fair. I will agree.

374
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:34,029
It's just so disgustingly painful and I, I use multiple profiles a lot

375
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,078
there. Look at their, they have an extension, go look it up, it doesn't work

376
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,430
the same way chrome does, but you can almost certainly survive with it.

377
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,000
What it does is you have like a new open tab button

378
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,589
and you pick the profile you want the tab to open with.

379
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,189
See, I like Google Chrome because it

380
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,469
shows me which profile I'm logged in as and then

381
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,300
I can just click it and pick another one and

382
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,109
it'll either start up a new browser or fire me off to the one where it is already open.

383
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,390
Yeah. No, II, I do agree with that.

384
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,449
I think that is a better experience, but at the same time, this is a principled stand.

385
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,459
So I'm willing to put up with a certain amount

386
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:13,000
of nonsense that I wouldn't without such an effort.

387
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:13,910
So.

388
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,030
Well, I mean, to put it bluntly,

389
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,150
I won't have a choice if they take ad blocking away from me.

390
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,030
I, I can't,

391
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,000
I can't surf the web with ads. It's just, it's too slow, it's too painful.

392
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,890
It's too risky

393
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,300
and it's just too annoying.

394
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,630
I mean, this is, I haven't had cable TV, and

395
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,660
I'm gonna say

396
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:35,449
89 years, it's been a while, almost a decade now.

397
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,290
And so when I do see regular cable TV, with ads,

398
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:42,719
it just again, I want to gouge my eyes out because it's so, so annoying.

399
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:43,839
It is terrible.

400
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:48,510
I, uh, we actually now that you say that it's been about 11 years since we,

401
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,969
we turned off our cable T VA little, little more even maybe.

402
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,290
And

403
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,959
I have no complaints and, and raising Children without

404
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,560
like commercial television.

405
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:02,000
It's been basically PBS and Netflix is about all they've ever used.

406
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,979
And it's funny because they go to someone's house who has like, ad TV.

407
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,750
And they come home, they're like,

408
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,619
do you know about this? Do you know about this?

409
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,150
And at one point my son was, like, repeating ads verbatim to me.

410
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,939
I'm like, where did you learn this crap?

411
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,849
I don't know what, no, we're not getting that.

412
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,290
And it,

413
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,709
it, it's terrible. I agree. I agree.

414
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,560
It, it's funny though because with,

415
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,579
with youtube on a tablet you can't escape the ads.

416
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:31,180
So, I guess they're, they're back to being subjected to ads to a degree.

417
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,130
But, oh, my goodness. I hate ads.

418
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,010
Yeah.

419
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,709
I mean, I, I've literally, I think three times in my life seen an ad where I was like,

420
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,030
oh,

421
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,880
-- I'm actually interested in that.
-- I'm trying to think.

422
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,849
I, nothing comes to mind. I'm sure I, I have and let's face it too.

423
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,839
The vast majority of ads aren't about,

424
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,839
I'm going to inform you of this product or service.

425
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,239
It's to just brainwash you into

426
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:53,260
like, like, what is it?

427
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,140
They've done studies where kids subjected to, like fast food ads,

428
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,180
eat more junk food.

429
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,859
Right.

430
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,130
And it doesn't even necessarily mean they're eating that one particular brand.

431
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,689
It's just like they're, they're, it's warping your mind

432
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,550
into thinking you want something you don't.

433
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,199
Well, to thinking that it's normal to eat mcdonald's every day.

434
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:13,609
If you eat mcdonald's every day, we apologize for calling you not normal.

435
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,329
I'm not apologizing.

436
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,699
You

437
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:16,579
think enough

438
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,310
choices

439
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,530
at least get, mix it up with like Hardee's or Apple or what,

440
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,910
what are those other us chains?

441
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,569
Hardee's and like,

442
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:26,969
-- like
-- fast food.

443
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,729
Carl's Junior Sonics, whatever. Yeah, something like that.

444
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:33,569
-- Carl
-- Carl's Junior is Hardee's, they're literally the same. Ok.

445
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:38,192
The west coast, it's Carl's Junior. East coast. It's Hardee's,

446
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,411
it's mostly Hardee's in the Midwest where I live.

447
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:41,312
Ok.

448
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,452
But anyway, anyway, so this is,

449
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,131
I sort of feel bad. There's not a lot of security in this one.

450
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,871
It's mostly us complaining about ad blockers and the

451
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,391
fact that we don't like what Google is doing.

452
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:53,952
But I guess one of the things I keep thinking about,

453
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:57,031
we don't like ads, we don't want to watch

454
00:20:57,274 --> 00:21:00,333
ads. And I think the fact that Google is doing this

455
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:05,323
tells me ad blockers are having the desired effect of people not seeing ads.

456
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:07,663
Now, here's the problem though.

457
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:11,384
What happens if Google starts getting more and more

458
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:14,254
angry because we're not looking at their ads.

459
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,413
That sort of scares me a little bit.

460
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:20,323
Well, so, ok, so clearly youtube, they can jam ads down your throat and there's a well

461
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:23,595
precedent for that with broadcast TV or cable TV or whatever.

462
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,686
I feel like Google Docs, they can't really do that.

463
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:29,595
That's going to make business people annoyed and angry. Google search.

464
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,375
Yeah, they can absolutely try and jam ads down and do more sponsored content and,

465
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:36,676
and what annoys me is once in a while I do actually

466
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,936
more so when I'm looking for a local business where it's like

467
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,885
the local business shows up in the ad and it's at the

468
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,385
top of the page and it's the one I wanted it.

469
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:43,906
So I'm like, yeah, whatever. Click that. Right.

470
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,706
And I feel kind of bad because I would have hunted them down and found them anyways.

471
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,676
You just cost them a nickel. Yeah.

472
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,030
But I feel like, fundamentally

473
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,229
there is still

474
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,109
some choice. I don't want to say Google has a monopoly.

475
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,369
I would say it's about as close as you can get to a monopoly without being a monopoly.

476
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,069
I would, I think they have a monopoly.

477
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,439
I think the fact that Microsoft was deemed to have a monopoly back in the day,

478
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:08,430
like Google is just as bad or worse.

479
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,589
Well, it's weird because they have a monopoly,

480
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,089
not in the sense of an absolute monopoly where there's no other choice but they have

481
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,420
a monopoly in the sense of they're so big and so good and so efficient,

482
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,489
realistically, I mean, I could go use bing or something but man,

483
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,550
the results are always a pain in the butt compared to Google.

484
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,510
Like my Google search bubble is so tuned to me at this point.

485
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,290
-- Uh
-- Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that.

486
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,329
God knows how many years of data on me, you know,

487
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,530
things like that were just like Microsoft can't replicate that without

488
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,089
me using Microsoft exclusively for like a year or two.

489
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,130
Right. Right.

490
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,339
And I, I fully admit I've, you know, I drank the Kool Aid

491
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,469
and I enjoyed it.

492
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,489
We all enjoyed it, man. It's, it's one of those things that I'm, I'm hopeful.

493
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,130
We look back someday and be like, wow, we were dumb.

494
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,390
Well,

495
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,770
I'm not sure how else this could have turned out because there's just

496
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,770
certain things at this scale that you can't do without effectively like,

497
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,760
like a good, you know, like tuning a search bubble to a person.

498
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,079
You can't do that without

499
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,880
seeing all their searches

500
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,150
and effectively having that monopoly over their eyeballs

501
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,050
and having everyone else's searches to correlate against.

502
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,530
So, you know, when, when you see the sequence of searches,

503
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,329
the next one's probably going to be this.

504
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,449
Yeah, exactly.

505
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,869
And, and they can do that.

506
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,729
The, the thing I keep thinking of is there,

507
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:23,520
there's all these companies that have built their futures on ads.

508
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,579
Well, it's one of the most effective current, you know,

509
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:29,050
for the last what two centuries ish

510
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,520
models that we found for quasi

511
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:32,530
micro payments,

512
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,510
right? The micro payment is your attention.

513
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:39,810
And ultimately, I, I serve an ad to a million people and I sell 20 widgets.

514
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,069
So, yeah, on average, blah, blah, blah, the math is all wonky. But fundamentally

515
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,760
how else are we going to do this? Right?

516
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,280
Because people literally,

517
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,760
I see people making as much of a deal about spending five bucks for an app as they do,

518
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,040
like buying a car or buying a house like,

519
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,760
I've literally had people complain about a $5 app and I'm like, dude, you make like,

520
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,439
six figures a year.

521
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,270
Why just buy the damn $5 app?

522
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:04,780
I've, I've done that before where I'm like, oh, it's a dollar.

523
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,780
I don't think I want to buy it.

524
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,260
I'm like, wait, I just spent more than a dollar thinking about this.

525
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:09,349
This,

526
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,410
yeah,

527
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,780
-- exactly. No,
-- I hear you. I hear you.

528
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:17,099
But at the same time it's one of those challenges also where,

529
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:17,640
like,

530
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,380
I'll give you my favorite example is I pay my local newspaper

531
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,859
so I can read it and I want them to survive.

532
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,660
So I'm happy to give them some money.

533
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,209
I find myself on another news site. They're like, oh, you can subscribe if you want.

534
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:29,829
I'm like,

535
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:33,319
I, I don't want to, if I had a way to give you, like,

536
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:36,219
a nickel for letting me read this story or a dollar or something.

537
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,459
Like I would, I would seriously consider it.

538
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:42,219
But I also recognize at the same time there is a nontrivial number of people.

539
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:42,979
Like, let's face it.

540
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:43,219
There's,

541
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,310
there's some kid in India who's just getting on the

542
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,270
internet for the first time who doesn't have a Eagle,

543
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,310
right? He has no way to get money to America. What now, I mean?

544
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,380
Remember the Ls and Crypt guy, right? The minute you charge even a penny for it. Ok.

545
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,050
Well, how do you get that penny to me?

546
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,069
Now you either need a credit card or

547
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,380
a bank account or some weird Cryptocurrency thing.

548
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,069
That is a pain in the butt. Right.

549
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,250
Whereas you just trade eyeballs and attention and hopefully one in

550
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,630
a million people spend all their money on your widgets.

551
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,310
No. Really?

552
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,109
Like that's, that's what I keep coming back to, you know, is, is the,

553
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,790
the second you require even 1/10 of a penny or a millionth of a penny payment.

554
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:21,430
The also the amount of infrastructure you need to handle that and charge backs. And,

555
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,140
you know, like, let's put, like,

556
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,310
let's be real if you charge five cents on a credit card.

557
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,800
Number one, can you even do that with a lot of credit card issuers?

558
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,979
Like, are you going to see because some of them charge minimum fees. Right.

559
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,329
They're not going to take 2.5% of five cents.

560
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:39,910
I have a funny story here is I sent someone, I think 10 cents over,

561
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,050
uh, paypal one time

562
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,119
and they charged me like a dollar service fee.

563
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:45,790
So

564
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,689
I paid like a dollar and 10 cents to send someone 10 cents, which amused me to no end.

565
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:54,150
Why did you have to send them 10?

566
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,810
I don't know.

567
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,979
It was to be, it was basically to, to show this is the problem, right.

568
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,119
It cost me a dollar if you send him 10 cents.

569
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,219
And it was funny and we all laughed. Ha

570
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,979
ha ha ha.

571
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:06,640
So far we've,

572
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:10,339
we haven't found a business model to, to replace ads

573
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,109
and the business model of charging

574
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:13,640
for content.

575
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,479
Let's be real that that has not worked yet.

576
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,099
Like, every time I go to the garden,

577
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,609
I feel so bad for the Guardian with their

578
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,520
little yellow notice at the bottom because the Guardian,

579
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,560
for example, is doing actual investigative journalism.

580
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:28,439
But I'm too much of a cheap bugger to actually give him like,

581
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:30,599
20 or 30 bucks or whatever, or buy a subscription.

582
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,949
Uh. Right. And I read like one Guardian news article a month.

583
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,780
Maybe it's not enough to justify it. I agree.

584
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,410
And I would love to give them some money, some money,

585
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,000
-- but
-- we don't love it enough to actually go and do it.

586
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,119
Here's where we're going to bring it all

587
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,709
together now because we're a security podcast.

588
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:50,290
So, here's the thing I have going through my head

589
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,050
now that we've had this weird discussion

590
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,890
is

591
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,810
I have a suspicion this suffers from the same problem.

592
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:02,699
The security industry does where there is a problem that we think we understand.

593
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,560
We probably don't really, but we think we do

594
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,739
and all of the current solutions to that problem

595
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,800
-- are insufficient in every way.
-- I'm, I'm reminded of the old spam solution chart.

596
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,560
Remember that thing, you know, your solution to spam won't work because,

597
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,699
and then there's like all those check boxes and stuff.

598
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,959
Right. Right. Exactly. That's exactly it. And,

599
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,060
but anyway, the the point being,

600
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,449
I feel like all we do now,

601
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,589
instead of saying we need to rethink the

602
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,900
problems and find new solutions is we're like,

603
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,390
well, just try harder.

604
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,579
Maybe that's the problem.

605
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:38,400
-- And it's like that is not the solution and it doesn't work,
-- use more paywalls.

606
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,819
Right.

607
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:39,410
Exactly.

608
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,699
-- We need more ads, everyone, more ads
-- and it's like, sponsored content, make the ads

609
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:48,305
more sneaky and less obtrusive. It's like soap operas.

610
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:51,915
I'm noticing that in some of the magazines now I buy, like, there'll be, I'm like,

611
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,015
why is the type font wonky on this article?

612
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,785
And then I'm like, oh, it's not,

613
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,084
it's a four

614
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,724
page ad.

615
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,385
I had that.

616
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:01,165
I think that was,

617
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:05,074
I think National Geographic just had one of those where I'm reading, like,

618
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:07,265
I've lost all respect for National Geographic.

619
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,209
Yeah, I like their pictures.

620
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,280
-- I'm a sucker for the pictures
-- back in and,

621
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,770
and back in the day I remember we fought over who, who got, who got to read it first.

622
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,819
And I, I remember I was so happy when I went to junior high because I could walk home

623
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,130
and I could get home before anybody else. And,

624
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,670
you know,

625
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,209
the mail had been dropped off.

626
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:27,170
-- So I always got to read National Geographic first anyway.
-- Anyway.

627
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,290
Yeah, I was reading it the other day. I still get it. I love the magazine.

628
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,489
I know they're kind of sell outs for a bunch of reasons. But whatever, I still like it.

629
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,410
And

630
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,270
I started reading, I'm like, what the heck is this article?

631
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,390
And it, like, it basically blended in.

632
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,469
You could not tell it was an ad until you actually stood back and looked at it.

633
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:46,209
I'm like, oh, my goodness, this is, this is shameful.

634
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,069
But at the,

635
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,250
you know, at the same time I sure as,

636
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,339
I don't have some magical business model to offer these people.

637
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:57,329
No, no, I, I don't have one and I don't know. And the thing that scares the crap out of me

638
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,810
is my suspicion is more ads is going to be the answer because

639
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:04,040
they're going to realize as more and more people are using ad blockers,

640
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,359
which it, it, it has to be more common that Google is making this decision.

641
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,670
That just means that people without them,

642
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,089
they're going to put even more ads in front of

643
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,199
because

644
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,209
like, let's face it. That's their solution is eyeballs, looking at ads.

645
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,199
Well, you got fewer eyeballs. So we'll just do more ads, right?

646
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,689
The ratio still works out.

647
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,349
All right. Anyway, we should, we should tie this one up.

648
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,089
Here's what I will say is my parting advice.

649
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,489
Get Firefox, use Firefox support Mozilla. They're doing awesome work.

650
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,314
-- And
-- if you do, you want to donate to Mozilla, go to donate.mozilla.org.

651
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:37,844
That's

652
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:42,574
I love it. I, I will donate today. In fact, I should do that. Awesome.

653
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:45,415
All right, good deal. So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you. Everyone for listening.
