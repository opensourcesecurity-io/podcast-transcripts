Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,850
Kurt Siefried and my partner in allergy suffering Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,510
Ok.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,310
So before I hit record,

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,700
I made a comment to Kurt that everything outside

5
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,909
is covered in like a thick yellow dust and my

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,750
allergies.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,229
I, I used to not have allergies and now that I, I guess I got them and it,

8
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,815
I'm a bit stuffed up today.

9
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,905
And so anyway, Kurt claims this is my city's fault,

10
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:32,505
which I of course said, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:36,985
And he wouldn't answer me until I hit a record. So, what are you talking about?

12
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:41,974
-- It's actually
-- shockingly simple. Female trees have seeds, male trees have pollen.

13
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:44,895
Guess which one is easier to clean up from the city's point of view.

14
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,740
I assume the male trees.

15
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:52,470
So at least in most of Canada cities prefer to plant male trees rather

16
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,180
than female trees because there's less of a mess for us allergy sufferers.

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,509
-- It's terrible. Interesting.
-- I wonder if that is true. And now that you say that

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,840
I feel like there are,

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,830
I have some trees in my yard

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,550
that drop mass quantities of crap

21
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:13,989
this time. Of year. But you're right. The trees the city planted along the roads,

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,779
-- I feel like, don't drop tons of garbage
-- because they, they

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,419
generally speaking

24
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,349
professionals who do this kind of thing prefer the male plants

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,019
because they don't make a mess.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,069
I mean, pollen. It just gets washed away in the rain. Interesting. Right.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
I have a female tree in my backyard and, you know, those, like, helicopter seeds

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,540
and it just, every year

29
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:35,449
I love those things. They're a mess. But they're fun to play with

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,250
and they're sharp when they're dry.

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,300
-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-- So,

32
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:41,550
you know, tradeoffs, less pollen.

33
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,690
But now I have all these little sharp things over me

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,379
in the fall. Is it fall or is it spring? No, it's spring. They fall. Right.

35
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:49,620
-- It's
-- all year. It's all year.

36
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:51,970
I

37
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,309
remember

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,970
I had an L shaped house once and someone planted

39
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:01,260
the biggest maple tree I've ever seen probably closer to the house than is safe.

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,589
And, yeah, it was, I was, I cleaned the gutters.

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,660
I bet 10 times a year at that house because the

42
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:08,580
tree was dropping something into the gutters at all times.

43
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,380
No, it's, it's, this is a perfect example of your original

44
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,029
hypothesis. I don't know if you want to share with the group.

45
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,500
-- What was my original hypothesis?
-- The humans make everything worse?

46
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,500
I mean, who's, that's not a hypothesis?

47
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,500
It's like that's a fundamental truth.

48
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,229
So, we're going to talk about

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,070
the

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,740
colonial pipeline disaster because it is not well known,

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,929
-- but I am in fact a pipeline
-- expert.

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm not shocked at all.

53
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:37,949
No, I'm not at all.

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,889
Have had more exposure to this than I should have also through my childhood.

55
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,270
So actually you might know something because you live in an oil rich place.

56
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,369
I'm I'm more making fun of the fact that if you look on Twitter,

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,460
most of the people who have been what supply chain

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,279
experts and probably election security experts and then epidemiologists,

59
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,380
they are now shockingly

60
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,770
experts

61
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,339
at pipeline security,

62
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,350
which is just what

63
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,300
Yeah,

64
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:07,679
-- to which I say if you don't know what a pig is. GTFO
-- that is the only thing I know.

65
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,639
And the reason I know that is from watching documentaries about

66
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,139
pipelines and I only thought it was funny because so,

67
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,660
ok, I will let me explain,

68
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,240
you can correct me because this is something I'm actually like giddy about.

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,750
Obviously, you've got pipelines,

70
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,070
they go into the ground or wherever and they go from point A to point B.

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,479
Right.

72
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:24,669
And you can imagine

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,772
that you can have issues of like keeping them clean and there

74
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,953
can be clogs and you got to make sure like how,

75
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,113
how is the pipe doing?

76
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,212
Is there something wrong with it?

77
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:35,052
Whatever they have these basically like probes they put

78
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,873
into the pipe and they call them pigs.

79
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,192
And the reason they call them pigs is because

80
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:42,593
the original things they would send through the pipelines were

81
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:45,402
made of leather and made a squealing noise as

82
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:47,483
they traversed the pipe because they fit really well.

83
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,513
They're kind of meant to clean it.

84
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:51,666
And that amused me to no end thinking about a pipe

85
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,305
squealing like a pig.

86
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:56,145
-- This probe moves down
-- it.

87
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:56,505
I mean,

88
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,466
what I really love about pipelines is that the

89
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,666
majority of them are quite old and pretty much

90
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:04,666
on their last legs and ready to like blow up

91
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:05,656
internal, a lot of

92
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:05,796
them

93
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:11,145
and they cross bodies of water, they go under creeks. There's just

94
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:14,865
like, I know people who work for remediation companies and

95
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:15,856
it's,

96
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,776
I mean, they, they generally try to do a good job,

97
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:20,704
but

98
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,029
when you have thousands of tons of soil that's been contaminated,

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,350
like what do you do with it?

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,299
Well, and, and look, I mean, this is actually in there,

101
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,200
there's a bunch of interesting parallels here.

102
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,549
I think we can touch on, but I think in that particular

103
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,070
parallel is pipelines are legacy infrastructure fundamentally, right?

104
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,589
Like the dependence on oil is decreasing,

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,589
we know we have an oil free future in front of us.

106
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,549
It doesn't like this is not a political statement.

107
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,029
This is just the honest to God's truth about oil consumption.

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,010
Well, it's a bit more complicated than that,

109
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,109
but I would say it's more like the amount of oil we're

110
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,950
going to need in the future is going to be relatively minor.

111
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,470
It'll be a fraction lubrication pharmaceuticals.

112
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,269
Like, we'll always need some amount of oil, but we won't be setting it on fire.

113
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,309
Right. No, seriously. Think about it. We have this awesome resource.

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,390
It's like trees. We used to burn trees all the bloody time.

115
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,350
Yeah. And we still do a little bit.

116
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:16,750
My neighbor, for example, heats his house with wood and I, like,

117
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,989
we live in the middle of a city.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,339
You get to smell like campfire all the time.

119
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:24,350
Yeah, I straight up do. I've gotten used to it. I kind of like it,

120
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,640
but

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,540
we went camping a couple of weeks ago because camping felt safe in COVID times.

122
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,279
And

123
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,450
my kids haven't been around a campfire in a while and they're like,

124
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,109
everything smells like campfire.

125
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:42,070
What do we do? It's like nothing. You can do nothing. You smell like campfire. Now,

126
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:45,380
that is the literal definition of camping. Everything smells like campfire.

127
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,200
That's right.

128
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,579
Anyway. Anyway,

129
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,450
so

130
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,630
there's a lot of angles to this and I

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,329
don't want to specifically focus on pipeline security.

132
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,709
-- You know,
-- my favorite angle is,

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,869
is that from what I've read the colonial pipelines company essentially again,

134
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,109
made a humans made a choice

135
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,790
to make the situation much worse because it benefited the company.

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,070
Well, I mean, maybe so,

137
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,279
this is one of the many points of contention I think fundamentally from

138
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,670
the perspective of what happened with this pipeline at the time of recording,

139
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,859
there is so

140
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,627
much conjecture and just made up crap that

141
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,736
I don't believe anything I'm reading right now.

142
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,076
All we know for sure is a pipeline is

143
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:25,957
down and it has been admitted that it's ransomware,

144
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,386
it's fault and that's

145
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,457
it. Maybe it was ransomware.

146
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,707
Maybe it was, there's,

147
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,587
there's rumors of like a second order where humans

148
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:36,226
turn the pipeline off because of some other system,

149
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,907
the ransomware affected, you know, like I have no idea.

150
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,886
Well, it, it's from what I've read the most,

151
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:45,177
-- like the current sort of the most well reasoned and
-- you have to

152
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:45,664
say

153
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,144
at the time of recording,

154
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,424
at the time of recording from what I've read,

155
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:52,984
it looks like their billing system got really hit hard.

156
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:57,104
And so, rather than, you know, deliver product and not be able to bill for it,

157
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,993
they decided to turn it off so they could

158
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:02,023
-- fix their billing system and
-- I wouldn't doubt that.

159
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:07,783
But I will assure you if that is the case when the congressional testimony begins,

160
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,773
they're going to have a bad day.

161
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:10,503
Here's the thing.

162
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:10,903
They,

163
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,824
they'll be easily able to claim that

164
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,514
they wanted to protect the pipeline infrastructure

165
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,821
and, you know, the skater systems by turning them off.

166
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,131
But this is what always drives me nuts about ska

167
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:23,151
and about a lot of sort of enterprise things is that people build something

168
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:27,540
and it operates something that either cannot be shut down or

169
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,501
is so incredibly expensive to shut down that you essentially need

170
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,101
like sign off. From the board of directors to turn it off.

171
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,480
You know, things like nuclear reactor plants, uh, oil refineries.

172
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,510
Like, I remember we had a windstorm once here and they had to shut down the Scott

173
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,800
for refinery, like, as an emergency.

174
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,399
Oh, man, that

175
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,790
was like,

176
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,339
that was a major problem.

177
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,209
Think of the stuff in the pipeline and the inertia that it has.

178
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,739
-- Right. Right.
-- You do not turn these things off unless you have to,

179
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,579
we don't know

180
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,720
all of the stuff we don't know. Right.

181
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,750
That's, that's basically what this is like running a pipeline.

182
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,739
I have no idea how that works. Shutting a pipeline down. I have no idea how that works.

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,109
It's not like a garden hose where you just kind of turn a knob and, well, that's it.

184
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,500
You, you can't because it'll break because of the inertia of the product.

185
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:14,220
All of that in

186
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,619
all industrial systems have

187
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,709
like a billion moving parts all at the same time. Right.

188
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,410
And you can't just turn one of them off.

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,350
Usually what happens is you end up with catastrophic failure somewhere

190
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:27,309
-- down the line
-- or just a really big maintenance bill.

191
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,130
-- Yeah.
-- But in the 8 to 9 figures, kind of maintenance bill, I mean. Right.

192
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,369
Right.

193
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,190
So, like my example I always use in, in this instance is when I was in college,

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,349
I worked in a paper mill in the summers to

195
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,719
earn my beer drinking money essentially.

196
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,390
And I remember the the machines had to be shut down every now and then this,

197
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,119
this mill I was in,

198
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,169
had like eight or nine big machines and it took 24 hours to shut it down.

199
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,049
Correctly. Mind you, it did, they did go down once because of like

200
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:54,190
a

201
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:55,140
power failure.

202
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,030
And that was, that was, that took a long time.

203
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,380
Then it takes 24 hours to start them back up when they shut down Catastrophically,

204
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,250
it takes like a week to start them back up.

205
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,929
But the other thing,

206
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,080
the thing I never thought about and I was talking to

207
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,289
the engineers one time when we turn the machine off,

208
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,070
every time they turn the machine off,

209
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,960
they have to replace some of the motors because

210
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,969
the motors just won't ever start back up again.

211
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,849
Which is kind of nuts if you think about it.

212
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:19,289
What always gets me is, well, I mean, I just went through this with my computer.

213
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,489
I upgraded the CPU

214
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,320
lost my, uh, memory profile and

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,659
there's a lot of computer memory, for example.

216
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,739
But, yeah, will it do 3200 or 3600 mega, uh, megahertz?

217
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,099
Yeah. Will it do it consistently day in, day out 24 7? No,

218
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,729
people forget. You know, this isn't a car that's only run 10 hours a day.

219
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,739
This is a machine that's running 24 7

220
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,809
with vibration with heat.

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,630
When you look at this stuff, it's just,

222
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,409
it's got to be massively overpacked or not overspeed and a whole lot cheaper.

223
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,530
And the reality is, in a lot of these cases, it's a lot cheaper to use parts that at any

224
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,609
sufficient scale it becomes statistics

225
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,210
and you just roll with it

226
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,229
like it's cheaper to replace that motor once every

227
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,729
couple of months than it is to buy a motor

228
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,650
that will never break because that motor that will

229
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,010
never break will break at some point as well.

230
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,289
So you just accept the fact that

231
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,299
I I think what it boils down to is you at scale.

232
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,690
You accept the fact that certain pieces are essentially consumable

233
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,849
that normal people would think of as being forever.

234
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,250
Well, I mean, you have to plan for that to a degree as well, right?

235
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,479
I mean, and this is true, let's think about it, infrastructure, right?

236
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,559
How many, how many it infrastructure plans

237
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,489
basically say

238
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,719
when this thing fails, this is what happens to everything else, right?

239
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:33,979
That like that never happens

240
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:35,570
because why would it,

241
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,929
it's well and, and, and but also you get organic growth so you get

242
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,619
things that depend on it that it didn't depend on it before and so on and so forth,

243
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,789
right?

244
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,929
Like these, these pipelines are a perfect example of,

245
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,250
one of the challenges of my provincial economy is that we have a

246
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,000
ton of oil that we extract from the ground and sell to people.

247
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,080
Well, why don't we refine it?

248
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,369
Yeah, ask me,

249
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,330
you want me to ask you,

250
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,169
ask me why we don't refine it locally and sell refined products at a higher value.

251
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,849
And why don't you do the thing you just said?

252
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,450
-- Because we can't transport it to market,
-- you mean the refined

253
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,580
oil

254
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,880
or gas or whatever?

255
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,609
I guess we have infrastructure pipelines to

256
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,849
ship the unprocessed or slightly processed product

257
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,919
to Texas, for example,

258
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,090
which then refines it and has

259
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,929
things like colonial pipelines to actually distribute the gas

260
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,210
-- to the east coast.
-- Right.

261
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,320
-- Right. Well, when we say gas, we mean petrol for the rest of the world
-- gasoline.

262
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,559
So

263
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:32,760
like,

264
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,130
yeah,

265
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,359
and so for example, if Alberta were to

266
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,260
do the value add here,

267
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,250
the only option we really would have is to ship it via tanker car,

268
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,650
which is quite expensive compared to pipelines and

269
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,539
also quite hideously unsafe compared to pipelines.

270
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,489
Well, and I have a suspicion that

271
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,179
refineries probably pollute like crazy.

272
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,700
-- And
-- dude, this is Alberta, we're ok with that.

273
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,210
Yeah.

274
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:54,700
Ok,

275
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,299
because I know in the US most of our oil refineries are in places that

276
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,650
will say have lax environmental regulations would be the polite way to put it.

277
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,969
Edmonton has grown up with oil refineries now in city limits like there's

278
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,859
facilities, well, they were inside the city when

279
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,390
50 years ago,

280
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,690
like we have, you know,

281
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,530
we have Fort Saskatchewan which has the highest incidence of asthma in Canada.

282
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm sure it's not at all related to the oil refineries out there.

283
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:21,570
Total

284
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,109
-- coincidence.
-- Yeah. So, no,

285
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,500
no, no. Like I, I can drive 2030 minutes and go look at giant oil refineries

286
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,890
like they're on the other side of the city.

287
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,609
So, no, the environmental concern is, that's

288
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,530
ok. We're good with that. But yeah, so the, the problem boils down to

289
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,299
people. Think about,

290
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,979
you know, a tank full of gas. That's cute.

291
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,840
What do you do with a million liters or for you?

292
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:47,380
Americans say a quarter million gallons of gasoline?

293
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,580
Well, you could ship it via train. Ok, but what do you do when you need that every hour?

294
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,534
-- I mean?
-- Right. Right. And is true of technology.

295
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:59,984
This is true of any, any industry, right? Any industry at scale creates challenges.

296
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:05,614
A normal person cannot fathom, toothpaste, toothpaste pipeline sounds epic.

297
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,965
Yeah, there was an XKCD.

298
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:10,005
We'll have to link to where he did the various sizes of pipelines for,

299
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,729
for various things that are needed, including toothpaste.

300
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:14,640
That's awesome.

301
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:19,520
-- I've not seen that one.
-- No. So the reality is as much as we hate on this stuff.

302
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,489
Pipelines are basically the least worst way to transport this

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,400
stuff at scale and bulk 24 7 without interruption.

304
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,549
Probably because you don't have to worry about, you know,

305
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,750
cars sitting on the tracks or

306
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,710
well and, and look my complaint isn't the pipeline like we have pipelines,

307
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,219
whatever I enjoy living in a modern economy.

308
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:42,570
Do I hope we stop using oil and gas someday, like, sure it's easy to say.

309
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:46,840
But, but fundamentally the issues I see are kind of multi

310
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:50,880
tiered of, first of all, we have the usual experts

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,020
that don't know crap about what they're talking about,

312
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,820
which is frustrating because they muddy the waters and they make a mess.

313
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,099
Right. There's that going on.

314
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:00,219
You've got the fact that humans probably made this worse

315
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,340
in some way because that's just what humans do.

316
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,919
All of this boils down to economics. Right.

317
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:07,479
You're not convincing these people to spend a ton of money and worse.

318
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:11,020
A bunch of outage time on upgrading things.

319
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,210
It is really hard.

320
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,159
You know, it always reminds me of hospitals where people are, like,

321
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,729
why don't you just upgrade all the software and stuff of hospitals?

322
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,390
It's like, yeah, so you just want us to, like,

323
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,049
shut the hospital down for a day or two and do software updates

324
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,700
that

325
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:22,349
checks out.

326
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,799
I don't think, I mean,

327
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,450
that kind of happened when, what was that? Not pet?

328
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:30,109
Yeah, that shut down the UK hospital system.

329
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,210
Yeah. They fell back to paper charts and it was, it was a proper mess.

330
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,700
What frustrates me the most is the majority of people have never had

331
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,049
operational experience running a system that has to work.

332
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,500
Not like, oh, it goes down. I get a call.

333
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,789
I have to bring it back up but I'm talking about systems that

334
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,140
have to work.

335
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,070
Like I said, nuclear reactors, oil refineries,

336
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,140
stuff like that where you can't just shut it down for a few hours.

337
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:52,650
Right.

338
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,219
Right.

339
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,659
I think they grossly underestimate how complicated this is

340
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,969
and how from a security point of view,

341
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,580
they mostly like the rest of us.

342
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,270
Kind of hope nothing bad happens.

343
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,809
-- I mean,
-- I think that's

344
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,460
kind of how everyone

345
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,460
works.

346
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:11,330
Ok. I want to, I want to also bring up one other thing that I think is bananas.

347
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,270
I will link to this in the show notes. But Rob Kaki,

348
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:18,799
who was on the show some time ago for the book, he wrote with Dick Clark,

349
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:23,080
he posted a thread on Twitter today pointing out that the

350
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,280
TS A the people at the airport in the United States,

351
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,669
the Transportation Security Administration is

352
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,549
responsible for pipeline security.

353
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:30,809
It

354
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,590
makes sense. That

355
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,830
doesn't make sense. I have no idea.

356
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,070
For example, most rail companies in Canada have their own police.

357
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,309
That doesn't surprise me at all because railroads have existed for

358
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,859
hundreds of years and things were pretty dicey at the beginning.

359
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,729
And not only that,

360
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,150
but you're dealing with crime where it maybe happened

361
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,090
on a train in between two towns in some

362
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:57,859
-- in the middle of nowhere may not even be a jurisdiction
-- that wouldn't shock me at all.

363
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,619
-- Well, and there may not have been back in the day. There might be
-- now.

364
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,500
Well, there would have been RCMP but you know you, how are you going to get some RC?

365
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,380
You know, just finding the guy and getting them on the train to deal with.

366
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,039
-- It's going to take days.
-- Right. Right.

367
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,210
-- And communication was slow and whatever I get that
-- there's a

368
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,679
lot of us departments where if you look at their responsibilities,

369
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,929
it's like, well, why are these people in charge of X?

370
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,429
And while it's just, that's how it is.

371
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,679
It's like one thing that always blew my mind was the secret service.

372
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,489
What is their mandate? Exactly. Again,

373
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,369
I forget what it technically is,

374
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,210
but they have like a hodgepodge of responsibilities.

375
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:33,729
-- Yeah,
-- it's like protecting the president counterfeiting

376
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,409
and just a couple of other really oddball.

377
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,010
-- But
-- I mean, look, this is,

378
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,159
so this is one of the other funny aspects to all this is when you have

379
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,599
a, we'll say long

380
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,780
standing organization of any kind.

381
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:53,119
It doesn't matter if this is a business, it can be like a, probably a church,

382
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,270
it could be a government, whatever, it doesn't matter eventually.

383
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,750
Just because of the arrow of time you're going to

384
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,200
end up with groups doing super weird things and reorganizing.

385
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,760
That is often a political nightmare that no one wants to deal with. So nobody does.

386
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:12,030
Not only that, but you hope you'll probably have regulation and law written.

387
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,348
Well, in the case of governments.

388
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,750
Yeah, there's totally going to be laws, you have to deal

389
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,663
well, or even the quasi

390
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,163
governmental bodies. You know, a

391
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:23,273
great example, the BC registries, you know they do the corporate registries, so,

392
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,073
company names and whatever.

393
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,233
And so I wrote an article about this.

394
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:27,933
Haven't published it yet,

395
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:31,813
but basically this lady wanted to register her company name in her native language.

396
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:36,313
-- Oh, right. I remember this
-- BC registries is like, yeah, cool. Sorry we can't.

397
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,004
And everybody's involved is kind of getting this hate on the BC registries.

398
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:44,014
And I went and I read the Act, the Act legally specifies

399
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,293
English and French.

400
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,089
That is what they

401
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:51,170
are to support. It's not that they have to support that and can do other things.

402
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,270
It, the act specifically says company names are English or French.

403
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,430
Stop.

404
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:57,270
That's it.

405
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,469
And so like they're not trying to be jerks.

406
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,489
It's just, you know,

407
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,849
we operate through a regulation and the regulation says English or French.

408
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,650
That's it. Sorry. Like we're not allowed to do anything else.

409
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,560
-- We're not trying to be jerks. It's just,
-- when was your regulation written?

410
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,989
-- Oh, good Lord. Oh, quite a while ago
-- before unicode.

411
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,239
-- Well,
-- before, you know, we,

412
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,550
we sort of started seeing the indigenous peoples of Canada's people.

413
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,530
Yeah, that too. I suppose that's a good point.

414
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,105
But I mean, right, this is, this is a fine example of there's always these multi like,

415
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:27,536
like

416
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,916
2nd and 3rd order things that happen in any

417
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,286
situation and like this is totally no different.

418
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:33,615
Like,

419
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,105
you know,

420
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:38,196
what else is really funny is I found a story talking about now that the

421
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:41,635
east coast of the United States knows there's going to be a gas shortage.

422
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,276
People are all going to hoard gas.

423
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:48,265
And so now they, they created a gas shortage and it's like you idiots did this.

424
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:53,255
-- It's toilet paper all over again.
-- By the way, if you have a pool, go buy your chlorine.

425
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,186
-- Now, now
-- there's legitimately a chlorine shortage I heard,

426
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,751
but I'm sure anyone with a pool knows that at this point,

427
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,501
the one main factory that produces sort of

428
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,671
chlorine pucks and chlorine Granules for pools.

429
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,932
It's in Louisiana

430
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:10,182
-- and I quote, it burnt down a little bit after the hurricane last year.
-- Oh, good.

431
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,121
That seems nice.

432
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,962
It's funny because I actually got like a small grove mount above ground pool for

433
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,802
this year for my kids because all the pools are going to be shut still.

434
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:19,241
Yeah.

435
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:23,281
It, the week I bought the pool a few weeks ago and then I did my research, you know,

436
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,541
I'm going to do chlorine and salt or bromine or whatever.

437
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:27,449
When I went to buy the chlorine stuff,

438
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,689
it's like the shelf's looking pretty picked over

439
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,829
it. Supply chains, man. And again, I don't want to be a jerk.

440
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,890
So I bought like the biggest bucket they had also.

441
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,020
It was, well, no, it drove me nuts because the small bucket was like 40 bucks.

442
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,989
The bucket twice as big was like 50 bucks.

443
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,479
The bucket twice as big as that was like 60 bucks.

444
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,400
It was one of those situations where,

445
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,969
you know, do I buy the? I have, honestly, I have no idea how much I need to use.

446
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,479
-- It depends how much crap you have in your pool. Well, exactly.
-- Yeah,

447
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,170
how much use and all that. So, anyway, anyway, but,

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,199
and I don't want to be like a jerk and like,

449
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,530
h chlorine, but at the same time it's like I want to run my pool this summer.

450
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,170
So I bought the biggest bucket I could.

451
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,630
It is hilarious to me how

452
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,910
fragile all of our supply chains are across everything.

453
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,699
-- Well, it's just
-- in time delivery. Right. Here's something nobody ever thinks of.

454
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,239
Ok, you're a car company and everybody's like, oh,

455
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,869
the car company should have had extra chips and parts and blah, blah, blah,

456
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,829
every time there's like a storm.

457
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:22,089
It's like,

458
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,910
it's like you want to have a warehouse full of $50 million of inventory of parts.

459
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,989
And they're like, yeah, then

460
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,369
I'm like, that is a

461
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:32,699
pile of $50 million cash sitting there doing nothing.

462
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:36,670
-- Well, and in the case of technology it's getting old. Right.
-- Yeah.

463
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,209
It's devaluing, like, like there's a little counter running down,

464
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,849
except in the case of my video card,

465
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:44,660
I checked my video cards actually appreciated 50% in the last year.

466
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,069
That's a different problem.

467
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:50,319
But, I mean, even, even all the busted technology supply chain stuff. Right.

468
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,089
I mean, it's just,

469
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,160
it is,

470
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,130
it is comical to me

471
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:58,689
how all of this works. And, and again, now everyone's a supply chain expert.

472
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,400
So they're saying, oh, you should have had stock,

473
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,459
you should have known this was coming.

474
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,109
You should have this, you should have that. And it's like

475
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,339
nobody expected a pandemic.

476
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,579
Nobody realized any of this was going to happen. It's just it, it

477
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,140
is what it is. And unfortunately,

478
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,099
historically, when you're not in a pandemic,

479
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,359
it is possible to maybe switch manufacturers, spin up resources, whatever.

480
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,489
But now all of that is 1000 times harder than it was before.

481
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,579
And so there's obvious lags in anything that happens and it's, it sucks. But like,

482
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,170
-- it just is, you know, like,
-- honestly, people are and I get that it really does.

483
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,650
It's very unfortunate right now, especially like, again,

484
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,189
locally in my province because we suck at handling COVID.

485
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,050
Everybody's doing school from home for the next three weeks

486
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:44,849
and I get it like, people need computers at home so their kids can do school from home

487
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,199
and that's really difficult right now.

488
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:47,359
You know,

489
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,380
I finally managed to source a Ryzen five CP

490
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,050
for my desktop and holy cow totally worth the upgrade

491
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,829
as, as quote unquote bad as it is.

492
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:59,579
We're not talking mass starvation levels of supply chain disruption.

493
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,189
Well, and that's just it. Right.

494
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,300
I mean, for the most part,

495
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,219
I would say most of what's happened has

496
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:08,900
been inconveniences versus like famine and plague.

497
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,180
Well, there's been real economic effects and hardship

498
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,540
but

499
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,430
it's, it's, we'll be able to recover from this.

500
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,859
It's not gonna be pretty, but it's not the end of the world.

501
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,109
Right. Right. And I mean, this is, we're marvelously off top.

502
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,910
Well, I guess, do we have a topic? Not really,

503
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,959
but, I mean, this is, this is part of it. Right.

504
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,250
It's like you look at like our, our pipeline mess right now.

505
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,969
Is it going to end the company? Probably not? Are we going to recover? Probably.

506
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,819
Are we gonna have a crappy couple of weeks?

507
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,810
Definitely.

508
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:41,650
-- Well, I'm, I'm not on the east coast, so I think we'll be fine. I mean,
-- well,

509
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:45,959
if you have a refinery in the middle of town, you're golden. You know,

510
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,050
I mean, luckily I fill my car up with gas once every three months right now. So

511
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,569
it's pretty ok.

512
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:55,260
What's interesting to me too is again the trade off? Ok.

513
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,260
So we want to have a more robust system. Ok.

514
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,380
Well,

515
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,380
that means we need to allocate large amounts of money

516
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,959
and resources to buy stuff and set it aside.

517
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,859
But, but is it worth it? And exactly. And,

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,750
and the thing is that has a real cost,

519
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,949
not only do we have to buy the stuff and stick it in a warehouse and store it properly.

520
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,420
Right. Because

521
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,339
again, people forget like you can't just,

522
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:14,160
you can

523
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,805
just have a pile of auto parts sitting out in the rain.

524
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:18,364
You can't just like computer chips.

525
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,175
You have to kind of store them a little bit carefully, you know,

526
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:25,005
you don't want them to get wet or cold or, you know, whatever or stolen

527
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:25,714
or stolen.

528
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:28,324
And then there's other stuff like food.

529
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:31,604
For example, I love watching Steve MRE 1986 info.

530
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:36,484
You know, the guy that does the MRE eating and reviews and even the good ones,

531
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,449
you know, you're looking at 5, 10 years lifespan and you got to rotate them out.

532
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,209
Right.

533
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:44,859
And this is like my perfect, a great example.

534
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,050
Diesel for diesel generators for data centers,

535
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,319
you have to rotate the diesel because diesel and gasoline goes sour,

536
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,569
it acidifies over time.

537
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,189
Yeah, I have this problem every year when actually.

538
00:23:56,199 --> 00:24:00,209
So I just had to start my lawn mower up for the season and, and I was,

539
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,155
I have done no maintenance to my lawnmower in five years now and every,

540
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:08,685
every spring I hope this is the year I get to buy a new lawn mower because, like, I just,

541
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,694
I refuse to buy a new until the other one's dead.

542
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:11,515
And

543
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:12,395
I

544
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:15,625
empty, I make sure I empty the gas out every year because if I don't empty the gas out,

545
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:16,744
it's a nightmare to start.

546
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,645
And I dump in my new gas.

547
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:23,285
I pull it and first pull it starts and I'm like, well, crap. Like, no, that's not nice.

548
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,104
-- I want a new lawnmower.
-- Well, just do it.

549
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,839
I'm a cheapskate. I'm not buying a new lawn mower till I need one.

550
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,579
-- But I mean,
-- and that's a perfect example. A small scale.

551
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:34,239
It's easy, just empty out your lawn mower, put fresh gas in whatever.

552
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,280
But when you're a data center with, you know,

553
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,780
50,000 or a couple of 100,000 L or gallons of diesel, what do you do?

554
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,660
Do you

555
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:46,329
ship some on site and then a month later, sell it back to the company for like,

556
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:47,530
90% of what it's worth.

557
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,410
-- You know,
-- I actually don't know what, what companies do about.

558
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,930
So I know my experience from long,

559
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:56,359
long ago is I work somewhere that had a small diesel

560
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,689
generator and we just ran it once a year and,

561
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,390
you know, used up the diesel.

562
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,359
But I, you're right, like, in these enormous data centers,

563
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,605
I wonder what they do with,

564
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:05,956
you can't run

565
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:09,845
like a week's worth of diesel, you know, that would cost too much. Yeah.

566
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:10,715
Well, exactly.

567
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:14,056
So, I would assume that they're selling it back or selling it off to somebody.

568
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,166
-- I don't know.
-- That's a good question.

569
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:18,206
If someone knows, like, tell us, I would love to, I'm too lazy to look,

570
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,885
but I would love to know the answer.

571
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:20,406
Yeah.

572
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:24,625
Well, there's a variety of strategies depending on, also part of it is how much,

573
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:25,005
right?

574
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:25,355
Like,

575
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,121
you know, and this is one of the reason, um,

576
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,121
a lot of these data centers are going to renewables is

577
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:32,072
because renewables tend not to fail or when they do fail.

578
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:36,921
Renewals are interesting in that a lot of renewables, especially solar kind of fail

579
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:41,112
gracefully and gradually like two or three solar panels fail. Ok. No big deal.

580
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:44,241
You know, your steam turbine at a nuclear power plant fails. Oh, boy.

581
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:44,531
Yeah.

582
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:45,952
Right. Right. Exactly.

583
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:47,041
I suspect

584
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:51,109
what is happening is the clever people will try and find better,

585
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,630
more efficient solutions that also dovetail with more robust systems.

586
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,319
Nah, I don't think anyone cares.

587
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,739
I think in a month we'll forget about this and it won't matter.

588
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,630
Well, solar is taking off and solar plus like,

589
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,550
well not tesla power walls or whatever, you know, energy storage

590
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,510
that will result in a very

591
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,869
robust, gracefully failing grid.

592
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:13,890
Oh, wait.

593
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,140
So you're suggesting because of the fuel shortage,

594
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,339
people are potentially going to look at renewables more at this time or

595
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:25,329
they're going to realize that maybe depending on this stuff isn't so great.

596
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:29,949
And so for example, on the spreadsheet of solution A and Solution B oh,

597
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,410
maybe we need to add some costs to because see one

598
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,380
thing I hate about oil and the petrochemical industry is it's so

599
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:42,119
heavily subsidized in so many weird ways that the true cost of it isn't apparent.

600
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:43,349
I mean, yeah,

601
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,119
that's right.

602
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:47,520
And I think as people, as a, you know,

603
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,969
global warming being a bit of an issue, you know,

604
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:53,150
those polarized caps in Greenland melting, we're becoming aware that, oh,

605
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,209
there are some real risks and costs to this that

606
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:59,910
we need to take into account when looking at a power solution, you know,

607
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,060
do we go with renewable or diesel generator?

608
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:03,719
-- I mean,
-- look, that's,

609
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,349
I think so far down this path. It, it's not even, there's nothing we can say.

610
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,150
I think from,

611
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,959
if you just pull back to the immediate threat of you have infrastructure,

612
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,849
infrastructure is down, are people going to make concerted

613
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,719
internal changes to make sure they're not the next colonial pipeline?

614
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,550
And I think the answer is probably not.

615
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,630
Oh, absolutely not because there's no money in it.

616
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,944
You'll have a handful of companies that look at this and they take it seriously.

617
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:31,074
But I think for the most part it was solar winds and then code

618
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:31,314
COV

619
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:35,344
and it was not you before that and it's a pipeline today and it's just,

620
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,484
I just think this is, this is the, this is it,

621
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:41,094
this is, this is how it works now.

622
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:45,305
But for example, Biden did commit to electrifying the US federal fleet, right.

623
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,224
The car fleet, the truck fleet. Sure.

624
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:51,535
And for, for example, that is something now that in hindsight is like, oh,

625
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,354
that's actually a really good choice because these pipelines

626
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:54,834
were not as reliable as we thought they were.

627
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:55,614
Well. Sure.

628
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,250
Right.

629
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,500
And I'm talking about those kind of decisions where,

630
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,780
what I'm saying is people are not going to actually,

631
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:04,609
I think it's actually better not to solve the direct problem in front of us,

632
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,609
but to find a new technology or a new solution that makes that problem obsolete.

633
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,329
Like the horse poo problem in London.

634
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:11,890
Right.

635
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,510
Something I think about a lot

636
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,290
is you look at kind of any internal process in any organization

637
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,579
and do you know how you get change?

638
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:23,869
You usually get your change by changing the people? Right. Because

639
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,569
new people have new ideas and they don't want to do things

640
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,410
the old way or they just might not know the old way.

641
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,780
And this is the same thing with kind of like technologies and

642
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,420
stuff is if you think you're going to slowly upgrade your legacy,

643
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,380
you're probably wrong,

644
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,619
you need to Greenfield that crap and eventually just like throw out the old.

645
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,969
And I think all of this, all of this infrastructure, all of these supply chains,

646
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:43,380
all of everything is the same way.

647
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,209
We're not going to fix the old stuff.

648
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,250
Now, at the same time, it's super easy to say this,

649
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,689
but it's obviously very difficult to create change.

650
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:55,130
I think this is part of why start ups are so successful is because start ups

651
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,540
tend to find a totally new solution to a totally new problem or a problem.

652
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,489
-- People didn't even know they had
-- sometimes and then a

653
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,290
giant company buys them and destroys their business monologue,

654
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,989
which is unfortunately part of it.

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,209
But

656
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,920
I there was a time when Amazon was not the world's

657
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,939
-- biggest company or Apple or Google
-- Amazon always lost money.

658
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:15,739
Remember that

659
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,150
they were perpetually in the red

660
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,119
except for what,

661
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,819
like November and then they would make money because of Black Friday or something.

662
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:28,430
So I think that's part of the solution space here is, it's like rewriting Firefox

663
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:32,095
isn't the solution. It's finding maybe something better than web browsers.

664
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,465
You know, it's that kind of thinking.

665
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:35,735
I think that will actually get us propel us ahead.

666
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:36,345
Right. Because

667
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:40,086
no amount of securing pipelines is fundamentally going to fix the problem.

668
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:43,526
But moving to an electric fleet of vehicles will basically

669
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:46,336
-- make the problem go away
-- to a degree maybe.

670
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:50,462
And, and I just think securing of this industrial infrastructure is,

671
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:54,241
is a ridiculous problem that I can't even begin to understand

672
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,322
or trying to make it environmentally.

673
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,812
I'm not even going to say environmentally friendly but environmentally neutral.

674
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:00,962
Probably

675
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:01,751
there's just

676
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,442
pipelines leak. That's

677
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,241
-- just that, that's reality,
-- which is

678
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:08,531
not at all related to ransomware.

679
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:09,510
Yeah.

680
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:10,349
Yeah.

681
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:14,869
Well, computers, I guess here's my one parting thought because we,

682
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,310
we are out of time, but kind of all of this is

683
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,949
the one thing I think is becoming completely obvious from all of this is

684
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,660
we like to talk about cybersecurity and meet space as two different things.

685
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,810
I think

686
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,479
this

687
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,915
is the irrefutable proof that there is no

688
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:35,964
longer a separation between cyberspace and meets space.

689
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:38,035
It's all just reality now.

690
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,805
-- Self driving cars or computers attack, like with a car wrapped around.
-- Right.

691
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:46,314
It's all the same cybersecurity or cyberspace is meets space.

692
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:47,834
Everything has a chip in it now,

693
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,994
including me because I had my COVID vaccine.

694
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:54,344
Wait, I don't. Did you get mind control or tracking? I forget which one.

695
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,224
-- No,
-- five G, five G, five G

696
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,150
anyway.

697
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,540
