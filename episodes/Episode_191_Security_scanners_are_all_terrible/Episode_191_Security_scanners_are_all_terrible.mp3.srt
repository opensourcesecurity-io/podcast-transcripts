Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,869
-- Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh
-- Bresser.

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,180
So, what's new,

3
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,539
-- ah,
-- spring was here? And then it went away.

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:19,149
As you can see from that chart, I showed you earlier freeze thaw days and I,

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:19,500
oh

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,079
my goodness. I, I

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,479
don't even know what to say. It's so bad. It's so comically bad.

8
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:28,639
We'll put, we'll put a link to the chart.

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,200
Kurt tweeted about in the show notes,

10
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:33,560
but like it's indescribably bad is all I can say.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,259
Yeah.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,939
And, and I think it's actually, well,

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,860
it actually ties in with what we want to talk about today,

14
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,369
which is the container scanning and, and the train wreck.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,900
That is most container scanning reports.

16
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,979
Oh, I thought you meant indescribably bad.

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,450
But

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,299
-- also
-- that

19
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,509
I think you can describe how bad it is by

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,189
words.

21
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:56,770
All right. So yes, we transition nicely out of our before the topic banter.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,380
And so basically, by the time this podcast is published,

23
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,220
I will have released a seven part blog series

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,050
on

25
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,660
security scanners

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,629
and

27
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:09,440
I work

28
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,800
well. No, not just containers specifically.

29
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,150
I mean, containers are an aspect of this.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,419
But I I cover kind of the gamut of scanning from. I talk about code scanning.

31
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,459
I talk about

32
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,370
I call it composition scanning,

33
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,720
but that's kind of what a container scanner would would be by most definitions.

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,529
And I also talk about application scanning which is

35
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,099
code scanning and application scanning have been around for a while.

36
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,739
Composition scanning is something kind of

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,040
and I think it's more interesting and I think

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,660
it has the potential to not completely suck.

39
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,699
The other two kind of suck.

40
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,680
But uh I apologize in advance if any of you listening,

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,010
work for any of the scanning companies.

42
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,660
I don't, I don't dislike you all. I, I don't like some of you though.

43
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,959
Uh So anyway, anyway, the reason I did this is

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,139
in my day job, I am getting these security scan reports from customers

45
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,809
that run them

46
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,000
often

47
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,889
uh across who knows what, sometimes they're using, you know,

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,720
containers that might be years old,

49
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,149
sometimes they're running versions of an application that are very old,

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,910
sometimes it's very new and

51
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:16,330
I get a report and usually I get something like please fix this by Friday. It's like

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,320
no. And so

53
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,289
the reason I started writing these blog posts is

54
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,570
because there's a huge knowledge gap in terms of what

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,860
these scanners are actually doing and what we as

56
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:32,160
kind of humans need to be doing about them.

57
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,250
And of course the vendors are

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,570
in some cases, peddling snake oil

59
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,080
and in some cases, like they have good intentions,

60
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,619
but they're still not quite doing what we actually need.

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,449
And so I figured it is time to start an education campaign because

62
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:52,546
grown weary of explaining this over and over and over every single day of the week.

63
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:52,725
Well,

64
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:56,985
my other thought would be also what are these scanners actually capable of now,

65
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:59,526
you know, both in terms of technology, but also in terms,

66
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:02,906
a lot of people forget about the data feeds that these scanners consume and need

67
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:06,595
are, you know, because that was actually the first part of my career was working at

68
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,686
defense and isight or sorry, isight partners.

69
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:13,255
And then I defense, you know, where we produced that kind of data and speaking from,

70
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,186
you know, over a decade's experience and also as the CV guy that

71
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:20,972
-- a very excruciatingly nontrivial task,
-- it is very difficult.

72
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,912
And I mean, this is a topic

73
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,712
in the series. You haven't read it yet because I haven't published them all yet.

74
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,251
I'm going to stagger them every couple days just because I don't

75
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,561
want to like dump them all on the planet all at once.

76
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:33,951
But basically, this is, this is a problem.

77
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:36,151
And one of the things I talk about is the

78
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:40,132
fact that if your scanner vendor isn't a CV ECNA,

79
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:44,912
a CD E numbering authority, if they can't assign C vs, like what are they doing?

80
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:48,037
And I've seen some are any of them?

81
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,317
Yeah, Well, Snick is, I'm trying to think,

82
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:54,598
I think Aqua might be also now those two for sure.

83
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,807
And I feel like there might be some more. But

84
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:00,488
what I see from a lot of these, I think white sources too, actually,

85
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,598
now that I think of it, but white source also,

86
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:06,498
I know assigns their own I DS and I run into white source, I DS on a regular basis.

87
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,917
White source is not AC N A unless they have a different name.

88
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,677
OK, then maybe they're not, I'm running off memory here.

89
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,638
-- So by all means, yeah,
-- Nike is,

90
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:17,644
but it's also S NKE, for example, is only AC N A for stuff they discover,

91
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,243
which is

92
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:20,313
a start

93
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:20,783
we'll say,

94
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:21,683
oh yeah. No.

95
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:26,334
Well, and part of that too is, is a, is a consequence of how the CN A system is set up,

96
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:26,604
right?

97
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,623
That the ideally you want people to kind of cover their own stuff as it

98
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:33,704
were not be like some jerk like Kurt who covers like all of open source.

99
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:38,764
Right. Right. So, so anyway, these scanners, some will just assign their own I DS.

100
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,364
And when, when the security finding will call

101
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,859
doesn't have a CD E ID. It is generally of dubious quality.

102
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,250
And like, for example, I,

103
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,540
I know there's a handful of white source ID

104
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,769
si found that are actually duplicates of one another.

105
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,179
And so I'm trying to report it to them. I have no idea how to do it.

106
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,130
I I if someone listening has a contact or works for white source

107
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,649
and you know how I can like officially report dupes in your,

108
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,320
your scanning feed.

109
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,170
Like please let me know I'm not your customer but I parse a lot of your reports.

110
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:11,089
That's annoying to me. But that's, that's a thing. I also

111
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:16,036
see there, there are some scanners using, we'll say private databases,

112
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:18,395
we call them where they are not open to the public

113
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:21,496
and the quality of the data coming from them is hot.

114
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:24,135
Garbage is the nice way I will describe them.

115
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:27,485
Well, the thing I always ran into is, you know, the numbers sell, right?

116
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:30,325
People want a phone book of vulnerabilities,

117
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:34,256
not like a thinly properly curated list.

118
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:37,186
Yeah, except your phone book is full of garbage. Like

119
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,786
because like how many people keep saying, you know, oh, this part

120
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:42,022
because more CV S than this product. Therefore, it's more bad.

121
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,351
It's like, oh wow, that's

122
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,231
that

123
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:49,302
happen. But you're not right. But yeah, if you have a private database,

124
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:52,141
-- it probably sucks that that's what I'm going to say
-- there.

125
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,541
Well, I just also love because then,

126
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,782
then they share this report with you and it's kind of like, well, cool, what is this?

127
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,351
And they're like, it's in this private database and it's like,

128
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:00,661
I don't have access to it,

129
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,832
you know, what makes it even worse is I'll get findings from a scanner that says, oh,

130
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,522
this, this finding has this idea.

131
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,541
I'm like, I don't know what that means. And then I go back to the customer

132
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,227
and I say, unless you give me

133
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:14,437
something I can look at to identify what this even is like, I can't help you.

134
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,747
And then occasionally they will come back with the information I

135
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,398
need and then I look them up and I'm like,

136
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,747
this is terrible.

137
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:23,667
Like these findings are beyond terrible.

138
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:26,787
And I just II I tell the customers, I'm like, look, these findings are, are trash,

139
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:28,268
like they're not security issues.

140
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:29,488
I don't know what to tell you. Right?

141
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:32,548
If your scanners reporting them, your scanners broke, that's the answer.

142
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,977
Well, and I think that's a big part of the problem, right?

143
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:37,148
Is, is the scanners technology itself can be

144
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:38,273
or decent

145
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,234
or whatever, somewhere in between,

146
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:44,223
-- but it doesn't matter if the data feed is
-- crap and, and yes, I mean, that's really,

147
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:45,694
that's very, very true because like I,

148
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,433
I'll kind of give you an example of what I see is there are

149
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:52,864
scanners that do a very nice job of identifying what is in the application,

150
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:53,544
right?

151
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:56,783
There's still the questionable aspect of,

152
00:06:56,794 --> 00:07:01,093
am I actually using the feature in the dependency in the application?

153
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:04,753
But that's a harder problem and I will, I won't give them a pass,

154
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:06,033
but I'll say I understand.

155
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,769
But then there's also vendors that have scanners that like they'll just detect,

156
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,549
you're running a patchy http D somewhere they have no

157
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,359
knowledge of version numbers and they just be like,

158
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,450
here's every http D vulnerability for the last 20

159
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,470
years and it's like this is beyond useless.

160
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,709
-- Can't parse this
-- list. Yeah. No, I think alarm fatigue is a real thing. Like

161
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,049
the other problem too is how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? Right.

162
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,459
Like, if I give you here's 10 vulnerabilities.

163
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:39,220
I found that that's actually a human addressable number of vulnerabilities.

164
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,920
But if I give you something with 1000

165
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,970
and I mean, I've seen scan reports that were clearly

166
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,269
not good because I remember this one came in

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,359
and it was, it was big with an Excel file

168
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,730
and it listed all these things about like how

169
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,769
our product didn't safely store credit card numbers.

170
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,339
And I went to the product team. I'm like sweet.

171
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,119
Like our product now takes credit cards and people can buy updates and

172
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,779
stuff because I don't remember that being mentioned as a feature anytime soon,

173
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,089
although it's really cool

174
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,769
and they're like, yeah, no, we don't. This product doesn't let you buy stuff.

175
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,079
And I'm like, that's what I thought. OK, never mind then.

176
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,140
And they literally just cut and paste like an Ecommerce template report and

177
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,121
I guess left the original findings or something.

178
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:17,821
My suspicion is that's an application scanner.

179
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,501
I see that a lot where someone will run

180
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:22,821
a scanner

181
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,980
for like I, I won't, I won't pick on a specific vendor.

182
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,161
But like you have your, your website running,

183
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,471
essentially you point a scanner at it and it, it scans it.

184
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,059
And one of the issues I see is it will, for example,

185
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,830
let's say if they put like my favorite example

186
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,301
is in and this happens in Cabana actually,

187
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,181
which is something

188
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:45,081
plastic builds is if you put a slash at the end of any URL,

189
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,471
it gives you an error message in

190
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:50,062
JSON because basically, once you put a slash on the end,

191
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,781
it's trying to do some api magic on the back end and whatever,

192
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,822
it's just how it's built.

193
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:57,802
And the scanner interprets that as you allow directory listings.

194
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,302
And so it literally will have like 300 findings that

195
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,942
all say you allow directory listings on these end points.

196
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:07,291
It's like, oh my goodness, no, like look at the freaking output.

197
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:08,611
You worthless piece of trash.

198
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:09,802
-- We don't.
-- Well, see.

199
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:12,942
And that's I think where we get into one of the core problems of scanners is

200
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:17,742
they are actually incentivized to generate false positives. Right? It looks good.

201
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,103
Right. Actually, I,

202
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,913
I had this come up,

203
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:24,773
I was talking to a company that does like third party security

204
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:27,382
audits and they were saying last time we reviewed your product,

205
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,343
we didn't find a lot of stuff.

206
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,953
I'm like, that's good. I don't, you know, that means we're doing it well. Right.

207
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:35,103
I don't want a phone book of findings from you people. That means we suck.

208
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:35,903
You know, I want

209
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:36,192
a

210
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,383
findings and it's this kind of the same deal with

211
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:41,414
these scanners where if you send me a phone book,

212
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,304
it's more likely your scanner sucks.

213
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,223
It's not that I'm doing a bad job.

214
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,684
You know, this all reminds me of is house inspections. Right.

215
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,064
Every time I've, like, been involved in buying a house, you know,

216
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,823
you get the house inspector for like, cost 2,

217
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,814
300 bucks and every time they come at you with like some, you know, half inch,

218
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,064
two inch thick printout with like,

219
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:01,364
you know, it's like thermal scans to show where the heat's leaking out.

220
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,583
And in every case they've

221
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:07,715
missed like major, easily found deficiencies that I, you know, like,

222
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,815
I remember in the last house I lived there were gas

223
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,945
lines that were not capped off like they were turned off

224
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,655
because there had been like a gas dryer and a gas stove which had been removed,

225
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:16,844
obviously because, you know, they're crazy,

226
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:20,304
dangerous and expensive and they never put a cap on the gas line.

227
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,825
Right. Costs like a buck. I love my gas stove.

228
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,565
So, but, you know, these are things that are easily found and of course,

229
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:31,015
it makes me doubt the whole competency and the whole, just the process

230
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,065
because every single time it's just been like,

231
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,986
like, what was the value in this again?

232
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:38,906
It. Right. Right. And I mean, home inspections are, I hate them.

233
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,716
-- Well,
-- they'll find like gross deficiencies.

234
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,116
But, like, usually it's kind of like stuff you would have noticed, like, oh,

235
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,806
look at this two inch crack in the foundation.

236
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:45,505
Right.

237
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:49,676
I've had, but, I mean, I know people that had inspections done and like,

238
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,265
a year later they realize that the

239
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,106
inspector missed something substantial about the house.

240
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,426
-- Like, it totally happens.
-- Oh, I think that's the rule. Not the exception.

241
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:57,825
Yeah.

242
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:58,466
Yeah. I mean,

243
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:58,586
I,

244
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:01,947
I, uh, I, I'll never forget the first time I bought a house,

245
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,747
I was handed the inspection report and it was of

246
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,156
course enormous and I went through it and I'm like,

247
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,296
yeah, I don't care about any of this stuff.

248
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:07,546
And the, and the realtor was like,

249
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:09,187
what do you mean you're not going to have them fixed?

250
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,146
And I'm like, I don't care, this is all stupid. It doesn't matter.

251
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:14,447
And then I'll never forget I went to sell that house and they got an inspection of it.

252
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,476
Like you have to fix all these things in a week.

253
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:19,276
And I remember I just went back with like, I'm not fixing any of this.

254
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,747
You're not buying my house anymore. And then they're like, oh, wait, wait, wait. Ok.

255
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,387
Ok, we, we won't make you fix everything.

256
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,906
I'm like, I'm literally fixing none of this stuff, right? If you're not the house,

257
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,807
buy it, like none of this matters.

258
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:31,668
They were like, ok, fine. But it's like, yeah, like this is a crap report.

259
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:33,487
-- I'm not, I'm not accepting this.
-- So OK.

260
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:36,197
So scanners, container, scanners and all these applications.

261
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,297
So because there's several different kinds of

262
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:40,888
scanning that is actually going on here,

263
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:41,007
right?

264
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,937
Like there's the sort of I'm going to call it the underlying operating system.

265
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,067
And that can mean like an actual bare metal

266
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:50,468
virtual machine slash all the stuff we chuck into a container nowadays, right?

267
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,348
And I guess even to a point you would see that in serverless, even

268
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,049
serverless, right? You have underlying operating system

269
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:58,638
bits somewhere to some degree, right?

270
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,499
Whether or not they're exposed, who knows?

271
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:03,789
Well, there's the blob of the application and whatever it pulls in.

272
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,549
So the dependencies basically and that's

273
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,448
you were mentioning the composition scanning.

274
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,318
Well, composition scanning is kind of what's in it.

275
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,309
So you've got, I split it up into three pieces.

276
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:15,588
There's code scanning which is like static code analysis, right?

277
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:20,789
And that's been around for a long time like scanning CN C++ and Java work. OK? But

278
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,179
once you get into things like javascript and Python, it's, it's not good at all.

279
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,250
And even scanning C and C++ are not great,

280
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,590
but we say they're not completely terrible,

281
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,479
which is the highest praise I can give for,

282
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:36,969
for scanners. And and then you've got composition scanning,

283
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,929
which is where you scan the like everything, right?

284
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,489
That's where you're scanning the operating system in the container,

285
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,000
you're scanning the application you put in, you're scanning like everything

286
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,219
in the thing. OK.

287
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,869
Be it dependencies, be it the code you wrote whatever.

288
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,330
And then you've got what I call application scanning.

289
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,219
And that's like what we just talked about where,

290
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,909
you know, you might have a scanner that scans your website and then it reports,

291
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,460
I've never seen an application scanner report anything resembling good findings.

292
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,630
The only thing I've ever seen is where they

293
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,549
catch some really obviously out of date server.

294
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,030
But usually that finding is buried in with, you know, 3000 other things.

295
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,299
-- I
-- mean, maybe, but like

296
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,679
I'm not in an environment where we're running anything out of date in that regard.

297
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,940
So the findings I'm seeing are, are bad.

298
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,880
Now at the same time, I will say composition scanning

299
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,559
is, I think

300
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,099
it has a future

301
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,119
and it actually it's going to be useful is what I say.

302
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,400
I don't think I would describe it as it

303
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,039
is useful today necessarily because it has value.

304
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,609
But people don't understand what it does

305
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,239
is the challenge. And so

306
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:46,409
I'll, I'll give you the example of what I I'm seeing. So people will run a scanner

307
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,119
and I mean, pick one. I don't, I don't care which one

308
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,049
they run it on a container

309
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,330
that has a product that obviously they're expected

310
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,650
to deploy in their environment in some way.

311
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,809
And then it's going to report on all of

312
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,450
the findings from the operating system because obviously,

313
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,770
if you're running a container, your container is built on top of something, right?

314
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,159
And for example, in the case of what I'm dealing with, it's just

315
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,429
generally

316
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:15,039
sent os which is basically Red Hat Enterprise. Linux is kind of the foundation here.

317
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,460
-- I
-- forget how they redid the upstream. But yeah, basically

318
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,659
fundamentally, let's just say that

319
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,250
right? Because it, it makes it easier.

320
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,719
I'm sure there's Red Hat people screaming at their podcast player right now. But

321
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,260
I, I love you all keep, keep up the good work.

322
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,159
And then there's the thing you put on top of the container base image, right?

323
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,099
And this is basically, you know, like the value add of, of the organ

324
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,409
where obviously, in our case,

325
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,809
we have the elastic stack and we put pieces

326
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,789
of it into a container and it gets configured

327
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,659
and then it gets sent to the container registries

328
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,380
and then people take those and they scan them.

329
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,049
So you've got,

330
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,510
you scan the operating system and obviously scanning operating systems.

331
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,020
We basically understand today where you can say here's a CV E ID

332
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,650
and the operating system vendor did or didn't fix it.

333
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,020
Most. I, I think we

334
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,359
agree that most vendors now have rational

335
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,760
and same package management systems with updates.

336
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,270
-- Yeah,
-- it's, it's pretty good.

337
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,200
But the one thing the container scanners are starting to do

338
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,919
that

339
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,200
was the big secret of open source that you and I have

340
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,349
known for years and it's not well known outside of kind of

341
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:26,400
the operating systems is there are more security issues than

342
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,950
a distribution can fix in a reasonable amount of time.

343
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,890
And so every, every open source,

344
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,630
every Linux distribution has to pick and choose and

345
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,010
say we're going to fix these security issues,

346
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,169
we're not going to fix these security issues.

347
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,130
Well, also a lot of these issues don't

348
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,409
really matter that much.

349
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:48,179
I mean, yeah, they can be chained together to do something maybe a bit naughtier.

350
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,289
But like so many of them,

351
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,820
like I remember my first sort of one of the major vulnerabilities I found was the,

352
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,219
what was it?

353
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:55,580
The I

354
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,450
cuzzy.com file was world readable and it had like

355
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,070
your user name and password or whatever for your

356
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:00,450
I

357
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,020
Izzy configuration, right?

358
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,179
Izzy was this like network attached file storage thing?

359
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,859
We were talking like 20 some years ago, the vendor of it lipped out

360
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,150
borderline legal threats, flip their stuff and I literally was

361
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,210
puzzled. I was like an 18 or 19 year old and I'm like, just chow in the file or see

362
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:17,590
it

363
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,510
like it's,

364
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,809
well, no ch model because it's world readable, right?

365
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,260
Just it still works like I tested it, it still works with the, you know,

366
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,409
other minus re I was, I was mystified as to why they were so hostile.

367
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,630
But then I realized because, you know,

368
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,840
for them to fix this little thing properly was going to be, you know,

369
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:36,250
probably the equivalent of several man years of effort in total.

370
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,072
Right, to ship an update just to do a chow of a file. Right.

371
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,271
It was, it was a very large vendor that's, you know, if I name them,

372
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,192
everybody would be like, oh, yeah, then they, they,

373
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,512
they are known to take a while and have rather

374
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,231
-- slow updates.
-- That's all the vendors.

375
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,861
Well, some more so than others, although 20 years ago,

376
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,312
that was all the vendors actually.

377
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:57,952
Yes, the reality is with a lot of open source projects, fixing some of these flaws is,

378
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,471
is quite, you know, labor intensive

379
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,791
and quite frankly, a lot of them, you know,

380
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,982
they'll just get it on the next update of the operating system or whatever, right?

381
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,241
So they, they're kind of like whatever, we'll fix this 3 to 6 months.

382
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,374
If you, if you really care, go fix it,

383
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:13,553
I would view it as return on investment

384
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:18,073
where fixing important issues is very important,

385
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,183
obviously, right, where you want

386
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:22,453
like heart bleeds to be fixed quickly,

387
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:27,423
but you don't care so much about a trivial issue that let's say is only

388
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:31,104
exploitable under certain circumstances that also probably has

389
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,014
a workaround that if you really care,

390
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:37,014
you can, you know, change file permissions or, or delete execute or whatever.

391
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:37,713
And so kind of the

392
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,196
the big secret

393
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:43,696
is that there are probably hundreds or thousands of unfixed,

394
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:47,145
crappy security issues in every Linux distribution on the planet.

395
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:49,765
And some of these scanners are starting to find them and in fact,

396
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:54,215
I just got one the other day where I get a report at 600 CV ES, I'm like,

397
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:55,686
there's no way this is real, right?

398
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,546
Like, tell me what you did, you screwed something up.

399
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,906
The guy's like, no, no, this one's real. I'm like, I don't know.

400
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:03,515
And I, I, so I started looking at it, every one of them was valid.

401
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:07,156
Like, well, let me explain to you why this happened

402
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,630
and they were like, oh, ok, that's fine because, I mean,

403
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,349
most of the people when I talked to them are very reasonable.

404
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,469
Every now and then you get someone that's like, no, you have to fix them all.

405
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,689
I'm like, well, you can tell me that but not going to happen.

406
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,209
It's weird to me that we have this, I, like,

407
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:24,010
there's so many people in software that want the software to be perfectly fixed.

408
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,270
Every bug, every hole squashed. And it's like,

409
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,239
but we don't, that's not how the world works.

410
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,790
-- Like every road I've ever driven on is not perfect.
-- Right. Right. Exactly.

411
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,209
-- And that's
-- ok. And,

412
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,829
well, not only that, I mean, look,

413
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:43,390
we all have finite resources if you expect a product to have a completely clean scan,

414
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,630
that either means all I'm doing is fixing scan results.

415
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,229
So I'm not making the product better or I've done something to trick the scanner,

416
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,979
which is even worse because people do that though.

417
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:59,255
See that where people will do something just to shut up the scanner,

418
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,494
not because it's better.

419
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:04,375
And one of the examples I use actually is in one of the posts talking about.

420
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:07,415
Do you remember when Debbie and screwed up their open SSL?

421
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:10,244
And it, and produced predictable random numbers?

422
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:15,375
The reason that happened is because someone wanted to shut up a compiler warning.

423
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:19,229
And so they basically mailed the open SSL list saying, hey, I want to do this.

424
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,609
So the compiler stops complaining and basically no one replied to like, oh,

425
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,589
it must be fine then.

426
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,540
And they did, it's like, whoops, that was wrong.

427
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,150
Yeah. Yeah. It just went based on process ideas, the seed for the randomness.

428
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,989
And so you had a grand total of 64 K keys,

429
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,630
-- right?
-- I remember dealing with that issue

430
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,489
-- but,
-- but, and, and I call these maybe positives where if you don't know,

431
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,989
doing nothing is better than screwing something up, right?

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,369
Like,

433
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,729
don't do something just to shut up your

434
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:50,089
scanner because that's worse than nothing unquestionably.

435
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,349
-- Well,
-- I mean, by definition, if you knew what was going on,

436
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,969
you probably would have fixed it by now.

437
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:56,349
So, you know, a scanner is triggering this thing.

438
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,209
And if it's like if it was a really serious important thing,

439
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:03,244
-- somebody other than the scanner would have already, you,
-- you'd think, I mean,

440
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:04,443
and that's a lot of it too.

441
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,723
So anyway, we've got the operating system problem and there's lots of cvs,

442
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,173
but here's the deal, right.

443
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:13,364
If you look at, we'll pick on Red Hat or

444
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,154
Tu or D

445
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:14,673
or so

446
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:21,024
or any of these, they have stellar security teams that are on top of all of this.

447
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,494
And so in all seriousness,

448
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,203
if you're running a version of any of the major

449
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:28,994
Linux distributions that's basically updated within a couple of days

450
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:30,978
or even weeks. In many cases,

451
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,478
you're in good shape.

452
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,067
Well, I would say that's true of almost any operating system at this point.

453
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,958
Like even Microsoft Apple, they generally crank out security updates.

454
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,078
But then you run into the situation where literally,

455
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:45,838
I've seen people running things still on Windows XP or even Windows 95 or 98 because,

456
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,287
you know, embedded hardware,

457
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:50,998
but that's a different problem from this and that's ok.

458
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:53,248
Well, it's a different problem from this until, you know,

459
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,917
somebody's running a containerized piece of software that they don't ever update.

460
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,432
Actually, I wonder,

461
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:02,031
I'm going to see about scanning something comically

462
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,842
old because I bet that would be funny.

463
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:04,362
But

464
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,352
not today anyway. Anyway.

465
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:09,552
So we'll move up a level and now we have the thing

466
00:21:09,562 --> 00:21:12,901
I added to the container and this is where the scanners also.

467
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,521
And now the quality starts to vary greatly

468
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,641
because once you're dealing with the operating system,

469
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,832
there's usually like package manifests and things like that.

470
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:21,192
Right.

471
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:21,671
So the,

472
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:24,592
the scanners do a great job of understanding what's there

473
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,546
and the versions they screw up back parts a lot.

474
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:28,026
But that's another story. Now,

475
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:33,495
once you get to my application, things start to get hairy because for example,

476
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:36,026
you may or may not be including code,

477
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:39,536
you copy and paste it out of something inside of your application.

478
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:42,105
Some of the scanners find that some of them don't.

479
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,916
I might be including dependencies.

480
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:46,605
I downloaded random files from off the internet.

481
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:48,745
Some of the scanners will find that some of them won't.

482
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:50,836
So for example, are they finding copies?

483
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,735
Because the one thing I remember when I started was uh

484
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,040
a

485
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,380
lot of Windows or a lot of open source software

486
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,339
embeds copies of uh there's this one XML dot C

487
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,359
file and this one G zip dot C file they

488
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,150
include so that it compiles cleanly on windows without whatever.

489
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,140
And so you're talking about instances where people have cut

490
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,239
and paste that code actually into their application sometimes.

491
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,189
I mean,

492
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:11,040
it will you stack overflow man.

493
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,329
You know what this reminds me now that we actually had a discussion on

494
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:17,400
the CV board about signing a CV E to like essentially a textbook example.

495
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,310
I think it was SQL injection or something because

496
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,130
example is so egregiously terrible and,

497
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,030
and really widely used.

498
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,310
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, I mean, it happens all the time.

499
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,599
And so these vary now if you're using something like the N PM package manager,

500
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,560
they do a pretty good job when you're using something like

501
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,750
that because there is kind of well defined dependency lists.

502
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,130
It can understand what the manifests are that got downloaded,

503
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,069
-- ignoring
-- that those ecosystems have up to,

504
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,709
they have people updating the code and taking care of it.

505
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,650
Yeah. Well. Right. Right. They do.

506
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,170
But now at the same time,

507
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,660
nearly every application will run into if I update this library,

508
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,369
everything breaks.

509
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,729
So it's easier for me to just say, screw it, pin it on an old version for now.

510
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:59,650
I'll update it later and then we never update it. And so,

511
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,689
no, because that would break things. Yeah, that's pretty common now.

512
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,810
That is a place though that these scanners have

513
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,689
a lot of power actually because they can say,

514
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,349
oh, you're running this, you know,

515
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,280
six month old version of this library and now it has a CV E ID,

516
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,040
you should really think about fixing it

517
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,310
and like that's cool. Right.

518
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:19,260
Because now I know I need to go look at this and I need to do something about it.

519
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:23,469
Unfortunately, one of the problems you get is if you've never run one of these before

520
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,699
and you have an application that's a couple of years old,

521
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,800
-- you're going to get a lot of findings
-- when

522
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,680
you write a piece of software that has dependencies,

523
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:33,660
you immediately start diverging from the rest of reality because, you know,

524
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,750
especially if it's something big with, say a couple 100 or

525
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,739
a couple 1000 dependencies. Right.

526
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:39,900
-- Yeah, one of them is going to get updated tomorrow.
-- Right.

527
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,670
And, and working beats, I guess, more secure or updated or whatever every time.

528
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,020
Right. So pinning my dependencies solves a real problem.

529
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,430
So I get that right. I'm not going, I'm not going to tell anyone don't do that.

530
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:54,609
I understand how it works. Like you need to eat. You need a product that works well.

531
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,849
And see my take on this with my web Dev team is like, I try to,

532
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,699
I encourage them to stay as up to date

533
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,130
as possible because we're going to eventually face breakage

534
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,310
and I'd rather them face breakage one at a time than like 20 at a time because ok,

535
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,839
now we have all these pinned things.

536
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:08,209
It's

537
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,569
been six months, let's update everything and of course,

538
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:14,020
-- everything breaks. Right, because there's like six months of changes.
-- Right.

539
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,819
Right. And I, I think that's where

540
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,920
the development culture is going to end up in the

541
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,979
near future is on a very fast update schedule,

542
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:25,319
but like none of us are there yet and some of us never will be.

543
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,709
And that's ok. It's, it is what it is.

544
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,060
Well, I'm not sure I want my pacemaker doing that.

545
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,550
-- To be honest, no
-- medical meds

546
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,219
is different. We're not talking about that today.

547
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,959
So

548
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,729
here's

549
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,569
-- my car.
-- Yeah, whatever, whatever, too hard, stop changing the subject.

550
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,739
So now here's where things get even crazier.

551
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,709
So I run a scan and it gives me back a phone book of results

552
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:49,359
and I go in and look and say, OK, like for example,

553
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:51,449
-- this library
-- story to intro for a second.

554
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:55,050
Has any of these reports ever had a confidence score attached to the finding?

555
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,329
I don't think I've ever seen that.

556
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,489
I don't think I've seen them either.

557
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,770
I just realized like not a single one,

558
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,895
some of them will have severity and by severity, I mean,

559
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:06,306
they like go scrape the CV SS scoring, the severity are terrible,

560
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:08,355
which is useless because again, yeah,

561
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:11,595
there's things where we don't use that or we use it differently in this product or,

562
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:13,995
or we use it in a way that's actually even more dangerous.

563
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:16,635
But I've never seen anything with a confidence score.

564
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,536
They just assume everything is correct.

565
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:22,186
I think they assume everything's correct, which is, which is a problem.

566
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:22,355
And,

567
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:25,625
and actually here's where the confidence score would be really interesting is so,

568
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:27,196
so I've got my phone book of results.

569
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:31,362
I'm going to look at them and say, OK, so this application, let's say,

570
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:34,862
uh parses XML and adds integers, which is a ridiculous example,

571
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:37,641
but let's just go with it and I'm only using it to parse XML.

572
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:40,862
But the security issue is only in the part that adds integers.

573
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,062
So obviously, from my perspective, that's a false positive.

574
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:45,781
Should I fix it someday?

575
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,342
Yes,

576
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:48,771
but I'm going to go fix a thing that's actually like

577
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:52,041
the critical cross site scripting flaw now because that matters.

578
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,582
Whereas this integer problem

579
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:57,037
-- doesn't matter. Right.
-- Or go out a new feature that customers are demanding. Yes.

580
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:58,307
Exactly. Right.

581
00:25:58,317 --> 00:25:58,637
People,

582
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,667
it drives me nuts that somehow people pretend like security is

583
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,697
just like this effort that just exists all on its own.

584
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,817
It's like, no, I mean, if, if you told a vendor, like,

585
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:08,547
you can spend a million bucks on security or 10 million bucks on security,

586
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:09,368
but if you spend the

587
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:12,567
$1 million security now you got like $9 million for features.

588
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,118
Well,

589
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,488
as a customer even do I want 10 million on security and

590
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:18,758
zero features or do I want $9 million worth of features?

591
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:21,333
-- Well, I kind of want features
-- mean it's going to depend, right?

592
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:23,534
If this is an airplane like,

593
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:24,154
yeah,

594
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:28,303
-- but I mean, in general, I'm going to want more features.
-- Yeah, seriously.

595
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:32,644
And actually this is something that I talk about in the post is the fact that like

596
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:34,673
why are you doing this if just running a

597
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,593
scanner is the reason you're running a scanner,

598
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:38,384
that's a terrible reason you need to be

599
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:41,083
running these with some reasonable outcome in mind.

600
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,343
That isn't I have a scanner to have a scanner?

601
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:46,473
Well, I mean, so many of these regulations now require scanning

602
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,819
and you know, again, the road to hell is paved with good intentions,

603
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,709
but now here we are with, I have to have a scanner.

604
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,260
So you, you know, you get a scanner, you run it and

605
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,849
the other thing is some of these regulations say once you're

606
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,680
aware of a vulnerability or a fly you have like,

607
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:02,339
what is it, like 30 or 90 days or whatever to fix it?

608
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,479
Tik Tok?

609
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,260
You know, and, and that's when these companies get real grumpy. And,

610
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,680
yeah, do that irrational. Like here's a phone book of scan results.

611
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:13,439
I need this to come back clean and it's like, well, sorry, computer says no.

612
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,060
-- And
-- well, what makes it even more fun is they might say, well, I'm on this old version.

613
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,599
It's like, well, you need to upgrade, but I'm on an old version, like, well,

614
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,459
you need to upgrade.

615
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,579
I'm on an old version. It's like this is, I think Evan and Costello did this, you

616
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:24,790
know,

617
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:29,939
and, and it's hard though, right? I get it and you're absolutely right.

618
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,140
There's definitely some of that aspect to it. But in all serious

619
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,520
this,

620
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,130
I think this is a great example of

621
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,270
the regulation needs to accommodate reality because today,

622
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,270
reality and regulation are kind of butting heads

623
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,400
in an incompatible way and that happens sometimes,

624
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:45,599
right?

625
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,060
Where something new comes out, there's some new feature,

626
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,239
there's some new way of work and now we have to deal with it.

627
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,949
Like open source is a great example,

628
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,469
regulated industry couldn't even run open source for a long time because there was

629
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:59,290
no way to deal with like the supply chain questions or the vendor questions.

630
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,589
And now they can, it'll come. Right. It's going to come. It's going to get,

631
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:02,719
I,

632
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,099
I have no doubt so. Anyway. Anyway. All right.

633
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:06,880
Well, we'll kind of keep telling the story.

634
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,140
So we've got our false positives,

635
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:15,430
we'll say of things that either aren't there in some cases or things I'm not using.

636
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,000
And I'm, I, I believe

637
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,160
100% that if I'm not using a feature and it

638
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,780
gets reported on a scan that is a false positive.

639
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,359
-- And obviously the scanner vendors will argue with me.
-- I would agree.

640
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:32,040
But the problem is that's a gnarly problem to solve because is there even a way for

641
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,849
vendor to rationally notify other

642
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,510
like the scanner vendors of this

643
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:41,709
-- sort of?
-- And like, so here's my point though is the reason I call it a false positive.

644
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:45,329
And the reason I'm pushing back on every scanner vendor I talk to about this

645
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:48,810
is because if we accept those results and say this is the way it is,

646
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:51,729
we've created an incentive again for the scanner

647
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:53,459
vendors to just report lots of stuff.

648
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,530
Whereas if I say I want you to tell me which of these findings,

649
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,729
I'm actually using the code.

650
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,489
That is the CV.

651
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,680
Now we're talking about a very useful feature and if

652
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,020
we don't push back on them saying I want this,

653
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,400
they're never going to do it because it's a really, really hard problem.

654
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:10,760
Well, you know,

655
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,010
I remember because I had this exact issue with Jackson data bind where we weren't

656
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,849
using the serialization stuff.

657
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,310
And so the problem though is, is, is there number one,

658
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,020
I'm not even aware of all the scanner vendors.

659
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,239
So even if I was willing to spend time reaching

660
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,859
out to them via phone and email or whatever,

661
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:30,729
I I are there 10 or 100 or 1000 scanner vendors globally that matter.

662
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:30,930
I,

663
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,430
I I've dealt with more than 10 we'll say.

664
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:37,119
And so, I mean, like what I do now is when people send me a scan,

665
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,459
I say I need this in a machine readable format.

666
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:41,270
Be it like XML or

667
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:42,459
JSON, preferably

668
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:43,430
JSON or whatever.

669
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,839
And then I scrape out all the I DS and then I have

670
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:48,880
a tool I run that basically says I've seen all these before.

671
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,010
I have statements explaining why we're not vulnerable or I've seen, you know,

672
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,650
I've seen these, I haven't seen this and I'll be like, oh,

673
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,599
we're vulnerable to this one.

674
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,930
Let's actually go fix it, you know, something like that. But like that sucks.

675
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,069
And it's not sustainable in the long term.

676
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,589
I'm wondering because you remember when we talked with the, the S

677
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,829
bomb, you know, software bill of materials guy and all that,

678
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,900
Alan.

679
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,800
Yeah, they, I don't remember but I,

680
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,810
I don't think it came up the whole idea of you have a bill,

681
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,760
not just a bill of materials but a bill of materials and how we're using them.

682
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,239
We don't have that today.

683
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,310
Honestly,

684
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,119
I don't think anyone thought about it before now because why would we care?

685
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,290
Well,

686
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,910
-- you
-- didn't
-- have these giant dependencies with 6 million features that you use?

687
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,839
-- Three of
-- right. And, and honestly, I don't think anyone who

688
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:30,800
cared before now.

689
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,689
And like obviously the the story the scanner vendors will tell you is, oh,

690
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,069
just as long as you run our scanner and you keep updating fast enough,

691
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,209
this will never be a problem.

692
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:40,390
So you don't have to worry about it.

693
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,770
But the reality is no one's ever going to get there.

694
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,530
You're always going to be behind some amount

695
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,079
and you're always going to have to prioritize work and you know,

696
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,010
updating dependencies is work.

697
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,219
And not only that it's work that no one cares about because no one really sees.

698
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,449
So you need to be able to prioritize,

699
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,290
well, you rarely benefit from it other than to make

700
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,609
things like scanner,

701
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,150
like reports and

702
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,150
maybe some bugs go away. It's, you know, a

703
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,939
lot of it. Yeah, that's most of it. And I'm not going to lie to you.

704
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,780
Like there's been many internal discussions where we're

705
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,339
quite frank about the fact that the only

706
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:15,530
reason we're investigating this particular thing we're working

707
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,979
on is to shut up the scanners.

708
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:21,469
We realize there's literally zero other value than making the scanners go away.

709
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,060
I view that as a scanner bug.

710
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,579
-- Yeah,
-- I remember doing that where I was at a point where I was like,

711
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:29,099
if we fix this one XS, we'll have a bunch of customers stop complains in

712
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,530
which actually will probably be cheaper in the long run.

713
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,520
Cause support costs of those poor support.

714
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,349
People listening to these customers complain about this one CV.

715
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,880
-- Jackson
-- data bind is exactly that for me right now where the

716
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,400
Jackson data bind vulnerabilities are reported as critical by scanner vendors.

717
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,589
And in all seriousness, if you're using those features at Jackson data bind,

718
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,510
it actually is.

719
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,390
-- I'm actually
-- just looking at the CV list for it.

720
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,680
-- I didn't realize there was a new crop of them last year and
-- this year, last year,

721
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:52,839
correct.

722
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:53,670
It's constant.

723
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,630
Like every week there's a new one it seems like and it's,

724
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,189
the feature is basically just fun

725
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:00,189
broken on every level and,

726
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:03,910
and like what's funny is they basically just keep removing the vulnerable de

727
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,489
serialization methods from the list of OK, things to do.

728
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,819
And it's like you guys are, you're not gonna have anything left eventually.

729
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:11,869
Just why don't you just blacklist everything like

730
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,400
problem solved.

731
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,939
But anyway, anyway, people obviously freak out because their scanners say,

732
00:32:16,949 --> 00:32:19,199
oh my goodness, you have like 10 critical issues in this,

733
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,780
this container and they're like, oh my goodness, you have to fix this.

734
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,000
Like right now right now we need you on the phone right now and it's like, OK,

735
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,369
let me explain to you what's going on

736
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:27,640
and

737
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,650
the thing is most people get it where you say we're not using these features.

738
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,910
And if they say we prove it, I say I can prove it.

739
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,170
Here's the line of code where we like literally don't enable that feature.

740
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,189
And then most people are like, OK, fine. I'll, I want you to fix it.

741
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,930
Like yes, we want to fix it too,

742
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:43,979
but we actually don't upgrade Jackson data bind

743
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:46,369
right now because there's some serious performance regressions.

744
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,510
And obviously when you have a very performance search engine,

745
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,410
-- that's a pretty big deal,
-- right?

746
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,329
Well, and that's a great example of, I mean, that's a real cost,

747
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,709
right? Like electricity, people's time,

748
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:57,089
you know,

749
00:32:57,199 --> 00:33:00,500
oh, we need 10% more servers because we had a 10% service degradation.

750
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,609
That's I mean, if you're my vendor and you're like, well,

751
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,739
we went through this with Intel, right where they're like, oh, here's the fix for,

752
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,880
what was the first or second one

753
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,020
where the performance was like atrociously terrible.

754
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, I don't, I don't

755
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:12,869
remember the name of it

756
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:13,619
and

757
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:14,719
attacks.

758
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:18,380
-- And
-- I remember looking at that performance metric changes and I'm like, we,

759
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,479
we can't ship that.

760
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,849
There's not enough spare server capacity in the world

761
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,540
to make up for what this performance degradation will do.

762
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,750
No, I I know. But yeah, anyway,

763
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,040
you get, it's a complicated and difficult problem and we're,

764
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,829
we're basically out of time for today and I know we

765
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,920
could talk about this for hours and hours and hours.

766
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,849
I will spare you all. I've got

767
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:39,569
a,

768
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,790
so a funny thing to my, my blog series is seven parts.

769
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,689
It started out as one and it got out of hand and I, I capped it at seven.

770
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:50,520
I could have gone more, but I decided this is already ridiculous,

771
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,967
but I will put links to it in the show notes, like go read it.

772
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:57,467
I value comments from everyone if you're a scanner vendor, like by all means,

773
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:58,416
get in touch.

774
00:33:58,427 --> 00:33:59,896
I love talking about this stuff.

775
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,906
I'm going to, I'm going to hold you to a high standard though.

776
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:05,107
Like as a warning, I'm not going to let you like steamroll me into agreeing that.

777
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,046
Oh, I guess it's good enough.

778
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:07,386
Like, no, I have very,

779
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:10,386
very high expectations and I'm going to expect you to live up to them.

780
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:13,177
Well, for what this stuff costs it should I, from what I've seen,

781
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:14,346
it should be doing a better job.

782
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,866
It's very expensive

783
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,842
and I know it's a hard job. I get it. It's a hard job, but

784
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,502
-- that's why people are paying you money.
-- Well, and

785
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,542
it's going to get better. Right. It's going to get better.

786
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,612
-- Well, some of them are going to get better. Well,
-- ok. Yes.

787
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,962
But, but the whole point and the big thing,

788
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:32,643
the big takeaway I have in this is that if we do nothing,

789
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:36,902
we aren't going to see these scanners get better in a way we want them to get better.

790
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:40,353
They're going to get better in the way the market incentivizes them to get better,

791
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:43,562
which is going to be bigger scanner ports, more noise,

792
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,541
-- super
-- annoying and it just becomes useless.

793
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:48,670
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. That.

794
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,429
So it is up to us to hold these vendors accountable and make it better.

795
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,781
So, all right, I'm ending it there. That is where we are so awesome. Thank you, Kurt.

796
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:57,101
