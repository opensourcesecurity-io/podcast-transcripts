Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,659
Kurt Siefried and my totally nonsocial friend, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,930
I'm a non paras social. What does that mean?

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:18,239
So I learned a new term today from the Twitter leak, which is paras social paras,

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,270
social interaction

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,569
refers to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience

6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,030
in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,319
particularly on television.

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,290
Oh, I've heard of this before actually.

9
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,470
And Twitch is a great example of this where they sort of take that mass market TV

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,250
concept and try to personalize it a bit, you know,

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,169
with like the text chat and stuff where basically if

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,500
you donate like 10 or $100 to a streamer,

13
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,049
they'll be like,

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,200
thanks Bob

15
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:45,330
and moving along. And so you get your like five seconds of fame.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,909
Right. Right. There's a video I think it's a,

17
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:52,125
I watch that discusses all of these weird relationships and,

18
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,604
and everyone talks about their like Twitch community

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,005
and it's not really a community.

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,965
I would try to dig it up and put it in the show notes, but I make no guarantees.

21
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:01,764
Like I don't think you and I have any illusions about our listeners.

22
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:02,575
Like, and

23
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,004
they, they're like victims at best.

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,610
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,290
I mean, at least we have the moral high ground of their, their willing victims.

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,459
That's

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,080
true. That's

28
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,260
true. Like they came to us. We did not advertise. Yes.

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,459
Yes.

30
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,730
So, yeah. So the reason I bring Twitch up is because apparently somebody leaked

31
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:26,040
all the Twitch, like back end source code,

32
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,410
including for products they haven't released yet.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,410
And also streamer payouts and the streamer payouts were,

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,980
I mean, it's a classic power distribution curve with, you know,

35
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,239
there's one person at, what was it?

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,309
$752,000 a month. Some of these people make Mad Bank

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:41,980
again.

38
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,650
I, I understand power distribution laws like there's Michael Jackson and you know,

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,319
Britney spears at the top and then everybody else at the bottom, but

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,089
like three quarters of a million dollars us per month

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,019
is,

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,680
wow.

43
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,629
Well, I mean, that's how

44
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,639
youtube has similar

45
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,480
for a lot of these, these creators.

46
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,160
And it's,

47
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,870
it is not surprising to me in any way.

48
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,020
I think if you look at any of the entertainment personalities over the decades,

49
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,679
the people who are at the top of the list do very,

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,669
very well and I don't think streaming and youtube are no different.

51
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,399
It reminds me a lot of software in that

52
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,559
somebody builds a software package or something that is very useful.

53
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,330
And yeah, you can,

54
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:26,809
you can sell it once or you can sell it 10 million times basically the same effort.

55
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,389
And

56
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,369
that's what always blows me away about this digital economy

57
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,199
is,

58
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,570
yeah, like 80% of the cost is that first copy,

59
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,839
19% of the cost is, you know,

60
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,000
marketing and paying your account and lawyers off and then

61
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,080
1% is making copies of it and distributing it.

62
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:42,440
Which

63
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,380
and also now 20 years later is comically cheap.

64
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,570
Like cloud flares are two, was just announced. It's like

65
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,320
basically, well, you know, it's,

66
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,080
it's X pennies per month per gigabyte.

67
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:52,979
Oh,

68
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,190
and there's no egress fees like if it

69
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,000
gets downloaded three trillion times good on you,

70
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,720
you know.

71
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,440
Um Yeah,

72
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,320
stuff like that blows my mind. So

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,529
yeah. So twitch, all the stuff got leaked. I don't,

74
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,210
here's the thing I keep coming back to, especially with these cloud services.

75
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,720
Like does it matter at all if their source code gets leaked?

76
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,240
Well, so I would argue the source code is probably mostly irrelevant,

77
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,119
but I think the data on the streamers is going to cause them a lot of headaches.

78
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,139
I doubt it unless they haven't been declaring their taxes.

79
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,759
I,

80
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,070
I bet there are some streamers that are going to be unhappy with what they're making.

81
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,559
True.

82
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,210
Oh, you mean for the ones that

83
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:35,839
I would say that there's probably some in the middle or on the,

84
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,800
the higher end, but not the top that are going to look at this and say, wait a minute,

85
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,160
what is the deal here?

86
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,119
Why am I not getting this?

87
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,669
I mean,

88
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,679
this is like the fundamental problem with

89
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,979
why companies don't want employees sharing salaries,

90
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,399
for example, because as soon as people start talking, you like, hold on, hold on.

91
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,570
Why, why?

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,509
Well, I guess ironically we exist in a society now where many of us were,

93
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,970
were kind of brainwashed into instead of saying,

94
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,130
why don't I have that saying that person should be down here by me.

95
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,250
I should be up there by them.

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah, exactly.

97
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:07,350
Yeah.

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,639
Raising up everybody rather than trying to drag

99
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,110
everybody down to some version of equality.

100
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,369
But I mean, so look, I,

101
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,510
I think the topic of if your source code leaks doesn't really matter

102
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,709
and I think

103
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,730
you're gonna have some people say, oh,

104
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,869
now the bug bunty people are going to have a field

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,119
and they probably will.

106
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:24,750
And,

107
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,859
but at the same time like these already exist, you want them to.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
So who cares? There is the issue of all?

109
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,040
This is my intellectual property and it's very important and whatnot.

110
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,660
But I, I guarantee you

111
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:38,630
if I gave you a billion dollars and said, Kurt,

112
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,790
here's the Twitch source code. Go make Twitch.

113
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,730
I would have no money

114
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,959
and not Twitch because Twitch is a brand. Twitch isn't source code.

115
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,250
But even even more importantly, it's, it's execution,

116
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,489
right? And that's what counts, right? Because to put it bluntly pretty sure.

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,950
All the source code that Red Hat Ships is out there. Same, all same with your company.

118
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,489
Elastic.

119
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,279
Yeah. Right. And no offense.

120
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,850
But building a team that can actually keep that thing

121
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:05,720
up to date and building a team to support it,

122
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,829
you know, tier 12 and three phone support for that.

123
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,019
That's right. That is,

124
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,309
that is what we call in a, you know, a complicated problem.

125
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,049
It is, there's even a large well known cloud provider who's trying to do that

126
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,559
and will say they're not failing,

127
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,559
but it's probably not going as well as they would hope.

128
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,369
I

129
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,670
here's the thing, something like S3 is conceptually very simple, put objects in,

130
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,549
take objects out

131
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,390
oh dates and you know, like metadata or, you know, automatic archiving cool,

132
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,850
but something like elastic is

133
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,429
much less trivial

134
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:36,399
and you can

135
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,480
credibly complicated.

136
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,299
It's like

137
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,540
you can't just hand a nuclear reactor over to somebody and be like cool,

138
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,809
like turn it on and you'll get a couple of megawatts of power.

139
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,160
I mean, well,

140
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,709
actually that's becoming true because we are getting turned key nuclear reactors.

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,119
But you're talking about like the existing boiling water nuclear reactors,

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,970
they require a literal army of people to keep the thing from breaking.

143
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,059
Didn't this happen?

144
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,475
When was it the Chinese or the Russians stole the plans to

145
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:02,135
some American like fighter plane and there was like a hole,

146
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,825
an accidental like screw hole or something somewhere that

147
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,035
they also put in the screw hole thing you're

148
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,184
thinking of is from a world war I I

149
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:11,274
bomber where they basically captured it was like a bee

150
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,649
17 or whatever.

151
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,140
And it had like a manufacturing defect and they included that in all their copies.

152
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,950
And the real problem was converting all the sheet

153
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,929
metal thicknesses from imperial to millimeters because those,

154
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,549
those things didn't exist like the same equivalent.

155
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,119
So the plane was much heavier anyways.

156
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,910
But no, there's there's been cases of,

157
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,450
I mean, well, the worst example would be the capacitor. Remember the

158
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,760
a Chinese firm stole a Japanese firm's capacitor recipe

159
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,559
and apparently they didn't get all of it.

160
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,299
So you remember for about that five year period

161
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,700
back in the early two thousands with all the,

162
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,760
you know, the popping capacitors and motherboards.

163
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:47,049
So this is an issue with, with video games because those rotten capacitors

164
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,820
are used in a lot of video game consoles. And there is obviously a lot of

165
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,200
and old computers too, but there's this effort now to preserve this old hardware.

166
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:59,579
And like when you have some, in fact, I have a game gear in my basement

167
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,350
that I need to recap at some point because the capacitors are shot.

168
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,709
And we know and funny enough,

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
you can go on ebay now and they sell just like

170
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,820
little bags of all the capacitors I need to replace.

171
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,899
So like car which is,

172
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,940
yeah, it's super easy. I just need to do it. I'm lazy and I don't want to

173
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,920
one of those things where,

174
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,140
when you actually get set down and to do it only takes a few hours but getting set up,

175
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:20,049
getting all the parts,

176
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,000
you know, getting your fume hood up and running.

177
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,640
So you don't get, you know, mad hats, whatever.

178
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,529
Got to breathe in that sweet, sweet Cider vapor.

179
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,779
And folks don't use that lead free garbage.

180
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,399
Actually, I have a roll of leaded solder.

181
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,290
I keep for special occasions just because you can't buy it anymore.

182
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,929
What?

183
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,459
Seriously?

184
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,019
Not that I, all the solder I've bought in the last like, probably decade is lead free.

185
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,170
I haven't looked to see if I can find leaded solder. I have some.

186
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,059
So I don't really care.

187
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,540
But, yeah, like it's definitely long term projects. Leaded solder doesn't crack.

188
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,720
So it's much better. But obviously

189
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:56,500
lead

190
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:57,644
whiskers

191
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,184
in the proper lead solder. Uh,

192
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:03,114
yeah, you're right now. I never noticed that. But yes, you are correct.

193
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:07,184
I just checked. Amazon has all the leaded solder. Oh, they do? Oh,

194
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,924
so this isn't special. I thought I had a special thing.

195
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:11,864
Anyway, don't use lead.

196
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:12,204
I was

197
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,644
going to sell my, I have like, most of the roll left.

198
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:16,644
Well, no, no, it's like,

199
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:20,505
because there actually is a market for old stained glass windows.

200
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:23,975
Yeah, that's true. You need, you need lead for those. Well, you need

201
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,429
isotope free lead for certain things

202
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,450
and the only way to get that is to get lead.

203
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,169
That is several 100 years old and conveniently enough.

204
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,799
Not only is the lead in a stained glass window old,

205
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:38,739
but it's provably old because it's like when that church was built anyway, we're,

206
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,500
we're at holding,

207
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:40,879
uh, Twitch.

208
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,078
So Twitch, basically everything got leaked.

209
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,758
I, like you said, the source code being leaked, I don't think matters at all.

210
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:49,068
And the payouts is interesting.

211
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,879
I don't think anybody's going to really care

212
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,239
or stop donating money to these people because,

213
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:57,119
well, if they were going to show some sense they probably would have by now.

214
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:01,679
No, no. Ok. Look, no, don't, don't, don't say that it's not about showing some sense

215
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,000
when you are receiving

216
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,799
a good someone is producing and in the case of something like Twitch,

217
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,719
there is a creator that is making a thing that you may enjoy

218
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:15,650
and so paying for the thing you are consuming is completely reasonable.

219
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,679
It's just in our old person brains. It feels weird to pay for that.

220
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,039
Well,

221
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,669
true.

222
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,190
But some of them,

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,750
apparently some of the streamers are making a lot more money

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,679
than they claim to be and they're whining on stream about,

225
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:25,780
you know,

226
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:28,409
having had to spend like this one streamer

227
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,760
was complaining about having to have spent,

228
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,530
you know, $5000 or $4000 in some event with friends

229
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,679
and then it comes out what this person is earning and it's over six figures.

230
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,539
A month and it's like,

231
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,210
ok,

232
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,010
that's,

233
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:43,010
I guess, well, that, that game's done now. So, anyway, anyway.

234
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,359
Right. Right. Uh, leak, leak source code.

235
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,099
I

236
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,020
don't think it matters.

237
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,250
I think we exist in a world now where actually releasing

238
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,830
your source code to your product is beneficial to you.

239
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,989
I think there's some,

240
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,400
we'll say rough patches you might go through at the very

241
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:59,690
beginning because I'm sure there's some demons in there that,

242
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,969
like the buck hunters might find.

243
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,929
But I think in the long term, it's definitely

244
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,799
a beneficial move.

245
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,150
I mean, yeah,

246
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:10,950
which leads us to Apache who has had their source code in the wild since, well,

247
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,919
forever.

248
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:12,359
Yeah.

249
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,150
Well, even prior to it existing because it was N CS A.

250
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,830
That's right. That's right.

251
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,760
And they, they patched it. So it was Apache web server.

252
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,890
I love it when you tell people that they're like what it's like.

253
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,460
Why is it called Apache? Because it's

254
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:24,940
a

255
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,270
patchy web server and they're like, oh,

256
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,710
anyway, anyway,

257
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,969
we should explain what's going on at the moment because this will not be true.

258
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:36,669
Probably by the time the podcast is published.

259
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,020
I OK. Yeah. Um,

260
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,390
so long story short, uh, patchy

261
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,010
fixed

262
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,700
uh, Apache,

263
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,200
cha OK. Let's backpedal. Apache changed

264
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,369
some quotes handling in strings for the, well, the previously, the most,

265
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,030
I'm gonna say the most recent version of Apache, which was then,

266
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,359
uh, 2.4 point uh, what 49.

267
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:00,500
Yeah.

268
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,349
And that introduced

269
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,169
a bug

270
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,250
that was then found by,

271
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,130
um, Ash Dalton along with the C panel security team so good on them.

272
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,260
They fixed this bug,

273
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,289
yay and push out the fix. And that was yesterday, it was no big deal.

274
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,969
It was kind of like this weird bug that could,

275
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:19,919
um, I actually posted a tweet about it because one person pointed out that it changed

276
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,130
the behavior of how it parses the config files on windows.

277
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,780
And so they actually had to remove the

278
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,880
quotes from something because basically this Porsche guy,

279
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,039
you know,

280
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,049
upgraded his Apache web server and spent half an hour

281
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,770
fighting with the config trying to make it work again.

282
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,530
And the trick was he had to remove the quotes around the file name.

283
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:34,250
And

284
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,419
for anybody that's ever administered a UNIX C piece of software on Windows,

285
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,299
like the first thing you do is you put quotes around

286
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,289
those file paths because your spaces and junk in there,

287
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:43,669
right?

288
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,210
So you always put quotes around those file paths because of the way windows. It just

289
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,869
like even I know that and I haven't administered a Windows machine in 10 years. So

290
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,880
anyways, uh and then we wake up this morning and well,

291
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,500
it's our show topic because it turns out to be a remote code execution flaw

292
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,400
with an exploit that fits in a tweet.

293
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,500
Well, no,

294
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:08,049
OK, you jump too far. I think they're the intermediate step where

295
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,109
Apache publishes their

296
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,505
security advisory calling it a

297
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,294
path traversal flaw,

298
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,744
not arbitrary code execution

299
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:18,815
are extremely different

300
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:23,265
from. Well, the thing is it is a path traversal flaw that leads to code execution.

301
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:24,515
And I don't,

302
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:24,965
I

303
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:25,395
don't

304
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:25,715
know pedantic.

305
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:26,984
Well,

306
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:31,125
but no, no, it's important because the remote code execution is the outcome,

307
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,544
not the underlying flaw.

308
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:33,950
Um,

309
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,219
and it's not,

310
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:37,890
I suspect that they did not know this.

311
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,239
I suspect because here's the thing with open source,

312
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,659
we have enough bugs and flaws to solve that.

313
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,849
Like somebody reports one. Ok, whatever it looks, it's,

314
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:49,390
you know, you look at a path traversal flaw and my mind would immediately go to ah,

315
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,840
crap, you know, file disclosure.

316
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:51,229
Ok.

317
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:52,250
Ok.

318
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,460
Ok. Great. Ok. We got to fix string handling, ok?

319
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:58,309
We fixed it, it stopped doing that and the files not being disclosed. Ok.

320
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,979
Push out a fix call. It done. Let's go for lunch. Now, I want to explain why

321
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,677
this happened and I think I know how they got here because I have,

322
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,617
by the time I press the publish button,

323
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,177
some of this may have changed.

324
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:16,317
So mind you, this is we are literally hours after learning of this particular issue.

325
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:21,057
So here's the deal, a path traversal is where you put lots of like dot dots in a path.

326
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,718
And so obviously you kind of walk the directory tree backwards

327
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,817
and then you can walk it forwards to whatever you want,

328
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,617
say like Etsy password or

329
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:31,317
some other sensitive thing. OK. Now what was happening in apaches?

330
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:34,505
This generally Apache has these rules that say things

331
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:37,135
like you can't look at files in this directory,

332
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:37,395
right?

333
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,635
They have like their allow and deny and all those rules.

334
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:44,335
Now, it sounds like what happened is they added a directory, traversal flaw.

335
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,385
Once you escape the directory,

336
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:50,546
it was applying the allow and deny rules for kind of where you started.

337
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,406
It's like if you start in slash icons,

338
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,195
it's going to apply the slash icons rules to wherever you end up.

339
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:56,806
After all the

340
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:59,906
treating it sort of like a, a symbolic link almost

341
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:00,325
in a

342
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,783
of like where it's applying the local directory policy but to an object,

343
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:04,794
that's actually somewhere else.

344
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:09,073
That's right. But now what's the special thing about the CG I bin directory?

345
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,114
Uh Well, you get to run things. That's right because

346
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:13,114
it was awesome.

347
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,374
And I remember trying to make it work.

348
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:21,234
I saw cgib in this exploit and I just had like a flood of horrible old memories.

349
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:25,193
My stomach is actually feeling a bit yucky right now just saying that word, I,

350
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:28,213
I need to go wash my hands now or something anyway.

351
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,182
So here this is how it works though, is like many,

352
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,921
many years ago when Kurt and I were we lads,

353
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:38,291
there was this concept called CG I bins, which was common gateway interface.

354
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:41,252
And the concept was you would basically your web server.

355
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:47,031
This is so insane when I said your web server would run an application, a binary

356
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:50,421
or a script or whatever and then basically dump a

357
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:54,161
bunch of data from the client straight into it

358
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,651
and then return back whatever the script or executable.

359
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,909
Like I, I had a job at one point writing CG I in the C language.

360
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,630
Well, and that's the thing, right? It is.

361
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,450
It's a chicken and egg problem of we didn't have any web

362
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,210
languages. I'm gonna say

363
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,030
because we didn't have any way to pass data around.

364
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,559
And so literally, this is one of those classic UNIX clutches of, hey,

365
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,419
you guys have heard of pipes on the command line, right?

366
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:21,900
Yep. Well, I just, that's what CG I bin. Is that

367
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,469
right? That right.

368
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,419
But anyway, OK,

369
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,658
so what happens is the slash CGIB directory on Apache by

370
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:33,007
default has very special permissions where it says you may execute code

371
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:36,737
or executables, I should say from this directory.

372
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:40,288
And so what it looks like is happening is people are using slash

373
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:44,317
CG I dash bin slash all the dot dot magic slash say KC

374
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,757
dot exe on windows and it's running

375
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:49,687
C dot exe because Apache thinks you're in the CG

376
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:53,788
I bin directory where it's OK to run executables except,

377
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:54,927
oh no, you're not.

378
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,909
Yeah.

379
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,419
And this drives me nuts because like,

380
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,239
I'm trying to think if I've even seen AC G I bin in the last decade,

381
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,849
like this is something that probably should be Well,

382
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,780
I want to say it should be removed from Apache.

383
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:07,880
What it should probably be do

384
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,330
is be turned into a module that's not installed by default. Almost definitely. I

385
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,679
know,

386
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,559
I, I see CG I type behavior often in

387
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,380
like IOT type

388
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,340
pieces because

389
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,400
they literally,

390
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:22,640
well, and the beauty of CG I bin is

391
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,419
if you can write a shell script,

392
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,739
you have a web app. Well, it also has no overhead.

393
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,039
You have to remember when you're using like let's say PP or

394
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,619
Pearl or no Js or whatever those interpreters exist in memory.

395
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,239
Even when they're not doing any work even worse. They, they require some expertise.

396
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,179
Whereas writing,

397
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,479
like if you want to have a light bulb turn off and on and

398
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,169
you have a local binary that actually talks the hard one does it,

399
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,599
I can whip you up a bash script in five lines and stick it in CGIB

400
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,090
and we're just done.

401
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,049
That's true because you just have to hit the end point and then it will run.

402
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,679
And so it's,

403
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:56,590
it's not

404
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,049
in and of itself a bad thing.

405
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,799
It's just one of those really old sharp dangerous tools with no safety guards.

406
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,410
And we should probably not include it in the toolkit by default.

407
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,380
I mean, I agree. I, I don't think it needs to be there.

408
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,439
And now,

409
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,199
now it should also go with saying there's a lot of hoopla going on on

410
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,920
Twitter at the moment about this and there's a couple of really important things.

411
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:23,400
First of all, the Apache advisory and the CV E description

412
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,118
have not been updated to reflect, this is an R ce which I think is

413
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,469
unacceptable. Apache has had more than 12 hours at this point to update this. Like

414
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,219
anyone in this situation should have been freaking out

415
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,750
and at least put a big banner up.

416
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,680
That's like we are investigating reports that this might be an R ce,

417
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,319
except in this case, there's literally

418
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:51,260
R ce demos on Twitter that work. I am like I am a bit disappointed in Apache

419
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,290
because they are big enough that they should

420
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,979
be able to have somebody pull the fire alarm

421
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,140
like a one person show.

422
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
I also love that

423
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,040
the NVD has the entry up but no CV SS score

424
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,660
and they need to have somebody go in there manually and type the number 10.

425
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,420
Just type a TED. It's a TED. We all know it's a TED now and again,

426
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,260
they are in a position

427
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:16,390
where they should be able to pull the fire alarm. They're Eastern Standard.

428
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,380
They've had two hours to do this already today.

429
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,510
Like it's nine in the morning right now. It's 11 o'clock where they are.

430
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,459
It's, it's 1130

431
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,849
at the moment

432
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,589
and that's a lot of time, a lot of time. And I would, now

433
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,010
this is probably

434
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,800
not accurate, but I,

435
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,319
I would think they've had people for more than five hours

436
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,859
paying attention to this at this point or maybe not.

437
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,790
I mean, probably not. I don't know,

438
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,920
you would think.

439
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,790
I'm just trying to think because you and I are on Twitter and that's a normal thing.

440
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,810
I'm kind of wondering, are the NVD people, like,

441
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,150
do they have somebody kind of on Twitter monitoring it because, and,

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,310
and this is one thing I find fascinating and this is

443
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,680
part of what we're working on with the UV I,

444
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:55,859
right?

445
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:55,949
Is,

446
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,209
is from transforming this from an infosec problem

447
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,630
to a web search and discovery problem because

448
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,310
like the people on Twitter talking about this are all

449
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,709
highly trusted, like easily verified in

450
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,229
information security weirdos

451
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,949
like goss see the dog, like,

452
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:15,510
like when you said when you posted that link in, in signal, right?

453
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,219
My first thought was like, why are you posting me Twitters?

454
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,250
And then it's like, goss see the dog? Oh crap. What happened now? Right?

455
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,079
It's like seeing Tavis.

456
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:22,540
So

457
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,670
in a, in a Twitter string, it's just like, oh boy, that's right.

458
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,930
And then hacker fantastic post the X flight.

459
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,920
And it's like, well, it's over because when goss

460
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,219
the dog posted, I'm like,

461
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:31,969
i

462
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:35,180
it's probably this but um I'm gonna look at this and

463
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,010
then I saw the hacker Fantastic tweet and I'm like,

464
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,400
it's over like this is it, it's the real deal.

465
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,900
And so, and that's an interesting thing because

466
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,079
getting this data sort of through the normal channels.

467
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,829
You know what, somebody emails, what, what is it?

468
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:46,500
It's security

469
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,790
apache.org or whatever. And then they process it and then they push it out and then

470
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,349
as a CV numbering authority they would have to poke miter with a sharp stick

471
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,290
and try and get some sort of emergency update to the CV

472
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,400
database which I know can be done but it can be.

473
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,260
But look, let's,

474
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,260
that, that process is really broken. We can ignore the CV E description.

475
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,969
Yeah, exactly. I will bet you a dollar.

476
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,410
But by the time you're listening to this podcast on Sunday or Monday,

477
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,369
the CV entry still might not be updated.

478
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,869
It wouldn't shock me. It would not surprise me at all. I would not take that bet.

479
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:16,650
No, not even for a dollar but, but I Apache should be doing better.

480
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,880
And now here's the one redeeming factor in all of this is,

481
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,239
this only affects one version like one single

482
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,290
release that I bet not many people are running today.

483
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,479
Well, it affects

484
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,209
that one version that is current.

485
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:32,229
So anybody who actually is running current is kind of up the creek.

486
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:35,290
But I would also suspect and hope I think is

487
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,530
the word that the people running current are also doing things

488
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,989
like containers where it's not full of like BS H and

489
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,650
things that or even if you get remote code execution,

490
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,969
it's not that big of a deal.

491
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,589
I would hope so. But I think we both know. That's not true.

492
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:52,819
Well, it's interesting that the C panel team found it. So they,

493
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:57,260
I, do you think I'm just, I don't even know if C panel runs.

494
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,619
Like, I have no idea what version of Apache they're using.

495
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,459
I couldn't tell you. I haven't looked at C panel in years. I mean,

496
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,089
now there's one other

497
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:10,810
kind of wacky thing in all this. I've been thinking about as soon as

498
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:16,770
I read this was an R ce I saw people posting

499
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,489
log files showing like this was being actively exploited on the internet.

500
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,930
And I feel like historically, it might have taken a day or two, but in this case,

501
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,369
it sounds like it took about 15 minutes.

502
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,719
I mean, there's those men

503
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:34,603
scan tools now that can scan the entire I PV four space of the internet in about what,

504
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:35,542
1015 minutes.

505
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:36,603
Yeah, really fast.

506
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:40,412
And so to essentially run this exploit against every I

507
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:43,762
PV four on the planet is maybe an hour tops.

508
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:44,042
Well,

509
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:48,203
and you could even use something like showdown to specifically figure out what,

510
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:49,922
what are the versions of a pan?

511
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:52,483
Like these versions of Apache? I want their ips

512
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,463
and show Dan could totally give you that well or are you just fired

513
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,562
at every I PV for on the planet and be done with it?

514
00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:01,715
Like really it's not expensive. It's not hard. No, no, I agree. It's

515
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:02,316
man,

516
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:05,656
I remember when some of the first scans of the internet happened back in

517
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,975
the nineties and people were talking about taking months to scan I PV for the

518
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,316
same thing as the human genome project. Right.

519
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:14,436
It started out, we might sequence a human DNA in

520
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,416
decades.

521
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:16,076
If we're lucky,

522
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,676
then the technology got a little bit better and

523
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:18,836
a little bit better and a little bit better.

524
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:22,956
And here we are with, what is it? I think it's 25 minutes on the high end for a sequence.

525
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:24,436
Like, it's less than an hour now

526
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:25,880
and it's affordable.

527
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,010
You know, I've just the fact that my kids like the science museum we go to,

528
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,839
has a scanning electron

529
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,949
scanning tunneling electron microscope,

530
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:34,869
like

531
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,579
for public use. That is pretty wild. Right.

532
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:41,119
And, and I was kind of like, wow, a, wow, two man.

533
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,560
That's a, it's a really cute looking little,

534
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,650
I think it's from GE and apparently it only costs like 100 grand.

535
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,349
Which, yeah, only 100 grand.

536
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,420
But still, like for a piece of technology that, you know,

537
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,589
we used to watch documentaries about in school.

538
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,619
Yeah. Right.

539
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,079
I

540
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:57,359
remember when I went to university they had one and I'm like, this is amazing.

541
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,689
You have an electron microscope and it was like

542
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:02,060
millions of dollars for this thing.

543
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,130
And I think every time they started it up,

544
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,339
it costs like thousands of dollars to run because it had like the cryo tank outside

545
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,180
the perfect vacuum. And that's right. It was nothing like it is now.

546
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,780
And, and that's the beauty of technology, right?

547
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,339
So,

548
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:21,300
yeah, no, this, this Apache thing is really fascinating because it, it does really

549
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:25,719
the whole defense in depth thing is still needed because, and I hate to say this,

550
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,819
there's these just ridiculously

551
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,030
exploitable, silly flaws,

552
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:35,099
but literally the exploit fits in a tweet and lets you run like BNSH with arguments

553
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:38,250
on the host. So for example, if you're using a container

554
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,099
and you've removed all the shells,

555
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,729
what I remember this person did a thing where they basically tried to figure out,

556
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,339
you know, which Linux binaries are quote unquote safe. Like can't be used to hack

557
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,339
and there's a number of them like I think a

558
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:52,209
is one where a

559
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,729
like will and can talk to the network.

560
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,790
Oh yeah, there's loads of stuff. I mean, most containers,

561
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:02,329
I should say most it is not uncommon for a container to have system D in it.

562
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,280
For example, system D has a ridiculous amount of functionality built into it.

563
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,050
I mean, this is, you know, in the attacker space

564
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,060
or the defender space. I should say they call this living off the land

565
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:15,729
where Attackers basically look at what's there and they figure out

566
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,459
how to abuse the tools that are already on the system.

567
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:21,729
Because obviously a lot of these sensors will say, oh no,

568
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,040
a binary got uploaded alert, alert, alert.

569
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,500
But if someone's running curl, whatever curl gets run, it's fine everybody.

570
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,250
And it's like, oh, not fine at all.

571
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,939
Yeah. And on the flip side you have, like, oh, my, oh, there's a copy of,

572
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:35,739
you know, network CNC installed.

573
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,790
It's a hacker tool because they'll use the pivot and it's like,

574
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,239
but the, you know, and like, well,

575
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,290
windows were moose til net now and a bunch of other stuff for kind of that same reason,

576
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,650
which drives me nuts because

577
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,650
very handy tool for, you know, testing things.

578
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,640
But um

579
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,550
yeah, no, it's, I, I,

580
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,410
I don't know what the answer is here because I, I am firmly in the camp of, well,

581
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,569
we had bash shell shock a few years ago, which was kind of the same thing.

582
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,660
It was like, whoops this, you know,

583
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,660
remote code execution that fits in a tweet and here we have it again, what,

584
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,310
five years later, seven years later,

585
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,569
no, about five years later.

586
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:05,239
Uh

587
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:05,939
yeah,

588
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,609
about that.

589
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:11,290
And so like, well, that seems to be about the cadence is about once or twice a decade.

590
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,489
It's just going to happen. I mean, it is going to happen and look,

591
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,390
I think the message here isn't to mock Apache for making a mistake.

592
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,150
They made a mistake, it happens, whatever,

593
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,219
they also fixed it quickly

594
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:23,510
and that's good.

595
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,469
But they, they, there's more work to do because I think the severity of this is not,

596
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:28,640
it

597
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,349
is not documented appropriately.

598
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,270
And I think all of these security things,

599
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,209
the key isn't to not make mistakes because we're all going to screw up all of us.

600
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:38,959
It's just life.

601
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,319
The key is to be able to move quickly

602
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
and remediate your mistakes where I feel like apaches

603
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,239
only done half that well. And, and, but also you say remediate the mistake.

604
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,000
And it's interesting because they did remediate this specific mistake, right?

605
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,569
They fixed it,

606
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:53,869
but they didn't do

607
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,400
maybe a crash investigation and say, oh, look, CG I bin is really dangerous.

608
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,770
Let's turn it into a module that's not installed by default.

609
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:02,540
Right?

610
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:05,170
And that's one thing that always gets me with the airline industry is

611
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,589
they don't just figure out why it crashed and like, oh, you know,

612
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,530
the person should have put the right size bolts

613
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,219
in the windshield so the windshield didn't pop out.

614
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:13,170
It's like, oh, were they sleep deprived? Ok.

615
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,550
Look,

616
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,280
maybe we need to change the rules around mechanics and crews sleep

617
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,430
requirements so that they're not so dang tired and making these,

618
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,280
you know, mistakes that result in massive problems.

619
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,859
And so my hope would be is that Apache maybe uses this as a reason

620
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,430
to do some re architecting

621
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,689
or some tidy up, especially around CG I bin because,

622
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,050
yeah, I don't think we can just get rid of CG I bin. People still need it, but

623
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,650
people generally don't need it by default.

624
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,180
Yeah.

625
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,900
Right. Right. Because I'm just trying to remember if CGIB I

626
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,250
actually

627
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,579
a module or Oh, dang.

628
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,839
I'd be shocked if it was. I bet it's like core functionality.

629
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm pretty sure it is. Whatever, who cares? Fix it.

630
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,839
And I would say if you run Apache,

631
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:00,489
make sure you've turned that stuff off because

632
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,439
you can disable it in the configuration file.

633
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:05,020
Like CG I bin doesn't have to be turned on.

634
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:05,579
Yeah.

635
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:08,660
Don't turn it on unless you're using it and if you're using it, like,

636
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,290
containerize the crap out of that stuff,

637
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,449
you know. Yeah.

638
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:11,729
Yeah.

639
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,859
Unfortunately that turning it off then means every time you do an update it's like,

640
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,010
oh, your config file is different than the one I want to install.

641
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,930
Do you want to keep it? And sometimes that breaks stuff and,

642
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,050
uh,

643
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:23,089
yeah, I mean, that's another problem though. I wish we had seen our defaults.

644
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,400
Well, yeah,

645
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,369
but that's, that's another conversation.

646
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:28,329
So. Ok. Ok.

647
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,329
We've made, we've picked on Apache a lot, I guess at the same time,

648
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:35,560
remember there are, people don't, don't yell at them like, no, I would say this is

649
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,650
an instance for growth.

650
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:42,079
Where, why, why did this take so long to update, like, figure it out?

651
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:44,170
Make sure it doesn't happen again. You're a patchy.

652
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,880
You're not Josh and Kurt, you know, there's,

653
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,900
there's, there's some expectations I think. Yeah.

654
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,270
Yeah. Yeah. That's all I have. I have.

655
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,060
One last thing I want to end on that I think is super cool.

656
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,180
So I upgraded my laptop to windows. 11

657
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,439
the day came up. Actually, it was technically the day before because it worked.

658
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:02,089
But whatever

659
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,420
I can run X 11 apps

660
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,810
on Windows natively,

661
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,359
my head exploded

662
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,219
and it,

663
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,709
well, but the thing is not just can you run natively,

664
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,619
but it actually works out of the box with zero setup

665
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,229
like it just,

666
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,410
well, you have to make Windows subsystem for Linux

667
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,250
work. You literally type in WSL two

668
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,589
space hyphen hyphen enable or something.

669
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,000
That's it like that's,

670
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,079
yeah, it's pretty easy. And you know what the craziest thing of all us though

671
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,520
is.

672
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,829
So when you press,

673
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,680
what is it like the little window key that

674
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,969
brings up whatever the start menu is called now

675
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:40,010
and it's all in the middle, of course, because being in the middle is cool again.

676
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:42,310
And so you hit the button

677
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,000
and

678
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,680
it shows like recently run applications,

679
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,839
it showed the X 11 apps in that list and when I clicked them, they ran

680
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:51,949
like it.

681
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,150
I don't even,

682
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:53,339
I

683
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,550
don't know what to say. Like that's the year of the Linux desktop.

684
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,510
If you would have told me a decade ago that I would be able to run X 11 apps on Windows.

685
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,214
I would have laughed in your face and said,

686
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:09,064
that's the dumbest thing anyone has ever said.

687
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:12,145
So it's been 23 years since the Halloween documents actually.

688
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:15,944
Almost, yeah, almost exactly 23 years since the Halloween documents in 1998.

689
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,625
It'll be 23 years on Halloween, maybe

690
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:23,305
close to October 31. Anyway, I

691
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,045
don't know what to say. Kurt, it's

692
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:26,145
of the Linux desktop.

693
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:28,944
It's always the year of the Linux desktop.

694
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:31,505
It will always be the year of the Linux desktop.

695
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,729
It will always be the year of the Linux desktop. There you go. That's the show, folks.

696
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:40,020
The only constant I have in my life is the year of the Linux desktop.

697
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:40,900
Alright.
