Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast episode 54 with myself,

1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,319
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,590
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,260
So, I must say Happy Birthday to Canada. Kurt. I heard it's 100 and 50 years old.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,209
What, a couple days ago.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,159
Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah.

6
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,879
So, well, and Happy Fourth of July to you.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,360
Ah, yes, I know.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,549
Yes. Celebrating all that freedom. Right.

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,400
Well, that's, you know, kind of your, one of your inaugural dates.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,759
Uh, yeah. Anyway.

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,159
Right. Well,

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,639
we'll just ignore that for now. Ok.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,479
Uh, I'd prefer not to get into a bizarre discussion about the state of

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,990
the world politics

15
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:44,659
anyway.

16
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,549
Right. Right. It's,

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:46,750
uh,

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,790
no, II, I had no idea.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,779
Actually they were talking about it on the radio about, um,

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,590
all the big celebrations in Canada and all the crazy stuff going on.

21
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:54,750
And I thought, wow, that's,

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,919
that's awesome. 150. That's old man.

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,799
It's old.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,909
Yeah. Well, yeah.

25
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah, I mean, I've,

26
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,330
I've lived in Europe where they were renovating a 500

27
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,739
year old house in the town I lived in.

28
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,839
Yeah.

29
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:05,510
But, I mean,

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,360
Europe's weird like that because while many of the countries have existed for,

31
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,989
you know, many hundreds of years, sometimes thousands,

32
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,919
they've gone through an amazing amount of turmoil and

33
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,029
borders have been fought over in crazy ways.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,199
And so I think when you think about kind of continuous governments,

35
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,940
there, there probably aren't very many that are more than 100 and 50 years old.

36
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,440
Right.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,970
Well, and the thing to remember too is technically Canada, I mean,

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,419
we are constitutional monarchy.

39
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,459
So ultimately, the queen is our head of state.

40
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,660
So we would fall under that government.

41
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,470
You're part of the commonwealth, I guess. Which,

42
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,069
-- no,
-- no, you can be part of the commonwealth and not be

43
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,360
under direct

44
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,470
rule.

45
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,050
So Australia, for example,

46
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,540
changed their constitution back in the, I want to say the nineties or two thousands.

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,750
I mean, we, we did a partial change and I think it was 1982. But for example, I mean,

48
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:58,150
well, the lieutenant governor is still the

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,489
head of government in Canada. Like when we have an election.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,569
Um you know, we, we, we vote for various parties and there are those MP S

51
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,889
from the various parties, you know,

52
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,600
uh essentially whichever one gets a majority then goes to

53
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,009
the lieutenant governor and ask permission to form a government

54
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,210
and they can be, they can be told no, right.

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,809
Like they, there have been cases where they're like,

56
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,970
uh I think it was uh they wanted to form some sort of coalition government.

57
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,529
I forget exactly what it was and, and they just were flat out told, no,

58
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,509
you can't do that.

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,710
You're gonna have to like, figure it out and come back.

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,750
-- It sounds
-- like security spending. No, go figure it out, come back later.

61
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,429
So, in some ways, I think it's nice because it gives a bit of sort of stability.

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,669
But at the same time it's,

63
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,039
you know, as much as I hate the four year election cycle in the US, for example,

64
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,440
we have a totally

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,289
arbitrary election cycle.

66
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,449
So, so does your election cycle work in the same way?

67
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,820
The UK does where the Prime Minister could just be like, oh,

68
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,970
we're going to have an election now.

69
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:58,570
That's one option. Yes. That's crazy to me. I can't even,

70
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,050
I can't even fathom that.

71
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,690
Well, we went through, what was it? Three national

72
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,889
or three federal elections in the space of like a year or two.

73
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,889
That's insane. People are going to just not care by the end of that

74
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,179
half the people already don't care

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,740
anyway.

76
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,190
-- Sorry. But that's the sad reality.
-- You know,

77
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,619
let's talk about sad reality because we can not

78
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,199
Petya.

79
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:22,759
Uh

80
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah. Well, that's interesting.

81
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,699
I mean,

82
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,539
it appears to have been what a state sponsored cyber attack against the Ukraine.

83
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:28,880
That

84
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:34,250
-- ransomware,
-- which is, which is wild because this, this attack actually came out.

85
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,979
I was about to publish the last episode

86
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,110
and then Twitter lit up and I thought I can't publish

87
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,520
anything right now because nobody's going to see it and,

88
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,729
and, you know, I'm not going to waste,

89
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,960
you know, kind of strike when the iron's hot sort of situation. So,

90
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,919
so, anyway, it was funny because we'd recorded shortly before it came out as well.

91
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,600
So we obviously didn't talk about it. But that's probably a good thing

92
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,479
because

93
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:55,940
what,

94
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,399
there were probably three or four days where nobody had any idea

95
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,080
what was going on and this is just an insane story.

96
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,190
Well, it's, you know, that's one of the things

97
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,990
that that's really actually almost worrying to me

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,860
is it's so easy to obfuscate your motives

99
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,059
nowadays.

100
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,949
I mean, for all we know like something like wanna cry, you know,

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,298
there were those initial

102
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:20,140
thoughts that wanna cry was like a targeted cyberattack that went wrong.

103
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:21,480
Uh Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,309
And, and there's many people who still think it leaked out early because of just the,

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,980
the sloppy mistakes that, that it had.

106
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,359
Well, and see what gets me about the sloppy mistakes is that they were,

107
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:32,279
it wasn't like a,

108
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,200
an error that was like a fundamental like

109
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,630
you guys really aren't good at this or you're

110
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
really good at this and you're just pretending to

111
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,000
be really bad at this because quite frankly,

112
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,649
you don't actually have to be that good at

113
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,899
this to like create a worm that rampages through.

114
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,959
Well, WINDOWS XP. I mean, come on.

115
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,160
Uh No, I don't think XP was vulnerable was it,

116
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:52,730
I think it

117
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,910
did wanna cry affect XP.

118
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,480
Was it only seven?

119
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,519
I

120
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:58,019
forget

121
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,500
you wanna cry, affected XP.

122
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,459
But in theory you could get the key out of memory because it wouldn't reboot.

123
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,279
But once you rebooted you were up the creek.

124
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,989
No, it's, it's crazy though. I mean, it,

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,880
the, the thing that gets me with this is, and, and I forget who even said this.

126
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,980
But I mean, this is,

127
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,619
this is really like

128
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,549
a, I hesitate to say it but it's like a cyber world war at this point. Right.

129
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:21,899
I mean,

130
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,720
there's clearly countries attacking countries and they're just raising about it.

131
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:27,799
I mean, there's,

132
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,200
they don't hide it, they're not secret, they're just,

133
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:30,589
they're,

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,519
they're going out and they're just doing like these wide sweeping operations,

135
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,040
which is just kind of it, it's crazy to think about it.

136
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,359
Everyone knows who's doing it.

137
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,119
Everyone knows what's going on and we're like, oh, ok.

138
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,899
Well, part of what gets me is that, you know,

139
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,329
how essentially it really strikes me as the, the, the classic proxy wars, right?

140
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,170
Like where, you know,

141
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,410
Russia and America can't actually have a war

142
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,239
because that will escalate and become a real problem

143
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:54,739
and

144
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,209
the human race.

145
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,160
Right. Well,

146
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,209
it'll be bad for us.

147
00:05:59,540 --> 00:05:59,950
Um,

148
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,779
and also here's the thing, like,

149
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,140
how do you retaliate to a cyber attack against, say,

150
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,869
a private company or a single bank in your company, uh, country, right?

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,089
Like,

152
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,640
do you respond in kind and attack one of their banks or

153
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,029
something or do you take down their power grid for a day?

154
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,290
Like, you know, because there's also that Russian power grid hack, right? Where?

155
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:24,269
Sorry, the Ukrainian power grid got a bit hacked up probably by the Russians.

156
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,489
And I say this because I'll,

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,170
it looks like at this point in my life I will never travel to Russia.

158
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,739
No. Seriously. Right. Like,

159
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,720
uh but yeah, I mean, it's how do you respond

160
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,730
and more to the point kind of,

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,380
does that sort of teach them not to do it? Do we?

162
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:39,420
I,

163
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:43,579
I part of it is do we end up with like a mutually assured destruction scenario where,

164
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,269
you know, I don't hack you because I know if I hack you, you'll hack back and like,

165
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,980
-- trash my economy for, I
-- don't, I don't know if that's ever gonna happen.

166
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,619
I mean, this is so different and it's so weird.

167
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:55,700
It's,

168
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,220
it also depends like the,

169
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,720
the mutually sure destruction scenario kind of depends on these

170
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,450
being nation state hackers who actually care about their nation,

171
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:03,619
right?

172
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,369
Like if you have sort of an, an like, remember anonymous, like anonymous is a brand,

173
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,209
not a group.

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,890
And so like,

175
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:10,940
you know, I don't

176
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,980
think 90% of anonymous would give to figs worth of, you know,

177
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:18,420
caring about the power grid in some arbitrary country where a bunch of them live.

178
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,980
So how do you sort of threaten retaliation against a group that

179
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,600
isn't even, maybe a group necessarily.

180
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,559
I, I mean, yeah, that's certainly, well, ok.

181
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,420
So, in that case, I think that's the, where law enforcement is kind of a big deal.

182
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,019
And one of the challenges though is

183
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,640
many of these people live outside of the jurisdiction

184
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,779
of the law enforcement where the crime occurred.

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,420
Right. Where if you have someone sitting in, you know, middle of nowhere Russia

186
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,359
and they're, they're attacking a credit union in Georgia.

187
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,480
What are the Georgia authorities? Well, Georgia,

188
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,230
I shouldn't say that because Georgia is what

189
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,859
a state in the United States,

190
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,279
Georgia

191
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:56,779
with the,

192
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,619
let's say Washington DC,

193
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:02,119
right?

194
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,239
Like, like you attack a small bank or something and, and what do the authorities do?

195
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,260
They can't extradite that person.

196
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:11,640
There's, they're operating in almost complete impunity,

197
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,609
but then there's also the other side of it where let's

198
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,829
say you have a nation state attacking another nation state.

199
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,649
What,

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,790
what really happens there? I mean, nobody's dead.

201
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,869
Your infrastructure might go down for a couple of

202
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,750
days or maybe they stole some hacking materials or,

203
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,350
or whatever.

204
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,720
But, I mean, at the end of the day, I think what,

205
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,520
what really makes a difference in wars is

206
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:37,640
the kind of attitude of your population really dictates

207
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,179
the war where if the people support the war,

208
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,950
you look at something like World War One, World War Two and,

209
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,780
and America's involvement in it will pick on

210
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,119
the American people were very positive about that and they

211
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,429
were very much behind the government and the soldiers.

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,909
Right.

213
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,349
And then you look at another war like Vietnam,

214
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,489
the Vietnam conflict in the United States.

215
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,969
Which, which for those of you who don't live here,

216
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:58,710
you

217
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,109
know, it wasn't

218
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:00,280
a war.

219
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
I

220
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:00,919
know.

221
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,599
I

222
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,130
know

223
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,109
it's madness. But, but anyway, like,

224
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,409
at first people thought, oh, yay,

225
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,380
we're going to bring freedom to Vietnam and then

226
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,479
after a while it turns into a quagmire and,

227
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,119
and they were like, this sucks.

228
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's go.

229
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,489
And part of it, I think with, and it's similar to cyber war.

230
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,599
So I, I've read about the Vietnam war bit and

231
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,280
apparently one of the challenges or problems was,

232
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:25,190
is America viewed it as, you know, sort of communism versus the rest of the world.

233
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,320
And apparently the,

234
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,549
the majority of Vietnamese people viewed it as an internal civil struggle.

235
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,590
It's wild. Actually, I watched a travel show

236
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,559
one day on the local public television station

237
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,909
and they went to Vietnam and they were,

238
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,750
they were showing off like all their memorials and everything and it's like,

239
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,549
holy crap.

240
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,380
They,

241
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,510
they clearly don't think of this conflict like we do,

242
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,219
you know it, yeah, it was very much about bringing freedom to Vietnam and

243
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:52,820
we thought we were the ones bringing freedom to Vietnam and it's like, this is crazy.

244
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,900
But, but whatever the point being though,

245
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,400
that when we're talking about a cyber conflict,

246
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,359
if if the people don't care,

247
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,179
I don't think you're going to find the, the will to do anything.

248
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,650
I, well, the thing is you don't really need the support of the people, for example,

249
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,150
for, you know,

250
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,359
some government agency to spend $10 million attacking another company, uh,

251
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,659
country's power grid.

252
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:15,539
But more to the point again, sort of what does that accomplish?

253
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,409
Because part of the challenge too is so somebody hacks a bank.

254
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,390
Well, why, what is their motivation? Did they want to damage the bank?

255
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,789
Did they want to steal money? Did they want to harvest information

256
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,830
so they could chase terrorists down?

257
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:27,469
Like

258
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,650
we really don't know.

259
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,190
I, I mean, that's true.

260
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,710
There's, there's many different cases and, and I guess at the same time,

261
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,989
let's say somebody hacks a bank, let's say somebody steals all the money,

262
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:41,500
you get all your money back if you're, you're the, uh, a customer, right?

263
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,789
Because it's insured,

264
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,729
let's say someone hacks the power grid, what are they gonna do?

265
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:49,270
They're gonna turn it off and they're gonna flip the manual override switch and,

266
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,650
and so, yeah,

267
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,289
power might be down for a day and then it

268
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,309
comes back and two hours later after watching reality TV,

269
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,030
everyone forgot that they didn't have power.

270
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,979
Right. It's,

271
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,280
it's tricky

272
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,840
that they don't do a really bad hack.

273
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,880
But there are, you know, with industrial control systems,

274
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,659
there are a way to permanently damage those things that

275
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,479
take weeks or months to replace

276
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,210
and, and that could certainly be the case. It's,

277
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,979
I don't know, this one's tricky man because I don't

278
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,419
without proper public support, I still feel like this is,

279
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:19,760
this is not a fight that anyone can really win.

280
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,340
And not only that, I mean, let's face it.

281
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,000
A significant number of these events we've been seeing

282
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:28,119
have been done to embarrass the country where it happened. Right.

283
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,190
Whereas they could also be in the sense,

284
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,419
warning shots like when you test fire missiles into

285
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,780
the middle of the ocean or, you know, like the American,

286
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,750
you know, we, we can land a man on the moon so clearly we can drop, you know,

287
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,210
a one ton payload anywhere we want in the world.

288
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:43,890
Well, and part of it too though is

289
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,700
so, so let's say

290
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,750
Russia hacks, United States and it's all over the news and,

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,229
and it's super embarrassing for the NSA right

292
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,469
now, let's say the NSA hacks Russia back,

293
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,789
but it's not all over the news because obviously they

294
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,190
don't have the same kind of media we have here.

295
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,049
Now. What? Right.

296
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,469
Did, did your, so in that case, you can't embarrass them,

297
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,219
you have to actually go after infrastructure and in, in many instances,

298
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,919
a lot of this infrastructure probably you can damage some of it,

299
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,590
but I bet a lot of it you can't

300
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,950
just because it's let's face it, it's, it's old and crappy.

301
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:17,750
Well, and

302
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,390
-- in
-- every country where they've

303
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,539
unintentionally damaged their own infrastructure.

304
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,070
You know, they,

305
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,460
I remember this is back in the eighties.

306
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,690
They, they tried to run part of, you know, the old,

307
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,429
like the electrified train system,

308
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,570
they tried to run it at a lower, either a lower voltage or, you know, they,

309
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,869
they basically tried to save on electricity

310
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,289
and they ended up damaging like thousands of motors.

311
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,690
Interesting.

312
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,619
I wonder what that was because actually running it on unless power won't save power.

313
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,099
Motors are weird like that.

314
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,119
They might have turned it up,

315
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,299
turning it up would make sense because you actually

316
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,460
become more efficient and that would burn out motors.

317
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:51,650
This

318
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,849
is also a country where, you know,

319
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:56,650
they have that gas pipeline leaking so they just increase the pressure in it and then

320
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,539
-- exploded,
-- right?

321
00:12:58,729 --> 00:12:59,369
Um

322
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah,

323
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:00,710
minor

324
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,359
details

325
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:02,070
or,

326
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,380
or you look at the way Chernobyl was run and it's like let's do a

327
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,049
low power test in combination with some

328
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,280
other shenanigans in combination with the night shift

329
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,400
and not really plan it out. And, well, we all know how that ended very poorly.

330
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:16,679
Indeed.

331
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,070
No, I, I don't know, man, I still don't know what to think of this. I feel like

332
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,820
we're at the beginning of something but I don't know what it is yet

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,539
and

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,299
that

335
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:30,299
-- part of it is these people are just taking exploratory shots and it's
-- not even just,

336
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,309
there's the exploratory nature of it, but there's also the aspect of like

337
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,859
infosec or, or cybersecurity, whatever you want to call it

338
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:39,719
is.

339
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,780
We're in such an infancy. We don't even understand what a lot of this means.

340
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,380
We don't really have processes to deal with.

341
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,275
We just,

342
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,575
we don't know. Right. Like something happens. Twitter goes crazy.

343
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:53,575
Everyone's running around like crazy people

344
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:54,405
and then,

345
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:59,054
and now it's like, it's a week later it's mostly over and we're like me, whatever,

346
00:13:59,065 --> 00:13:59,875
nobody cares.

347
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:02,445
Well, a great example. So last week uh Interac

348
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:03,385
Ransfer it's a,

349
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:08,044
it's an interbank and payment system in Canada, you know, debit cards and whatnot,

350
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,934
kind of like Visa or mastercard, right?

351
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,015
They basically have the brand and they also run the,

352
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,335
the kind of back end.

353
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,294
Uh it, it failed, it just stopped working

354
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,530
and it took them like the better part of a day to sort of actually admit it, right?

355
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,460
Like people were like, I can't do transfers and,

356
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,640
and the banks and everything are kind of like, oh,

357
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,000
have you tried turning your phone off and on or

358
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,049
have you tried, you know, like just all this dumb stuff where it's like,

359
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,369
you know, it's, it's everybody is affected.

360
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,840
Like literally everybody I can't transfer money or receive money. I, you know,

361
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,799
um luckily it wasn't like the,

362
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,859
the point of sale systems were not affected because that happened once.

363
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:41,719
Like TD was like, oh,

364
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:44,750
we had a motherboard failure and like interact payments for all

365
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,320
of our like Western Canada failed for like two days.

366
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,789
Yeah. So uh I hope they never have a fire at that data center.

367
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,679
But anyways, like back to this interacting, like,

368
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,780
you know, this is a legitimately huge problem.

369
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,099
Like you can't transfer money between the banks.

370
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:02,200
Uh like from, say I have an account at TD to an account at, you know,

371
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,559
Bank of Scotia or whatever.

372
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,570
And like I said,

373
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,849
it took them the better part of a day to admit that it was a

374
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:11,190
problem and then it took like one or another day or two to fix it.

375
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,250
Yeah. And like this is a great example actually because

376
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,349
how many people are going to even remember this in a month.

377
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,320
No,

378
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,710
no, you might. And, and now we will and we've, we've etched it into

379
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:28,340
the, the history of Canada since it's on our podcast.

380
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,830
But I mean, let's face it, it's,

381
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,869
it's just not something people are going to really think about or care

382
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,570
and, and even the business probably, I'm sure they lost a couple of million dollars.

383
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,820
But my suspicion is

384
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,909
didn't because people just did the transfers later.

385
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,729
It was towards the end of the month too. So people had to do it was on June 30th, right.

386
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,710
So, like people had to pay their rents and stuff.

387
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,309
Um But it kind of reminds me of when people talk about

388
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,909
Ecommerce site outages.

389
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,650
Well, yeah, your,

390
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,700
your Ecommerce site for the sake of argument takes in a million dollars an hour in, in

391
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,570
orders.

392
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:57,659
Well, and you have a one hour outage.

393
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,679
Did you really lose a million dollars or did they, like,

394
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,510
all come back a day later and buy stuff?

395
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,489
It depends.

396
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,849
I've actually experienced this where I've gone to a

397
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:07,380
site and it didn't work and then I went elsewhere

398
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:08,940
with interact.

399
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:12,599
You don't really have an option of going elsewhere because it's like

400
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:15,059
how you transfer money between banks in Canada.

401
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,260
Your other option is to go get cash and walk it over somewhere.

402
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,799
Right.

403
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:19,559
Which, yeah,

404
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,979
because you guys don't have those fabulous paper

405
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:23,619
checks we do in the United States do.

406
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,080
We

407
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,599
do. But they really discourage use of them.

408
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:30,859
Like the last time I looked at ordering checks it was, they wanted about $2 per check.

409
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,039
They give them to old people for free.

410
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:37,849
That's solid man. I was at the store the other day and somebody wrote a check.

411
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,010
Oh, my goodness.

412
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,559
And it was an old person, in fact,

413
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,390
but this person that was writing a check to the cashier and I just wanted to, like,

414
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,700
grab them by the shoulders and shake them and scream what is wrong with you?

415
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,159
There's,

416
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:52,299
there's nothing, I mean, I would rather watch someone pay with a sock full of change

417
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:56,525
than, and a check just because it's like, what, what is the matter with you?

418
00:16:56,534 --> 00:17:00,205
Why would anybody use these terrible things anymore? Especially at a store.

419
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,635
It's just it's

420
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,684
because it's what they know, it's all they know.

421
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:06,983
Like, I've, I've been at places where, like, again, I hate to say it,

422
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,405
but older people using intact

423
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,493
and the person behind the counter is like,

424
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,314
now you have to enter your pin,

425
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:13,805
man. You know,

426
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,425
and we've had chip and pin here for 20 years.

427
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:21,275
Like, the only reason I carry cash now is in case the interact system dies or

428
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,959
I end up there's this like dodgy uh

429
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:28,540
ice cream place nearby that doesn't take anything but cash and they don't have a,

430
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,359
an ATM.

431
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,579
Yeah, I, I had that the other day.

432
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:36,859
I, I went to uh a nursery to, I needed dirt for, for my yard.

433
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,239
I, I get there and they said, oh, cash or check only I thought, well,

434
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,719
I'm not giving you a check.

435
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,420
So let me go get some cash.

436
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,439
But, you know, I was like, who doesn't accept credit cards today?

437
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,300
Like, what's the matter with

438
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:47,479
you?

439
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:47,939
Like,

440
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,680
I mean, there's, there's, what is it? There's a square, there's stripe.

441
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,060
Oh man. So, you know, it's really cool. I was out

442
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,209
there the other night

443
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,930
and, and uh the, I'm sure this is not news to the rest of the civilized world but uh

444
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,729
the, the guy walks up with his ipad with square with the stupid thing on top.

445
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:09,189
I'm like, whatever, you know, stupid stripe

446
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:14,069
and he whips out this little like it must be a Bluetooth. Uh car chip reader

447
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:18,030
that, that he plugged my, my card into and then, like things happened

448
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:20,380
and then, yeah, and, and then I paid for my meal

449
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:22,689
time.

450
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,550
Sorry, when you,

451
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,130
because now that I'm thinking about travel to the US,

452
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,880
-- I don't think I've ever seen a mobile chip
-- terminal.

453
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,540
This is the first one I've ever seen it was from.

454
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:32,750
And

455
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,099
I'm like, thank goodness,

456
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:34,540
yeah,

457
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,219
because here that's the pretty much the default unless

458
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,260
it's like a small restaurant that just hasn't upgraded.

459
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,300
And

460
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,060
this was a super

461
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,709
small restaurant. It was very new, right? But it was like it was brand new. I was

462
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,839
um yeah, it's, I think it's the owner and his wife and, and that's it.

463
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,500
So it was awesome. I I could not believe it.

464
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,219
Yeah, it's funny cause I, I've like, I mean the,

465
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,540
the only places here that are pay at the counter are

466
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,140
like small places or old places like everybody else has,

467
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,170
you know, the mobile.

468
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:04,819
So for those of you that live in the US, it's, it's think of a game boy.

469
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,930
Well, smaller than a game boy basically.

470
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,390
But yeah, it's like a little, it's got the number pad, a little L led screen, a little,

471
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,939
you know, roll of paper and a printer and then make swipe on the side and you,

472
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,449
you shove your card in the back.

473
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,589
Uh and most of the newer ones are also tapped, pay.

474
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,910
So they basically just bring the thing out to your table, you,

475
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,050
you put in how much tip and then you just tap your card to it and then they,

476
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,770
they ask you if you want a receipt and then they walk away.

477
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,949
Yeah, it's, it's fantastic. I do love those things in Europe.

478
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,030
Although it was, it was very funny. I was, uh, I was in Amsterdam a couple of months ago

479
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,469
and I went somewhere and they,

480
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:42,069
they pull it out and it was the first time I'd use my credit card there.

481
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,150
And I said this is, this is the crappy American chip and sign. Can you handle that?

482
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,810
And the guy just started laughing hysterically

483
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,280
because he's like, yes, yes, we can

484
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,810
the whole point of these standards.

485
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:59,069
Oh man, I hate chip. I, I have tried to get a pin from my bank and they will not get,

486
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,800
-- well, you have a chip but no P,
-- no P I it's chip and sign you, you put the card in

487
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,869
the chip

488
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,160
because people still haven't upgraded their payment infrastructure to handle P

489
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,829
because P I can be on chip verification.

490
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:12,479
Right?

491
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:17,050
Yes, I know. And in fact, I actually had a credit card once

492
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,489
that I got the bank to give me a pin.

493
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,459
And this was, this was a different card than I use now

494
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:26,750
and it was great and everywhere in the U si just entered my pin and it was fine.

495
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,939
But, but the current card I have, uh, the bank will not give me a pin.

496
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:32,069
And so yes, I give them,

497
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,030
they scan the card or they scan the chip and then I

498
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,829
sign a thing and then I'm go along my merry way.

499
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,030
It's completely ridiculous.

500
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,630
Well, I, I guess it's better in that.

501
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,640
-- It's harder to clone the card,
-- whatever, it's ridiculous. Uh, fundamentally

502
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,790
according to the,

503
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,829
whatever credit card companies or whatever here or

504
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,530
the banks or whoever is issuing them,

505
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:55,489
they were concerned, the

506
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,880
people are familiar with swipe and sign.

507
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:02,489
And so they were concerned a pin would confuse them too much,

508
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,670
-- which
-- I honestly, it probably would.

509
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,630
But you, you get over it. It's like when Canada got rid of pennies,

510
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,449
uh, it took about a month for us all to get used to.

511
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:13,489
If you pay with cash, they round up, round down and if you pay electronically,

512
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,770
you pay the exact amount that that's done.

513
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,160
It seems easy enough.

514
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:20,920
Let's face it. It's the old people right now.

515
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,709
It's old people. They are the problem.

516
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:26,839
Oh, my goodness. I apologize to any old people listening to the podcast.

517
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:27,369
Well, you know,

518
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,430
I realize I'm turning into an old person because I'm

519
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:33,150
getting to the point where I don't actually want to learn

520
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:37,640
for the sake of learning about technology. I just want to learn what I need to know.

521
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,880
Uh, you know, I've become very sensitive to that fact and I, I make a point to,

522
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,280
to do silly things just for the sake of it

523
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,800
to, to keep it fresh, so to speak, you know, using my cool young person lingo.

524
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,839
Uh, because, yeah, II, I recognize that where I was like, oh, that's stupid.

525
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:54,959
Why would anyone want that?

526
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,599
And it was, in fact, my kids really got me into this where they,

527
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,000
they play games on their tablets and they do things and I'm like,

528
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,050
that doesn't even make sense. I don't get this.

529
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,390
And then one day I thought I'm turning into an old person. I can't be like that.

530
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,170
So now I,

531
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,959
now I play the weird games with them on their tablets and I

532
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,589
download the apps and I try it all out and it's actually,

533
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,280
it's a lot of fun.

534
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,949
Honestly, it's way easier than being old and crabby. So

535
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,300
I prove,

536
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:20,609
yeah, speaking of which my one son is turned into a murder hobo in Minecraft,

537
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,900
a murder hobo.

538
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,430
What

539
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,420
does he ride the rails

540
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,910
where there's a village?

541
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,900
And the, he'll go to the village and if he gives it the full treatment,

542
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,300
he will fill it with zombies,

543
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,079
then he will burn it down

544
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,520
and then he will flood it with, uh, sorry.

545
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,910
Yeah, it's zombies.

546
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,180
Fire explosives,

547
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,390
lava is the sequence of essentially biblical plagues

548
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,819
that he will visit upon these poor villagers.

549
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,390
I'd keep an eye on that one if I was you.

550
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,079
Well, it's,

551
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:51,540
it's, he takes such delight in it.

552
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,069
So he's playing on creative mode, I assume now you use it.

553
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,060
He's playing on a tablet though, right?

554
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,489
That's too bad

555
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,280
because if you play on the computer,

556
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:02,810
you can type in like cheat code commands.

557
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:09,859
And uh one time I created a block of TNT that was, I think, 500 by 500 by 500.

558
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,359
And then I, I set it off and

559
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,599
it was amazing because first it starts exploding

560
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:21,930
and obviously there were a lot of TNT S and my computer, like,

561
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:25,599
basically froze and I just walked away and thought I'm gonna see what happens

562
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,689
and I came back in like an hour and it was still exploding.

563
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,810
And then, uh, I waited a bit longer and eventually it settled down

564
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,040
and the carnage was amazing

565
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,670
because it would have blown the blocks outward.

566
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:41,939
That's

567
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:42,250
it.

568
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,819
Exactly. Because some of the looking

569
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,689
and, and in fact, I then, like,

570
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:50,890
wandered around quite a lot to see what was happening and,

571
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,369
and you could see explosion damage

572
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:56,189
like farther than you could see

573
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,229
where this stuff. It just, it was amazing. It was so much fun to do

574
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:02,489
anyway. This is, this is a security podcast. Kurt.

575
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,650
-- Why are we, why are we talking about? Mine? Minecraft
-- is fun.

576
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:07,449
Speaking of fun.

577
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,170
Right.

578
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,930
Let's, uh, so I read a thing that they want to

579
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,880
make you take your books out of your bag

580
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,439
when you go through security at the airport. Now,

581
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,569
-- what do you think of that
-- this is airport security in the US. Correct.

582
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:21,489
-- Of
-- course.

583
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,130
Sorry. I know.

584
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,920
I,

585
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:31,780
-- although
-- I don't have a lot of high ground to take as a Canadian but

586
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,520
every once in a while you guys do this and it's just like what,

587
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:36,989
I, I don't even know what to think of this.

588
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,489
It's,

589
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,719
-- well, you have your business card situation.
-- I do.

590
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,859
And, and for those of you listening, I, I, whenever I go places to,

591
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:48,699
to various conferences, I have a box of cards.

592
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,530
I made up for the podcast that I hand out.

593
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,040
That is like the website address and Twitter handles and stuff on it.

594
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,119
And they're, they're very thick cards.

595
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,569
And

596
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,479
every time I have a box of those in my bag,

597
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,609
my bag is pulled aside and they tear it apart

598
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:06,020
and then they spend a significant amount of time messing

599
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,010
with that little box of business cards because I,

600
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,369
I suspect the density must set off their uh scanner,

601
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,660
which is just like, yeah, it's business cards

602
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,750
and then they look at me funny, like,

603
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,739
sure,

604
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,839
open it up, man. Yeah, I'm pretty sure, you know, it's,

605
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,829
although I had that too, I was going through security a while back and they,

606
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,199
they flagged my, my microphone, my, my little podcast microphone I carry with me.

607
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:31,739
It's not that

608
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:33,040
it's

609
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,969
the

610
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,349
Mike, the Samsung go oh

611
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,260
man, dude, this thing you can like, beat someone to death with this.

612
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,189
I'd be amazed if they let this on an airplane.

613
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:42,760
But

614
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,670
for those of you who don't know,

615
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,349
I have a road podcaster as my mic and it is really heavy and it is huge.

616
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,670
I would not bring this anywhere.

617
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,280
Uh But anyway, yeah, the go mic and they were like, the, the lady kept looking at it.

618
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,790
She's like, what is this? Like I said, it's the microphone.

619
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,900
She's like looking at me looking at it and it's just funny because, you know,

620
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,170
they're obviously,

621
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,290
I imagine they act like this because they're waiting for

622
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,390
you to like get nervous or sweaty or something.

623
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,130
And it's just,

624
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,459
it was bizarre.

625
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:09,180
And then of course, when they're done, you know, they're like,

626
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,739
give me my pile of garbage and I have to put it all back together.

627
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,079
But,

628
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,550
uh,

629
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,310
although I had that too in, uh I was in, it was when I was leaving Amsterdam,

630
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,790
I, I get to the airport and I have to go through security

631
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,369
and, and they,

632
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,569
they send my bag to the X ray and the lady says we're gonna have to double check this

633
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,849
and then she opens it up and she just looks at me and goes OMG and they literally

634
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:35,949
took every single thing out of my backpack and it had a ton of crap in it.

635
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:39,589
It was just insane. I bet it took me half an hour to get through security

636
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,670
just because this poor lady kept taking stuff out and then running it through

637
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,020
the X ray and taking more stuff out and running through the X ray.

638
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:45,699
What

639
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:49,819
traveling with, I mean, I travel with uh like a tablet, my laptop,

640
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,489
my kindle my battery, a pile of wires,

641
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,760
the wires I think are what really set it off.

642
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,550
But then I also have like USB hub and my charging stuff and I've got

643
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,130
my, my portable battery and I, my Nintendo three Ds and a tablet and

644
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:05,979
just a bunch of weird. The thing is none of it's

645
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:09,369
big. It's just a bunch of weird little crap.

646
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:12,229
And they had to take it all out

647
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,989
every and, and, oh man, it was so annoying.

648
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,689
I'm actually, you know, here's an idea for a start up.

649
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,380
Somebody make a thing where I can get a custom made

650
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,949
sort of like a roll of plastic with pouches on it

651
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,979
all custom sizes. So I basically put into the website, what electronics I own.

652
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:28,880
And then you send me this thing and it's kind of like

653
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,199
I put the electronics in this clear plastic roll up pouch,

654
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,589
put it in my backpack and then when I get to the airport I can just pull it out,

655
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,630
unroll it and be like

656
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:36,609
here.

657
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,109
That would be kind of clever.

658
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:39,250
Yeah.

659
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,349
Like, you know, those old leather things that people would roll their tools up in

660
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,400
pockets for their tools.

661
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,329
Let's face it. Right. Like we're like,

662
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,329
well, and they were talking about that laptop,

663
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,849
not banning laptops from the cabins of airplanes, but making them, like,

664
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:55,199
more difficult to bring on board.

665
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:55,959
And I'm like, well,

666
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:59,339
the reality is, like, I mean, if I'm going, like,

667
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:01,209
I can't spend 23 hours at the airport,

668
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:03,579
then a couple of hours on the airplane without my laptop.

669
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,640
Like, I, what am I going to do? Right. It's a waste of a day basically at that.

670
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,020
And that's actually been one of the topics that keeps coming up.

671
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,739
It's the story evolves in the bizarre and strange ways.

672
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,359
It does is they think a lot of business travelers just aren't going to travel.

673
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,040
-- And I get that
-- right.

674
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,869
I would certainly avoid it if I could, like, if II, I don't travel a lot. But, um,

675
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,439
I, I,

676
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:27,699
I'm not gonna travel without my laptop because otherwise I've lost an entire day.

677
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,000
-- Yeah.
-- Right. Right.

678
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,040
No, I, I wouldn't,

679
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,949
I would very much be in a similar situation where

680
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,880
I would think long and hard about that trip.

681
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,760
Yeah. I mean, what am I going to do? Bring, like, Warren Peace to read,

682
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,130
uh, if you ever read Warren Peace?

683
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,890
No. And I never will because I've read about it.

684
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,329
It's very long, it's not the most exciting book either.

685
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,040
I'll, I'll say I did read it because I thought

686
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:53,810
this feels like one of those things I just have to do as a human

687
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,170
and, uh, I will never read it again.

688
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:58,500
I'll just say that.

689
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,229
However, however, the one thing I will say is you can tell it was written by a Russian

690
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,599
because it makes Napoleon seem like an incompetent moron all over the book.

691
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,050
It's very funny like that. Yes. Yes.

692
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,089
Oh, man. Just thinking about it.

693
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,040
It took me so long to read too because, well, the other, the other hard thing and,

694
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,939
uh, I,

695
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:21,260
I found this when I was a youngster and I read Crime and

696
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,079
Punishment for the first time is I am bad at Russian names.

697
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:28,469
I can't pronounce them, but not only that many of them look the same to me.

698
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:31,010
And so I remember reading Crime and Punishment, I reached a point.

699
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,479
I was actually writing names down on a piece of paper

700
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,839
and what they did.

701
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,219
So when they would talk about somebody be like, oh, that's the policeman or?

702
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:41,680
Oh, that's the landlady. You know, because I, like, I could not figure it out

703
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,760
just because, like many of them look the same to me and, and I had no clue.

704
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,430
Yeah. Right. Right. Um, although I had the same problem with Lord of the Rings as well

705
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,780
where, like, all the made up name,

706
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,540
I don't even know who this person is in

707
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,650
his future point. I just read it actually, I just finished it maybe 23 weeks ago

708
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,530
and

709
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:03,329
now that I've read it like 100 times and I've seen the movies many, many times.

710
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,089
I, I know who everyone is,

711
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:08,849
which does make the book far more enjoyable rather than the first time I read it.

712
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:12,250
I'm like, wait, wait, who's this guy? What's he doing? What? Who?

713
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:13,010
Yeah.

714
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,375
Although I guess at the same time I can tie that back to security.

715
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:17,944
That's probably what normal people feel like

716
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:19,295
when we start talking about something,

717
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,045
-- I don't know
-- the

718
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:21,824
acronyms.

719
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:25,084
I keep running into these acronyms where I'm like,

720
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:28,954
I absolutely don't remember what that means or, you know,

721
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,724
it's an acronym that has multiple meanings.

722
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,645
Those are the best kind, aren't they?

723
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,010
Yeah,

724
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,619
but his GP Dr

725
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,160
R oh man, we should do a show about that at some point.

726
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,780
It's, it's gonna be messed up and, and it's one of those things that at first I thought

727
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:46,030
that,

728
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,260
that corporations would find a loophole or something

729
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,739
around this and it sounds like they're not,

730
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,199
they don't,

731
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,479
it, it sounds like it, man. It's gonna be, it's gonna be crazy.

732
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,270
Yeah.

733
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,109
So, well, speaking of crazy.

734
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,109
-- So you recently got to deal with sort of a standards related?
-- Oh,

735
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,869
yes.

736
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:03,800
So,

737
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,000
so I'm excited to talk about. This is

738
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,500
so, so I live in, in a very old house.

739
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,430
It's, it's was built in 1990.

740
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,959
It is, it's on the

741
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,699
National Historic Registry or something in Washington DC.

742
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,229
And it's uh

743
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,660
right. So, so the house has not been

744
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:24,989
remodeled a lot.

745
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,560
It's all a lot of original,

746
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,790
everything on the inside which is actually a good thing because in, in, like, the,

747
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,589
the fifties and sixties, they,

748
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,170
they would do these horrendous things to

749
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,270
these historic properties and it was awful.

750
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,630
And so I'm very happy that I don't have that problem.

751
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,310
And anyway, uh,

752
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,000
I wanted to add a door,

753
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:45,560
like there was a wall and I needed a door there. Sort of add a door. Right.

754
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,479
-- This isn't like, oh, just go by a door and put it in. No, no,
-- no, no.

755
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,550
-- And this is an exterior door too. Not
-- exterior

756
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:51,510
door. It's an interior

757
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,640
interior. Oh, well, that shouldn't be a big deal. I mean, it's not a load

758
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,219
bearing wall. I,

759
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:56,050
it was,

760
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,930
uh, but no,

761
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,020
that's ok. That's, that's easy. That's no big deal.

762
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,959
It was from a bedroom to a closet.

763
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,800
And,

764
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,410
right. Right. Because,

765
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,130
yeah, yeah, it's, the house is weird and

766
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,410
basically every bedroom

767
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,550
and, and

768
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:16,910
the, the way it's set up like every wall of a bedroom butts up to a closet.

769
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,119
And we wanted one of the bedrooms to have access to two closets instead of one.

770
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,849
And so you can actually now get from, uh,

771
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,030
every room but one just by walking through closets.

772
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,930
Which is kind of weird. It's, it's just, it's an old house. Right.

773
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:31,489
Old houses are weird. Anyway. Anyway,

774
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,760
so the point is I basically had to cut a big hole in the wall and put a door in and I,

775
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,170
I didn't just, like, go by a door.

776
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,439
Right. I had like an old historic door in the basement.

777
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:43,380
So I use that and, and, and right, it, it's crazy. And so

778
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,819
my grandfather was a carpenter so I knew how to do all this stuff

779
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:50,739
and I, I don't like it when other people mess with my stuff.

780
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,319
So I,

781
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,579
I don't like letting contractors work on the

782
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:55,520
inside of the house because they mess it up

783
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:58,189
or, or they don't listen to me, which is even worse.

784
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:58,920
But,

785
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,339
but anyway, anyway, the thing that really got me thinking about all this is

786
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,479
like there were no standards in 1919, right?

787
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:09,329
People just built stuff, everything was done by an artisan

788
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:13,060
and it was crazy because nothing makes sense and,

789
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:14,300
and you don't even know what you're going to find

790
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,930
until you start taking it apart and then it's like,

791
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,130
why would anyone do that?

792
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,050
And, and I only hit that three or four times. Thank goodness. But,

793
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,329
but the point is it really got me thinking about security while I was doing this and,

794
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,849
you know, cursing at things and smashing my hands with,

795
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:29,130
with hammers and stuff like that. But

796
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,239
the point is

797
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,339
if you look at security today, we do artisanal security for the most part, right?

798
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,020
Where it is,

799
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,729
everything is kind of a one off special thing

800
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,099
and then

801
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:42,250
it

802
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,890
is, it's madness but not only that,

803
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,619
the other thing that I was really thinking about a lot is

804
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,699
when you have this old stuff,

805
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:54,420
it just sits there for a long time and, and you kind of get that, you know, a,

806
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,050
a body at rest wants to stay at rest. Right.

807
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:03,180
And I feel like there's a lot of security and it like that where it's just,

808
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:07,219
it's this old stuff that if you touch it or you look at it wrong,

809
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,870
it just collapses and you end up with a mess.

810
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,949
-- Right. It's
-- worse. You know, people have built additional things onto it

811
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,260
based on the lessons they've learned. You know.

812
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,379
Well, it always reminds me of the Mozilla code base, right.

813
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,780
When they, they basically made an effort to rewrite Firefox and they basically

814
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,889
almost died because,

815
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,540
you know, the amount of sort of work, um,

816
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,260
like, what always gets me is, you know,

817
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,719
especially whenever a business tries to do an SAP or some sort of, er,

818
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:34,820
p deployment

819
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,458
and the problem is to do that,

820
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,989
you have to move all your processes into a computer and computers are dumb

821
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,570
and they're not like Agnes from accounting

822
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,800
who has 50 years of institutional knowledge and

823
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,100
can like paper over glitches in the form or people forgot to fill out stuff.

824
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,780
You know, you have to put your exact data

825
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,060
models and processes and everything into the system for it to work and it

826
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,239
always fails or ends up going like 3 to 10 times over budget.

827
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,429
Well,

828
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:04,500
yes, I

829
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:06,479
don't know what they're doing.

830
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:06,709
But this

831
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:06,879
is,

832
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,820
this is the same problem though, as, as working on 100 year old house is

833
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,850
in the absence of standards, people just do whatever

834
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,969
and doing whatever is fine

835
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,570
if it's only a one off weird thing.

836
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,780
But as soon as you have more than one person or

837
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,530
you're talking about long term maintainability or anything like that,

838
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:30,330
the lack of standards becomes a nightmare and

839
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,850
something will take two or three times as long

840
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,540
as it would if their standards, I mean,

841
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,959
and I got to thinking about this,

842
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:40,989
like you go to the store now and every piece of lumber is basically a standard size,

843
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,080
right? It it makes sense there are you buy doors, doors are a standard size.

844
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,919
You know, you've got doorknobs, standard size. All this makes sense.

845
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,360
You don't have to worry about it.

846
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,189
Instead, I'm out in my garage trying to like build a door frame

847
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,610
because I have this door. That's a bizarre size and weighs 10 million pounds.

848
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,590
And not only that, like

849
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:00,590
I had to dig through,

850
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,820
I've got this like bucket of parts because whenever I find old timey parts,

851
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,889
I buy them because

852
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,830
you can't, you know, you can't buy them for real.

853
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,310
So anyway, you know, I'm like digging through, trying to find hinges that fit right?

854
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,620
And trying to find like the door closer and the knobs and

855
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm thinking this is crazy, like just

856
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,409
it's complete madness, right?

857
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,840
Because everything was completely different and, and yeah,

858
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,590
I ended up doing like an insane amount of

859
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,790
surgery to make this stuff work and just thinking,

860
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,629
you know, this took me four days and really it would have taken if

861
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:30,189
it

862
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:30,760
was

863
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,840
-- you make
-- any documentation to leave behind for the next time.

864
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:35,199
No. Screw that guy.

865
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,689
Right.

866
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,919
He's on his own.

867
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,399
And that's,

868
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:41,590
that's one thing that got me was as part of a modern building process too is,

869
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,479
um,

870
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,899
you have your blueprints and especially, well, more so for like, you know,

871
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:48,850
industrial stuff where it's big and complicated

872
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
versus like a relatively simple house,

873
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,560
but you have your blueprints and then you have your US built plan

874
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,979
where you literally take like the blueprint and modify it because,

875
00:36:59,399 --> 00:36:59,580
um,

876
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,350
so I spent six months working for a large

877
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,850
electrical contractor locally that did primarily industrial work.

878
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,760
So things like, you know, oil refineries,

879
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,449
like all the wiring for a new oil refinery or whatever.

880
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,370
And, you know,

881
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:13,709
and it turns out that like this thing and this thing are both bigger than we thought.

882
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,570
So they don't fit in the same room or, you know, whatever, right?

883
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,370
This machine has to be moved over here.

884
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,639
So you got to move cable over and, you know,

885
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,239
you, you can't just have like random, you know,

886
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,879
15,000 volt lines running around your plant and not know what they are.

887
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:29,209
You know, that's ok.

888
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,850
Like, honestly in a house you can have random 120 volt lines and you probably do,

889
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,139
uh, not my house because I had it rewired.

890
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:39,060
Yeah, from scratch. But, you know, most people don't have to do that.

891
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,729
Thank goodness.

892
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,070
And, you know, that's the thing that gets me too is like when I look at all these,

893
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,219
it deployments

894
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,060
and security deployments, not only are they handcrafted, most of them are not

895
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,659
documented or if they are documented, they get documented when they get built

896
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,550
-- and then they get changed.
-- Oh, man, they, they're never documented and in fact,

897
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:59,969
any time I talk to someone about starting like a security program

898
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:03,379
or any sort of like they want to start doing security.

899
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,090
What's the first thing you say, you say, get an inventory of your stuff? Right.

900
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,219
And even that is an insurmountable problem for the vast majority of people I talk to

901
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,419
where they, they just, their heads explode when they think about it.

902
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,879
Well, yeah, I mean, even if you know your entire IP space,

903
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,360
there's still stuff potentially behind that

904
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,389
or running a private IP space

905
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:29,479
with the computer under his desk. Right. I

906
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:30,439
mean,

907
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,639
actually that's, it's one of the really funny things I remember many,

908
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:36,679
many years ago I was working at a small company and uh, yeah,

909
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,699
like the web server was a computer under a dude's desk.

910
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:40,239
Literally.

911
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,254
It's just what, what

912
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:43,574
like, how did

913
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:44,945
today you think it works?

914
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:48,274
And it's madness. But back then like that was, that was no big deal.

915
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:50,445
That's still what a lot of small businesses do. Right.

916
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,544
They'll have their one copy of what is it? Windows,

917
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:54,715
small business server sbs

918
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:58,715
and it's in the broom closet. Right. Like under the leaky water heater.

919
00:38:58,885 --> 00:38:59,274
And

920
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:02,435
-- exactly,
-- there's a tape drive with tapes being rotated out.

921
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,840
Actually, I remember that too. II, I remember working for a company that

922
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:10,959
they, they had a tape drive

923
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,159
and they just kept, like, someone knew it was their job on, on Friday to, like,

924
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,040
switch the tape.

925
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,699
And I remember thinking, like, do you even know if these tapes work?

926
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,010
And, and they were, the tapes are like,

927
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,050
five years old and they'd all been written into a million times and I'm thinking,

928
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,239
I bet these things are shot and they probably don't work at all anymore.

929
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,280
But that was someone's job on Friday. Go switch the tapes.

930
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:33,649
Yeah.

931
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,199
Yeah. No, I mean, it's, these are tough problems and, uh,

932
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,479
yeah, I, at this point I'm even, you know, I have a small home network and, uh,

933
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:46,000
I actually had a surprise system on it at one point I'd forgotten about.

934
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,550
I always love the stories too of the university that, like,

935
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,820
sealed up the old sun server behind a wall or something and

936
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,479
nobody knew it was there and it was running for 12 years.

937
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:55,800
Or,

938
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,739
I believe that that kind of stuff happens all the time,

939
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:03,929
I guess though. This is a, an ad for cloud.

940
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:07,260
Well, it's gonna happen in cloud two people already do that.

941
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,239
You know, they, they set up a cloud service and they forget it exists or,

942
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,600
uh, the classic thing with like Amazon and whatnot,

943
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,429
you set up virtual servers and forget about them.

944
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:18,250
And so there's actually like, software and services now that will go through your,

945
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,429
like,

946
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:21,570
infrastructure and actually match it to what you're paying for and then be like,

947
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,300
there's all this other stuff you're paying for that.

948
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,679
-- We can't figure out why you're paying for it. Right.
-- Exactly.

949
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,439
And, and that's what makes it nice though is because, I mean,

950
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:31,199
let's say you're a moderately sized organization,

951
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,060
there's no way you can scan your IP space and,

952
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,750
and accurately know what's going on just because people do crazy stuff.

953
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,500
You know, you might have had the guy from accounting,

954
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,679
brought his old home router in and now he's got

955
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,919
10 things sitting behind that and you can't see him.

956
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:45,300
You know,

957
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:48,570
there's just all kinds of crazy stuff like that. That happens and,

958
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,719
and I get it because let's face it. People want to get their job done. Right.

959
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:54,310
They don't care about security. Security isn't a feature.

960
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,030
It's the thing that gets in their way.

961
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:59,100
And so if bringing the old router in, fixes their problem,

962
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,020
they're going to do it and they don't care what the security guy says.

963
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,909
Yeah, I think, and it kind of goes back to, like,

964
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,750
inventory control for physical stuff.

965
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,739
Right. Companies used to be terrible at that.

966
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:13,739
You know, when you think about, when you look at the, like, the losses

967
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,560
of product during shipping prior to containerization.

968
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,899
Oh, man, I can't,

969
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,090
it

970
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:19,250
was

971
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:19,399
a

972
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:20,350
show,

973
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,429
you know,

974
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,850
uh, in some things it was as high as 10 or 20% between the factory and the end store.

975
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,929
I believe that, whoops, it went missing,

976
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,239
you know, and the time involved as well as shipping this stuff and,

977
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,179
and to say nothing of actual breakage.

978
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:37,790
Right. No, I totally get that,

979
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:39,510
you know, and I, I think that's,

980
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,320
that's one of the benefits I think too of

981
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,820
Cloud is that you have this external organization.

982
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,070
That's like, well, if you're going to use this,

983
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,310
we're going to send you a bill for it and we're actually like,

984
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,270
we have to know what you're using because we want to bill you for it.

985
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,050
Right. That's,

986
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:52,540
you know,

987
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,780
how many companies have stuff that's well past its

988
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,899
like three year or four year amortization date,

989
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,139
but still in use.

990
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,250
But officially it's like, maybe off the books.

991
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,090
Oh, man, I bet there's tons and tons of that.

992
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,219
Tons of it.

993
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,810
Yeah. Well, if it still works then, yeah, I mean, use it.

994
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,100
I, man, I remember that too. I remember when I, when I was a cis

995
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:12,729
edin

996
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:19,699
we had machines that were, I mean, they were old, like, scary old stuff but it it ran.

997
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:22,409
So nobody touched it. But again, we kind of come back to that,

998
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,139
you know, a system at rest wants to stay at rest. And everyone knew,

999
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,770
like, don't touch that machine.

1000
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,129
In fact,

1001
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:32,010
I remember we had one machine even that we were afraid to power off and we would,

1002
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,939
we would shut down the whole data center

1003
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:37,489
just so the UPS could keep running that one machine because we were definitely

1004
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,010
afraid it would never come back to life and it did something really important.

1005
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,260
I don't even remember what it was. It was some accounting software or something.

1006
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,909
Yeah. No, I imagine I had that happen.

1007
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:51,070
I had a fan freeze when I rebooted a server, uh, due to a power outage and it,

1008
00:42:51,129 --> 00:42:54,840
it came back up and then, uh, yeah, the, the main case fan

1009
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,949
was frozen.

1010
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,500
Did

1011
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:57,889
you?

1012
00:42:58,889 --> 00:42:59,360
But

1013
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,209
if you spun it with your finger, it would

1014
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:06,060
spin but it didn't, like, it was sticky enough that it on its own,

1015
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,030
it couldn't get going

1016
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:07,939
interesting.

1017
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:10,969
Now, could you turn it on and then, like, poke it with your finger and everything?

1018
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:12,850
Yeah, that's what I did the first time.

1019
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,270
I was like, oh, dead fan and then I spun it with my finger, of course.

1020
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,889
And it started moving and I'm like, oh, ok,

1021
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,040
part

1022
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,649
Dead fan. The best kind.

1023
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,520
That's like,

1024
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,689
that's how so much stuff in it works. All right. We pushed it down the hill.

1025
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,870
Everything's cool. Let's go back to work.

1026
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,459
Yeah, exactly.

1027
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,590
It's not on fire

1028
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,250
yet

1029
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,050
so.

1030
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,879
Well, it's, it's the human condition. I think

1031
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,939
it is. People are the problem. Right.

1032
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:42,409
Well, it's, it's funny because, like,

1033
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,060
they even have this problem in the space station

1034
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,620
on the, is SS where on the one hand,

1035
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:49,850
they kind of want the astronauts not to be living in,

1036
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,860
like a rat's nest of exposed cabling.

1037
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,969
But at the same time the astronauts are like, we don't want to spend time like

1038
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:56,709
putting cables back in place.

1039
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,939
We just want to fix whatever it was and get on with all our other stuff because,

1040
00:44:00,149 --> 00:44:01,860
you know, there's only so many hours in a day.

1041
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,929
Yeah, I, I totally get that. I mean, well, that's like any server room, right? It's,

1042
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:10,659
I, I, I've been in the position before where the server room got so bad.

1043
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:14,310
We, we decided, you know, and the next time maintenance was happening, we,

1044
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,489
we literally took all the cables out because

1045
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,979
it was just, you, you could not figure it out

1046
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,379
and we ran new cables and then, yeah,

1047
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:25,159
like a year later it was a mess again because nobody, nobody does it right.

1048
00:44:25,169 --> 00:44:25,300
You know,

1049
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,939
we had everything beautifully organized and we had zip

1050
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,020
ties around groups that needed to be together.

1051
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,699
We had every, you know, they had the overhead rack thing, whatever the,

1052
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:35,679
the cable trays.

1053
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:36,449
Yeah, whatever,

1054
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:40,010
you know, everything was nicely lined up. It all made perfect sense.

1055
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,969
And, yeah, in, in a year it was terrible again. And we're like, well, so much for that.

1056
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:46,699
It's, I, I don't know, it's crazy, man.

1057
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,959
You know, the one part of me always wants to have tidy cabling,

1058
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,000
but the reality is quite often, you know, it,

1059
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,590
it's just not actually that much of a problem, like,

1060
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,080
and that's the problem with a lot of security, right,

1061
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,409
until you get attacked or something that, that security hole is not, you know,

1062
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:01,979
those old windows XP machines that were running the,

1063
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:03,739
the National Health Service in Britain

1064
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,080
were generally not a problem until, you know, they all got wiped out one day.

1065
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,899
That's a good point. Actually, I think Cabling makes a lot of sense in this analogy

1066
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:18,879
because it, it doesn't matter in most cases, well, until it does

1067
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,959
because we've all been in that situation where, where you need to figure out what,

1068
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:26,840
you know, what, where the other end of this cable goes and you just, you can't do it.

1069
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:27,510
It's,

1070
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:28,870
-- it's a nightmare.
-- Yeah.

1071
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:29,899
And there is, and, you know,

1072
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:34,729
there is a small chance that it just won't be a problem and you, you get away with it.

1073
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:37,540
So, and if you do then great, you know, you just save the business,

1074
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,010
how many hours or dollars.

1075
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,370
Right. Right. You know, I have a great Cabling story. Actually.

1076
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:45,530
I don't, I don't think I've ever told this one on the podcast, but I was, I was,

1077
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,570
but a wee lad

1078
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,879
out of college, it was my first job

1079
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,300
and

1080
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,500
there's

1081
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:51,889
the,

1082
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:57,739
the server room was wired up and they had run two cables to go from the router to the,

1083
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,620
the firewall.

1084
00:45:58,919 --> 00:45:59,340
Right.

1085
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,919
This was, this was back in the day when,

1086
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:03,669
like you had just a special router to connect to the T one line,

1087
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,060
two cables. That way they had redundancy.

1088
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:08,590
And I look at it and I, what's that?

1089
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:10,489
So what was the purpose of

1090
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,379
the, it was dark, right? It was just dark.

1091
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:16,770
They did this because they thought they might need an extra cable some day

1092
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,929
or if it went out or something.

1093
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,040
And I remember I looked at it and I was, I was,

1094
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,409
this was when I was planning out how to rewire everything

1095
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,530
and I said, hey, uh these cables are mislabeled

1096
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:30,979
and, and this guy, this was back, remember when the M CS ES were all like, oh,

1097
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:31,929
I'm so special.

1098
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:34,080
I have an M CS E and they all thought they were amazing.

1099
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:36,959
I had an M CS C back in those days.

1100
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:38,610
So, you know exactly what I'm talking about

1101
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,070
in fairness. I test well during multiple choice exams and getting the M CS E,

1102
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,080
I actually managed to get it down to four hours

1103
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,199
reading the prep books and then just go write the exam

1104
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,320
well done,

1105
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:49,899
you

1106
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:50,780
know.

1107
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:55,639
But anyway, uh this is one of those guys, right? Like I have an M CS E I know everything.

1108
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:58,290
And I was of course, the young starry

1109
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,879
eyed open source fanatic.

1110
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,939
And I remember I, I mentioned

1111
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,860
that, hey, these cables are mislabeled. He's like, no, they're not.

1112
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,719
I said no, but they, they really are.

1113
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:10,699
Look, the, the light isn't lighting up on this cable, but it is on that one.

1114
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:12,860
Which means that's the one in use. He said no, the,

1115
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,280
the it was a hub, literally a hub that had the cables connected to it.

1116
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,179
And he said, the, the lights in the hub are broken.

1117
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:20,199
And I thought

1118
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,739
what, like, why, why would, why

1119
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,939
would the lights on the hub be like,

1120
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:28,770
exactly flipped on these two cables exactly in this way.

1121
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,500
And this guy was like, I labeled these myself, I guarantee the the hub is broken.

1122
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,939
I said,

1123
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,379
so if I unplug this cable here, the everything should still work, right?

1124
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:38,219
He's like, yeah, go ahead

1125
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,959
and I plugged the cable

1126
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:42,889
uh effectively turning off the internet for the building.

1127
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,040
And of course, as you can imagine, like two minutes later,

1128
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,270
everyone was like banging on the server room door saying the internet's broken,

1129
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,000
what's going on?

1130
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,239
I just remember looking at this guy and I'm like,

1131
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,439
but now, you know, and you got to get really mad, of course. But,

1132
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,020
you know, it's just, it's always stuff like that.

1133
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,129
I, I think about especially in security where

1134
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,939
we love to think we're right.

1135
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:05,909
You know,

1136
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:09,949
-- reality sometimes it,
-- well, it, it came up kind of with the whole stack

1137
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:13,399
thing, right? So, for those of you that don't remember the whole stack guard debacle

1138
00:48:13,919 --> 00:48:15,429
have stack guard pages.

1139
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,330
That's like three emergencies ago.

1140
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:19,840
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. So we're gonna have a little recap.

1141
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:22,879
So you, the idea being is that you don't want the heap and

1142
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,169
uh the stack and what not to grow too big and get to areas they shouldn't.

1143
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,110
-- So that, you know,
-- they,

1144
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:29,689
they grow,

1145
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,270
they grow towards each other.

1146
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:32,500
And if they, if they

1147
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,550
clash,

1148
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,830
then you have problems.

1149
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,229
So we have like this guard page in the middle and

1150
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:41,949
you know, there's ways to kind of jump over it.

1151
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,520
And so anyways, one of the things was there's this,

1152
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,070
uh what is it F stack check or protect?

1153
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,679
I always,

1154
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,399
I can't remember

1155
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:48,909
F

1156
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,760
stack check. So the idea is F stack check, you compile it in

1157
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,909
uh

1158
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:54,590
it's a

1159
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,280
Gipsy thing

1160
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:59,520
and I think it's available maybe conceptually in some other libraries.

1161
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:04,580
But anyways, you compile it in and you get a bunch of well checks and protections,

1162
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:04,969
right?

1163
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,129
Except the,

1164
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,239
except the code apparently doesn't really work as we'd hoped because it was

1165
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:15,500
written 20 years ago. And based on a, a

1166
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,520
whoops,

1167
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:18,750
which is a programming language

1168
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:20,550
that has

1169
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,030
a very different design culture behind it than say c

1170
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,870
you know,

1171
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,000
uh it's, it's a very different

1172
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:33,620
environment. Uh And so these assumptions taken from a

1173
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,080
A and applied to like

1174
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:35,580
glib

1175
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:36,110
Z

1176
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:37,760
just don't work,

1177
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,840
like, it's so f stack it, it just, the, the protective mechanism

1178
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,879
doesn't work at all as well as we'd hoped.

1179
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:49,629
And, but again, because nobody really uses this mechanism much, it,

1180
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:51,070
it just sort of had never come up,

1181
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:52,500
you know,

1182
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,149
your cabling issues or your whatever issues, you know, like,

1183
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,989
and that's the problem is, you know, now, well,

1184
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,449
now we've discovered it's a problem and, you know, people are working on it.

1185
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,389
But again, it's one of those problems where, you know,

1186
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:05,379
we can't just make a simple change to it because it's,

1187
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:06,540
it's not

1188
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:08,649
like a code flaw. It's a,

1189
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,810
and it's not even a design flaw, it's like a, a cultural historical

1190
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,530
precedence,

1191
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,379
you know, where it comes from conceptually flawed.

1192
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:20,030
That's crazy, man.

1193
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:22,270
It's like comparing X 86 to arm.

1194
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:24,629
They're, they're two very different things.

1195
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:28,899
You know, they share a lot of concepts because they're computers.

1196
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,729
But fundamentally, there's just some things that are, you know,

1197
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:33,750
if you're an X 86 guy and you go to arm,

1198
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,229
you know, you, you need to relearn some things.

1199
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:38,250
I

1200
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:40,790
feel sad that they have a proper stack on arm.

1201
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,899
It's slightly better, but they, they, they had a chance to get that right.

1202
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:44,709
And they didn't.

1203
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:45,550
That's right.

1204
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,000
Actually the Titanium and, and I know this is probably a terrible thing to say,

1205
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,070
but the Titanium actually did this right is, they had a special

1206
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:55,560
area for, for the stack registers.

1207
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,469
-- That way you weren't like pushing it. Well, it's
-- kind of, I seem

1208
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,659
to remember it caused some performance issues.

1209
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:04,590
-- Probably
-- the whole freaking chip was a performance issue

1210
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,229
because it was like a nightmare to program for.

1211
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,439
But regardless of that, they got the stack part. Right?

1212
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:12,820
I think, because they had something like, what was it?

1213
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,560
Eight or 12 registers just for stack variables.

1214
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:19,929
And if you surpass that, then they'd put some things on the stack.

1215
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:22,429
But generally speaking, the important stuff lived elsewhere.

1216
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:23,800
And so it was very nice actually.

1217
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,530
But then, you know,

1218
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,280
there's an example of your program needs to

1219
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,149
do the right thing because there's programs that

1220
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,709
can and in some cases legitimately do need

1221
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,070
huge stacks like megabytes or even a gigabyte.

1222
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:38,310
-- No,
-- the stack can be large.

1223
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,149
The problem was the registers because what happens is when you,

1224
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:44,060
when you jump into a new function, it basically takes all the registers,

1225
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,909
pushes them on the stack, then starts execution of the new function.

1226
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,260
And then when you, when you pop

1227
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,540
right, you come back from that function and the it replaces all the registers.

1228
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,500
And that's obviously the issue with a stack buffer

1229
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,989
overflow is you override a bunch of these registers,

1230
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,060
they get restored.

1231
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,219
And all of a sudden whoa crazy things are going on.

1232
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:02,219
And,

1233
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,129
and obviously in something like the attan,

1234
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,790
the the stack

1235
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,540
registers were nowhere near the buffers So even if there was an overflow,

1236
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,780
you were just overflowing other data, not that, that can't be abused,

1237
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,090
but you get the idea.

1238
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,379
It's

1239
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,790
how big were those stack registers in the Itanium? Right?

1240
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,860
There were like eight or 12 of them. I, I forget there weren't a ton.

1241
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,790
So basically, that meant you could essentially,

1242
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,020
if you were passing more than like 10 variables

1243
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,979
into the function call,

1244
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,479
then it would have to do some stack shenanigans.

1245
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:34,699
But if it was obviously the compiler decides all this

1246
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,489
and if it was less, then it would just use the,

1247
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,260
the special stack registers to take care of it, which obviously made it much,

1248
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,169
much more safe.

1249
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:43,800
But,

1250
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:45,020
but anyway, anyway,

1251
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:45,840
uh

1252
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:48,520
-- and, and then see that's
-- the problem I have is a lot of this.

1253
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:54,310
The problem now is we have such a catalog of software that runs on

1254
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,850
say X 86 and arm with a whole pile of assumptions behind it.

1255
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:01,800
If you break one of those assumptions, you just broke everything,

1256
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,649
right?

1257
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,090
And that's one thing I really respect about

1258
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,010
the Linux kernel guide is their mantra of,

1259
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,050
you cannot break user land.

1260
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,389
Uh Yes, I like end of story and I agree because,

1261
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,870
well, we, we, you know,

1262
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,310
there's some issues with some of the snack

1263
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,270
card patches around some of the Java stuff.

1264
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,149
And so yeah, no, it's, it's, it's not good. It's

1265
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:24,709
potentially for some people really bad so much

1266
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:26,550
so that they can't use the security update.

1267
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,840
Wild.

1268
00:53:28,129 --> 00:53:28,379
Wow. I

1269
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:28,810
didn't realize

1270
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:29,800
that's

1271
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:30,979
lucky now.

1272
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:33,120
Yeah. You know, and it's

1273
00:53:33,439 --> 00:53:35,370
so, you know, we,

1274
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,540
we can't burn it all down and start fresh. We just can't afford it.

1275
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,540
You know, it would be like changing the width of railway lines,

1276
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,330
didn't they do that in the Czech Republic or something once?

1277
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:46,320
Uh,

1278
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:52,310
-- they, well, I know Russia used a different gauge than western Europe,
-- I think.

1279
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:52,899
I think it was the

1280
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,790
Czech Republic,

1281
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,219
-- a
-- former colony might have like a well not colony but former satellite state.

1282
00:53:58,229 --> 00:53:58,600
Sorry,

1283
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:02,209
might have been in that situation where it's like, you know, it's worth it,

1284
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,219
spending the money to switch from, like, you know,

1285
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:06,840
being compatible with Russia to being compatible with Western Europe.

1286
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,290
It's like the US and the metric system. Right.

1287
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:09,959
Yeah.

1288
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:13,850
Yeah. I mean, a great, well, talking about building supplies, right.

1289
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,419
Like, if I want to buy a sheet of plywood it's a four by eight,

1290
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,199
-- you know, feet. If I buy lumber it's, it's imperial.
-- I was wondering that actually.

1291
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:26,860
-- So, so all the lumber in Canada is the terrible imperial
-- units.

1292
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:28,840
Yeah, because we export so much of it.

1293
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,330
Let's

1294
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:30,219
not talk

1295
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:30,639
about

1296
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:33,409
lumber disputes. Ok. That's, that's a bit of a,

1297
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,540
one of those touchy subjects for us, Canadians.

1298
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:37,479
We're a little bit,

1299
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,280
it's one of those things that we're a little bit

1300
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,100
annoyed about because it's been going on for 30 years.

1301
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:41,350
But

1302
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,510
fundamentally, yeah, I like

1303
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:44,620
um, plumbing supplies. Right.

1304
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:47,530
It's all the, you know, it's basically the same stuff as you guys use. Right.

1305
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,949
So it's half inch OD copper

1306
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:49,229
p,

1307
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,030
here's the thing and here's what we'll close on. Ok.

1308
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,459
Is, so the imperial system is the worst way to measure anything ever.

1309
00:54:57,479 --> 00:54:58,830
And we can all agree on that.

1310
00:54:58,969 --> 00:54:59,429
Ok.

1311
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,550
The metric system is vastly superior.

1312
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,669
But even if you're using the worst system in the world,

1313
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,770
as long as there are standards, it's OK and consistency, consistency. Right.

1314
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,389
Exactly. And, and that's really the lesson is

1315
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:17,399
it doesn't matter how bad your measurement system is.

1316
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:21,659
As long as it's consistent and standardized across your organization

1317
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:22,945
or industry,

1318
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,395
that is what matters,

1319
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:27,875
right? We just had this exact conversation in CV E world

1320
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:30,064
where somebody was like, why do you do it this way?

1321
00:55:30,074 --> 00:55:31,344
And we're like, well, it's not ideal,

1322
00:55:31,354 --> 00:55:33,754
but it's what we've done and we consistently keep doing it.

1323
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:37,715
So we at least have the same rule and every you, you essentially have

1324
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:43,439
-- of standard expected behavior and no surprises.
-- That is exactly correct.

1325
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:47,840
And I can think of no better way to end the podcast than on that point,

1326
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,379
which if you take nothing away from this, this lesson or if you made it this far,

1327
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,760
let it be that right.

1328
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:57,979

Kurt, you have a fantastic rest of your day.

1335
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:21,639
-- You too. And I guess, be safe with your fireworks. Folks.
-- I hate fireworks so much.

1336
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:22,979
They're so noisy and annoying.
