0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,179
What the way you're supposed to use?

1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,529
Narrow press is brew your coffee at about 80 degrees.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,310
Ok. That means I need the digital thermometer. I can't judge what 80 degrees is.

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:11,630
-- My kettle can be set to 80 degrees. Yeah,
-- I use a microwave.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,909
-- I'm going
-- to leave that into the cold open because anyone

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,100
from the UK who just heard you say that died inside.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,889
Oh, yeah, I know.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,459
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

8
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,809
Kurt Siefried who is essentially I'm a borderline

9
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:32,049
maniac when it comes to heating water for coffee

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,509
and my partner in the podcast who apparently heats water the proper way.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,610
Josh Pressers.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,020
I don't even know what to say to that like,

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:44,650
-- yeah, I know right.
-- The proper way.

14
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,509
But I'm too lazy to get a good kettle and I only want one cup of coffee.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,869
So I only need 100 and 50 mils of hot water.

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:53,509
Look, you are a Costco fanatic.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,549
I want you to go to Costco and buy the electric kettle that they sell there.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,750
It's quite affordable,

19
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:01,569
but this way is faster because microwaving hot water is

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,419
the objectively fastest way to get the hot water.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,650
I, anyway, we have two topics today.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,970
I'm just going to move us right along because, like,

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,910
I

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,370
don't know what to say.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,559
It's gonna be a bit of a rehash because we

26
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,599
just argued about this and Josh agreed with me.

27
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:20,750
It was, it was. But I don't want,

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,769
so it's a sovereign tech fund. We talked to

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,260
Piano crack

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,709
burger. Um, it's been, what, like, 456 episodes. maybe it's been a while.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,519
I don't remember how long

32
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:31,110
-- that
-- two

33
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,980
-- month break I took.
-- That's true. There was that, that feels anyway.

34
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:34,750
Yeah.

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,230
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,620
-- But things are better now.
-- She sent us a link literally hours ago.

37
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,239
I master it on saying, oh, hey, take a look at this idea. We have and I am

38
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,500
smitten with it.

39
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,480
Well, especially because that idea has funding.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,000
Like it's not just we had an idea.

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,910
No, it's, we had an idea and moved it through a process to actually get it funding.

42
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,449
Like this is not some random idea, not just funding like real funding,

43
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,959
funding that they're gonna give to people

44
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,290
-- that is like a whole other step of,
-- I just wanna,

45
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,760
I wanna cover this very briefly and, and once it

46
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,529
has more meat on the bones, we'll say in the future,

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,410
we'll talk about it more carefully and we can

48
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,110
probably just get Fiona to come talk to us,

49
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,789
which is better than us making crap up

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,880
once they actually have some experience in data. Yeah.

51
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:17,809
Right. Right.

52
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,289
Exactly.

53
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,250
Like

54
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,009
uh God bless the Germans.

55
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,570
So anyway, it,

56
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,690
it's called the contributing contribute back

57
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:25,149
challenge is what they're calling it.

58
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,380
I'll put a link in the show notes and

59
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,970
basically they've created these kind of three challenges.

60
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,389
The first one is improve uh developer, tooling,

61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,759
securing software production

62
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,820
and infrastructure documentation. And basically

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,860
they, they've got all the details and I'm not gonna read them because I,

64
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,919
I don't think they're particularly important to the

65
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,940
aspect of this Kurt and I were discussing.

66
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,720
But basically, if you look down way at the bottom,

67
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,279
they basically say that the minimum amount

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,020
you're going to get is €65,000 for, it's like a, I think a three or six month effort

69
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,130
-- and the max is 300 €1000.
-- That's for round one.

70
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,979
There's also round two with, again the same thing.

71
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,460
-- So this is like real money.
-- Well, that's just it.

72
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,130
And that's the thing I thought when I saw this is

73
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,160
when you look at a lot of these open source funding proposals,

74
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,839
it's like we will give you $75 to write the Linux kernel in rust.

75
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,679
-- And it's like, wait, what
-- like

76
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,669
or fix this bug or

77
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,990
like we would like a feature added where,

78
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,130
you know, we can just import data from any source and

79
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,490
there's $100 bug bounty on it.

80
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,839
If, if, if my company did this,

81
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,570
it would cost $7 million but we're offering $75 and a gift card and it's like, wait,

82
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,940
what

83
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,690
-- I
-- mean? Or better yet, we'll give you recognition

84
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,639
-- because you can totally pay your rent with recognition.
-- That's right.

85
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,369
Exposure is the most valuable currency of all.

86
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,889
How do you think I pay the mortgage here?

87
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,770
I use podcast recognition to pay my mortgage.

88
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,479
You don't, have you been paying your mortgage with money?

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,889
-- Well, that's just silly. I know
-- what's wrong with me, right.

90
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,910
But, but look, this is the way right?

91
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:06,369
If we want people to work on this stuff and to make measurable, good progress,

92
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,529
you have to let them live their lives.

93
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,809
It's kind of like I know the Maslow hierarchy of needs has been debunked many,

94
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,630
-- many times, but it's kind of the concept of um
-- well, but

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,140
kind of can't live without food and, and that's just it like,

96
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,489
I don't mean to be argumentative, but

97
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,670
you can debunk them as little hierarchy of needs all you want. But like

98
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,019
if I put you in a box with no water

99
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,529
for a week, that's not gonna end well

100
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,309
-- for
-- you.

101
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,140
I'm not going to be fixing very much open

102
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,540
and I'll have a box to get rid of this heavy

103
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,160
if anybody wants a mystery box.

104
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,369
But anyways, but

105
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,540
so here's what's fascinating to me is I personally think that they are

106
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,160
solving the wrong problems, but

107
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:55,089
this is the correct way to do it because this is where we are.

108
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,820
And what I mean by that is

109
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,339
they are essentially like improve fast developer tooling.

110
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,239
And in my mind, it's more,

111
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,399
I think we need to take a step back and maybe look at sort

112
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,600
of the workflows and actually like what does the tooling need to do?

113
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,119
Because we sort of have this implicit assumption that like right code, check code in

114
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,320
C I CD pipeline

115
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,339
code slash binary pops out the other end

116
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,390
and I guess at a high level that's reasonably correct because what else would we do?

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,750
The challenge is we've had so much

118
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,649
new technology and new understandings of how to better build software.

119
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,000
You know, like we've literally in the last 20 years gone from

120
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,070
object oriented programming being like, oh,

121
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,869
that's kind of weird and strange to like

122
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:40,084
Python and stuff is the default now for a lot of people.

123
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:43,644
No one does object oriented programming. Kurt, we program with objects.

124
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:46,625
It's a long complicated technical

125
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:47,885
differentiation.

126
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,964
The point I'm trying to make is we've gone well, like, OK, 30 years ago,

127
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,475
we were happy to write assembler.

128
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,375
Now, we have Rust and Python

129
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,885
and web frameworks and

130
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,045
services.

131
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,024
And so I,

132
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,869
what's interesting to me though is when you look at

133
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,899
the workflow of most software that hasn't changed at all,

134
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,410
like the Linux kernel is a great example.

135
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,019
-- It, they literally a bunch of mailing list with patches flying around.
-- I

136
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,420
agree with that statement at

137
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,299
all.

138
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,950
Well, and I'm not saying that this is necessarily wrong. I'm saying we don't know.

139
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,829
And what I'm trying to say is we've had 20 or 30 years of progress in the technology,

140
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,350
maybe we need to look at.

141
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,239
So for example, car manufacturing,

142
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,079
car manufacturing has changed enormously over the

143
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,149
last 2030 years because of new technologies,

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,369
right?

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,109
-- Robots, Kurt,
-- the way we build software has changed drastically,

146
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,130
-- this has been turned into a shaggy dog story at a high level
-- write code,

147
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,209
check code in code passes, smoke, test

148
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,929
code C I CD code binary goes out the other end.

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,089
And the one thing that has significantly changed is

150
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,690
instead of code now people are writing service.

151
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:42,929
But

152
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,399
if you let me put it this way,

153
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,190
if you showed a colonel developer from 30 years ago what they're doing today,

154
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,209
you'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.

155
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,799
-- That's what we do.
-- Maybe, maybe here's, here's how I want to address that very long

156
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,480
rambling rant. It doesn't matter

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,000
that there are fundamental underlying

158
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,399
problems that aren't technically being addressed

159
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,670
by this because I think we can't address them right now.

160
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,600
We can't.

161
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,630
And we also end up in this situation on a regular basis

162
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,190
where we say

163
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:15,290
that doesn't solve whatever problem we think there really is underneath.

164
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,890
And in the case of open source, open source is a million different things.

165
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,459
It's not one thing we love to say, it's one thing but it's not, it's a million things.

166
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,540
Probably more than a million.

167
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,950
But the point is

168
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,600
you have to do something and you have to start somewhere.

169
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,519
And I think that's my biggest, I,

170
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,290
I guess compliment I can give to the Sovereign Tech Fund

171
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:35,929
is they're doing work. They're not just talking about work.

172
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,149
They have real money to do real work and some of it

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,170
won't be correct and they're going to learn lessons as they go.

174
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,829
And that is the key.

175
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,089
Whereas I've seen many groups that will spend months or years talking about

176
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,320
what correct is and I'll make air quotes when I say correct.

177
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,649
And then they don't actually do anything at the end.

178
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:56,600
And then,

179
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,920
like, why did you just spend a year talking about this? And

180
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,230
then

181
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,170
-- I,
-- because it's easy to talk about stuff and have meetings,

182
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,799
-- it's hard to build stuff,
-- it's hard to take action.

183
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,440
And actually I'm gonna, I, I

184
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,339
need to correct you.

185
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:13,190
There's something subtle. You said that's very wrong.

186
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,519
You said they are doing the work. No, it's better than that.

187
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,279
They are letting, they are actually funding other people to do the work.

188
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,399
And that is even more valuable because you get that,

189
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,119
that diversity and that just like,

190
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,630
-- well to put it simply from, I don't
-- want, I don't wanna say that

191
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,399
I think they're funding other people to do a lot of cool work.

192
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,919
But the things the Sovereign Tech Fund had to do to get this to happen.

193
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:34,539
I,

194
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,000
-- I can only imagine the mountains that have been moved.
-- Oh, the paperwork alone.

195
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,979
I,

196
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,400
I know what it's like working with government.

197
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,460
And this is incredible to me that they not just had their first

198
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:48,909
round of funding but now they're doing more stuff and it's like,

199
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,719
holy cow.

200
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,320
This is

201
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,520
amazing.

202
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,729
Anyway, I don't, I don't wanna,

203
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:56,909
-- I don't wanna dwell on this one too much and I also don't want,
-- well, just a quick note,

204
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,159
the first application deadline is July 6th.

205
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,150
So if you're interested in this, get moving,

206
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:04,419
that's true because this, this I'll, I'll make sure this episode goes out.

207
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,109
Uh What July June

208
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,820
7th 18, something like that.

209
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:09,479
I

210
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,700
forget

211
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,530
what, I don't know, I don't know how to add

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,219
but

213
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,830
yes, you will have some time. So by all means like go look at this. It's amazing.

214
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,169
So we have one other thing we want to talk about that.

215
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,090
That was the actual topic we were going to

216
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,130
discuss today because it amuses me to no end.

217
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,099
And then the Sovereign Tech Fund snuck in so well done Sovereign Tech Fund.

218
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:27,750
But there is a story.

219
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,609
Kurt sent me from the BBC that was titled

220
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,440
Why Millions of usable hard drives are being destroyed.

221
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,950
And I saw the title

222
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,619
and II, I immediately knew what was going to be inside of this story

223
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,450
and it did not disappoint.

224
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,289
And then I told Kurt, I said, didn't we talk about this watch

225
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,520
and I can't, I can't find the, what did you do? Did you just snap?

226
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,590
-- I just destroyed an M two SSD.
-- No, you didn't,

227
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:53,849
you broke

228
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,780
it in half. You made it so your computer can't read it.

229
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,280
-- The data is still on those chips.
-- Well, not,

230
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,969
did you crack the chip in half or did you only crack the PC B?

231
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,750
-- The chip
-- is cracked. The chip is, here's the other one

232
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,559
because I just upgraded the drives in my computer and the other computer.

233
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,539
-- Did you wipe it before you cracked it in half?
-- That's encrypted.

234
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:14,849
There we go.

235
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,539
That's an important point. And we'll get to that in a little bit. So

236
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,909
this is the demo you warned me of with you packing in SSDI, I,

237
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,210
I'll go take a hammer to it later.

238
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,150
So, here's the thing. Why do people throw out

239
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,630
quote

240
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,950
unquote perfectly good storage media,

241
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,760
like M two drives or hard drives instead of like resell

242
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:33,104
them?

243
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:35,844
And, well, a couple of things, there's actually, uh,

244
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:40,015
we'll put in the show notes but L tt just bought an old, what was it called?

245
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,905
Store. Uh, I forget the vendor of the

246
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:42,525
San

247
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:43,065
Ar.

248
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:44,054
Yeah.

249
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:47,924
Anyways. And they're like, it's like a 57 terabyte array which is essentially

250
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,684
two modern hard drives. Well, three if you want some redundancy.

251
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:52,684
Um,

252
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:57,044
and so here's the problem, right? If you want to sell used storage.

253
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,299
Well, number one,

254
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,390
you have to wipe it and especially wiping hard drives takes forever.

255
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,669
Not, not just that you can't wipe S sds

256
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,630
and that's I, yeah, that, that was gonna be my second finger point.

257
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,030
Yeah, you can't reliably wipe an SSD because of trim and stuff.

258
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,239
The next thing I would point out

259
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:20,429
by definition when storage is so old that a company is actually getting rid of it.

260
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,359
It's basically e waste.

261
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,159
Like it's 600 gigabyte hard drives in 2023.

262
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:27,380
Right?

263
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,679
Like that

264
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,630
angle. Yes.

265
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,530
And there's also the angle of these M two drives.

266
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,219
Well, I'm getting rid of them because one is at 80% and the other one is at,

267
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,859
at 87% health like they're dying.

268
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,700
I don't want to give that to somebody.

269
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,179
Uh Sure,

270
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:42,900
you know,

271
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,520
like I'm not like what,

272
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm gonna sell a basically dying M two drive that will definitely K

273
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,739
out at some point in the near future for like 10 bucks.

274
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,229
And I'm gonna deal with kgg or Craigslist for 10 bucks.

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,219
No, I'm gonna smash it with a hammer and throw it in the garbage.

276
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:00,659
And then, and which kind of leads to my, one of my points is gonna be, is, for example,

277
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,700
uh, in most of North America and I think Western Europe probably too,

278
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,070
like you can't legally resell a car seat.

279
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:07,309
And

280
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:09,580
why is that?

281
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,150
Because helmets too

282
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,130
general

283
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:13,169
and stuff?

284
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:13,849
Yeah.

285
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,039
Uh,

286
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,200
why? Well, because it might have been in a crash and it might not be fit for purpose.

287
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:19,809
And you don't know, you can't.

288
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,080
Now with granted, with a hard drive and an M two drive,

289
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,450
like these M two drives very clearly.

290
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,969
Like I ran crystal disc and it was like, it's

291
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,969
80% health. And I'm like, 00, and the best part is on my son's machine.

292
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:29,849
The other machine,

293
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,219
it was at 87% health. I'm like, oh, that's not bad.

294
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,400
And then I tried to clone it to the new drive and

295
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:36,880
it failed and told me to run check disk and I'm like,

296
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,200
uh

297
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,799
NTFS needs check disk. I thought it was robust.

298
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,299
So I ran check disk rebooted. It took like almost an hour,

299
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,760
fixed a bunch of stuff, cloned it over

300
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,599
and like, I'm not,

301
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm not giving somebody this drive.

302
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,669
I don't care if you run it in a ray to ray with a ton of redundancy.

303
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,440
Like it's, it's a half terabyte.

304
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,979
It's clearly unreliable.

305
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,789
And like, what I'm gonna put like

306
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,549
half an hour of effort into selling something worth 10 bucks,

307
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,390
right?

308
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:04,859
This is a

309
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:05,140
lot.

310
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:05,719
That's,

311
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:06,710
that's

312
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:11,359
by definition when this stuff is old enough to be sold off. It's,

313
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:15,830
-- it's basically e waste it.
-- It probably is. Now, let's, let's back this up.

314
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,619
And, and the,

315
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,020
I guess fundamental underlying point of this story

316
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,099
was around risk

317
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,809
where you've got, for example, let's say you're uh a data center,

318
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,659
you've got a ton of hard drives

319
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,099
and when it's time to yank the drives and replace them,

320
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,489
it's less about

321
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,260
kind of e waste or recycling things or, or whatever.

322
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,710
And it's really about you have customers who put data on those drives

323
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,710
and

324
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,390
generally speaking, as part of the,

325
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,905
like a sock two audit or, or any sort of compliance effort,

326
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,594
there's going to be data destruction requirements

327
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,645
and the easiest way to meet those requirements with something like a hard

328
00:13:56,655 --> 00:14:00,025
drive is to just say we shred the drive when they're done.

329
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,965
Like we, when I say shred, I mean, literally like crushing the drives into dust,

330
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:08,684
well, not dust, like we'll say sharp pieces that you wouldn't want to eat.

331
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,684
And then of course, everybody's like, oh, but the data didn't.

332
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,955
So you could actually pull data off of it now. And it's like, yeah,

333
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:13,604
you could

334
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:13,984
know what

335
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:14,304
going

336
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:14,695
to that

337
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,205
point.

338
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,869
There's people who say things like, oh, you need to wipe a hard drive three times

339
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:20,710
or

340
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,190
you know, you, if you crush the platter, you could still get to off it.

341
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,659
I spent an enormous amount of time. Quit breaking that thing. Like put that down.

342
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,710
I feel like you're a child,

343
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,989
but Kurt's playing with the, the M two drive. Have you met me?

344
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,429
You're going to get like lead poisoning or something from that thing,

345
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,229
like quit playing with it.

346
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,150
-- No,
-- these are lead free now.

347
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,830
-- The solder they got the little,
-- there's, isn't there Arsenic and chips, whatever.

348
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,400
-- Anyway. Well,
-- I'm not licking it.

349
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,099
You're gonna touch your, your, I'm gonna, no. Anyway,

350
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,270
after the show,

351
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,169
we're like Children here.

352
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,640
But so, so I spent a ton of time looking for examples of like,

353
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,979
like academic papers saying like we took a hard drive, we

354
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,750
did a thing to it and then we extracted data off of

355
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,789
it using an electron microscope or whatever people are saying about.

356
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,510
I could find literally nothing. So I have a strong suspicion, you probably can't.

357
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,309
Well, and more to the point, it wouldn't matter because

358
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,900
everybody does

359
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:21,270
data encryption at rest,

360
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:22,309
like in

361
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:23,260
the

362
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,049
like

363
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:25,099
should be.

364
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,940
Well, do you think Amazon is not just encrypting all the discs anyway,

365
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,500
anybody competent is doing encryption at rest full stop at the OS base level

366
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:36,539
because,

367
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,859
well, it's just

368
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,679
the alternative is you don't.

369
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,900
And then if a hard drive ever does go missing or

370
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:45,299
doesn't get shredded or somehow goes walk about or oh,

371
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,539
remember that case where they,

372
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,630
they found the missing hard drive by a photocopier

373
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,809
at like uh Lawrence Livermore laboratories or something.

374
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,570
Remember they had that picture Kerle?

375
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:54,000
Well, here's the thing when that hard drive goes missing.

376
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,799
And I can say with 100% certainty it was encrypted at rest.

377
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,539
Everyone was like, oh, yeah, OK. Then

378
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,700
versus if I can't say it's encrypted there, now we have a problem.

379
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,260
Well, and look, this is a defense in depth measure where you're saying

380
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,659
they're encrypted

381
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,039
and they're crushed.

382
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,219
So if someone says, can you prove they were all crushed and you say,

383
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:16,700
I can't prove this truckload was all crushed with the beyond certainty or whatever.

384
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,090
But you can say, but

385
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:21,909
all of the hard drives were encrypted and the keys live

386
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,049
in this HSM over here and the keys were wiped.

387
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,250
So there's no keys anyone can get.

388
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,609
So even if they have the drive, there's nothing they can do.

389
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:33,090
And so this again comes back to the, why don't you just wipe it?

390
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,859
Why don't you just resell it like they're encrypted. Why do we care?

391
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,289
And it's because

392
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,479
there's inevitably going to be errors where something doesn't get crushed where

393
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,340
something doesn't get encrypted right where

394
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,280
there's something in the process fails.

395
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,830
And when you are a company like Amazon,

396
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:54,530
a one in a billion failure rate is going to be unacceptable to your Giants customers.

397
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,359
It's like every Tuesday. Well, and here's the other problem,

398
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,880
old hard drives,

399
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:03,169
use a lot of electricity. This isn't a car, this isn't something that is so

400
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,930
energy intensive to build,

401
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,959
but it is in almost every sense,

402
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,739
cheaper to run the car until it dies and then get a new one versus replacing it

403
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,509
old hard drives by and large,

404
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,298
especially in data centers because you don't just have to feed electricity,

405
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,458
you now have to feed electricity to a cooling system.

406
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:20,479
So it doesn't melt.

407
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,868
So basically for every watt in

408
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,138
you're gonna have to spend at least half a watt getting the heat out.

409
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,048
Probably.

410
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,029
Right. Plus it sits in a system.

411
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,900
So, but basically for like enterprise drives,

412
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,520
like these 15 K drives from about a decade ago, they average about 8 to 10 watts

413
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,780
power used. That's a lot compared to modern M two stuff, for example.

414
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,530
Well, and, and not just that, like, there's still hard drive,

415
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,939
like spinning disks in use today,

416
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:50,300
but I'm sure if you take the watt per gigabyte or whatever their rating is

417
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,060
that

418
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,420
it's one of those situations where

419
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,949
like keeping this old gear in service,

420
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,189
it's almost certainly worse for the environment than just buying new gear.

421
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,500
And it feels wrong to say that. But I have a strong suspicion. It's true.

422
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,270
-- No,
-- it's not a strong suspicion. It's so L tt spent $1000 on that

423
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,229
giant

424
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,410
San Array myth and it had 57 terabytes of data

425
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,310
storage. Basically

426
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:15,949
that is two

427
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,150
modern enterprise S

428
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,199
sds.

429
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,199
And so you'd want to buy a third one to raid five that sucker.

430
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,130
Sure.

431
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,390
The amount of electricity,

432
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,689
those three drives in a small server will use compared

433
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,579
to that half of a rack worth of gear.

434
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:31,939
-- That
-- thing's got to be like thousands of watts.

435
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,140
So it's gonna,

436
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,760
the RO I on replacing it just on electricity usage and cooling alone,

437
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,699
it'll pay for itself in

438
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,060
like a month or two.

439
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,140
And

440
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,890
uh so for example, the, the M two, drives.

441
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,219
I just, I got some western digital black ones for the computer.

442
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,319
They're rated at 1.2 million read

443
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,900
ops and 1.2 million. Right. Iops. No, that's it. Like they're, they're both over,

444
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:55,310
um,

445
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,719
they're over a million. Iops.

446
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,300
And what is a, what is an enterprise, hard drive from 10 years ago? Iops.

447
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,050
Well, in the hundreds to thousands

448
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,920
is it? I don't, I don't even know.

449
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,079
I have no idea.

450
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:08,859
-- So
-- the point is basically

451
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,329
there, there's just, there's no ex there's like,

452
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:16,199
literally you're gonna get pennies on the dollar for selling it.

453
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,369
Ok. Cost recovery, whatever pennies on the dollar.

454
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
But more to the point,

455
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,920
anybody buying it is insane. I mean,

456
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:27,880
well, it's probably security researchers looking for data. They can expunge.

457
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,520
Oh, here we go. A SAS 15 K drive.

458
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,729
Iops four kilobytes

459
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,439
block random, 100 and 88 to 203 typical

460
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,180
-- 50 to 60 megabytes per second data transfer.
-- What,

461
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,160
-- what kind of crap is this? This is. How old is that? This
-- is 10 years old.

462
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:44,560
Ok.

463
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,819
I'll buy that.

464
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,099
And that's what we're talking about, right.

465
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,020
We're not talking about modern,

466
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,569
like we're not selling off modern gear at pennies on the dollar.

467
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,209
We're selling off

468
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,949
-- 10 year old gear on pennies on the dollar.
-- All right. All right.

469
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm tired of talking this soccer, but

470
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,050
I want to ask the question of you of why can't I

471
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,515
successfully erase

472
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:05,234
a SSD drive because I don't think this is always understood.

473
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,555
Oh God. Well, basically this goes back to the health of the drives.

474
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:11,755
Why is the drive saying 80% health? What does that mean?

475
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:14,234
I know this, I actually just watched a video about this.

476
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:17,214
So you and I were talking about it and unexpectedly,

477
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:19,935
a video about this appeared in my youtube feed, who know how

478
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:22,114
they're listening. So basically

479
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:25,744
the majority of flash drive technologies,

480
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,339
the cells wear out. It's just that simple.

481
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:31,089
Now, there are some technologies that don't wear out and they are

482
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,079
horrifically expensive,

483
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,400
but that's for an enterprise user and that's their problem, not ours.

484
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,880
And when I say wear out like both of these M two drives were

485
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,280
running in my son's system and my system for over three years nonstop.

486
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,540
And actually my system

487
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:49,069
has heavy IO workload because I do a lot of get stuff and a lot of multimedia.

488
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,939
And anyways, the point is I used the

489
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,589
snot out of this thing for over three years and it got down to 80 80% health.

490
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,900
And what that means is essentially

491
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:58,689
a

492
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,560
good chunk of the cells have literally just worn out and stopped working now.

493
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:04,040
-- No,
-- not a good chunk. OK.

494
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,489
-- OK.
-- Well, not a good chunk. But yeah.

495
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,099
So part of the beauty is

496
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:11,010
they anticipated this when they ship me my drive.

497
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,020
So my one terabyte drive

498
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,410
is actually a little bit more than one terabyte it's got basically a

499
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,969
tire of cells.

500
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,260
And so they,

501
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,900
it's,

502
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,530
well, uh, basically when a cell wears out and dies and stops responding,

503
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
they're like, yeah, that's normal.

504
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,589
That's ok. Go get a fresh one from the back.

505
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:28,530
Uh,

506
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,750
ok. Well, it's even more, it, it's even weirder than that.

507
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:36,500
Ok. So let's start at, at, let's start at, at, at magnetic media right

508
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,819
back in the day when Kurt and I were, but we lads

509
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,910
they

510
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,660
everything was magnetic media, right?

511
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,439
You had floppy disk,

512
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:48,109
you have hard drives and it's literally a spinning thing like a circle

513
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,569
-- like a record for anyone who knows. Oh,
-- well, actually my trash 80 had a set, right?

514
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,290
But sure, let's get all fancy with these hard

515
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,660
-- drives.
-- That's

516
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:58,810
true. You have tapes anyway, let's, let's just talk about round things, right?

517
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,890
Like for vinyls. Cool. So I can talk about records, right?

518
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,949
You got a big round thing spins around

519
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:05,770
and you have a magnetic head

520
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:06,219
that

521
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,010
reads

522
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:14,530
FM sound off of this media literally and then converts it into digital data, right?

523
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:14,949
Yeah.

524
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,390
And so what happens is,

525
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:19,650
you know where the head is? You can control what it's doing. And now

526
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:23,290
there would be times that a part of the disc would go bad, right?

527
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,089
And then the sector is marked bad,

528
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:27,280
-- a bad
-- block or sector, sorry sector.

529
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,849
-- Right. Right. Well, and there's blocks as
-- well.

530
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:32,060
-- Blocks or file system sectors are
-- no, there's,

531
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:33,949
there's bad blocks like that's the thing too.

532
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,089
There's sectors, like there

533
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,050
are parts of sectors I think, I don't remember.

534
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,410
It's, it's, it doesn't matter who cares. And so

535
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,010
-- now Kurt's going
-- to win. This is why we just

536
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,800
-- everything at rest now
-- basically.

537
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,510
-- But anyway,
-- oh, blocks are part of a sector.

538
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,130
OK? Sectors are made up of blocks. OK?

539
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,949
That, that sounds right.

540
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,060
And then a cluster is a bunch of blocks.

541
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,160
Sorry. A sector is like a pie shaped piece.

542
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:59,969
So a sector is like the pie shaped piece. The block is the actual like bit of the pie.

543
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:04,050
A cylinder is the circle. So like where the cylinder and sector intersect.

544
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,040
That's a block.

545
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,739
OK. Anyway, all right. I don't want to dwell on this. It doesn't matter.

546
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,430
It's not important. Anyway, so you,

547
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:13,770
you've got magnetic media, portions of magnet, magnetic media can go bad.

548
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,869
They're marked bad by file systems and other things underneath

549
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,300
and then you just don't use them, right? No big deal.

550
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,900
Then when it comes,

551
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:23,329
it's time to wipe the drive because you want to clean out all the data.

552
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:27,209
You can basically just say all right head, I want you to start on the edge

553
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,400
and I don't care what happens. Just like write zeros,

554
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,069
don't ask questions,

555
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,010
write zeros. Now, I want you to write the number seven over. You know what I mean?

556
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,540
And you could just totally control the head much like you

557
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,449
could control like a a record player's arm and needle and,

558
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,979
and stuff or like, put it wherever you want and make it do stuff.

559
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,300
Right. No big deal. So, wiping hard drives was really easy to do.

560
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,089
But then

561
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,459
flash media came about

562
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,099
and flash is special because it doesn't have to, like, read sequentially.

563
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,189
You don't know exactly what's going on. And so they built

564
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,160
these S sds

565
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,430
to hide all of the complexity of what's happening on the flash layer from us.

566
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:09,979
-- So we think it's a hard drive, but it's magic storage underneath.
-- Right?

567
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,199
Well, it's even more subtle than that is

568
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:13,123
20 years ago.

569
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:16,243
We didn't have massively powerful controller chips,

570
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:18,003
your hard drive and floppy drive.

571
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:19,292
Like, well, if you go back 30 years,

572
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:23,932
floppy drives were basically dumb and like the CPU literally had to drive

573
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:27,042
the arm back and forth and like you could overdrive it and break it

574
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:27,772
with.

575
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:29,052
And obviously over 20 years,

576
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,922
we've had a little bit of advancement in chip manufacturing and,

577
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,483
you know, design

578
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:35,036
drive is a computer now.

579
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,395
Well, and, and that's, and that's exactly it. So it's now cheaper,

580
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:39,156
you know,

581
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,095
to just

582
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,276
make a thing that has its own little computer in it so that it,

583
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:47,375
it basically presents an interface that says like you want data from X, here you go.

584
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,156
And it takes care of everything in the background.

585
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,975
And that's the other aspect of what happened is, is essentially a,

586
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:55,355
a very thick layer of abstraction was added

587
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,310
that you cannot penetrate. And that's

588
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,109
-- why you can't wipe a drive.
-- Well, you can,

589
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,859
you can, you can penetrate it, but it's really hard to do.

590
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,630
But, and that's the point when Kurt was saying there's like the,

591
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:10,229
his one terabyte drive is probably actually 1.2 terabytes.

592
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,150
And when it says it's 80% degraded, it means 80% of the unused 0.2 terabytes

593
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:17,229
has been

594
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,430
used

595
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,229
because he's burning out cells. Now.

596
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:24,520
It, it also you have to remember you, you don't, they don't just swap out the,

597
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,439
the magic extra cells.

598
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:28,699
You can move data all around. You can say like,

599
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,479
well and that's trim right to

600
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,699
do. Wear leveling.

601
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah, exactly because you can, you don't want to write to one specific spot.

602
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,010
And so they try to spread all this out to

603
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,770
maximize the amount of time this stuff can be used

604
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,199
with potholes

605
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:41,739
with heavy

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,489
traffic.

607
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:44,520
-- You did
-- get it

608
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:44,839
in. Oh

609
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:45,010
I,

610
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:45,939
I'll

611
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,189
let that one go.

612
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:47,939
But it's

613
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:48,150
true

614
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,489
-- like the wear leveling vastly increases the life of the drive because of
-- that.

615
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,890
If we say try to shred it and

616
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:58,734
SSD, we'll say all right, drive start at sector zero.

617
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:02,734
And I want you to write all zeros. It's gonna be like, wow, we sure are writing a lot.

618
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:04,275
Let's start moving this around.

619
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:08,814
And so you might think you might end up writing zeros to like basically

620
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:11,775
the same place on desk over and over again because it's probably like,

621
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:12,604
oh, more zeros.

622
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,724
I've got some zeros over here we could just reuse

623
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:15,974
and so

624
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,900
you can't wipe this stuff. And so if someone can, like,

625
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,989
take the magic software

626
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:22,949
and say,

627
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,650
like, SSD, I want you to show me what's actually written and,

628
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,410
and here's the craziest part.

629
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,410
You just physically extract the chip. Put it in a thing of a jigger. That's true.

630
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,930
I, there's videos of people doing that. It's, it's amazing.

631
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,890
-- Yeah.
-- And they're, I'm not gonna say they're, they're not cheap

632
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,010
-- but they're not expensive anymore.
-- It's pretty cheap to do this.

633
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,390
You

634
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,619
and I,

635
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,739
if we wanted to,

636
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,989
it's like without taking out a second loan,

637
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:45,949
-- it's
-- not,

638
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,219
it doesn't cost as much as a house. Right.

639
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:48,739
It's there,

640
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,180
there are probably hundreds to thousands of

641
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,579
dollars depending upon what you're doing.

642
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:52,979
But yes, very, very affordable.

643
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:55,939
You know, here's, here's the trickiest part though. So

644
00:26:56,229 --> 00:27:00,380
when you have a, whatever they call the, I forget what they call.

645
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,579
The, the little grouping of bits on the SSD.

646
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,540
Is it a cluster?

647
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,420
It has a weird name. I forget it off the top of my head.

648
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,800
But what happens is like when it goes bad, it gets marked as read only

649
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,810
because you just can't write to it.

650
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,890
And so you can't,

651
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,469
you can't get rid of the data,

652
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:21,089
there's gonna be data on there and I'm sure there's some bizarre super low

653
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,569
level command. You could issue the controller that's like mess this up.

654
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:25,819
But fundamentally,

655
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:27,250
you've got data written

656
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,449
and that data is still there, right? Like hidden in these read only blocks.

657
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,920
The thing is my understanding is that the cells can

658
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,479
also wear out in a way where they are physically incapable

659
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:40,750
of being written to

660
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,430
like so it's there's no amount of low

661
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,319
level commands that are going to let you overcome the physics of the

662
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,609
properties of the material

663
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,640
being like, sorry, I can't do that.

664
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,969
And I,

665
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,250
I just keep coming back to the point of by the time

666
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,770
like this is a half terabyte drive that's basically wearing out.

667
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,609
It's not reliable. It's also slow.

668
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:00,780
Like, holy cow,

669
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,050
I swapped out because basically I bought like a one Terabyte Kingston,

670
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,430
like the cheapest kind of one terabyte drive I could buy four years ago

671
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:08,369
because I was like,

672
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,770
I'm gonna upgrade this right away and then

673
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,140
COVID hit and all the prices went bazonkers

674
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,739
and now they're back and now they

675
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:15,704
are really

676
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:16,145
cheap right

677
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:20,474
now. Like my computer boots in about half the time it used to. It is just

678
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:20,655
my

679
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,994
ops on this Western digital drive. Are that?

680
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:25,474
Oh, my favorite part was when I was cloning the drives,

681
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:29,224
the drives were reading at like 98% of their capacity.

682
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:30,834
So they were just going flat out

683
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:34,525
and it was writing to the Western digital drives at between five and 7%.

684
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:37,895
Yes, I, I had the same experience because I went from like an,

685
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:39,805
an SSD with, uh,

686
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,324
was it, uh, uh,

687
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,280
what is the, the drive cable? That's the

688
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:44,869
SAS

689
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:46,050
SA A

690
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:47,650
to PC invme?

691
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:48,880
Yeah.

692
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,609
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I did and I saw the same thing.

693
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,760
Oh, fun fact.

694
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,239
Um, I was, this also needs to be destroyed.

695
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,680
Um, yeah, good luck with that.

696
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm gonna open up the case and

697
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:01,189
no one knows what this is. It's a,

698
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:04,180
it's a one terabyte, Western digital blue Sata SD.

699
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,280
And it's horrifically slow by modern standards.

700
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,959
Well, it's faster in a spinning disk,

701
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,109
which, I mean, and hard drives are faster than clay tablets.

702
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:16,550
-- Right.
-- Right. No, I know. I know.

703
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:20,229
I just, as much as I would love for there to, like, not be e waste.

704
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,130
I, I would also love for their, like,

705
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,369
like locally we have as part of our recycle program.

706
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,300
We have composting.

707
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,040
So, like, you have a,

708
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,170
you have a big green bin that you put all your yard clippings and food waste in and they

709
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,060
have a giant facility where they compost it. Which fun fact,

710
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:35,089
they built the roof wrong. They didn't account for the amount of humidity.

711
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:35,660
So it, like,

712
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,410
rotted out and almost broke. And I'm like,

713
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,670
the, my first thought of a composting facility is like, wow,

714
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,890
that's gonna be humid in there.

715
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,099
I, I

716
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:44,500
mean,

717
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,140
I can forgive that. I would not think of the humidity right away,

718
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,569
-- but
-- this is a $50 million facility,

719
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,130
I would think for $50 million someone would have asked that question,

720
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,939
especially in our environment with winter

721
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:58,760
anyway.

722
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,250
But the point is like, yes,

723
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,040
I would love to live in a world with basically as little to no food waste as possible,

724
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,900
as little to no e waste as possible.

725
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,300
But the, the thing is like

726
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,270
the,

727
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,819
the amount of time and effort somebody will spend driving

728
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:14,569
to my house to pick up a half terabyte SSD

729
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,699
is going to do more environmental damage than like reusing this thing.

730
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,459
Stop and like 10 year old hard drives just no, like they're, they're too slow,

731
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,010
they use too much electricity

732
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,260
and you can replace them with like two or three M two drives

733
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:33,280
that will be literally on the order of 100 to 1000 times more performant

734
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,569
use literally 100 to 1000 times less electricity.

735
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:39,599
Yeah,

736
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:43,770
I it's offensive and I hate to throw this stuff out that works like it works.

737
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:46,459
But yeah, I'm sorry. No, it's time to let go.

738
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,739
I mean, that's fair.

739
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,609
And so I think there's definitely the risk angle here and

740
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,859
then there's also just like the environmental impact and I think that's

741
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:57,260
-- just economically, it's not viable.
-- That's kind of the takeaway

742
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:01,540
is, is, it's not, it really isn't millions of usable hard drives.

743
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,380
It's

744
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:03,130
a lot of,

745
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,209
-- it's
-- millions,

746
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,010
it's millions of instances of like, I have 100 hard drives.

747
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,109
Like if it was a million hard drives that were all the exact same size and model. Yeah.

748
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,790
Chuck them in a

749
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:12,180
ra,

750
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,540
well, no, don't because they still, like, maybe, maybe chuck them in a radar

751
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:18,760
and use it to heat a pool. But no, don't do that.

752
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,780
But literally, that's the other thing is it's not a million homogenous,

753
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,989
working hard drives.

754
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,540
It's a million hard drives of, like,

755
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:29,819
-- well, some of these are about to die. We don't know which ones though.
-- That's right.

756
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:30,310
That's right.

757
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,790
And I can't wait for someone in the UK to pass

758
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,160
a law saying you can't throw away hard drives or something.

759
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,969
And then you'll just have warehouses and warehouses full of old hard drives.

760
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:39,819
No one can use

761
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,109
-- apart as maybe heaters. No, I guess you could use them
-- as

762
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,290
they're not use

763
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,089
for anything.

764
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:49,449
Nothing don't use old hard drives. Like, just, no, no, no, no, you can't do it.

765
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,489
-- I think I'll, I'll give you the last word on this one.
-- Kurt.

766
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,660
I would love to see a lot of people apply to that Sovereign tech Fund program

767
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,300
and I get that, it's kind of a big lift for a lot. Like it is a, it's

768
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,349
the, they're not doing small amounts of money, which was one complaint I saw online,

769
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,989
but the reality is kind of like the hard drives. They can't do 1000 projects.

770
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,209
That's right. That's right.

771
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,489
And maybe that's part of the thing to learn here. Is

772
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,060
we live in a very heterogeneous world and it's messy

773
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,599
and there are

774
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,150
no good overall solutions

775
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,560
-- for many problems. It's, it's complicated but we're
-- gonna learn.

776
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,869
It's ok. It's ok. It's not perfect. That, that's how I'm gonna end

777
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:28,589
it all.

778
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,359
