Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,159
Kurt Siefried and my partner in wondering

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,329
why we even bother with certificate authorities.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,979
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,569
-- I don't
-- wonder why I know why we bother with them because

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,760
the foundation of modern society is built upon our certificate authorities.

6
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,459
-- I know. Right.
-- Yes. It's a very shaky, disastrous

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,360
foundation. Yeah. And I love that.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,059
It literally every connection now is

9
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,796
-- what matters is TLS are encrypted.
-- Basically,

10
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,916
I have a fun fact for you. Actually,

11
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,316
we're recording this right after like B sides and

12
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:42,116
black hat and Defcon happened in Las Vegas.

13
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,855
It's the week after

14
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,546
and I was there and I went to an event and there was a guy from let

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,515
encrypt. I honestly can't even remember his name.

16
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:53,116
So I apologize if you listen and I've forgotten your name, send me an email.

17
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,276
He said now let

18
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:54,416
and

19
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:55,472
is

20
00:00:55,692 --> 00:01:01,352
delivering literally billions of certificates per day per day.

21
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,552
I'm like, oh my goodness, it's, I have a suspicion.

22
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,141
It's all of the other certificate authorities

23
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,351
added together and multiplied by a large number and

24
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,861
it's still more certificates and like that's a mind

25
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:13,832
boggling number

26
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,431
and and that actually leads to you were mentioning earlier,

27
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,071
like about certificate pinning and why nobody uses it anymore.

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,330
Like, OK,

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,330
so let, let's,

30
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:25,629
let's backtrack a bit and do some foundational C A stuff because I was talking,

31
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:26,389
you know, a lot of people.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,129
OK. Number one certificates do not essentially prove who you're talking to.

33
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,169
It proves you're talking to food.com.

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,730
Not that you're actually talking to Food Corporation.

35
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,519
So, like you're talking to td.com

36
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,830
now, whether or not that's TD Bank, I don't

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,050
know.

38
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,339
Right. Right. Might be, might not be.

39
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,190
And, and in this case,

40
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:50,120
td.com is actually TD Bank until they forget to pay the registration, I guess.

41
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,250
Well, no, it happens. Right.

42
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,449
So that's the first thing. It's like there are, you know, and,

43
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,750
and this leads to a big thing. There's,

44
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:01,449
I was looking at this. So historically, there was,

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,809
the security people have focused on

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,739
Attackers are going to try and hijack

47
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,119
certificates. So you have to protect them.

48
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,919
You have to have a private key and a hardware security module.

49
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,639
It has to be double triple encrypted with a very ravenous dog tied to it

50
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:19,320
and no attacker cares or oh, certificate authorities are gonna, you know, they'll,

51
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,940
they'll get

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,149
a,

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,320
a

54
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,580
air quotes fake certificate, like it's a real certificate,

55
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:23,779
it's just not assigned to who it should

56
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,710
be and they're gonna fake out the certificate,

57
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,089
authority provider and like,

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,860
you know,

59
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,667
intercept traffic and like, do the response and blah, blah, blah.

60
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,347
And so like we have things like where, you know,

61
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:35,406
the C A request it from multiple locations to, you know,

62
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,026
make sure they're not being spoofed or anything.

63
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,317
And again, Attackers don't do that

64
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,466
because what they do do is they register Walmart

65
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:44,826
with the number one instead of the l.com.

66
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,067
That is exactly what happens in most cases. Yes.

67
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:48,667
Yeah.

68
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:53,847
And then number three state level actors, well, they own AC A so they don't give a crap

69
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,194
of them do. Yes.

70
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,003
Like

71
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,994
-- it's just that simple.
-- This is the attack

72
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:00,473
that I think

73
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,113
a lot of people think about now is

74
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,404
there are a bunch of cas

75
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,634
with questionable owners.

76
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:07,794
I mean,

77
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,214
we did a whole podcast episode when like Kazakhstan

78
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,824
was going to make browsers add their root certificate,

79
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,274
right?

80
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,033
And that happens independent of whether or not they have AC A, well,

81
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:19,123
they have AC A and whether or not that C A is in

82
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:22,121
the route and obviously it's not because they're forcing people to add it.

83
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,380
Right. You know.

84
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,800
So, yeah, when the nice men with guns show up and tell you to do something, you

85
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,561
-- should maybe do it.
-- It's the XK CD cartoon with the Wrench, right?

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,610
Like it's literally that, I mean, yeah,

87
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,481
if a guy shows up with a gun and tells me to do something, it's going to get done,

88
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:39,360
that's how it works.

89
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,401
And so, and then there's ok and let's also cover,

90
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,641
there's a couple of sort of supporting tech friends here.

91
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,391
So there's, there's DNS sec

92
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,919
and DNS security basically means that I make a DNS request to seafood.org

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,979
dot org replies it's signed and it can be altered

94
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,279
in transit.

95
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,309
But also one very important thing is an attacker can't spoof

96
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,399
a reply so they can't block my reply and create one,

97
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,740
like

98
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,490
see your.org points at 1.2 0.3 0.4 or whatever, right?

99
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:07,830
And DNS EC

100
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,429
is actually very important for certificate authority security. In that

101
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:17,279
the vast majority of certificate validation is now done through uh DNS checks.

102
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,880
But going back to it is,

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,886
but Attackers are not manage in the middle and certificate authorities,

104
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:25,147
they're not, you know, they're not hijacking you.

105
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,316
So honestly, if you don't have DNS C

106
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:27,946
in stat,

107
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:28,717
that's fine.

108
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,437
And then the other one is HSTS http strict transport security,

109
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:36,916
which mattered about 10 years ago because basically you could say only talk to me via

110
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:42,726
-- HTTP S except no unencrypted and
-- don't most web browsers just default to http S now

111
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:46,717
they pretty much all do because a few summers ago, Google changed their seo

112
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,463
prefer http S.

113
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,614
So all the websites finally like,

114
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,003
like I keep saying I have a spreadsheet and it used to have a column.

115
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,813
Does this cloud vendor support http S

116
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,313
like

117
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,394
which is hilarious to think about now?

118
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:02,653
-- Like
-- I finally deleted that column because I'm like, yeah, I know this.

119
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:03,493
Like if they don't.

120
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,634
-- Then obviously I'll notice because
-- create a column for when they don't.

121
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,894
-- Well, more to the point my web browser won't let me go there.
-- That's true.

122
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:11,503
Like

123
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,770
I just set up a new local server and I had to

124
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,411
go to the IP address and it doesn't have a certificate.

125
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,020
And of course, my web browser is like, I don't think you should do this.

126
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,631
I'm like, yes do it. And it's like, no, I really don't think you should do it.

127
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,941
You're gonna have to click on advanced security.

128
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
I click on advanced security and then it's like, I really,

129
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,210
really don't think you should do this.

130
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm like, just, yeah, it's, it's a pain in the butt.

131
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,930
Just show me the local IP address, web page, please. For the love of God.

132
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,311
So I can configure the server.

133
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,751
So HSTS used to matter

134
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,191
and now it doesn't

135
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,040
-- really.
-- Yeah, I agree.

136
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,700
And then the one you mentioned, certificate pinning,

137
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,679
certificate pinning was a perfect example

138
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,579
of some of the worst engineering security

139
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,950
mindsets ever because what certificate pink did?

140
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,820
And this is the stupidest thing that you could ever do

141
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,799
is you're basically saying we have a certificate with like this serial number

142
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,040
and we're going to have a DNS record that pins it

143
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,079
and if it's not that certificate with that serial number,

144
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,859
then it's not us.

145
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes.

146
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:03,709
Ok.

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,739
So like now you need to roll

148
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,260
over certificates suddenly because something happened.

149
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,570
No one knows how to do that.

150
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,940
-- Well,
-- and, and if you roll over the certificate and then the DNS cache

151
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,850
is everything still broken for five minutes or a week or whatever.

152
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,359
That's

153
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,649
right. It's just certificate pinning. Made life.

154
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,929
It, it, it basically made life so hard.

155
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,230
It's like that old security diagram, you know,

156
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,519
where you got that little gate in the middle of a

157
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,579
field with the tire tracks going around it in a semi

158
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,989
circle. That's exactly what certificate pinning

159
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,630
did.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,179
Feels like a good idea in theory, but in practice, it was not a good idea.

161
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,720
It's a good idea. In theory.

162
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,500
-- If you've never operationally run a web server,
-- that's fair. Yes.

163
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,260
-- Which uh most security people haven't or
-- they haven't done it at scale.

164
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,850
And there's a big difference, you know,

165
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:47,760
I ran into this a lot at Red Hat where developers would be like, hey,

166
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:48,619
it works on my laptop.

167
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,040
It's fine and I'm like, that's great.

168
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:54,609
Now, what happened with 100,000 clients connecting to it and it needs to work 24 7.

169
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,269
Or else people get yelled at, oh, side note.

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,250
Speaking of which revenue,

171
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,790
Canada is having a scheduled web server outage this weekend

172
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,989
from like Friday close of business till Monday morning.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,609
And I'm like, ok, so they're like 99% reliable now because they're taking 2.5 days.

174
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,640
I mean, 99% reliability is what, like 3.5 days per year. Yeah.

175
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,709
-- So they're taking two,
-- they got plenty of offer.

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,859
Well, that, but that's the thing.

177
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:20,350
Like, I've, like, it's the tax people. So, like,

178
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,109
they can, they can turn their server off for 2.5 days and, well,

179
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,049
you just have to wait till Monday because you still have to pay those bills.

180
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,279
Go to their competitor,

181
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,730
switch, switch tax agencies. Good luck.

182
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,290
-- No, I need to go. Set up an Irish entity.
-- There you go.

183
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,070
Because it's funny because companies do go

184
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,820
to their competitors which are like Ireland

185
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,864
-- and Holland and like all these weird Bahamian islands
-- companies can do that.

186
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,394
-- Us peons cannot.
-- No, no.

187
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:45,165
But so,

188
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,804
so certificate pinning was just literally the worst idea possible

189
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,744
so much so that like it's nobody does it.

190
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:54,545
Now there's one thing that is kind of sort of useful and that is certificate,

191
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,234
authority, authorization records

192
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:59,785
and what CAA records are is very simply put in your DNS. You say

193
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:03,734
the following certificate, authorities can issue certificates from my domain.

194
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,184
And so in my case, it's like in trust digit

195
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:07,494
and like

196
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,510
I want to say, maybe commodo or something,

197
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:10,179
basically,

198
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,670
it's whoever lets them crypt uses and like Amazon

199
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,149
and a couple of others in the group right

200
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,850
now, that is kind of useful because then

201
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,690
now if somebody goes to Turkey,

202
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,239
what see

203
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,549
in theory,

204
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,140
the certificate of authority, when they get a request, they check the CAA record.

205
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,760
OK? But the client doesn't.

206
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,209
So the problem is by definition, if you have a malicious C A,

207
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,960
they're not checking these records. So

208
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,049
CAA records are essentially kind of, they,

209
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,960
the only hole that they close is like somebody somehow got into

210
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,169
your DNS or email so that they could validate for a certificate

211
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,909
through some and then they are dumb enough to like, use

212
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,640
AC A that you don't have listed.

213
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,679
So CAA records basically don't do anything.

214
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,479
Like they don't,

215
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,799
they don't address any real world attack scenario

216
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,679
where the attacker is actually going to be

217
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,289
skimmed by it.

218
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,280
And, and again, a good example of this would be every major domain does not use them.

219
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,159
That could be, I, I honestly don't know it.

220
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,159
-- No,
-- I, I looked at a bunch, nobody uses

221
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:08,440
them.

222
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,530
You know, we should also predicate this conversation even though we're what,

223
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,320
like 10 minutes and now at this point or something.

224
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,020
But

225
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,460
this is a topic, Kurt cares about a lot and this is a topic I don't know very much about.

226
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:21,059
And as I, I think my literal words to you where this,

227
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,940
I feel like this is my water supply.

228
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,940
I turn the tap on and water comes out and I don't care

229
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,090
because someone else's problem to figure this all out.

230
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,419
Well, and the thing is, there's very few people who care about this.

231
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:33,900
Like if you look at the certificate authority mailing list,

232
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,349
there's like five people being active on it.

233
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,059
And it's the same five people for 20 years. So,

234
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,645
what's interesting to me is like,

235
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:44,044
the vast majority of security stuff like C A pinning

236
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,804
CAA records is to put it bluntly it's security theater.

237
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:50,924
It doesn't matter at all. And even better example is

238
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,275
there's three kinds of certificates. Right.

239
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:56,005
There's domain validated, extended, validated and organizational validated.

240
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,924
-- I thought they got
-- rid of the EV.

241
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,445
Exactly. It was security theater.

242
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:00,905
So they did get rid of them

243
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:05,085
because, like, oh, you know, I, I, actually, my bank used to use one. Weirdly,

244
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,710
Toronto Dominion used to use one.

245
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,400
-- Lots of
-- sites, lots of big companies had them, like,

246
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,989
Amazon had one and Walmart had one and,

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,979
-- and
-- nobody cared because they go to Walmart with the number one instead of the l.com.

248
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,830
I understand the theory because it turned your

249
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,900
address bar green or something.

250
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:24,659
-- I remember
-- they had like a little thing instead of the walk.

251
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,619
It actually had like a little

252
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:26,940
green thing

253
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,190
but nobody cared.

254
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,869
And, and the thing is, I don't know,

255
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:31,794
the TD

256
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,385
has one. So I don't know, to look for it.

257
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,885
-- Exactly. Exactly. Right.
-- Yes.

258
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,294
Like I know when I go to a restaurant to look at their food handling permit

259
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,255
or actually I just look them up on the,

260
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,905
the website where I can check out their records and see what they failed.

261
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,775
The number of times I've looked for that is basically zero.

262
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:51,575
-- You know,
-- it's, to me every restaurant that's clean and nice.

263
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,695
They proudly display it and it's like right there when you walk in and see it.

264
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:56,734
Right. That's fair.

265
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,440
The best restaurants almost certainly fail their health inspection.

266
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,619
Oh, everybody fails.

267
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,380
But it's usually like you want it to be normal failure, stuff, like, oh,

268
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,559
-- there's a bit of grease on the, on the grease hoods, like, yes,
-- that's, that's true.

269
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,760
-- Not like they found a body in the freezer
-- or, you know, uh mouse droppings in the food,

270
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:14,919
right? That's fair.

271
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,400
-- That's,
-- you know, like I'm ok with a little extra grease and like, oh, they, you know,

272
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,250
every single time the dishwasher cycle,

273
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,099
they're like the PH balance is off and they had to recalibrate it like they had to,

274
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:26,960
they don't use the testing strips, put enough uh blue stuff in or whatever it is.

275
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:27,750
I forget the color.

276
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:28,510
I don't know.

277
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,590
But anyway, so,

278
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,080
so what's fascinating to me is like the vast majority.

279
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,969
So though one of the few things that has actually worked for C A security is

280
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:40,190
the public transparency locks because it let us see how bad some of these cas were.

281
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,309
-- Sure.
-- But how many cas have been removed

282
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,969
from the, the root store?

283
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:47,989
-- Uh three or four
-- out of how many

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,830
and several have failed to join.

285
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,059
Uh There was that Brazilian one that wanted to join and we looked at their, I,

286
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,150
I looked at their certificate transparency logs and

287
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,479
they were issuing certificates for IP addresses,

288
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,570
which is super not allowed

289
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:04,419
for single names, like not a domain name like food.com dot Corp,

290
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,359
but like just

291
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:08,219
a word, right? Like there was hundreds

292
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,900
hundreds of misu Ands and, and so they lacked maturity to do this.

293
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,010
Oh, and they were specifically to look up email records for DNS using,

294
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,190
who is they were specifically using a website that said

295
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,979
do not use us for this kind of activity,

296
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,309
right?

297
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,159
So what this all boils down to is

298
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,570
there's really only a few things that even remotely matter.

299
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,669
And I would say one of them is the ability and, and willingness of the C A

300
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,010
to revoke certificates when they are mi

301
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:37,599
misis

302
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,169
issued, which that's how trusts,

303
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,840
that's one of the big things that got entrust booted

304
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:44,179
is because they had issued a lot of bad certificates

305
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,169
and they weren't

306
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,929
like dealing with it properly.

307
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,809
I need to explain this because I don't even understand this situation.

308
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,760
So the, the in, in trust story is what kicked off this whole,

309
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,570
I guess

310
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,909
-- line of discussion to how we got to right
-- now.

311
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,780
So in trust behaved badly enough that they got booted out of Google and now

312
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,330
-- Mozilla's Certificate store program and in
-- trust was

313
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,260
a root certificate or were they just,

314
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,349
uh, ac a

315
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,330
major root

316
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,140
-- certificate? They are
-- root certificate.

317
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:13,890
They are,

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,390
um,

319
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,950
like they're one of the original kind of top five us

320
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,679
entities that have been doing this for 20 or 30 years,

321
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:21,979
right? They are also like for b

322
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,270
for the brand identification mark certificates. It's only in trust and dider

323
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:30,520
-- that do that
-- or it was in trust or is it still in trust?

324
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,039
Well, that's a server thing with email. That's not a web browser thing? Ok.

325
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:34,760
So it's different.

326
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,659
So, but in trust basically behaved badly enough that Google booted them out.

327
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,369
And then of course,

328
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,469
Mozilla did because essentially once a major player like Google or Apple or, well,

329
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:44,650
Mozilla

330
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,840
are based and I guess Microsoft those, there's four that matter.

331
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,369
-- And
-- it should also be noted that every

332
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,080
web browser carries their own root certificate.

333
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,530
Is it a database? I don't what you call the root cert

334
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,599
-- store,
-- it's a store, it's called a store. Root Certificate store.

335
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,340
-- Ok.
-- Yeah.

336
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,539
And, but they're all pretty much the same in that they're all the kind of the,

337
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,869
the cab forum one.

338
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:10,140
And so in trust actually, because they got booted out, like,

339
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,460
how do they keep selling certificates?

340
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:14,530
And the answer is they basically became an ssl.com reseller,

341
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:18,570
right? They, so they literally are like, you know, you'll get a

342
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:18,809
ru

343
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,219
branded email from ssl.com when it varies, you know, blah, blah, blah.

344
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,869
So they literally have become a glorified reseller.

345
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:30,320
And so because for example, their inability or unwillingness to,

346
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,479
to revoke a certificate means they're not like willing to do

347
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,419
this is the the entry level of security for a certificate authority

348
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,979
because the problem is I sell you a certificate, it has a serial number,

349
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,719
it has a digital signature.

350
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,270
Well, I can't like take it back. I can't,

351
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,039
I can't revoke it in the classical sense if

352
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,169
I actually like physically revoke it from you.

353
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,659
So how do I make people stop using it?

354
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,010
I, I actually don't know because there was what the, like the OS CP is it O CS P,

355
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,340
I forget the acronym.

356
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:00,859
So the original way we did it

357
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,820
was what was called certificate revocation list. And it literally was

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,530
every certificate authority was supposed to run a server

359
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:08,619
with an endpoint

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,099
that would have a list of certificates that had been revoked

361
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,570
and you could query it.

362
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:14,590
And of course,

363
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:17,380
none of them could run a web server good enough for this to actually work.

364
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,609
And so what happened is, do you remember for about a decade,

365
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,700
there was a period of a lot of web browser updates

366
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:26,210
and one of the main notes in all the web browser updates would be this certificate,

367
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,010
revocation list is being updated.

368
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:29,140
Yes.

369
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,090
And so literally the solution to revoking

370
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,500
certificates is we're gonna update your web

371
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,380
-- browser with a list of stuff that's been revoked
-- and issuing 4 billion certificates

372
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,322
a day or more is

373
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,361
very reasonable.

374
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:44,041
Well, no, that's actually the solution.

375
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,992
-- Are they still doing that?
-- Well, no, the solution now

376
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,142
because the problem is certificates used to have

377
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:53,281
long lifetimes of three or five years.

378
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:53,981
That's right.

379
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:58,281
And now Apple, because basically Apple said, no, this doesn't work for us anymore.

380
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,562
One year max.

381
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:03,981
Well, in and let's encrypt uses what, like 30 or 90 days or something.

382
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:05,984
-- I forget what it is. It's pretty short.
-- And

383
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:08,093
this is the most important thing for

384
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,633
security certificate because it forces people to automate

385
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:11,674
that

386
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,893
and it, but it's not just automating getting a new certificate.

387
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:20,354
It's also by definition, if you, if let's encrypt issues a bad certificate at most,

388
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:23,273
it's going to be good for 30 or 60 days or whatever.

389
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:24,054
Right.

390
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:27,994
So, the amount of damage long term is, is vastly minimized, right?

391
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:29,723
This is the whole idea of password rotation.

392
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:29,744
Oh,

393
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,926
you need to rotate your password in case an attacker found out

394
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,666
and he's using it to log into your system and use it

395
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,625
and then you rotate your password and lock them out.

396
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:36,426
And it's like, well, that's,

397
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,036
but then they'll just get in the same way they

398
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,306
got in the first time by fishing you or whatever.

399
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:43,435
Probably because just add a one to the end and

400
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:49,065
-- it works.
-- Yeah. So, certificate revocation. We had uh OS CP online certificate.

401
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:53,296
-- Oh God. The s always evades me something, protocol.
-- No, I, I just looked it up.

402
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,026
It's called

403
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,236
online certificate status. Product

404
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:57,617
status.

405
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:57,947
O

406
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:01,737
CS P. I had to look it up because I couldn't even remember what the acronym was.

407
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,557
I knew it had those four letters in it, but I didn't know the order.

408
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,767
And the best thing is you tried enabling it and living

409
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,047
with it once for like what two days and then no,

410
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,137
a couple of hours

411
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,098
every, the whole internet just fell over. It was unusable.

412
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,896
And didn't we did like a show on this, didn't we? I think we did.

413
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,406
-- Yeah, we
-- did. That was years ago.

414
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,258
And so again, that's a perfect example of

415
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,088
you cannot check

416
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,530
that every certificate you're interacting with is valid

417
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,040
every time you use it because you have

418
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,670
to check it every time you can't check it once a week or once a month,

419
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,300
it has to be checked.

420
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,020
Like every time

421
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:35,780
a

422
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:40,020
the, the, the services to provide this don't exist reliably enough. And B

423
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,640
is, there's also a huge privacy problem

424
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,140
that

425
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,969
every Os CP endpoint knows where you're going and when you're going there

426
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:49,209
-- O
-- CS P,

427
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,319
-- you keep saying Os C
-- P. Oh did I

428
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,050
-- O CS P?
-- You know, I keep thinking of omni Consumer Corp.

429
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,180
Anyway.

430
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,680
Anyways,

431
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,369
that was a great, that was a great original film, Robocop. Anyway. Anyway,

432
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:06,530
so back to this. So, so like all of these things that like certificates,

433
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:06,949
the,

434
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,680
the cab form and everything did.

435
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,040
I mean,

436
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,099
pretty much every single thing they've done for security has turned out

437
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,439
to generally be so bad that like even Google won't do it.

438
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,829
-- Like Google tried pinning for a while and then stopped
-- because

439
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,140
-- it had too many problems
-- because

440
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,280
the answer

441
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,319
much like software is automation and rapid rollover.

442
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,579
Like just renewing certificates, getting certificates, like same thing with. So,

443
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,300
like being able to patch rapidly trumps pretty much every other

444
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,459
security measure because it's what you're gonna have to patch anyway.

445
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,589
So you might as well get good at

446
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:39,420
it.

447
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,520
What it boils down to is that the vast majority of this certificate,

448
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,890
authority stuff is security theater.

449
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,750
That doesn't matter. Or in many cases was it made things so bad that, like,

450
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,780
people tried it and then gave up

451
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,849
and then invented something new to try and make it better,

452
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,329
which turned out to be even worse.

453
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,880
And so a great example of this is digi

454
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,500
cert. So Dider

455
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,150
Misis issued some certificates.

456
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,400
Now, when I say misu, that's a, that's a loaded word in this thing,

457
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,979
they didn't give them to the wrong people, we don't think.

458
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,109
But the,

459
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,189
the way they did the issuing and the C the DNS checks was not correct

460
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:14,430
because they made some changes on their back end and then their one front end.

461
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,420
Is this fairly,

462
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,066
or is this the very old digit

463
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,046
probably like a week ago,

464
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:21,105
like a week ago or two weeks ago?

465
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,086
And one of their head people stepped down over it?

466
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:24,306
Yeah,

467
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:27,605
basically. Well, because here's the fascinating thing, did GT,

468
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:32,946
basically, you know, tried actually kind of responded quickly and,

469
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,145
and is like here we're, we're,

470
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,576
we're doing this to fix it and we're going to

471
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,186
do this long term and code reviews and blah,

472
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:37,786
blah, blah, blah blah.

473
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,495
But then a company that uses them,

474
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,511
sued them and got an injunction so that they couldn't revoke the certificates.

475
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:45,972
Oh, interesting.

476
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,062
What happened is there's this health care

477
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:51,921
adjacent cloud company that I guess does a product and you know,

478
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,411
you have a domain name and obviously need a

479
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:54,621
certificate for it and they get it through digit

480
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:58,541
and clearly they don't have any sort of automation to roll this over

481
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:01,582
because they literally sue Digi cert to get an injunction to like,

482
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:03,222
stop them revoking all these certificates.

483
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,271
Now, this puts Digic

484
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,812
Cert in a bit of a pickle

485
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,640
because if they don't revoke these certificates in a timely manner,

486
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,069
like basically 24 hours,

487
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:12,650
they might end up getting killed, like in trust.

488
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,709
Interesting.

489
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,770
-- But a judge said you can't.
-- Ok.

490
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,709
And what was like,

491
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,380
what was wrong with these certificates that they were used by a business?

492
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:24,829
The way they did the DNS checks to validate them wasn't secure. It.

493
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,750
It had a technical glitch basically,

494
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,380
which meant an attacker could potentially actually get

495
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,875
-- certificates relatively easily.
-- I see.

496
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:38,974
So they didn't know if Attackers had maybe issued certificates for this company.

497
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:41,094
-- Well,
-- the attacker request the certificate digit

498
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:42,045
would issue it.

499
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:43,035
Right. Right.

500
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,295
So the, the digit certs,

501
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:47,214
like we're just going to revoke them all and you'll have to re, you have to redo it,

502
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:51,694
-- which is the, that's the correct answer. I
-- mean, yeah, that, I agree.

503
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:55,295
-- That would be the right thing to do. And if
-- it's automated, guess what? It's easy,

504
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,354
it would just magic.

505
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,494
Yeah, exactly.

506
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,160
But like I said, they got an injunction and they were prevented from doing this.

507
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,880
And so they went kind of, then even a little bit further.

508
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,989
And I think that's why that head guy stepped down is because they, they, they like,

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,219
in trust don't want to get delisted and become an ssl.com reseller, right?

510
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:13,719
Because

511
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,229
it used to be actually, I'm gonna say this and I'm not using air quotes.

512
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,300
It used to be easy

513
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,300
to become a root certificate authority and get into the root store

514
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:27,020
because the process was fail open. It was essentially you went

515
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,839
and you applied to Mozilla and there was one person

516
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:31,739
who I'm not gonna name because she does great work.

517
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,459
And she's like one of those load bearing internet pillars,

518
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,439
the foundation of the entire internet in modern society,

519
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,380
right?

520
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:41,020
So

521
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,150
I

522
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,089
to be clear, like she's doing great work. But

523
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,160
the process and because we came from a simpler time, we were all, you know,

524
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,369
-- things were innocent and lovely
-- and everyone probably knew each other.

525
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:49,859
Yes.

526
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:50,310
But well,

527
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,819
more to the point is we weren't like if you basically stood up what looked like a

528
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:57,800
root certificate authority got your audit report from

529
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,760
some auditor and like some of these audit reports

530
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,000
as far as I can tell were a s, a company that is a single individual.

531
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,349
Now, if you look at the audit reports for like Verisign and well,

532
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,060
in trust and did you're certain all these people,

533
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,780
you're going to see accounting firms with names you recognize?

534
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,579
Ok.

535
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,900
And then you look at some of the dodgier ones and you're gonna see

536
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,380
company names that you look them up and it's like a single person.

537
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,339
So you're beginning to see there's a bit of shenanigans maybe going on.

538
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:20,989
You know,

539
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,130
it's like I got a sock two report like let me put it this way if somebody said to you,

540
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,219
hey, Josh, here's my sock two report and you saw it was signed by Kurt siefried.

541
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,949
-- Like, would you trust
-- it? I wouldn't untrust it.

542
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:34,819
I think there is, there are circumstances where a single person

543
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,920
company is just fine. I mean, I think for a root C A

544
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,640
the bar should be a bit higher

545
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:42,719
but,

546
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,810
but there's, I'm not, I'm not discounting like single person audit companies.

547
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,920
They are legit and some of them are very, very good

548
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,180
and, but, and some of them, for example,

549
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:54,479
-- were delisted by the Canadian Auditors Society and
-- blah, blah, blah.

550
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:54,880
Yeah. Well,

551
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,479
and there's, I, I remember there was some story I heard I can't, I, I just, I,

552
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,010
I'm certain I won't be able to find the details, but I'll try, but there was like

553
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,479
there was basically some,

554
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,290
a business auditor was using,

555
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,880
like their cousin that was running like a one person company.

556
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,770
And when they got, like, actually audited by the state, they were like, oh,

557
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,890
this person hasn't even done any like this.

558
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,650
You haven't been audited at all.

559
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,729
And yeah, it was their cousin, like,

560
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,729
was just rubber stamping whatever they were given.

561
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,400
-- That's actually a pretty common thing.
-- It probably is,

562
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:22,819
that kind of shenanigans

563
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:22,979
happen.

564
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,130
So, back to this.

565
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:27,755
So digits are kind of fell on their sword and is trying to do the right thing. And

566
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,225
what's fascinating to me is, yeah,

567
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,735
the vast majority of people don't care and don't know.

568
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:32,536
And they don't have to.

569
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:33,816
Yeah, like, I had no idea.

570
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,656
I'm literally in the industry, but I now,

571
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,336
granted I've been on the road for three weeks prior to this,

572
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:41,615
so I have no idea what's going on anywhere but still, yeah, I,

573
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,135
I had no idea this was happening.

574
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,576
No, I, no, no clue.

575
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:48,702
And if you look at the certificate, traffic, like mailing list traffic,

576
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,621
it's the same small group of people,

577
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:54,021
like, straight up, like, one of them is a professor from Calgary, you know,

578
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,222
south of me who, like,

579
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:59,862
got ac a booted out a few years ago because they were so bad and he did some research,

580
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:00,421
you know,

581
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:02,312
the Turkish one where they got broken into and

582
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:05,041
they didn't know for possibly a few years,

583
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,250
you know,

584
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,819
and they straight up had like public

585
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,849
facing services with like default administrative credentials.

586
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,869
Good. Right. Like,

587
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,510
and somebody found it and reported it and then was like,

588
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,380
they're like, yeah, we don't think an attacker did this and they're like, ok,

589
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,910
that's one way to answer that question.

590
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:20,729
So

591
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:23,510
fundamentally, I don't know, kind of what the,

592
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,959
the point of all this is. But looking at this, I think a big part of it is

593
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,510
security

594
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:36,369
needs to involve the people who actually are going to use this also at scale.

595
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,089
Yes. So it's funny you say that, that, that was a topic

596
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:45,489
that came up multiple times while I was in Las Vegas last week for B sides

597
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,219
where

598
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:50,329
specifically around S bombs and vulnerabilities

599
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,750
-- that's going to be a prom at scale.
-- A lot of the people,

600
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,560
like we say

601
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:57,189
in the boat

602
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,800
for S bombs and vulnerabilities

603
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:03,680
haven't actually been using them for years, maybe ever.

604
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,140
And they're speaking with authority and making decisions and

605
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,030
it's obvious to anyone who's actually like in the dirt

606
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:12,469
that like these people have no idea what they're talking about.

607
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,819
They're, they're so far removed from reality,

608
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,609
but unfortunately,

609
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,979
they are in positions sometimes where they're

610
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,859
speaking with authority and they're getting,

611
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:22,270
they're, they're being listened to.

612
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,949
And so it's really hard to be like,

613
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,635
hey, I'm just like a nobody down here in the mud. That guy's an idiot.

614
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,645
Well, so the problem is the infosec industry tends to like,

615
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,484
for example, I you know,

616
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,814
brought up that the cas are doing bad things and people are like, Kurt,

617
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:36,494
why are you doing that?

618
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,415
You're being mean to them.

619
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:40,155
Like, why can't you just leave them be like, they're like,

620
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,425
they're causing problems and it's like I'm trying to

621
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:45,775
get ac ad listed that is like objectively bad

622
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,670
and needs to be delisted.

623
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:50,359
Well, you see that all the time in this industry where somebody bring, like,

624
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:51,890
everybody shoots the messenger

625
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:52,589
a

626
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:56,510
great example, the, the two thread on Mastodon where I'm like,

627
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,180
I would love to use Firefox but like, where is my easy profile manager?

628
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:04,790
-- There isn't one? You have to install a plug in and it's not great.
-- Exactly.

629
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:07,060
And it doesn't actually quite work the way I want it to

630
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:07,974
and it doesn't make it easy.

631
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,165
And all these people are kind of like, well, Kurt, you're holding it wrong,

632
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:10,685
you're doing it wrong.

633
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,035
And I'm like,

634
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,814
I think this is a common use case and actually a few people piped up saying

635
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,055
I too have this problem and I too would love to use for

636
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:19,125
ha, but I do have multiple business things and a personal thing and I need to blah,

637
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:19,574
blah, blah

638
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:22,984
and it just doesn't work. I've tried it and I've done it and like it, it's a pain.

639
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:26,165
Like I've been using Linux since Slack or one point. Oh,

640
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,055
I understand

641
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:30,224
painful software and using it

642
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:30,885
like,

643
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,819
well, and you're old and you complain a lot now. So there's that

644
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,089
too

645
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,770
-- because I'm also like, well, chrome did it relatively easily. Why
-- can't?

646
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:38,800
Yeah, the chrome,

647
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,439
the profiles or whatever they call them. They're very good. OK.

648
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:46,760
II I have a question related to the topic because I don't want to go down this radical.

649
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,040
But OK, so one of the things that comes up around the, the certificate root store

650
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:58,199
is I do a lot of work with, we'll say us public sector,

651
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,000
which is the US government oftentimes the Department of

652
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,839
Defense and the military and things like that.

653
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,160
And they will say they have a particular sensitivity to certain countries.

654
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:11,680
-- Let's say China, North Korea,
-- I wasn't going to name them. But sure those countries,

655
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,959
I had someone come to me the other day. It was like,

656
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,569
have you seen all of these Chinese cas

657
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,420
in the root certificate store?

658
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,920
And I was like, yeah, what about it? They're like, should we trust them? I'm like,

659
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,520
we don't really have a choice like they've been there forever.

660
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,160
So here's what's frustrating to me

661
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:32,869
is there's actually some security stuff built in where for example, I could issue,

662
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,750
you can create a root certificate

663
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,359
that

664
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:39,729
it has specifications on what kinds of things it can do.

665
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,619
It can sign email certificates, it can sign webs

666
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,410
can sign code certificates,

667
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,119
software,

668
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:45,250
software, sorry.

669
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,859
Um

670
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,189
And uh like be like the brand identification

671
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,520
soft and so typically certificates have that limitation.

672
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,489
Like this is a web service certificate. This is a

673
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,630
code uh software signing certificate. This is an email certificate.

674
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,130
You can also restrict their domain names. So you could say, for example, like, ok,

675
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,250
for the sake of argument,

676
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,449
this country's post office will be given a root certificate and

677
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:07,410
they can sign dot whatever the TLD for the country is

678
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,209
-- like
-- dot CN for China, for example.

679
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:10,890
Exactly.

680
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,680
And in that case, then I'd be like, yeah,

681
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,910
I don't have to care about that certificate authority anymore because,

682
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,739
well, like

683
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,926
I just, you know, they, they, I only sign stuff for.cn and that,

684
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:20,355
that I don't really mind.

685
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:24,755
Fun fact. Guess how many of the root certificates in the store

686
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,436
have that sort of domain limitation enabled.

687
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:31,706
So I know nothing about how many root certificates are in the store.

688
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:32,686
-- Let's start with that
-- question.

689
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:38,186
It's um over 100 hundreds. It's low, hundreds of memory serves.

690
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,802
And that's a fun thing is just getting that list is

691
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,332
kind of tricky it.

692
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:46,062
So the C A forum has a list of root certificates that generally speaking,

693
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:49,671
almost everybody kind of uses, but each C A kind of has their own thing.

694
00:28:49,682 --> 00:28:50,621
So there's actually PK

695
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:54,212
ic.org/ltl, which is the list of

696
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:59,722
uh trust lists. And so it's like 360 Adobe Android Apple, Chrome Cisco

697
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:02,641
in alphabetical order, you know, a bunch, right?

698
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:03,391
Uh

699
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:07,312
Visa has a really good list. Uh I, I honestly, if you're an American entity,

700
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,060
use the Visa list.

701
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:10,290
That's funny.

702
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,180
I mean, I'm not surprised that they have real money on the line so they care a lot.

703
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:14,630
Like,

704
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
generally speaking,

705
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,760
the companies with actual money in the game are the ones who do the best job here.

706
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:23,170
If you want a US centric version of the list, go use Visas.

707
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:26,290
So, the, the problem though is you're thinking of root certificates as

708
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,859
root certificate companies and that's how

709
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,510
certificates gets issued and you're wrong.

710
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,329
Ok.

711
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,300
The vast majority of certificates are issued

712
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,949
by intermediate authorities like Lutz and Crypt.

713
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,939
-- Well, no certificates. Yes. No, I know that.
-- But here's the fun part.

714
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,900
We don't know how many intermediates there are.

715
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,770
I believe that 100%.

716
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,500
Yeah, like just like we don't know how many certificates there are.

717
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,060
Well, we think there's about six.

718
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,290
The last number I saw a few years ago is we think there's about 6000 intermediates.

719
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,630
That doesn't surprise me even a little bit because the

720
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,390
prompt too is you've got some that are like,

721
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,839
are obvious, like let's encrypt

722
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,469
and some like, ok, well,

723
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:03,239
Amazon issued certificates for their web services and

724
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,380
they became intermediate a long time ago.

725
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,300
So they can,

726
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,920
all of the cloud providers are intermediates

727
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,819
-- pretty much. Yeah, pretty much is
-- an intermediate or intermediary

728
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,020
intermediate

729
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,849
because basically they have a certificate

730
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,560
signed by a root certificate.

731
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,300
But without the limitation, like normally when they sign a certificate,

732
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,949
they say you also can't sign any more certificates.

733
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,209
Well, in that case, they

734
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,010
or you're constrained to a domain,

735
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,410
right?

736
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,170
Well, no domain constraints are almost never used.

737
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,170
I looked and, well, how would you constrain Amazon, right?

738
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,270
You can't constrain Amazon,

739
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,805
constrain them. But I'm saying for like you or I, for example,

740
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:45,324
-- no, they, well, you just get a wild card certificate in that case.
-- OK.

741
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:48,704
And that's fair. And again, I, I'm way out of the game on this.

742
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:52,265
And that's a good example of domain constraints in theory, but in practice,

743
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,864
domain constraints don't work because now we have over 2000 Tl DS.

744
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:55,114
Uh

745
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:55,775
Yeah,

746
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:59,305
like minor problem even just listing them all

747
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:01,324
in the ticket would like it would break.

748
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,135
That's fair. Right. Well, I'm, I'm,

749
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:05,214
I'm guessing if you add 100

750
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,859
domain constraints to a certificate,

751
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,949
-- we're going to find out a lot of broken implementations for
-- sure.

752
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,670
Yeah, I'm sure every, most of the,

753
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,420
-- the low end phones would probably collapse
-- low end.

754
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,199
I, I don't know, maybe it's,

755
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,880
it's cute that you think like the high end stuff would handle it because it never,

756
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,650
well, and, and it's also funny because

757
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:30,189
-- the, the, the libraries that parse all this crap are like ancient sea code
-- and worse,

758
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,650
it's all based on a SN one which is that itu the

759
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,310
International Telephony Union Standard and a SN one is not a standard.

760
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,849
-- It's a horrible format. Well,
-- no, a SN one is like a family of documents.

761
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,449
Let's say that are sort of a standard because people use them as a standard.

762
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,119
Interesting. But if you actually look at it like

763
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,020
there's, it's kind of officially technically a standard,

764
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,250
but it's also kind of officially like,

765
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,790
here's a pile of documents that everybody sort of agrees to.

766
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:01,160
Perfect example, curl just issued a security update like a week or two ago

767
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,270
and it was an a sn one person problem.

768
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,619
Well,

769
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,300
and this leads to another show we need to do

770
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,599
on undefined behavior and why that's such a problem.

771
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,359
But anyways, we don't know how many there are to start.

772
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,339
Well, we know how many root certificates there are. And so here's the thing.

773
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,359
Now, I asked you to pause.

774
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,069
Now I want you to go, you're in Firefox, go into the certificate store

775
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,780
thing under security and tell me how many there are.

776
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,349
-- I have to figure
-- out how to do this.

777
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:27,439
-- You want to click on settings and security
-- certificates, view certificates.

778
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,390
There you go.

779
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,510
Uh It doesn't show me there's the list is gigantic.

780
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,479
-- Hundreds, hundreds and hundreds
-- easily. And you can't export it easily.

781
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:41,689
-- Can you,
-- I can I select all I can select all? No, I can select one. I can export one,

782
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,739
the interface to these things in the web browser.

783
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,819
Also, let's say for the sake of argument, you want to like

784
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,160
-- remove a bunch of them
-- again, one at a time. Can I can I control click?

785
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh I can shift click, I can export them all. I can go to the top.

786
00:32:55,719 --> 00:33:00,020
Wait, there's a certificate named CN that seems safe. Anyway,

787
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,810
then I can click on the bottom.

788
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:05,839
Yes, I oh, but if I select them all, I can't, the export button is grayed up.

789
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:08,109
I have to select one to get the export button to

790
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:08,339
re

791
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:13,469
so or, or delete or distrust is also, I have to only

792
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,920
-- select one at a time.
-- I don't mean to laugh but

793
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,439
it's 2024.

794
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:17,969
And

795
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,719
in every web browser, it is effectively impossible

796
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,439
and even better on Apple devices, Apple Mobile,

797
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,540
they stopped pretending you you can't even look.

798
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,439
I I think the point is like, I think the reason,

799
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:34,069
the reason I let you do this show even because honestly,

800
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,780
I think this topic is boring and no one cares.

801
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,280
Yeah, I agree. But the reason it

802
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,750
matter

803
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,079
is this is like

804
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:45,560
this is the foundational infrastructure of modern society.

805
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:47,609
-- I won't even say the internet.
-- This is plumbing,

806
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,800
it's not even plumbing.

807
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:53,989
This is like this is the bedrock upon which society functions.

808
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,949
Every computer, talking to every computer on the planet

809
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,040
uses this.

810
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:00,640
Yes, is using this and it is

811
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,589
-- an unmitigated disaster.
-- Oh, it gets worse though, from a browser perspective.

812
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,208
So tell me which ones you're using, which what

813
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,389
which root certificates ultimately you're actually using on a daily basis.

814
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,929
-- I assume all of them.
-- Well, the answer is we don't really know.

815
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,360
And the best answer I came up with somebody was like, run Linux

816
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,620
and use pie notify to monitor the certificate store in

817
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,969
slash etc and see when the files are being read.

818
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,620
I see which would work for applications that use the system store

819
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,770
and have their own but not a web browser.

820
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:34,956
Yeah, the whole thing is like, it's wild and, and this is again,

821
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:36,466
I think back to that email.

822
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:40,324
I got not long ago where the guy was like, look at all these Chinese

823
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:41,645
certificate authorities

824
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:42,864
and it's like

825
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:44,246
we don't know.

826
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:49,565
And I love that all of these organizations make a big deal about oh Chinese

827
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:53,324
developed code or we don't want contributions from

828
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:56,485
people outside of this country or whatever.

829
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,976
And the reality is like this is one

830
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:02,642
of those extremely a key foundations that thank goodness

831
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:04,852
has basically worked.

832
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:09,162
No, I mean, because of a couple of people, you know, doing miracles

833
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,362
and probably what is free time.

834
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:11,931
Yep.

835
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:16,941
Well, and uh one also thing uh for example, Atos is a certificate authority, right?

836
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,961
A big one. They have multiple certificates actually in the root store.

837
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,652
A majority of creditors of Atos se have signed

838
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,431
the lock up again agreement that will see them

839
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,261
take control of the embattled French it services provider

840
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:30,041
following its restructuring according to a statement on Monday.

841
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,679
So the other thing to remember is like

842
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:33,899
if you start looking at these certificate authorities and

843
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,530
trying to track them down unless they have

844
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,060
a really obvious name like Beijing Certificate Authority,

845
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,479
which

846
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:42,000
literally is the name of one, then you can be reasonably sure that's a,

847
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,159
probably ac a in Beijing

848
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,790
or

849
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,199
Atos,

850
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,659
-- you know, being that big it company. I've
-- never heard of Atos before. At this moment.

851
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,840
They're massive in Europe.

852
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,080
I,

853
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,320
I used to know people that work there. You know, they're like one of those.

854
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,050
It's like accenture if you're not an accounting. Yeah,

855
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:56,979
I've heard of accenture.

856
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,219
-- But if
-- you're that name,

857
00:35:58,229 --> 00:36:01,330
I've heard of because they sponsor some program on public television.

858
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,879
Yeah.

859
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,820
But, um,

860
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,310
if you start looking at a lot of the certificate, authorities,

861
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,129
about half of them are really hard to track down and figure out like,

862
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,629
kind of if they're legit or not.

863
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,290
And I'm sure we never take anything out of the list.

864
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,219
And the intermediates of course are,

865
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,889
-- it's a complete free for all
-- unknowable number. Yes.

866
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,889
I, I don't know what the answer is here because the other,

867
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,580
the thing is we're, they're talking about getting rid of certificate,

868
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,370
transparency logs because of the privacy issues of like,

869
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:30,239
because the problem now is you stand up a server and of course you have

870
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,699
to get a certificate for it because otherwise your web browser screams at you.

871
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:34,379
Yes.

872
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,360
And the moment you get a certificate, it shows up in the logs

873
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:42,010
and the Attackers see it and your server gets hammered.

874
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,530
Now on the on the, on the other flip the flip side of that,

875
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,739
I know

876
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:47,770
a bunch of security

877
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:50,120
researchers that watch the transparency logs to

878
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:52,419
look for probable phishing domains where,

879
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:57,070
when you have a website registered that looks like walmart.com, they're like,

880
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,409
that's almost definitely phishing.

881
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:01,229
Let's add that to the list of places you can't go.

882
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:01,449
Yeah.

883
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,669
And there was that famous club floor hack incident where they

884
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,409
talked about that where they were monitoring for these domains,

885
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:08,100
but didn't, didn't catch it in time.

886
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,209
And yeah, so I,

887
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,310
I personally think we should keep the certificate

888
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,629
transparency logs and just make it all public because

889
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,550
trying to rely on

890
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,199
Attackers not knowing that the server exists.

891
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:20,399
-- It's not, I mean,
-- yeah, that's stupid.

892
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,120
But at the same time, like if, if,

893
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:26,830
if there are literally billions and billions of certificates issued each day

894
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:30,719
like that transparency log has to be bananas.

895
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,959
And that's kind of part of why we're looking to get rid

896
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:35,919
of it is because like running it is expensive and not chore.

897
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,820
Oh, I'm sure, I can't imagine what it's like to even just keep the thing alive,

898
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,959
much less do anything with the data.

899
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:42,909
Yeah.

900
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,399
And I mean,

901
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,229
this leads to interesting things of where this actually in

902
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,580
some ways will help Attackers because if an attacker,

903
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,929
you know, if they get a certificate that lasts 5, 10 minutes, they use it,

904
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,050
they do the attack, they send out the smashes, you know,

905
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,409
the S MS s or whatever it gets used and then it's just gone kind of without a trace.

906
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,810
You know, it, it's very hard to investigate because it's, well, it's gone.

907
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:02,919
I mean,

908
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,270
this is, oh, man, this is such a weird problem. And

909
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:09,639
the answer, the one, the one answer I know it isn't,

910
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:14,012
is creating like some sort of governmental or UN type organ to

911
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:16,913
try to manage this because it would be

912
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,913
no doubt a disaster.

913
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:22,623
-- It, well, even if with good intentions, they would screw it up
-- for

914
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:22,752
sure.

915
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:26,623
I think what terrifies me is the lack of sort of new people getting involved.

916
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:26,843
And like,

917
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:29,083
I've seen new people try to get involved and then they

918
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:31,893
kind of get booed out because they do unpopular things,

919
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:33,433
like point out that there's no pants.

920
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:34,232
Right.

921
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:34,572
Right.

922
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,062
Not that we're not wearing pants, there just are no pants,

923
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,343
-- that is a difficult problem for
-- sure.

924
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:39,952
And we, we,

925
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:43,125
I see a lot of that in Infosec and I think that's kind

926
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:46,535
of one of the biggest problems INFOSEC has currently because especially with,

927
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,656
like, we're turning away newcomers.

928
00:38:48,716 --> 00:38:51,176
-- I mean,
-- well, there's some of that we also talked about like,

929
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:52,456
where are all the young people at open

930
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:53,936
source? Not very long ago?

931
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:54,615
And there's,

932
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:59,196
there's an aspect of people just don't want to get involved because quite frankly,

933
00:38:59,206 --> 00:38:59,595
like,

934
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:01,176
this is a boring job.

935
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:01,996
I,

936
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,756
I actually got rein involved with the certificate

937
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:05,936
authority stuff

938
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,530
and I basically gave it about a year and then I gave up and left

939
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,330
because it's a terrible thing.

940
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:15,310
It feels like the sort of work you definitely have to pay people to do.

941
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,070
Yes.

942
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,149
And

943
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:18,020
that's

944
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:21,300
-- about all I have to say.
-- It's one of those things where there's very,

945
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,949
there's almost no

946
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:24,620
incentive

947
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:29,050
to actually make the whole c a landscape more secure because, well,

948
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,250
essentially all the cas are, like, in trust are making money selling certificates.

949
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,770
They don't want to, you know, disrupt that.

950
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,729
This is like the story of security,

951
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,929
like the security that actually matters and works

952
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:42,800
isn't the security V CS are funding.

953
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,209
It's boring stuff that you have to pay people to do

954
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,939
because it's boring and no one wants to do it.

955
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,219
Same thing here. All right, we got to call this one, I think. But

956
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,939
yeah, I guess in summary

957
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,179
we're doomed. Maybe

958
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:59,010
it's, you know, it kind of runs. It's like, again, like roads,

959
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,020
potholes.

960
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,570
I wish we had better roads, but we

961
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:02,969
don't

962
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:04,360
it. Yeah.

963
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,399
Yeah. Well, we'll see, I guess we'll see what happens.

964
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:11,520
Thank you for enlightening me with this horrifying information. Kurt.
