Hello and welcome to episode 103 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:12,279
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,220
So now that we have more than 100 episodes,

3
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:19,190
you keep saying like 103 and for some reason in my brain,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,829
I want you to say 103 and I can't explain it and there's no good reason for it either.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,020
It's just, I, I don't know.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,549
-- It's one of those things
-- I noticed myself the other day,

7
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,790
somebody asked me my birthday and I gave it to them in month, day, year form,

8
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:31,790
which I despise

9
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,520
don't do that. That's like the worst,

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,639
it's the worst date format ever.

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:37,439
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,080
But like as a human, it makes sense, right?

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,849
Because typically the year is well now, so like,

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,430
you know,

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,110
may 5th or, you know, June 12th, right? Like that's

16
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:49,490
the 12th of June, right?

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,060
I don't know. I just, June 12th seems to like kind of

18
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,939
-- locate my brain faster
-- one would think. So.

19
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:02,439
So looks like Microsoft actually came up with a useful paper on IOT security.

20
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah, you sent that to me. That's really cool. Actually, what they've done.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,540
So, why, why don't you give us the, like,

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,699
nickel tour and then it'll be in the show notes?

23
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,279
Of course, for anyone interested.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:13,830
Yeah.

25
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,800
So Microsoft has released a PDF, uh,

26
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,470
called the Seven Properties of highly secured devices.

27
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,129
And, uh, one thing that actually just as a side note,

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,540
you know, I was thinking about iot but I'm also, you know,

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,730
like phones and everything, like we are carrying,

30
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,169
like everybody's carrying a computer around with them now that

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,599
you probably want to be secure, right?

32
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:37,510
And so this list actually applies to not just IOT but well, devices in general,

33
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:37,809
right?

34
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,580
Like computers or phone, whatever.

35
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,250
And so there's, there's seven properties that they give

36
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,500
some of which are pretty obvious and some of which are,

37
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,870
I think a little bit more subtle and

38
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:53,089
I actually wrote out a list of questions I kind of have as a result of these. Um,

39
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,040
but uh do we just want to start from the start at the top of the list?

40
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,669
So, you know what's funny is you're,

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,970
you're talking about IOT and I know they even call out IOT.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,319
But when I read this list, the first thing I thought of was my phone.

43
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:06,080
Yeah,

44
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,339
not IOT.

45
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,210
So, but yes, we should read the list.

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,809
Uh I'll let you have the honors and then we'll comment from there.

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,960
The first one is actually, I think the biggest one and that is having

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,759
a hardware-based root of trust. So uh what they say is unforget

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,759
gray

50
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,600
keys generated and protected by hardware

51
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,869
physical countermeasures, resist side channel attacks.

52
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,660
Does this device have a unique un forge

53
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,669
identity that is inseparable from the hardware?

54
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,029
And that really got me thinking about iot in the sense of,

55
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,800
you know, let's say you have some IOT device

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,839
in theory, you know, like what happens if I like de

57
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,889
solder or you know,

58
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:46,460
I basically swap out the board that has the identity

59
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,990
of the device and put it in my device.

60
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,589
Now my device is your device and I have access to your stuff

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,270
or whatever that's doing, right?

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,539
In theory.

63
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,100
Well, I watched this documentary on car stripping, right?

64
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,229
And so the deal is when you steal a car, it's got a VIN number.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,020
So you can't just like sell it on because the VIN number will show up as stolen, right?

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,429
But the VIN number is attached to essentially to like the chassis

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,550
in the car, right?

68
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,729
So what they do is they take, they steal a car

69
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,190
that they basically have like a broken or whatever chassis for.

70
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,539
They take that broken chassis, strip it down,

71
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,339
they take the stolen car and they basically like

72
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,600
strip the stolen car and put it back onto whatever damaged

73
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,110
chassis or whatever they have with a legit vin number.

74
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,470
So they basically severed like

75
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:30,029
and they showed it and these guys did

76
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,789
it over literally overnight with a pickup truck,

77
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,500
like they went out and stole a pickup truck at like seven o'clock.

78
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,740
It was one of those, it was Vice or something like that. Right? And

79
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,130
so they literally went out and stole like this $50,000 pickup truck.

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,660
And by like, you know, six in the morning

81
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,699
here is a chassis.

82
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:50,570
We bought it a junkyard, a salvage, you know, with a legit uns stolen VIN number

83
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:53,119
and hey, presto, new new truck,

84
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,399
that's crazy.

85
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,600
And it blew my mind that they could do it this quickly.

86
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,000
But it also, it really drove home. Like that's the thing with like

87
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,789
we just bought a new fridge

88
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:02,479
and we bought a dumb fridge.

89
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,509
I'm happy to say, but let's say for the sake of argument,

90
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,600
we didn't buy a dumb fridge and we bought a smart fridge.

91
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,130
Well, where,

92
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,080
where is the identity of that fridge?

93
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:13,210
And I'm assuming it would be like on a little daughter board that would, you know,

94
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,190
be easily plug and play out of the device.

95
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,670
So now does you know,

96
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,010
like does the rest of the fridge have to authenticate to

97
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,108
that daughter bar to prove that it hasn't been swapped out?

98
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,519
Like, you know, a

99
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,070
great example of this is

100
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,230
Apple phones with the screens, right?

101
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,470
That this, you know, they,

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,309
they discovered that you can make screens and

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,170
stuff that can like snarled up your passwords.

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,859
And so now Apple is making it much harder for third party, you know, swaps and, um,

105
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:38,670
hardware to take place because they're actually adding apparently

106
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,600
like cryptographic authentication to various kind of hardware chunks.

107
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:42,989
Wait,

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,440
you're saying you can get like a third party screen that essentially steals II,

109
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,250
I assume like that the taps you put on the passcode.

110
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:51,959
Interesting.

111
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,329
Well, uh not just that,

112
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,230
but because it can talk to the rest of the hardware at such an interesting level.

113
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,329
Right. Right. Right. That totally makes sense. Right.

114
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,390
So, so hardware based root of trust,

115
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,559
I, I dig this and I think it's important and

116
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,040
the thing that makes me really happy about the,

117
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,970
the devices we carry around now is this is kind of a thing for the most part,

118
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,799
right? You've got your SIM card obviously can be part of this story.

119
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:20,720
But also the phones themselves now have

120
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,540
security crow processors and security enclaves.

121
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:27,390
And I mean, I remember back in the day like T PM was the promise, right?

122
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,660
-- T PM was terrible
-- to work.

123
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,059
And it

124
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,119
part of the problem I found with T PM is the hardware guys are like, great.

125
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,350
We did this thing. It works

126
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:39,790
and, and all the software guys are like, oh, right, we need software for that.

127
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,549
-- Yeah, we didn't
-- do that.

128
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,549
It, it was so hard to use

129
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,890
well. And, but the thing is, it's happening now, like I know in um

130
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,989
in the Linux ecosystem and some other ecosystems there are,

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,769
there is stuff to use the T PM

132
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,459
to do key generation and secure key distribution.

133
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,230
So that for example,

134
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:03,480
you can have uh storage attached to a device that only works on that device,

135
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,559
right? Because the, the motherboard has the T PM with the decryption keys.

136
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:11,329
And then there was also an extension of that for network stuff. So

137
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,510
you plug your server into the network and

138
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,519
your server essentially can access the storage,

139
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:16,799
you know, and that's it.

140
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,429
Like even an attacker that could get another server in there can't do it. So

141
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,410
it's happening. But I mean, it's, it's a classic thing of, yeah, like

142
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,320
the the hardware existed. But

143
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,059
yeah, using it, I mean, oh, crypto is hard.

144
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeah, it was, it was too hard to use and that's exactly it.

145
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,179
Whereas the phones just work, you know, tm

146
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,470
uh And we should actually this is also related to the next

147
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,779
next point in this list which I will let you read.

148
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah. So having a small trusted computing base.

149
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,179
So private keys are stored in a hardware protected vault,

150
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,049
inaccessible to software division of software into self protecting layers.

151
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,920
So the question is, is the, is most of the device's software outside the devices,

152
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,190
trusted computing base, right?

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,519
And again, we've had that in theory forever, right? Intel ring 0123.

154
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,720
And yeah, what happened? Well, the kernel ran in ring zero

155
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,660
and the Linux kernel last I checked is quite humongous.

156
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:10,480
Well, in, I think this is, this is more than that, right?

157
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,059
This is closer to the security enclave

158
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,079
concept we're talking about.

159
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,140
Well, that's what I'm saying.

160
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,859
We had sort of this, the idea of this forever and it was just

161
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,380
not well done and poorly used and yet we're finally starting to get there where

162
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,149
like my understanding is, you know, the Apple phones, for example, like,

163
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,959
yeah, that security enclave processor has

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,785
the actual encryption keys to decrypt the flash memory and, and

165
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:35,524
you know, that's what you're talking to when you're decrypting the, you know,

166
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,505
when you're putting your pin in the phone or your

167
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:40,125
uh what is it facetime or whatever your fingerprint stuff,

168
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:41,765
it's like bypassing

169
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:44,265
pretty much the rest of the phone as I understand it.

170
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:45,304
Right. Right.

171
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,475
Well, even the Intel chips are,

172
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:51,244
are gaining this ability today where you have the ability

173
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:54,644
to run in kind of an enclave in chip,

174
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,684
which is, I mean, debatably useful.

175
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:57,964
I won't get into that, but

176
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,989
it's this one I'm also seeing popping up everywhere, which is very exciting.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,950
-- Well,
-- it reminds me of how we've traditionally sort of done security,

178
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,940
especially on servers for a lot of people in the cloud, it boils down to,

179
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,890
they have physical hardware upon which they run a very,

180
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,809
very minimal operating system

181
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,920
that runs virtual machines

182
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,420
hopefully securely and well as we learned from

183
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,239
Intel Specter even that doesn't always work.

184
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,500
And

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,109
like Amazon had to patch and reboot their fee. Right.

186
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,209
But essentially, you know what the, like, for example,

187
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,660
what all the major cloud providers do is

188
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,520
just have like an absolute minimal VM hosting infrastructure. Right?

189
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,719
Because we've had 20 years of beating up on V MS virtual machines and they're,

190
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:38,630
they're pretty secure,

191
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,229
you know, they're, they're pretty hard to break out of,

192
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,750
not impossible but, you know, like the venom and all the other.

193
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,450
Like if you just Google Zen CV E like,

194
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,520
yeah, I mean, it's not perfect. But

195
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,789
yeah, it's a hell of a lot closer than say, like having an, you know,

196
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,159
the entire Linux kernel is your attack surface.

197
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,169
So, you know, I like this idea of, kind of, yeah,

198
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,919
you have that small trusted sort of compute base,

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,900
you know, which kind of has minimal capabilities

200
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,840
and then inside of that inside of a VM or a container or whatever, you know, you run

201
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,030
the actual complicated workload that's doing weird stuff

202
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,460
which, which actually builds on the next point. Then it's, it's,

203
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:20,869
it's clever, these things they're all related. Right. Imagine that.

204
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,739
Yeah. Well, it's also part of it I think is you can't build on sand, right?

205
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,109
Like you, you know, when you build a house in, well, a lot of the world you,

206
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,719
you start with a foundation or

207
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,260
at a minimum, like you drop a concrete slab on the ground.

208
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,090
So you have, you know, something flat to sit on

209
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,715
that probably won't move too much but anyways, yeah, so

210
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,724
the third one is defense in depth, right,

211
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:43,145
multiple mitigations applied against each threat, countermeasures,

212
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:46,244
mitigate the consequence of a successful attack on any one vector.

213
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,395
You know, is the device still protected if the security of one layer of device so

214
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,804
is breached. And a great example of this actually is the chrome web browser, right?

215
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:56,885
Yes, it is. If you pay attention to the the the results of the P

216
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:59,465
to own uh which is a contest run at Cans

217
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,455
West, I want to say by Dragos,

218
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,619
you know, they've been, he's been doing this for like I think about a decade now.

219
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,320
Anyways,

220
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,270
the attacks against

221
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,320
the good web browsers like Chrome are now like

222
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,750
uh what wasn't the the one like 16 stages?

223
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,929
-- Oh It was insane. I know it, it was unbelievable. Yeah.
-- And, and it, and it,

224
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,479
it was, I mean, so for one thing, Chrome has gotten to the point now, yeah,

225
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,599
where to actually go from like

226
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,299
zero to exploit in Chrome requires like over a dozen

227
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,909
attacks and steps, right?

228
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,390
Because yeah, you can totally break this one little thing.

229
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,020
And now you're, you're still in a locked room,

230
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,700
you know, now you got to break into the safe, OK? You got the safe open.

231
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,950
Now there's a locked case,

232
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:41,169
OK? You get the case open and it's full of bees.

233
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:45,250
Chrome is really aggressive about breaking these attack paths,

234
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,919
you know, and hardening, right? Because

235
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,059
oh the other day, it was so funny. I was

236
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,979
somebody submitted a CV U request and as part of the CV request,

237
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,280
they actually included an example of the exploit.

238
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,750
It was a cross site scripting exploit.

239
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,640
And I'm like, oh, that's cute. I, you know, I wonder if it actually works.

240
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,919
So I cut and pasted it into chrome

241
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,849
and I get the sad little dinosaur saying, you know, oh,

242
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,580
it looks like you've basically tried to shoot yourself in the foot with an XSS.

243
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm not going to load that page for you. Sorry.

244
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,299
Oh, nice. Right.

245
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,739
Like it and I was like, oh,

246
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,640
like chrome basically looked at the get request and you know,

247
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,400
the the the XSS string was in the get request.

248
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,419
So it's like even for a human, you look at this and you're like,

249
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,369
oh that's clearly an ex ss attack

250
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,409
and it was like, and chrome was like, nope,

251
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,219
I'm just not going to allow this to happen

252
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,440
because something bad will probably happen if I do.

253
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,969
And I was like, awesome.

254
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,359
And,

255
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:31,640
and you know what I'm going to call out here too

256
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,669
is this is a place I think security has failed historically

257
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,320
is we obsess over the perfect solution

258
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,919
and we'll say things like, oh if, if we do this, we we miss this obscure corner case.

259
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,760
So let's let's do it right. It's like, no, just, just do this

260
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,799
and then do some other things. And when you put them all together.

261
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,919
It's awesome.

262
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,549
I get the fear is you do like a 90% solution and,

263
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,909
and then your manager is like good enough, we're done and you move on.

264
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,739
Well. Right. Don't do that either.

265
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,840
But uh well, even that a 90% solution is better than nothing.

266
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,809
And that's true. Right.

267
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,650
So then the fourth one is again building on this compartmentalization, right?

268
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:12,710
Hardware enforced barriers between software components prevent a

269
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,799
breach in one from propagating to others.

270
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:15,539
So, you know,

271
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,020
does a failure in one component of the device require

272
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,289
a reboot of the entire device to return to operation?

273
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,650
And that, that is something that really got me thinking that question

274
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,109
number one,

275
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,169
how do you find like a fail safe mode?

276
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,169
Like we were discussing this and for a car you pull

277
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,349
over to the side of the road that's pretty safe usually.

278
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,609
But in a plane generally

279
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,070
maybe, you know, with the plane of the less options,

280
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,580
but like what's a fail safe mode for an oil refinery,

281
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,979
I think burst into flames

282
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,469
and, and you know, and especially with IOT stuff like

283
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:48,140
how do I reboot a light bulb

284
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:48,580
well,

285
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,780
or does it just reboot every time I turn it off and

286
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,820
turn it on or does it have a built in battery?

287
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,109
I honestly don't know.

288
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,780
It's a good question. I I can't answer that either.

289
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,729
You know, I would assume because, you know, part of it is I know, you can get

290
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:00,645
to boot real fast.

291
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,914
But at the same time when I turn a light bulb bomb, I want it to turn on, like now,

292
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:05,234
like right now now.

293
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:09,835
So, yeah, this whole hardware enforced barriers between software components

294
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:13,354
and this really again, going, for example, to android, you know, where they,

295
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,905
they've split out the audio system

296
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,184
and they've split out the video system and they've,

297
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:20,244
they've essentially kind of chunked apart the operating system

298
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,195
along sort of hardware lines because,

299
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,840
you know, when you have a web page talking to your sound system, well, you know,

300
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,690
on a traditional PC, that means the sound system is like, you know,

301
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,830
it's running with a high degree of privilege,

302
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,559
-- you know, because it's hardware,
-- I don't feel like that's being done in hardware

303
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,030
in, in many cases.

304
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,190
Well, it's not done in hardware yet, but it's,

305
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,190
it's getting there right with them chunking it apart in software at least,

306
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,799
and having these major subsystems so you can do permissions.

307
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,130
And I assume then the next step is to start, you know, actually having like,

308
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,750
say the sound system, talk to the rest of the system through a more well defined

309
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:55,979
kind of gateway rather than like, oh, you know, direct memory access. Go nuts,

310
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,479
right? Because that's, you know, that's a classic case of D MA, right?

311
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,419
Um With the older Macbook

312
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,130
with the firewire, sorry.

313
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,169
So firewire was amazing and fast because it had D MA direct memory access.

314
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,559
But what this meant is if you had access to the firewire port on any Mac,

315
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,580
you could just suck down the entire contents of memory,

316
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:15,260
like

317
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,020
in a minute.

318
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,890
Right.

319
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,820
Right. With no authentication or anything,

320
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:20,590
you know,

321
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,080
and, and we've seen the same thing with USB. Right.

322
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,580
A lot of USB stuff turns out to have pretty low

323
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,820
level access in the chips and you can subvert them and do bad things

324
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:29,440
and,

325
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,090
and so I think that's something that has to happen

326
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:34,590
because these things have to have ports and I can't

327
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,739
physically secure them necessarily.

328
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,895
Like I'm gonna put like a USB port on something the size of,

329
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:41,515
you know, a pack of cigarettes.

330
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,455
Well, bad example, people don't know what that is anymore.

331
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,244
I'm going to put a USB port on something the size of like

332
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,184
an SSD and like what a giant physical lock on it.

333
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,775
Well, not only that, something that came up,

334
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:55,765
I was joking around with somebody the other day about gluing USB ports

335
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,385
and it occurred to me on, I

336
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:02,695
charge my laptop then. Right on my Macbook. My USB port is my charger.

337
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,005
Like I can't glue that shut. Right.

338
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:07,255
-- I
-- should.

339
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,659
Right.

340
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:10,429
Just one a day.

341
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,789
Apple,

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,140
totally economical.

343
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:18,289
Yeah. No, that's, and that's a great example. Right. Like, yeah, it's,

344
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,299
yeah, you just, you can't do that.

345
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,530
Yeah, I don't know. Anyway.

346
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,559
So the, the, the fifth one is certificate based authentic

347
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,859
authentication.

348
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,169
So, science certificate proven by un forge

349
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,369
cryptographic key

350
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,739
proves the device identity and authenticity.

351
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,700
Uh So does this device use certificates instead of passwords for authentication?

352
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,809
And clearly

353
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,390
that has to happen pretty much globally. And that's actually something

354
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,219
I'll actually be working on with the working group with the cloud security lines.

355
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:45,599
Is this whole keys in the cloud thing,

356
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,609
right? We have to have encryption keys in the cloud.

357
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,900
Well, how do we do that securely? How do we back them up? How do we distribute them?

358
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,510
How do we destroy them?

359
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,159
And then you want to talk about, for example,

360
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:58,190
a uh like a small IOT device that needs

361
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,340
to connect to the mothership to report data like um

362
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,739
a temperature sensor or a thermostat or whatever. Right.

363
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,229
Again, I don't want, you know, somebody monkeying with that.

364
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,070
And so how do we do that? Well, it's going to have to be certificates

365
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,549
and more to the point, you know,

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,469
can that certificate be extracted from that device?

367
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,580
I hope not,

368
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,309
you know. So that means it can't just be on the little storage flash chip.

369
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,190
It has to be like in a security enclave.

370
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:21,580
The, you know,

371
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,479
basically you're gonna have to like scale that chip

372
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:26,169
down in a lab and do all the shenanigans,

373
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,219
you know, to get that certificate and even then it should be a pain in the butt.

374
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,530
Well, and, and look, I mean,

375
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,530
so what you're talking about is the end state, I think.

376
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,000
But I mean, we're not even at a point where certificate

377
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,534
communication is common.

378
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:42,405
It's, it's getting there, there's, for example, go,

379
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:45,284
um, some of the providers are using it internally and it's

380
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:46,994
with software defined perimeter.

381
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,434
It's, that's one of the keystones of the software defined.

382
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:50,094
Right.

383
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,484
So we're getting there

384
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:51,835
for that

385
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,015
and I'm seeing this actually become more and

386
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,734
more of a question where people are essentially saying

387
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,695
we read the Google beyond court paper

388
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,775
and we want to implement that for.

389
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,794
And there's usually, I think two main reasons for wanting to implement that.

390
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,535
Number one, they've realized they can't secure their infrastructure,

391
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,608
they just can't, who knew. And

392
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,848
secondly, then I think a lot of them realize, wait a minute,

393
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,108
if we build a system that can run securely on insecure infrastructure,

394
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,729
we can just dump the sucker into the cloud, be done with it.

395
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,068
That's right. You can.

396
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:25,368
-- So it's starting to happen. Now, the tooling is just not there.
-- It's, it's terrible.

397
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,118
I'm I suffer through this on a daily basis

398
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:30,568
where I'm trying to deal with certificates and it's,

399
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:32,619
I mean, let's encrypt has made,

400
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,329
it's so bad,

401
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:34,939
so

402
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:37,729
-- bad
-- and even the good tools still are,

403
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,770
-- there are no good tools.
-- Well, I'm saying

404
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,689
the tools that are good in our by current standards are

405
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,640
when let me put it this way,

406
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,920
could you know, a new

407
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,400
team member, get up and running with it? The answer is Absolutely. No.

408
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:55,699
No, it's, it's, it's so complicated.

409
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,790
Right. They, they would for sure do it wrong.

410
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:02,699
Even the tools that are out there get so much wrong and it's, it's just

411
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,829
-- the certificates and keys are so hard.
-- I know Windows with active directory

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,319
service. What's a, a active directory server

413
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,469
is starting to do that, like generating client certificates securely, you know,

414
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,770
doing the bit locker, securely sharing the bit locker decryption, you know,

415
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,069
master decryption key with the, the servers securely.

416
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,160
So it's getting there. But

417
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:25,140
what I'm kind of noticing is the only people getting this right are doing like, very,

418
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,699
very kind of closed inclusive systems that like they control,

419
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:31,359
we don't have it.

420
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,390
And so, yeah,

421
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,989
when you talk about certificates doing it within a system is hard enough.

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,300
But

423
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,400
if you want to do it have system A

424
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,869
talk to system B where they're totally different then,

425
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,359
I mean, just abandon all hope.

426
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,290
That's it.

427
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,339
Yeah, pretty much, you know, it's, it's messed up still. Yeah.

428
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,880
But I mean, it's gonna have to happen,

429
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,959
right. I mean,

430
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:53,680
actually on a side note, uh, uh, Firefox and I forget what the other thing was.

431
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:57,719
They're going to start using the, uh, the, the, um, have I been pawned, uh,

432
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:00,219
password database when you, like, enter

433
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,770
password? They

434
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,400
yell at you? Yeah. One password. Yeah, that was it.

435
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,630
So, no, that's awesome.

436
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,410
Well,

437
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,670
especially because that basically takes away like the

438
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,359
500 billion easy passwords that were to remember,

439
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:12,760
you know, and they're all gone now.

440
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:13,979
So

441
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:15,420
I don't know.

442
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,619
Um, so point number six kind of feeds into this is renewable security, right?

443
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,520
Renewal brings the device forward to a secure state and

444
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,760
revokes compromised assets for known vulnerabilities of security breaches.

445
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,199
So is the devices software updated automatically?

446
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,280
So, I mean, this is a perfect example where

447
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,040
um you have a device

448
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:34,599
with a known security flaw

449
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,880
and there's a patch,

450
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,020
how do

451
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,439
you, you know, get that patch installed? So that, that security flaw goes away

452
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,400
and how do you make sure that that patch stays put?

453
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,900
Right. And then I was also thinking again, like,

454
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:51,160
you know, it's, it's sure on a laptop, whatever. It's like, oh, there's an update.

455
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,510
Do you want to do it now or later or tonight or whatever?

456
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
And I'm like, ah, go away, bug me tonight. But, like, for a pacemaker,

457
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,089
like, there's pacemakers out there with Wi Fi, um,

458
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,199
there's the whole ST jude medical device debacle.

459
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,239
You know where

460
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,290
we found a volt it? No, you didn't. Yes, we did. No, you didn't. Yes, we did.

461
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,260
I'm,

462
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,459
I'm gonna stop you because medical devices are going to

463
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,540
-- be special because they're going to be regulated
-- by the,

464
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,359
about your car,

465
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,719
your plane. And,

466
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:18,599
well, so a car and a plane are also going to be regulated. But now

467
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,959
you talk about a phone

468
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,890
who is? Right. Right. Exactly.

469
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,880
Perfect light bulbs who is regulating the light bulbs.

470
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:26,099
Right. What about a light bulb?

471
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,869
Because when I turn my light bulb on, I don't want it to be, like,

472
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,079
not working because it's running an update.

473
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,359
You're getting very animated. It's a light bulb.

474
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,969
You're, you're absolutely right though.

475
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:41,050
Who is going to make a light bulb manufacturer update itself? And I have a suspicion.

476
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,310
The answer is nobody.

477
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,660
This, this comes back to your, your question on Twitter the other day about

478
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,290
why don't dryer vents just have a little sensor in

479
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,989
them that knows when there's a clog in the,

480
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,030
the exhaust.

481
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,790
And, and this is going to be the same deal at light bulbs.

482
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
It's because number one,

483
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,130
the manufacturers don't want to spend an extra $1 on this piece of hardware.

484
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,430
And then there's also the issue of if I have a dryer that

485
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,790
has a sensor on it and it still burns down my house.

486
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,949
Now, I'm going to sue the company for screwing up the sensor, right.

487
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,500
Whereas before it was my fault.

488
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,130
And so we're probably going to see some degree of that.

489
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,189
But most importantly, it's just the fact that

490
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:19,189
if you walk into Costco

491
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,349
and there's one light bulb is $10.01 light bulb is $1.

492
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,000
And the only difference is one has better security. Which one are you going to buy?

493
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:29,439
Probably the cheap one because

494
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:30,689
of course, security is a

495
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,770
-- relative term still, you
-- know, of course, you are. Right.

496
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,599
We're all going to buy the cheap one. Right.

497
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,000
-- And that's just the fact of life.
-- And this is,

498
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,280
you're, you know, one of those, uh,

499
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,369
my favorite story this week is that the US government is having a

500
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,420
hard time sourcing security cameras that don't have chips made in China.

501
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,400
Right.

502
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,099
Like, that's,

503
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,890
you know,

504
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:56,060
and so, especially for security cameras where they're worried, like, because,

505
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,989
you know, security cameras, like, even the cheap ones,

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,500
not like I have a really cheap $200 Chinese security system that included

507
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,729
a camera for 70 bucks that has pen and tilt microphone

508
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,859
and a speaker in it.

509
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,949
You should give me the URL and I'll put it in the shop.

510
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,160
It's called Skylink

511
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:14,579
net.

512
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,069
-- Yeah. Can't make that name up.
-- I

513
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,969
-- was like,
-- no, I mean,

514
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,290
-- give me, give me the UR
-- I don't know,

515
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,390
there's an app

516
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,050
and here's the best part,

517
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,979
there's an app that connects to the mothership

518
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:27,890
that then my video just magically works.

519
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,890
-- I bet that's super secure.
-- No, it's not. Of course not.

520
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,650
But,

521
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,359
but the point is too is that this camera is

522
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:35,849
good enough that you could probably read lips with it.

523
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,380
You know,

524
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,969
that's the thing to remember it is these even

525
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,280
-- cheap cameras now or a couple megapixels
-- right?

526
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,979
Here's what I want you to do. I want you to go buy a reloadable credit card.

527
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,219
Like one of those one use only. I want you to hold it up to the camera

528
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:50,569
and then, like, put like $5 on it,

529
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,530
never use it and see if it ever gets stolen.

530
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:54,239
I'm,

531
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,770
I'm totally serious. You should totally do that.

532
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,550
Like, that's, that's like a def con talk man,

533
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,449
assuming it gets stolen.

534
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:06,219
But yeah, going back to renewable security. The other big question I have

535
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:08,130
from a hardware runner's point of view.

536
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,109
You have to update 10 billion light bulbs with the security patch.

537
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,400
How do you make sure you don't break even a millionth of a percent of them?

538
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,699
You just don't care, don't do it and problem solved. Yeah,

539
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,630
like, like I'm, I'm totally serious when I say that, which is unfortunate.

540
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:24,199
Well, and see, that's what really drives me is, is, you know,

541
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,119
when you do an update of some device

542
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,099
and a human being doesn't kind of keep an eye on it.

543
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,819
Like, because the other day, it's funny. I actually

544
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:33,130
was in the basement and I moved a pile of boxes backwards.

545
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,369
Thought nothing of it went upstairs, went to sleep, woke up in the morning,

546
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,079
went back to the downstairs fridge to grab a pop or whatever.

547
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,520
And the light doesn't work. And I'm like, oh, bloody heck, the light burnt out.

548
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,239
And then I'm like, wait, this fridge has more than one light.

549
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,989
They all burned out at the same time. Huh? That seems improbable.

550
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:50,689
And then I'm like, all right, the power bar for the fridge.

551
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,719
Where's that?

552
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,209
Oh, it's buying these boxes and I, you know,

553
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,160
shove the boxes back and they'd hit the switch and turned it off and,

554
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,010
and did you have like, anything in the fridge?

555
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,439
That? No, because modern fridges are so sealed up that like it was still cold inside.

556
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:02,729
Right.

557
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,739
But the point is like,

558
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,949
that was a minor thing of where I just shoved a pile of boxes back and broke my fridge.

559
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,219
But,

560
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:10,479
you know, if I'm, if someone's installing a software update in my fridge,

561
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:13,119
like you want to baby it to make sure it doesn't die.

562
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,900
So, you know, is my fridge gonna start pinging me?

563
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,560
Like when I open it like, hey, you have an update to install and I'm gonna,

564
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,579
I'm gonna do it right now, like, you know,

565
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,270
hold on and put the milk somewhere safe if this doesn't work.

566
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,939
And there's a ton of IOT devices that are not going to be easily accessible, right?

567
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,739
There's um I was reading a project about they were talking about, you know,

568
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:31,655
building Linux

569
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:34,864
devices that will be literally buried somewhere or at the

570
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,665
bottom of the ocean for 50 to 100 years,

571
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,025
you know, pipeline stuff or communications,

572
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:40,645
right? And it's like, yeah,

573
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:43,505
I read that, you know, a great one is like the, well,

574
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,545
apart from the Hubble space telescope,

575
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:48,084
if your satellite breaks, you can't go fix it,

576
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:50,890
right?

577
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,579
-- Uh
-- No, but, but these systems have so like NASA is

578
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,959
maybe a good or bad example, I can't tell, but we didn't know what the,

579
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:03,030
one of the Mars Rovers had a file system problem, remember?

580
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:06,329
But they, they also had like a fail safe mode built into it.

581
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,569
So they basically re uploaded an operating system on

582
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,339
the fly in the fail-safe mode on another planet.

583
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:13,750
Which again,

584
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,339
a $1 iot light bulb is probably not. The

585
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:17,760
thing is

586
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:18,660
the good

587
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,310
news is we've already got that functionality in most motherboards, right.

588
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,790
Most modern motherboards have the dual bios thing where they have like essentially

589
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,469
two.

590
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,229
As I understand it,

591
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:30,050
either two flash chips or one bigger flash chip that holds two copies of the,

592
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,130
the uh the bios.

593
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,959
And when you update it, it updates one,

594
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,000
you reboot to it. Hopefully it works.

595
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,839
And if it doesn't work, there's like a lower level fail safe.

596
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:41,040
That will be like let you flip back to the known good one

597
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,040
and the good news is storage is cheap now. So that actually I think is a reasonable

598
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,199
approach to this across most devices the cost.

599
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:53,319
But here's the problem across those devices that cost more than a few dollars.

600
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,270
And that's again the

601
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
great and, and here's,

602
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,339
here's what I'm going to say about this list

603
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,469
is

604
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:03,859
everything up to this point

605
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,339
I think is doable without breaking the bank.

606
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,290
And if you stopped before here,

607
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,599
I think you would have,

608
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,640
you'd be 90%

609
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:19,930
you'd be, you'd be at the far, far end of the bell curve way up in the clouds,

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,020
even if you can't install security updates.

611
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,280
If you,

612
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,670
if your communications is relatively secured

613
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,260
and you're communicating with a known trusted

614
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,819
source and you have hardware-based root of trust and all this other stuff.

615
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:35,589
I think this one becomes less important and I think that's going to be the

616
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,109
future is rather than focus on updates for things like a $1 iot light bulb

617
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,199
you focus on just making sure the communications is so secure that even though

618
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,510
this thing can be a steaming pile of garbage from a security perspective,

619
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,829
it won't matter because nobody can get to it.

620
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,160
And that's just the way it's going to have to be,

621
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,050
I suspect because we have sucked at security updates forever

622
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,329
and I don't see us getting better anytime soon.

623
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,939
Well, and more to the point if somebody can physically attack the device and, like,

624
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:01,199
start

625
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,349
deering chips and analyzing them, they'll just, like,

626
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,150
-- dump a cup of water in it.
-- You've lost.

627
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:11,449
Right. It, it's like the old, the old analogy we use around denial of service.

628
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:14,910
You know, if, if I hit my computer with a hammer, I've caused a denial of service.

629
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,930
It's like, yes, but that's not a security issue. You're just an idiot. Right.

630
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,569
So that, yeah, number seven is a doozy and this is, this is like,

631
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,280
people who get here are going to be pretty amazing.

632
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:24,599
It's

633
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:25,760
failure report.

634
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,390
-- And really,
-- I would have switched seven and eight because I think the last one

635
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,599
is something we can do with

636
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:36,319
or six and seven, either 123457, I can't count

637
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,420
six and 77 is I think more important than six.

638
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,699
Well, no, to me,

639
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:46,739
explain it please to the audience before we continue this conversation.

640
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,739
Number seven is failure reporting a software failure such

641
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,339
as a buffer overrun induced by an attacker,

642
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:54,589
probing security is reported to cloud based failure analysis system.

643
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,900
So does this device report failure to its manufacturer?

644
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,750
So I just before we get into that,

645
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
I would say number six is more important than number seven

646
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,699
because number seven doesn't matter if you can't actually get an update

647
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,949
-- installed properly.
-- Not, not entirely.

648
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:07,430
So

649
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,599
number seven is super important, I think because yeah,

650
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:11,239
like are people attacking us?

651
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,439
How are they attacking us? What is the attack? Ok.

652
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:17,199
You know, a great example of this being is what about every I'm going to say

653
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,150
quarter?

654
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,420
It feels like there's a Adobe zero day,

655
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,319
an Adobe flash zero date in the wild

656
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:26,319
about what quarterly, every twice a year or something like that,

657
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:27,599
you know,

658
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,430
and and essentially the way from what I can tell the way

659
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,359
it usually kind of happens is a bunch of people get popped

660
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,130
their A V reports back to the A V mothership.

661
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,880
Hey, you know, this computer is now running a crypto miner something went wonky.

662
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,640
You know, they do a bit of analysis.

663
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,280
Oh, they're all running this version of flash or older then? Ok.

664
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,709
You know, go grab the content, look at it. Oh, boom. We got another zero day flash.

665
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,469
Go tell Adobe

666
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:52,819
they fix it and it just a couple of times a year. That's how that works.

667
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,900
And that needs to be automated and fast.

668
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,479
Yes. Yes, it does.

669
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,790
But when you're dealing with things that have something like,

670
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,819
say a hardware based root of trust and certificates and,

671
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,599
and proper segmentation of resources,

672
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:09,089
now we've reached a point where and this isn't even important just for security.

673
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:13,119
It's the fact that when we know the device is misbehaving in some way,

674
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,489
we can tell someone something is going wrong.

675
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,930
And I would, I would say that is far more doable than secure updates, right?

676
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm not, I'm not saying it's less important or more important.

677
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,349
I'm just saying in, in the context of something we can accomplish,

678
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,520
we can accomplish this.

679
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,369
-- We can't accomplish consistent security updates.
-- The secure updates thing has

680
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,459
largely been,

681
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,979
how do I put, I don't want to say theoretically solved, but it's,

682
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:39,989
it's actually been like there's the tour updater, you know,

683
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,640
uh tough the Tor

684
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,270
update framework, right? Which go read the paper.

685
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,300
Uh it,

686
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,479
they, they went into like all the failure modes and address them, right?

687
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:50,670
Um

688
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:51,949
And there's some

689
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,280
modes you can't address, like say a freeze attack So if you have an IOT device.

690
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,359
Oh, a perfect example.

691
00:29:56,469 --> 00:30:01,040
All the water meters in Edmonton here have been replaced by wireless ones so that,

692
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,939
you know, they can read your water meter wirelessly.

693
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,300
Right. Saves money.

694
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,579
And I'm assuming if I wrap it in enough tinfoil they can't read it.

695
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,439
And also thus by extension, it, you know,

696
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:13,319
wouldn't be able to get software updates assuming it does.

697
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:17,319
Which, well, I think we all know it doesn't. So certain types of attacks

698
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,319
against

699
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,839
updating software will always be possible, right?

700
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,459
-- You just wrap the device in enough tinfoil. Ok. No,
-- no, no, no,

701
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:26,520
no. II, I think we're talking about two different things.

702
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,920
A malicious attacker will always be able to prevent software updates.

703
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm willing to say that right.

704
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,709
I'm not talking about malicious Attackers.

705
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:38,119
I'm just talking about the fact that when you install updates of any sort,

706
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,180
some percentage of devices will be bricked,

707
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,680
right? That is the, the honest rea not potentially guaranteed it happens. Right?

708
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,479
And so when you have a fleet of a trillion iot light bulbs,

709
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,739
if even a fraction of a fraction of a percent of them gets bricked,

710
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,119
that's real money.

711
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,660
-- So you're just never gonna do it,
-- but that's already uh you know,

712
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,050
light bulbs used to burn out all the time.

713
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,619
Remember?

714
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:06,180
And people were ok with that, like our fridge, our fridge just stopped making cold.

715
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:09,020
It still makes cold but not enough cold to freeze the freezer

716
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,579
and not enough cold to keep the milk cold,

717
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:14,739
except if that happens a week after you buy it,

718
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,739
they're going to have to give you a new one.

719
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,089
Right. There are certain consumer protections here that, that kick in

720
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,020
the rules are different for a lot of this stuff.

721
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:27,199
Right. And same thing with a $1 light bulb. Even though it costs a dollar,

722
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,670
-- you can't just say, oh, ha, ha, sorry. It's two hours old, tough
-- luck.

723
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,589
But something to keep in mind is there's certain types

724
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,920
of devices that where the consumer will demand updates.

725
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,250
So, medical devices, for example, you know, pla

726
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,329
-- software. No,
-- you can't talk about medical devices.

727
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:45,479
You talk about fridges and light bulbs. That's what we're talking about.

728
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,550
Stop going back to the things that matter.

729
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,030
Well, and we've already done this with cars, right.

730
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,989
-- We've already seen this with cars where people have had
-- cars are regulated.

731
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,910
You can't talk about cars, light bulbs and refrigerators.

732
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,550
That's all you get to talk about here.

733
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,920
Well, what's interesting is I know in Europe there's some, you know,

734
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,989
much stronger consumer protection laws where you can, like,

735
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,819
return stuff after I think, what is it?

736
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,680
One or two or up to one or two years.

737
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,300
And so Apple especially was,

738
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:10,739
it's a couple of years.

739
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,709
Um, but

740
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:12,189
yeah,

741
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:15,900
so, no, I think this list of seven things is actually

742
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:20,810
largely correct. And yeah, like if anybody were ever to actually achieve this list.

743
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:21,300
I

744
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,369
would be in awe of them.

745
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:24,739
It'd be great. I agree.

746
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,939
So, like the other problem is, well, just,

747
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,420
we already have that with S Os Report and other things in Linux.

748
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,270
But the problem I see is there's just so many false positives and,

749
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,219
and that's part of the

750
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:34,420
chin.

751
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,739
So, and that's something to keep in mind with, with some of these um,

752
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,410
security measures

753
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,989
is you have to implement it in a way where dealing with it is still economical and,

754
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,310
and that makes it even harder.

755
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,920
Yep. Yep. Definitely,

756
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:49,680
definitely,

757
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,780
we'll figure it out.

758
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,479
Let's just use A I in the Blockchain and that, that should take care of it. Right.

759
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,089
Problem solved.

760
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,630
