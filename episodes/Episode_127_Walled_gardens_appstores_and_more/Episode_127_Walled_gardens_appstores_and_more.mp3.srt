Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 127

1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,710
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,220
-- What's
-- new man?

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,780
We've had beautiful snow and the skiing is great.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,639
Yeah, that's fair

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,889
because you live way up north. So we,

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,760
yeah, where, where I live, which I'm obviously fairly far north in the US.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,829
We've had some ice and that's pretty much it. We've had no real snow at all.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,020
So it's just rotten out.

9
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,659
We had ice last week. We actually had freezing rain on Friday

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,369
and that was not super awesome.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,189
But now we've had about three inches of just delightfully fluffy snow.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,029
And like I said, the skiing is just

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,889
my son actually fell because he caught an edge

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,669
because he's never skied on proper snow before.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,400
He's only ever skied on like machine groomed,

16
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,990
you know. So it's like skiing on a Teflon frying pan, right?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,709
Which, you know, better than nothing. But

18
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:52,430
yeah.

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,520
So he was taking a turn and caught an edge and spun around and he was like,

20
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:57,419
just the look of confusion on his face.

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,740
Right.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,790
We had a little talk about powder.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,069
So, yeah, for those. Anyways. Um,

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,910
so the other thing that's come up in a couple of things is the, um,

25
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,449
Mozilla has been removing some extensions.

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,879
-- Yeah, I saw that you sent me that story. That's wild
-- and not for the usual reason.

27
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,120
Like they're malicious and terrible in stealing people's banking details,

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,839
which I'm ok when they remove those extensions, like that's

29
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:26,059
fine.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,739
You know,

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,919
you can, you can throw plaguy people off the boat. That's cool.

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,010
You know.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,709
Right.

34
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,269
-- I think, I think you're a witch. Right. Let's
-- just

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:37,819
see

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:37,980
if

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,059
you are a witch and if you drowned. Well,

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,360
you a

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,860
good death.

40
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,069
Oh, well,

41
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,150
sorry about that.

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,830
Right.

43
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:50,550
But, uh, no, they, they have removed apparently a whole bunch of paywall bypasses.

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,010
So we should all right. So, first of all, I guess, uh, what is a paywall bypass?

45
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,260
Let's, let's start there.

46
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:01,449
So a paywall is essentially a website that says, uh, you want to look at our content,

47
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,099
you got to pay.

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,980
There's a wall literally of you having to pay to look at the content.

49
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,980
So there's a bunch of newspapers and stuff that do this

50
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:13,699
and a paywall bypass is something that makes your web browser look different.

51
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,919
Um, so for example, it like makes you look like a Google search spot or, you know,

52
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,139
other things that these websites will allow to scrape their

53
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:23,408
website and look at their website without paying or,

54
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,009
-- you know,
-- it's really

55
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,919
sad. And some of them even is, I've seen some of those paywall bypasses.

56
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,369
They just, there's

57
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,770
so they load the article and then they load javascript that opens

58
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,259
up the paywall box and they just don't load the javascript.

59
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,729
And it's like,

60
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,300
that is insane. That is the dumbest way to do that.

61
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah.

62
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,240
When I'm on like a slow link where, yeah, the web page pops up and I'm like, oh, sweet.

63
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,789
-- And that gets covered by something. And I'm like,
-- oh,

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,690
-- I know, I hate that. So
-- yeah, you could easily block that with no script or something.

65
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,300
But you know,

66
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,770
you'd have to hunt around the interface

67
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,289
figuring out which element to actually block.

68
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,029
Whereas with these paywall blockers, they,

69
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:59,220
you know, like ad blockers, they've, they've found the quote on whatever it is.

70
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,789
I don't want to call it bad stuff, but they found the paywall stuff and blocked it

71
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,520
or, you know, they pretend to be a Google search bot

72
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,880
or they sometimes they can monkey with the refer header or whatever.

73
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:11,139
And so they blocked these things

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,130
and it's not

75
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,130
100% clear as to

76
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,740
why apparently one of the community reviewers removed it from

77
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,169
the store claiming it violated the terms of service,

78
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,940
which doesn't sound very legit, to be honest.

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,479
Uh Maybe, I mean, so look, I, I think you can easily say that

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,910
a paywall remover is potentially,

81
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,479
it might not be legal, but it's definitely ethically questionable. We'll say

82
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,080
yes, and no, I mean,

83
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,279
so having said that there's,

84
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,539
I would say part of it depends on how you're bypassing the paywall blocker, right?

85
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,639
For example, if you're using stolen credentials,

86
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,070
you know, and,

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,750
and accessing somebody's else account who is

88
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,070
allowed to access the paywall blocker.

89
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,979
-- Well, that, that's illegal.
-- That, yeah, exactly.

90
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,419
I was gonna say like so on the scale of from black to white that, that's black.

91
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,259
But for example, the paywall is like you said,

92
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,979
say a javascript box that pops up and blocks your

93
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:09,970
visual field of view.

94
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,929
Well, what if I'm running a web browser that has javascript disabled,

95
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,369
like completely disabled?

96
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,200
Like I'm running E links for the sake of argument.

97
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,079
You know, I'm on a text session just for the sake of argument. We 10 years back in the f

98
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,649
well, 20 years back in the future,

99
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,910
am I doing something unethical by running a

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,559
web browser that maybe doesn't even support javascript,

101
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,579
right? How am I supposed to even know that there's a paywall blocker there?

102
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:29,899
You know,

103
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,589
or somebody's running no script with the default

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,570
of having it disabled javascript everywhere and they

105
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,420
selectively enable it on their bank and some other sites they need to use it.

106
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,059
Are they doing something ethical and immoral?

107
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:46,190
Yeah, I would, it's, it's super gray, right? I, I would, I would say no, probably

108
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,470
to me at that point it's like walking out of the room when a commercial plays on TV.

109
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,690
Right. Exactly. Which I think someone tried to say it was illegal once,

110
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,649
-- which is crazy.
-- Well, illegal or moral or whatever. And it's like, yeah, no, too bad.

111
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,750
I get to control goes on my eyeballs to some degree.

112
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,410
So I think we can definitely agree. There's on, it's, it,

113
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:06,570
there's details, sometimes the details matter,

114
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,130
but let's just say generally speaking,

115
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,029
it's

116
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,179
not illegal behavior

117
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:12,670
usually.

118
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:12,940
Uh,

119
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,459
and it's typically not also completely clean

120
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,809
because typically these people kind of,

121
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,269
you know,

122
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,790
it's like when you tell a little line, you kind of giggle internally, right?

123
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,579
You know, you're doing something naughty,

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,000
but

125
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,329
on the scale of naughtiness, it's,

126
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,230
I would say it's not as bad as say, using your, you know,

127
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,600
phone while making a left hand turn and eating a sandwich.

128
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,799
Sure.

129
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,200
And, and I would, I would view it as it's,

130
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,399
it's maybe somewhat comparable to fast forwarding through commercials

131
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,989
when you're watching your DV. I Right. It's definitely

132
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,130
extremely minor,

133
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,399
-- but the problem is when you automate it and make it easily available and
-- that's

134
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,959
fair.

135
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,420
That's, you know, because the thing, it's like, it's like ad blocking,

136
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,899
if only like 1/10 of a percent of people are doing ad blockers,

137
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,299
whatever we can live with that.

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,160
But, you know, for example, what if somebody,

139
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,750
oh OK, let's say for the sake of argument,

140
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,519
let's say Microsoft starts shipping all copies of windows

141
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,359
with built with a built in ad blocker,

142
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,070
didn't Apple talk about doing this

143
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,390
-- with
-- Safari.

144
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,910
They sort of have they, with the tracking and the,

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,859
some other stuff to make sort of the,

146
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,950
it's more the malicious behaviors of some of these ads that are being blocked.

147
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,709
So, like the legitimate stuff is still ok.

148
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,549
Right. But regardless, let's just say for the sake of argument that,

149
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,640
well, let's say for the sake of argument, Microsoft

150
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,459
Apple and Google. Right. Those are the three people with

151
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,230
and let's say Mozilla as well.

152
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,290
Those are the basically between those four web browsers,

153
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,910
you're like 99% of the market,

154
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,549
you know, outside of China.

155
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,649
And let's say, by default, they all start blocking ads.

156
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,950
Well, for example,

157
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,820
Google has to hire a bunch of lawyers to

158
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,769
sue everybody because they're going to go bankrupt,

159
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,049
right? Like something like 90% of Google's revenue is from ads.

160
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:48,339
Uh

161
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,470
-- Yeah, it's huge, it's huge.
-- So if that revenue goes to zero,

162
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,429
you know, they're going to get a little grouchy.

163
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,269
So

164
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,109
that's part of the problem is, is where this becomes easily available.

165
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,070
You know, it's like the difference between,

166
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,690
remember when people were trading MP threes via use net versus Napster, right?

167
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,119
Everybody could use Napster, your mom could use Napster,

168
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,980
right? And that's when the music industry came down on it like a sack of hammers.

169
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,200
If you really do want to put up a paywall, then put up a paywall that works and isn't

170
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,420
trivially bypassed by for example,

171
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,899
blocking javascript because I have a hard time

172
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,779
feeling a lot of sympathy for somebody who

173
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,609
kind of puts up, uh,

174
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:26,220
they want to accomplish something and they use a very weak technical measure.

175
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,040
Like,

176
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,820
you know, it's like all those pictures of, um,

177
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:30,910
where they have like a locked gate with no fence

178
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,549
around it and people just walk around the gate.

179
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:33,869
Yes,

180
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,910
-- that's, that's fantastic.
-- It chews up the grass and it's not good for the grass.

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,100
But at the same time, I have a hard time.

182
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,399
Any sympathy for the guy that owns that gate is like,

183
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,959
ok, so I, I guess let's do this.

184
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:44,980
I,

185
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:50,799
I think we can Hammon haw over the ethical implications of removing a paywall with,

186
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,170
with a script, bypassing the pay

187
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,269
and that's fair, bypassing it. So let, let's go up a level though and talk about

188
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,260
the,

189
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,100
the concept of a walled garden where Mozilla

190
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:04,140
essentially gets to decide what is in or out

191
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,890
of there. I, I would, I can we even call it an app store?

192
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,089
-- I don, I don't know what you'd call it necessarily. Well,
-- it's a free app store.

193
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,220
-- Yeah, I guess we should, we could call it an app store. That's
-- fair.

194
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:17,250
There's free apps on the Google Play store in the Apple store.

195
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,410
So, yeah, I, so, ok, let's

196
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,679
ok. So first of all, what is a walled garden in this context?

197
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,269
In, in, well, in really any context?

198
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,980
I think that the fundamental concept of a walled garden.

199
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:28,880
And we'll, we'll pick,

200
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,910
I'm going to pick on apple because I think they have the largest and most famous

201
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,619
when you buy an I device, iphone, ipad. I think that might be it. Um Anyway, I buy this.

202
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,159
I,

203
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,210
yes,

204
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,030
those did not have wall gardens.

205
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,250
But anyway, I've got my iphone.

206
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,330
-- I can only install apps. No,
-- by default on the mac.

207
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,080
Now, you cannot install apps from 30 party developers.

208
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,169
Remember you have to go into your settings, security settings and a lot of

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,630
apps from unknown,

210
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,559
a little more difficult and that's fair. But that's, that's, we'll get to that.

211
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,440
That's I think if we had a sliding scale of no app store to app store,

212
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,919
the, the imac or the imac, what have you done to me?

213
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,169
The,

214
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,559
the ipad and the iphone are on the very far end where you can only install the apps in

215
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,719
the Apple app store and that is it Apple gets to decide what goes in what doesn't go in

216
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:20,950
and all of that,

217
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,390
they completely control their walled garden.

218
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,960
And I guess also it should be pointed out the, the, the term walled garden

219
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,510
comes from way back in the day

220
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,119
in, in Europe. They will say uh not poor people.

221
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,940
They, they lived generally with houses that would have like a garden in the middle

222
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,580
and they made sure nobody could get in unless you live there

223
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,409
because they didn't want to have to congregate with the common folk.

224
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,099
Right? And so the basic idea with this is

225
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,739
Apple only gets to let in the people it wants

226
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,409
into its magic little garden and the rest of you

227
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:55,049
-- screw off. You don't belong here is the idea.
-- Yeah.

228
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,359
Well, and you have a curated garden. It's nice. It's clean.

229
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,010
People aren't stomping all over it and, like putting weeds in there.

230
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,010
Part of me says that's ok because like, how,

231
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,409
how much malware do you hear about on iphones and ipads?

232
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:09,609
Well, exactly. Very, very little.

233
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,750
-- There. There's almost none. There
-- are malicious apps.

234
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,289
Uh,

235
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,679
my favorite being a new scam where basically it's

236
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,200
like a calorie counter or some sort of app

237
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,859
that convinces you that you need to hold your

238
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,299
thumb onto the fingerprint scanner for like 10 seconds.

239
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:23,239
So they can like, calibrate your calorie

240
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,460
sweat counter or whatever thing.

241
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:29,770
And of course, then it pops up an in app purchase for like 100 $200.

242
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:34,020
And if you're holding your, your finger, you know, a finger that's registered to,

243
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,260
you know, activate the device then and you have the, um,

244
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,900
and I think by default that you, you do allow when you have in app purchases,

245
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,940
you can use your thumbprint to activate it by default.

246
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,289
Bam you just bought, you know, one or 200 bucks worth of, well, garbage

247
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,679
in app purchases. Right.

248
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,219
-- Yeah.
-- But I assume you can

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,940
get your money back. Right.

250
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,010
-- Oh, yeah.
-- Well, but, you know, that's assuming you even notice this happened.

251
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,119
Well, and that's true.

252
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,280
These guys only, you know,

253
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,679
need a couple dozen people to not notice and they're swimming in gravy.

254
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,039
Let's think about our,

255
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,969
our sliding scale now and let's move down a little

256
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,299
bit and let's talk about the Android App store,

257
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,080
which I think is a little bit more wild west.

258
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,830
It's similar to the way the Macbooks work. Now,

259
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,780
-- the problem is there's more than one Android
-- App

260
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:15,109
store.

261
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:18,059
No, we're just going to focus on the real one. None of this stupid garbage.

262
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,700
All right, we're going to say Google, when you're running an Android phone, you're,

263
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,760
you're using the Google App Store

264
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:29,619
and by default, you can only install applications from Google, however you can go in

265
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,359
or I shouldn't say from Google, from the Google App Store, we'll say right.

266
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:36,380
And again, Google has a very similar model to Apple where they control what's in,

267
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,080
they control what's out and, and you got to play by their rules.

268
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,359
However, on Android phones,

269
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,909
you have the ability to go into the

270
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,539
settings and say allow applications from unknown sources.

271
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,869
And that then lets me install the app application.

272
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,859
And the best example of this on Android is Fortnite,

273
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,880
which is an insanely popular first person shooter and a lot of fun, by the way,

274
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,429
I just looked

275
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:57,929
100

276
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,390
and 25 million Fortnite players globally up to 8 million concurrently.

277
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,289
-- Yeah,
-- that's crazy. Right.

278
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,960
But anyway,

279
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,559
you can install the Fortnite app in Android,

280
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,830
but you have to get it from them because they don't want to pay Google

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,580
the because obviously, like for example, the Fortnite app in the Apple app store,

282
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,599
Apple takes like a what?

283
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,239
20% cut, I think or something

284
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:18,809
there.

285
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,159
That's a lot of money,

286
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,919
right?

287
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:24,960
And so Epic is a company that makes Fortnite and Epic basically said on Android,

288
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:26,150
we don't want to pay Google.

289
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,489
So here are the instructions to essentially,

290
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,080
you know, turn on untrusted apps and install our app on your phone, which

291
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:33,760
like

292
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:39,119
Fortnite from Epic Games on the app store is free in app purchases.

293
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,429
Well, yeah, the app is free.

294
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,049
But then you buy your loot boxes and skins and all that other crap.

295
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:47,590
-- Oh, so the gambling part,
-- basically gambling. Yes, essentially. And,

296
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,159
and of course, like my freaking kids, man,

297
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,340
they spent a small fortune on this garbage and like I play and I,

298
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,510
I

299
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,729
forget they have a name they give to people who just use a default skin.

300
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:00,440
And I said like I don't even care what I look like it literally from, from,

301
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,520
but you think when we grew up playing video games,

302
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,960
you didn't get to change what you looked like.

303
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:05,469
So I don't, I don't even care.

304
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:09,530
Right? But to them like you have to look cool when you're playing this game or you suck

305
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,869
and for me it's like

306
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:15,429
-- whatever,
-- one thing that's always sold is personalization. Right? Anything cars.

307
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,000
There's that Sketcher. Uh, what is it?

308
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,650
I forget which, uh,

309
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,030
Converse store I think in San Francisco where you can get a custom pair made,

310
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,909
like in the afternoon.

311
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,309
Right. You get to choose everything.

312
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,299
It's not cheap but customization of your stuff.

313
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:30,469
That's always, that's been a, you know, that is a hell of a valid business model.

314
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,119
That's fair.

315
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,239
Well, I guess I could pick on my laptop,

316
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,260
like my laptop looks like a NASCAR car full of stickers.

317
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,890
And I only put on the companies I like or the projects I like.

318
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,684
So. But anyway, anyway,

319
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,554
so the point is an Android, it is a, it is,

320
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,135
we'll say a walled garden but anyone inside can open the gate, right?

321
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:49,335
Well, we kind of put it that way

322
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,815
you can with a device, it's easy to enable side loading,

323
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:56,205
right? Like loading from whatever you want

324
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:59,799
and yeah, and on and on iphones and I devices

325
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,380
theoretically you can sort of enable sideloading using, you know, for example,

326
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,150
the developer stuff where you can build an app and have up to 100 people install it,

327
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,950
you know, whatever.

328
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,239
-- But yeah, it's, it's super nontrivial and
-- the bar is amazingly high.

329
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,325
I would say it is not attainable for normal people,

330
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,575
-- whereas Android has made it possible for normal people,
-- right?

331
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,465
I looked into it and I can't even be bothered I'm like I could do this.

332
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:27,005
-- But, oh, man, it potentially I might screw my phone up completely.
-- Right. Exactly.

333
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,275
Yes. Now you own a brick, well done. Ok.

334
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:33,125
So we'll keep moving on our scale and now we'll get to, we'll say kind of

335
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:36,494
the Windows World, which it's a little better, but basically

336
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:40,625
-- there's not really an app store they do. It sucks. What
-- do you mean? Not really an app?

337
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:41,844
Have you used Windows? 10?

338
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,780
It comes with apps installed by default that when you click on them, it's like,

339
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,419
oh,

340
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,599
you have this thing sort of installed but you need to like pony

341
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:51,559
up a credit card number if you actually want to use it.

342
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,090
-- I try really hard not to use it to be fair.
-- I

343
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,580
like as much as I hate on Microsoft sometimes

344
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:01,719
the experience of Microsoft office 365 now, you know,

345
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:05,880
I needed to do some powerpoint slides for RSA a year or two ago and like

346
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,659
they were screwed up in every app.

347
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:11,429
So I went and bought, you know, powerpoint or office or whatever.

348
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,679
It was like 100 bucks for a five user license for

349
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,429
one year with a terabyte of storage on Microsoft Onedrive.

350
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,349
So not a bad deal.

351
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,799
But the beauty is literally you just download the app, install it and it's like, hi,

352
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:22,919
I'm in demo model.

353
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:26,200
Do you want to use me or do you want to like, buy me and to buy me, like,

354
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,400
you just activate it and it's like, oh, if you've already, you know,

355
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,309
if you basically own a copy, just log in with your Microsoft account.

356
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,549
So I log in, you know, with my

357
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,179
email and password and it's like, ok, cool. You're legit now. Like that's it. Boom.

358
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,104
The full version. It is so painless and easy.

359
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:40,744
And do you remember what buying software used to be like?

360
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:43,864
-- And I'm not even counting like where you had to go to a store and get C
-- DS.

361
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,434
It's still like that in a lot of cases though where like fundamentally

362
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,945
in the Windows world,

363
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,395
I think there's still very much an expectation of you download

364
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,484
something off the internet or God forbid you buy a CD,

365
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:59,804
but you acquire an executable, you run it and it installs itself.

366
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:04,724
And really this is why the Microsoft world was just a cesspool of viruses for so long

367
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:07,280
because that is how it worked. And,

368
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,349
-- and the thing is like, you look at
-- run dancing hamster dot A

369
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:10,820
XC,

370
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,940
totally not a virus dot exe Exactly.

371
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,609
So, and here's the thing though, you look at

372
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,369
the apple ecosystem versus the the Old Windows ecosystem.

373
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,880
I'll say then like a good example is the surface that you can buy a surface.

374
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,320
Now that's like totally locked down and that's awesome, right?

375
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,239
-- I Totally
-- Windows 10 by default.

376
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,630
Now defaults to only allowing stuff from the Microsoft

377
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,919
App store and you can unlock it easily.

378
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,900
Right. It's too easy to unlock. But I think they know if they made it too,

379
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,989
-- people would like revolt.
-- Well, it's not that they would revolt.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,099
-- They would incur support costs, which would be annoying.
-- Right. Right.

381
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:50,159
And, and so anyway, the point is when you have that, that ecosystem, I think you,

382
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,099
you have to make some considerations.

383
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:55,409
Do we want to make, our users will say more safe?

384
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,059
And I'm sure I'm going to get arguments against that.

385
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,039
But, but we'll say more safe versus more empowered.

386
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:02,599
I wouldn't say it's making them more safe.

387
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,699
I would say it's, let's maybe take away some of the sharp edges,

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,579
let's take away some of the potentially dangerous behaviors by default.

389
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,270
See, and originally, remember we were maybe going to have like a devil's advocate,

390
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,848
walled versus non walled gardens.

391
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,050
And the thing I sort of keep coming back to is

392
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,380
I think by default, it's

393
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,339
good to take away some of the sharp edges,

394
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:24,819
especially because there's a lot of people out there.

395
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,410
But my favorite is every time I go to the

396
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,459
apple store to get something fixed because it's really broken.

397
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:31,729
Like the speaker on my phone broke and I ended up having to, you know,

398
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,020
replace it like with a refurb because they couldn't even,

399
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,020
they replace the part and it still didn't work.

400
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,109
But I was sitting at this table and these people were fetching and complaining

401
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,689
number one, they hadn't made an appointment at the Apple store that don't do that,

402
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:46,170
don't go to the Apple store and then say, like, I'm here and I have a broken device

403
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,489
and they'll be like, great. We'll see you in like six days or hours or whatever.

404
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,219
Number two.

405
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:55,219
It was funny because the guy, you know, of course, when he's like, oh, you know, we,

406
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:57,579
we can do a phone refurb and I'm like, yeah, sweet, let's do that.

407
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:59,040
And he's like, oh, have you, have you backed up all your data?

408
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,810
And I'm like, yeah, of course,

409
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,979
I bloody well have and I factory wiped it before I brought it in here because like I

410
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,520
did. Exactly. And this lady sitting at my table looked at me and she's like,

411
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,020
you can back up your phone

412
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:09,989
and I'm like, oh, sweet Jiminy.

413
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,290
And the guy looks at me and looks at her and he's like, yeah, yeah,

414
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,689
you can back up your phone and she's like, how do you do it?

415
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,160
And I'm like,

416
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,560
you log into it

417
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,339
and then she looks at me

418
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,420
and I'm like,

419
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:23,359
yeah, I don't think there's a step two is there and I look at the guy and he's like, no,

420
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,550
no, I'm not by default.

421
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,300
Right? That's it. You just, you log into it.

422
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,369
But here, here's the thing,

423
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,239
I guess that that is another consideration here

424
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,979
is when you're in that apple like universe.

425
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,170
And I would also lump, we'll put game consoles in here as well.

426
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,099
You basically have one supplier of all this stuff

427
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,310
and they have like an insane amount of control.

428
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,130
And so basically you do it their way or screw you,

429
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,790
you lose like there's absolutely no options.

430
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,680
Right. Whereas then you look at kind of the Microsoft way and now you have

431
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,459
uh a bit of a commodity environment, it is less expensive, but as we've seen,

432
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,270
it comes with

433
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,910
a certain amount of risk as well.

434
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,579
But you also have large companies doing dumb stuff like installing spyware

435
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,290
and

436
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,369
on the laptops that they're selling by default.

437
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,439
I think that's one area where I really appreciate what Google is trying to do,

438
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,869
which is Google is from what I've seen trying to get

439
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,890
as many manufacturers as possible, sort of onto a stock Android

440
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,199
that will actually get updates, not some customized, you know, version of like, uh,

441
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,709
I don't even know if LG makes their own Android os.

442
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,579
But for the sake of argument, you know, like LG Android,

443
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,439
which is like slightly modified or whatever.

444
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,300
-- Yeah, I mean, they're, they're,
-- well, for example, I bought a Verizon,

445
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,339
uh Android phone that was unlocked for 100 bucks, you know,

446
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,680
so my son can start having a phone.

447
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,420
Uh, and it's, it's, you know, it's running some really ancient version of Android.

448
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,880
It's um, like two or three versions old and it, I, I can't update that

449
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,079
fully

450
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,859
and it's got like an NFL app.

451
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,359
And some other stuff installed on it that I cannot remove.

452
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,160
You can't, you can't remove them. I know it. It's super annoying.

453
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,270
Like I don't know if they're running

454
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,430
a

455
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:58,469
custom Android Os or just they're running an Android Os that's been locked down.

456
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,199
Don't know, don't care. It's a garbage experience.

457
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,109
So, so the way it works is in,

458
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,239
in the carrier world and this is where I give Apple a lot of credit,

459
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,640
but I think only Apple can do this.

460
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,560
So like for example, you want Verizon to sell your phone.

461
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,000
Verizon says great, we'll do it.

462
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,719
But you've got to put all this crap on it before we sell it and then they cave in and

463
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,213
do it. You end up with all this trash. Whereas Apple was like,

464
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,753
no, if you're selling the iphone, you're selling our iphone.

465
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,353
If you want something else to F

466
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:26,703
-- and B like you're doing it
-- our way. That's fundamentally. Apple is a luxury brand.

467
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,483
I, I, I do agree.

468
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:31,772
You know, they, they had their brief experimentation with their iphone five C,

469
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:34,402
you know, the cheap color ones and you'll notice that they, they just,

470
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:35,733
I want one so bad.

471
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:36,753
They don't do that anymore.

472
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,322
-- Well, that's what I like.
-- My phone is like,

473
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:39,762
I,

474
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:42,902
I bought a pixel. No. Well, no. Right.

475
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:45,593
No, but the se sucks because they haven't updated it in like six years,

476
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:48,625
whatever it works, it's got a thumbprint scanner. That's all I care about.

477
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,605
So my kid doesn't shoulder surf my pin.

478
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:50,946
-- I,
-- I,

479
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:55,036
I want an se that is fast because all like

480
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,916
every phone on the market today is a monstrosity.

481
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,936
I hate them all. And I bought a pixel

482
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:05,115
and it's way too big. But like after doing more research than I want to pretend I did

483
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:09,615
uh basically for, for price size and what you get inside,

484
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,426
like the pixel is basically the, the nexus point of all those things today,

485
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,026
but it's still way bigger than I want

486
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,910
or no a pixel pixel, not nexus,

487
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,150
they call it a pixel. I don't

488
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,579
know. I said, I said the word nexus

489
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,589
used to be called the nexus.

490
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,150
It's also the nexus of all those points of interaction that you want.

491
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:29,000
Right. Right. So anyway, anyway, so here's the question though.

492
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,839
So is what Mozilla did and,

493
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,719
and now that we've kind of laid some of the

494
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,640
foundation behind the concept of walled garden and Mozilla is currently

495
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,790
more towards apple if we think about walled gardens than towards Microsoft.

496
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
And it used to be a little different because it used to be,

497
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,510
you could just install like random garbage as add ons anytime you wanted.

498
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:53,739
And and that's been done away with a little bit because obviously

499
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,569
that is dangerous because people were installing garbage that was dangerous,

500
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,109
right.

501
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:03,869
So, so the question becomes, is it OK for Mozilla an open source project

502
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,160
to, to kind of have this. Trust us. Wink, wink attitude.

503
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,030
I, I think so because one aspect of this is by definition, the people,

504
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,449
these people who install these garbage

505
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,880
add-ons tend to then blame the sort of underlying operating system or, or,

506
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,349
or software like Mozilla for when things go

507
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,959
wrong because they're not sophisticated enough to understand.

508
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,089
No, you install some,

509
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:28,550
like random junk off of some random website that that's what broke your,

510
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,270
your machine.

511
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,469
And again, this kind of goes back to that whole removing sharp edges.

512
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,589
I'm basically, I'm ok with sort of removing the sharp edges from stuff.

513
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,030
As long as you still allow

514
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,989
the more sophisticated people a way to then go in and be like, no, no, no.

515
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,829
I really do want to take the safety guard off this thing because, you know,

516
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,750
then we can run it 10 times faster and if you use a hockey stick to push the wooden

517
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,430
and not your hand, you'll be fine.

518
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:53,849
Right.

519
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,130
You know what I mean? Like, no, seriously. Right.

520
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,979
How many people remove the blade guard from their table?

521
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:01,040
Saw the answer is everybody does

522
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,239
much

523
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:01,619
more than

524
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:01,959
that

525
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,130
sucks, dude.

526
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,800
My latest, my current table saw, like,

527
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,599
literally I got it and they gave me like all the little do

528
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:12,130
you have to screw on and stuff? And like, I just threw the blade guard away.

529
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,709
-- I didn't even open the bag it came in.
-- Well, that's what I love.

530
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,650
-- The blade guard doesn't even come attached. They know like.
-- Right.

531
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:21,849
Yeah, they know. Seriously. Here's my argument though, with that. Right. And,

532
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,800
and we can relate this to the APP store thing is

533
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,329
the blade guard on a table saw makes using a table saw

534
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,250
significantly worse

535
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,260
and while it, it, it,

536
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,550
I won't say it provides no safety,

537
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:38,810
I think the amount of safety it provides is fairly minimal.

538
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,150
It ideally encourages you to keep your hand away from it.

539
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,930
Maybe it makes you a little more conscious of it.

540
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,439
But um yeah, I agree. So maybe, but backing away from that.

541
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,079
So basically what it boils down to for me is

542
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:49,930
software is kind of like power tools and that,

543
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,930
yeah, I mean,

544
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:53,800
you can definitely do things to power tools to make them work a lot more efficiently.

545
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,189
But holy cow, like

546
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,239
you better be careful. You know, like my favorite is always industrial lats. They,

547
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,219
they, you know, the, like on the one hand, I've seen the ones where, you know,

548
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:03,670
they're, they're completely computer controlled,

549
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,609
the housing comes down locks and then it will run and you cannot reach it and touch it

550
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,579
very appropriate

551
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,319
in some cases.

552
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,050
But in other cases, you know, you have the older ones where, you know,

553
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,859
you have a human being doing stuff to it.

554
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:16,229
And

555
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,140
so you have some guy like working with a piece of metal that's spinning it.

556
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,979
Like how many ever 1000 R PM

557
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,979
can things go horribly wrong? Oh, absolutely.

558
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,930
Do not Google for like, LA

559
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:27,180
accidents

560
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,319
don't, I would never do that.

561
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,479
It would be, you, you, you bring this up and I just watched a guy

562
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,880
turn. He, like, uh, there was, I think he's in Australia.

563
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,089
They, they drained like, uh, uh, there was a dam.

564
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,439
I don't know what you call the lake behind a dam. But anyway, they drained it

565
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,510
and then he went in and he reclaimed a bunch

566
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,989
of wood that was over water for like 60 years,

567
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,479
right?

568
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,819
But he, he had like this root ball from a tree and he put it on his freaking lathe.

569
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,520
And the thing is like vibrating like crazy.

570
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm thinking you're going to lose a finger.

571
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,160
-- I mean, in your recording
-- the best case scenario

572
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,989
and the thing is like, and also it worked and the bowl he made was was awesome.

573
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,689
But at the same time, I'm thinking

574
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,599
the amount of risk you took on to make this bowl is totally not worth it.

575
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,439
Like that was crazy town. What you just did?

576
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,435
Well, it's like when people do ice sculpture carving, right?

577
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:18,814
And they're working with a chainsaw

578
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:22,094
and of course my son wants to stick his face in there and take a look and I'm like, no,

579
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,114
the circle of blood like get away.

580
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,255
We give him at least

581
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,915
arm's length plus the chainsaw plus another meter

582
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,064
in case he trips,

583
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,119
you know.

584
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:33,040
But so I think for me part of it.

585
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,540
I think there is definitely value in taking some of the sharp edges away from people.

586
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,420
But at the same time,

587
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,619
if they want to,

588
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,319
you know,

589
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,849
work with the professional tools and have the

590
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,079
really sharp knives that work really well,

591
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,859
then you allow them. But maybe, and, and this is part of what I was thinking about is,

592
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:52,589
you know, if you make it a little bit harder to install

593
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,810
it, maybe forces them to learn a little bit. And thus

594
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,910
they then

595
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,449
are able to actually make a better sort of risk assessment and understand

596
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,500
what they're doing because they have to learn a little bit about it.

597
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,910
You know, and I kind of wonder, you know,

598
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,000
sometimes with programming languages and frameworks, I think some of the time

599
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,369
that's part of the challenge here is, is, you know,

600
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,540
I've seen web devs that don't know what SQL or XSS is

601
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,349
and that's fine as long as they're using the appropriate framework.

602
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,709
But at some point then they do something where they run

603
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:20,290
into this and they have no idea what they're doing.

604
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,030
Whereas all the old timey developers, you know, they,

605
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,349
they had to write their own SQL statements and prepare them and, and, you know,

606
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,150
do all that

607
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,589
so they understand this.

608
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:28,910
And so

609
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,329
I think there is

610
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:35,760
maybe value in sort of having that on ramp to, OK.

611
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,770
Well, you want to work with the real sharp power tools.

612
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:40,040
Yeah, you can but

613
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,160
by definition to get to them, you have to kind of learn what is a blade garden, you know

614
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,800
how to remove it before we let you remove it, right?

615
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,520
Versus just, you know, here's a bunch of random sharp objects. Good luck with that.

616
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,760
So like on android, I mean, let me put it this way, you know, for,

617
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,099
for me to find that setting in the android settings.

618
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:01,239
It was like what setting security uh allow third party developer apps,

619
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,189
you know, click, yes.

620
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:06,310
Like if you can't find and get that setting to work,

621
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,430
then you really probably shouldn't be installing third party apps.

622
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:12,630
I, I think fundamentally you're right, but here's where

623
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,550
I struggle in my mind

624
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,550
is and I'm going to pick on Fortnite again.

625
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,140
So lots of people want to play Fortnite and

626
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,170
I would say a, a substantial number of them

627
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,280
don't have a freaking clue how anything works.

628
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,479
And when I say anything, I mean, like anything computer related, right?

629
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:35,680
Fortnite gives you the instructions to disable

630
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,479
the security essentially and then install the Fortnite app.

631
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,030
And so

632
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,000
in that context, I feel like they are encouraging negative behavior

633
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,579
because you, you, you didn't, you basically said, OK, person, uh

634
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,599
before you can cut our wood, we need you to take off the, the, the uh the blade guard.

635
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,959
Here's how you take off the blade guard and they're like, what the

636
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,239
F's the blade guard, right? It's like holy cow. Don't do that.

637
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,709
Yeah, I'm just looking at this.

638
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,500
So to get started,

639
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,729
please visit fortnite.com/android on an Android device or scan the QR code below.

640
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,790
I don't have an Android device so I can't,

641
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,030
I was actually wanted to see if I could walk

642
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,369
through this quickly and see if they actually kind of explain

643
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,619
because, you know, I've seen instructions where it's like do this dangerous thing

644
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:20,180
and here's why it's dangerous and here's the consequences of if it goes wrong

645
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,819
and you absolutely need to do this to accomplish this.

646
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:25,140
But, you know, we're also going to give you the downside and the risk

647
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,550
information

648
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,430
and, and then I'm a little bit more ok with it.

649
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,089
I haven't looked in the instructions in a

650
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,750
while but they did not say anything like that

651
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,189
when I looked some time ago because in fact, it was,

652
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,270
uh, my, my kids were interested in it for their android devices.

653
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,729
And basically I looked at it and said, well, first of all,

654
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:44,790
none of your stuff could run this.

655
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,949
So I don't care. But secondly, uh don't do any of this.

656
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,229
And then,

657
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:54,709
uh they, in fact, they, they put it on their, their ipads and it sucks on tablets.

658
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,750
So they just never use it.

659
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,670
So, whatever.

660
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,300
Right. Right.

661
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,760
So, anyway, anyway,

662
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,300
we are, are basically out of time. So I guess let's, let's recap all of this.

663
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,859
I think fundamentally,

664
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,349
I am not opposed to walled gardens,

665
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,400
but I I do feel like

666
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,619
as an open source fan

667
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:20,459
there is it, it, it can be a slippery slope if you lock people down too much. Right?

668
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,060
And I guess actually one thing we didn't even address is like

669
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:26,060
your Linux distribution is essentially a wall.

670
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,400
Like when you install a package from Fedora or Debian or

671
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,170
ubuntu or whatever, like somebody decided

672
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,290
-- that goes in and somebody decided
-- those other, what really gets me is for example,

673
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,479
with

674
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:39,579
YBE stuff and well, Debian as well.

675
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,449
You know, when I add a third party repo because I want, for example, the latest

676
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,189
whatever,

677
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,969
no jazz for the sake of argument

678
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:49,040
that third party repo can now install anything on my system,

679
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,910
right? There's no way to have that.

680
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,819
This is one thing that's

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,380
always bugged me about

682
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:53,510
A

683
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:57,599
and R PM and all these things is what I want is I want a repo

684
00:29:58,189 --> 00:30:00,910
where I can say, for example, I'm only going to, you know,

685
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,939
get package X from repo and you can sort of do that in the configure,

686
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,810
you can say exclude or you can say include or whatever.

687
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,329
-- But even then, you know, it's, it's still, you can't really,
-- it's pretty dodgy,

688
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,170
definitely.

689
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,969
Well, it's installing us root. So like it,

690
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,050
you know, here's,

691
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,469
here's the newest package of No Js and we also shoved a new Linux kernel in there,

692
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,010
right? And I can't stop that.

693
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,839
And this is one thing I love about containers where I, you know, I want the latest,

694
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,930
no Js, I just get the latest, no jazz container.

695
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:28,250
Right.

696
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,170
And it's got a really well defined interface and doesn't cramp all over my system.

697
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:31,579
Yeah.

698
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:31,780
No,

699
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,770
I agree with that 100% because I know I've enabled some third party repos in the past.

700
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,709
-- That did horrible things to my system.
-- Oh, yeah.

701
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:42,130
No, I ended up getting a new version of G lip C once

702
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:46,204
-- that did not go well, I don't want to talk about it.
-- II, I love that.

703
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:50,314
Actually, I, man, I remember reading there was a guy in Irc one time,

704
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:51,844
this was like many, many years ago.

705
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:54,905
But anyway, for some reason, he decided like his version of G

706
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,444
Lipsy was broken and we're like,

707
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:59,265
no, you can't touch that. He's like, I'm going to uninstall it.

708
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,885
We said if you uninstall this, like your computer literally breaks.

709
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:03,564
I'm going to do it. I think this is bad.

710
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,439
And like,

711
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,050
and a few seconds later he dropped out

712
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,910
there like

713
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,430
we,

714
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,069
we won't be seeing him for a while

715
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,589
just

716
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,829
because I was kind of curious because I know

717
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,949
Amazon tends to have a really strong walled garden.

718
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,010
Uh I just turned on my Kindle fire eight thing of a jigger.

719
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,719
You click settings, you click security and privacy, you click. Uh

720
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,420
Yeah, you can install third party app.

721
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:21,790
Yeah.

722
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,770
It's just uh apps from unknown sources,

723
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,390
allow installation of applications that are not from the app store.

724
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,859
-- So that, to me is the perfect example.
-- Funny enough.

725
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:30,979
If you do a Google search,

726
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,739
-- you can find instructions for installing the Google Play store on your Amazon
-- fire.

727
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,699
Yeah, I saw that,

728
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:35,829
uh,

729
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:36,199
just

730
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,599
saying I did try and

731
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,170
because I wanted, what did I want to get?

732
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,020
Oh, I think it was a VPN client.

733
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,760
Oh, no, it was the last pass. I wanted to put last pass on this thing.

734
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,229
But then I realized this thing doesn't have a thumbprint scanner. So, nope.

735
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,050
-- Yeah. Right. I'm not
-- typing in my

736
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,089
passcode, typing

737
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,810
in my 700 character password is

738
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,400
not ok. Actually, that's funny because

739
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:58,930
uh the other day my phone forgot the, the,

740
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,380
every now and then last pass decides like I need

741
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,119
to type my password in again on my phone.

742
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:04,099
And I'm like, well,

743
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:05,890
I'm not using this for a while until I could

744
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,790
find my USB my Bluetooth keyboard because like I,

745
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,550
I, it, it takes so many tries and I screwed up so much when I type it in.

746
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,829
Oh, that's why I had to simplify my Wi Fi password was things like all my apple TV.

747
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,619
S and the Google chromecast and all that junk,

748
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:20,829
you know.

749
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,380
And what I really appreciate now is all the devices where you, the device does Wi Fi,

750
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,890
you connect to the device via Wi Fi

751
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,099
and then like your phone in the app on your phone, shares the wi fi settings to it.

752
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:29,689
-- And I'm
-- like, oh my

753
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,189
God, which is awesome.

754
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:31,839
Yeah.

755
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,640
So, anyway, anyway, so I guess back to the closing remarks,

756
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,500
walled gardens are ok if you have a door to get out.

757
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,800
And sometimes I think, I mean, I'll ii, I think

758
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:47,479
in, in most instances, a door is acceptable and good

759
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:48,530
and

760
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:51,680
I think the, the other side of it is

761
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,619
how hostile is it to us?

762
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,079
Right? Where I'll pick on like Nintendo

763
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,479
for this one is Nintendo is notoriously anti.

764
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:02,550
And so for example,

765
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,920
they end up like shutting down a lot of homebrew scenes on their gear

766
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:08,239
and, and I love

767
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,199
some of that Homebrew stuff,

768
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:15,920
but at the same time, I also understand they're losing some of their sales to piracy,

769
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,880
but I don't know if it's enough to matter.

770
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,949
Well, I remember there were stores here, you know,

771
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:23,760
in Edmonton's Chinatown district where it was like open,

772
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:27,880
you know, an open secret that for like 50 bucks, they would mod your,

773
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,319
your console

774
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,420
with the chip to, you know, do everything.

775
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:34,829
And then for like another couple of bucks they'd give you like

776
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,609
whatever game, you know, copies of CD,

777
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,089
like they would burn C DS of whatever you wanted

778
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:43,579
and that's hundreds of dollars of piracy. Bam right there. Right. So I get it.

779
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,530
Why they, when you look at Nintendo's like hardware security, right?

780
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,569
There's some really good write ups on this stuff. Like we're talking you know,

781
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,689
this is like nuclear missile pal code interlock levels of security where

782
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,750
like even with physical access to the device in like six months and

783
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,280
you know, to monkey with it,

784
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,020
getting it to like side load a game is still a nightmare which,

785
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,270
and as we discussed the T two security chip, like

786
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
that's where Apple's headed

787
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:07,685
potentially if they want.

788
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,284
Uh yeah, I do think they're kind of going there. So,

789
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:12,504
So I guess,

790
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:17,524
man, I always get torn, but I guess, yes, I'll agree with you that at the end of the day,

791
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,043
I want my escape hatch.

792
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:23,284
Well, I want to be able to do that weird thing that I need to do for my job or for my hobby

793
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:25,715
that involves taking the blade guard off my table. So,

794
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:28,764
-- and I will accept the risk.
-- Yeah, I think that's fair.

795
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,120
So, all right, I guess in summary,

796
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,800
the issue is complex and strange and hard to

797
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,800
understand and even harder to explain in many instances.

798
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,800
