Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast

1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,340
episode 166 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,279
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,579
So I'm feeling extra aware this month. Are you by chance?

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:20,079
No.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,309
So I guess happy cybersecurity Awareness Month to everybody.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,229
I hope you've prepared gifts.

7
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,510
I feel like a month is too long

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,720
or maybe every month should be cybersecurity awareness month.

9
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:37,849
Well,

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,080
yeah, because, I mean, should we only

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,669
be extra,

12
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:48,770
like, is the threat level orange or blue or green or something now this month?

13
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:49,500
And we need to be

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,459
cautious.

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,220
Tomato. Ok. Heirloom tomato or just regular tomato, whatever. It doesn't matter.

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,419
It's all the same.

17
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,409
It's,

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,270
I always love when it, it's not.

19
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:04,059
So it's different now, but back after September 11th, I remember the,

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,669
the airports that always say, you know,

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,319
the Transportation and Security administration has raised the

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,839
threat level to orange and it's like,

23
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,569
what does that mean?

24
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,830
And nobody knew and it didn't matter.

25
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,349
Well, there's nothing actionable. Right. Right. Right. Exactly.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,489
Like, there's nothing actionable, like, like does threat level orange mean,

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,110
I need to start duct taping up all my windows with plastic.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,410
I don't know.

29
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,819
I mean, they might as well have said, like,

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,809
the threat level is toothbrush and that would have made as much sense to me

31
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,470
except I would have cared more if it was toothbrush, they'd be like,

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,529
why is it toothbrush?

33
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,430
What does that mean?

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,110
Yeah, because like, some of these awareness months kind of make sense.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,949
Like, um, there's, uh, what's the one for smoke alarms or you should, like,

36
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,970
go change all the batteries in your smoke alarms?

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,069
And like, if you do that once a year, that's a good thing. Like that's,

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,580
that's simple.

39
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:49,620
And it's, you know,

40
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:53,660
we can all get behind having smoke alarms with actual batteries that work in them.

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,389
So what we probably need

42
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,860
is just Password Appreciation Day where we all

43
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,190
go online and type our passwords into Google

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,430
and appreciate them.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,059
But

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,139
no, I mean, I agree with you and I think

47
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,669
this is something that's becoming more and more apparent to me over

48
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:15,860
time is the fact that the security people love handing out advice,

49
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,479
but there's never any actionable items in it.

50
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,830
Well, oh, actually worse, sometimes there is actionable advice,

51
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,419
but it's ridiculous and it's like,

52
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,910
somehow magically qualify each link before you check on

53
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,500
it to make sure it's trusted and then,

54
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,000
and only then click on it like

55
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,779
that's ridiculous. I can't do that.

56
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,649
And even if you could,

57
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,770
there's, what was it?

58
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:39,929
Wasn't there just an adobe redirection that was found where the link was literally

59
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,529
going to Adobe and then it could send you anywhere they wanted after that.

60
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,619
It, you

61
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,190
know, I, I agree completely. There's,

62
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:51,089
there's so much rotten advice and I feel like

63
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,009
cybersecurity Awareness Month

64
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:56,779
just feels like a poke with a hot poker of ha ha

65
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,380
ha ha.

66
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,130
There's still nothing you can do.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,149
Yeah.

68
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:04,380
Yeah. I, I don't even know what to say anymore. Like I just,

69
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,759
I think it's, I like the idea of,

70
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,520
like, I get from a media marketing perspective. It's

71
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,520
probably more effective to do this once a year than to try and do it every day.

72
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,289
But

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,910
again, I'm not real clear on what I'm supposed to be doing or

74
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:20,919
anything. Like,

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,149
should we all make sure everybody has automated updates enabled everywhere and is,

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,610
you know,

77
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,229
ideally goes and gets a password manager because

78
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,509
honestly those two bits of advice would actually

79
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,369
help.

80
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:36,229
Yeah. Yeah, they would. But I'm sure nobody will talk about it

81
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:37,630
because why would they,

82
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,550
it's

83
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,880
anyway, whatever, whatever it's annoying. I don't have a lot to say. I feel like

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,539
everyone has their special days and special months

85
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,649
and cybersecurity gets one.

86
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,130
And unfortunately

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,639
once again we squander what we have because we don't know what to do and

88
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,250
it's frustrating and I guess we'll just remain

89
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:03,610
bitter and complain on our podcast and that's

90
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,169
pretty much it.

91
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah. I don't know. I

92
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,990
like honestly the thing I actually did and maybe this is a piece of actionable advice

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,699
for our viewers that might help is I've set up a bunch of calendar reminders.

94
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,440
Generally quarterly things.

95
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,279
For example,

96
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,299
I have like a little an Amazon instance running a web server to do my my omni

97
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,049
focus to do software synchronization between all my devices and so quarterly,

98
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,000
I get an email saying like go log into the host and

99
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,160
reboot it and make sure all the packages have been updating,

100
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,369
you know, or for example, I have, oh,

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,320
I have a monthly reminder to check my son's

102
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:38,619
cell phone plan because it's like a prepaid thing.

103
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,829
And if you don't pay every once in a while after it expires after 365 days.

104
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,250
So it's,

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,500
it's kind of annoying because it's one of

106
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,790
those situations where it's rare enough that,

107
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:50,220
yeah, I'll totally forget at some point and then his cell phone will stop working.

108
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, that, that happened to my kids too.

109
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,649
Actually, I had,

110
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,869
my son had a prepaid for a while and that exact thing

111
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,820
happened where I didn't pay it and it just quit working one day

112
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:01,820
and he got a text message and when they finally, he's like, dad,

113
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,100
you need to turn my phone back on.

114
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,529
I said, oh, did it expire? He was like, yeah, a

115
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,579
couple of weeks ago they sent me this message.

116
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,089
I'm like, but you got to tell me these things. Come on.

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,179
It's, it's typical, I guess user behavior is how I would describe that well,

118
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,380
until it breaks, it's why would you complain?

119
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,209
It was broken for a month.

120
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:23,470
And, well, apparently, well, can I just point out my response would have been, like,

121
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,820
clearly I don't need that prepaid plan.

122
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,380
Yeah. Well, that was kind of the thinking. Yes.

123
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,649
Yeah.

124
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,320
I set up a bunch of just reminders, like,

125
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,339
even things like to check the programming on the thermostat to make sure, you know,

126
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,510
because I, again, I forget to change the temperature, you know,

127
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,500
from like summer to fall

128
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,695
to, well, it's winter now.

129
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,605
It's like minus three degrees outside and it was snowing this morning. Right.

130
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,244
So, you know,

131
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,584
I need to go twiddle with the thermostat and get it kind of into wintery mode.

132
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:48,255
Right.

133
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:51,424
I, I think maybe the moral of the story is

134
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:54,584
because to me, I mean, there are definite things you can do

135
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,024
that are beneficial once a year, like changing the batteries in your smoke alarms.

136
00:05:58,195 --> 00:05:59,725
But when it comes to infosec,

137
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,505
I feel like it's more of a continuous process type deal for most things.

138
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:07,494
Like you should probably check that your backups are working more than once a year.

139
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:08,670
I mean, yes.

140
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:13,089
And if we tell people, ok, so, I mean, let's, let's put this on its head a little bit.

141
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,290
Let's say I'm already using a password manager.

142
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,799
I already have two factor off enabled.

143
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,630
What's my yearly check? Now,

144
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,100
what,

145
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,529
what do I do make sure software updates are

146
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,549
enabled and that it actually has been updating.

147
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,309
Ok.

148
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,670
That's, uh, that's about all I got. Right.

149
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,989
There's, this is, I mean, it's terrible, I think,

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,149
and now I think there's two sides to this coin, I think on one side,

151
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,970
this is an acknowledgment of the fact that what we do

152
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:36,510
is,

153
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,695
but on the other side,

154
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:42,595
I think the reason it's difficult is because we don't truly understand a lot

155
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:46,255
of these problems and we don't have effective measures to go against them.

156
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,364
It's kind of like if there is no such thing as a smoke alarm,

157
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:50,505
what would you?

158
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,915
Oh, let's, let's, let's explore this actually thinking about,

159
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:54,945
let's say there's no such thing as smoke alarms.

160
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,915
You have fire prevention month and you're telling people, all right,

161
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:58,934
you have to prevent fire.

162
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:01,635
So I want you to move your oily rags and make sure you got

163
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:04,785
a pail of sand next to the furnace or a pail of water.

164
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:05,515
Right. Right.

165
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,589
Exactly.

166
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:09,660
And the reality is that advice is terrible and

167
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,220
most people aren't going to do that crap.

168
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,920
But if you have a smoke alarm,

169
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,779
that is an enormous difference and is a complete game changer because let's face it.

170
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,299
If your house lights on fire, smoke alarm goes off,

171
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,679
you just get the heck out and call in the professionals.

172
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,059
And today in the security world we don't have that.

173
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,649
You don't know if your house is on fire part of it is the

174
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:28,763
changes so much.

175
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:30,983
Like, I remember when password managers, I mean,

176
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,583
they've been around forever but they were basically unusable

177
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,132
in the sense of it was like an encrypted text file.

178
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:40,613
So, like you might as well just have an encrypted spreadsheet or whatever. Right?

179
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:43,423
I remember those days. Yes, it was, it was terrible. I

180
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:43,622
agree.

181
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:46,372
And now, you know, with the integration with web browsers and,

182
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,852
and even the integration with applications.

183
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:49,885
Well, that, that's better. I

184
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,605
mean, I noticed, you know,

185
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,816
uh I forget when it showed up on Apple devices but at

186
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,566
some point I os had that automatically update button show up,

187
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,825
you know, in settings.

188
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:02,196
And it was like, yes, please like and, and it's reasonably intelligent, you know,

189
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,656
it tries to do to overnight when you're sleeping and only if

190
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:06,746
you have like 50% battery or more and stuff like that.

191
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:09,156
So it doesn't like brick itself, you know, which is nice.

192
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,686
I appreciate my device, not auto bricking itself.

193
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,149
You laugh, but you and I have both had that happen.

194
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,190
I'm sure I've, I've broken so many things. It's not even funny.

195
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,250
Like I had to do this crazy bio

196
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,880
upgrade path that I think I talked about on the podcast.

197
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,910
Remember about with the gaming PC where,

198
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:29,880
you know, it was literally, I ended up

199
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,369
doing something like about 15 updates of software and bios, firmware, bios,

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,729
firmware, utilities, drivers, you know,

201
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:40,440
rebooting windows multiple times so that I could get,

202
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,010
I basically wanted to get the bios on the motherboard up to date enough so that I can

203
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,409
upgrade the CPU at some point in the future and then not have to do it then.

204
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,030
And, you know, the, the binaries of utility

205
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:50,044
I need are missing.

206
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,174
Uh, no, you did not tell that story on the podcast because it was really,

207
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:54,275
really long and you cut it.

208
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:54,364
Oh,

209
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,825
yeah. Exactly. Right. Exactly. It was, it was such a,

210
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,315
like, it literally took two hours with, you know,

211
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,484
about half an hour of actual work and a lot of waiting.

212
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:03,294
No, I'm gonna cut this one.

213
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,565
But, um, yeah, so, I mean, I

214
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:07,645
guess

215
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,794
what I would do is if

216
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,460
you want to do Cybersecurity Awareness Month, my advice would be,

217
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,599
is probably the two biggest things you could do is get people to make

218
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:20,140
sure their software is up to date and where possible auto updates are enabled,

219
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,489
which,

220
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,340
you know, shout out to things like Firefox and chrome and, I mean,

221
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:27,580
even windows and I like has gotten a lot better that way.

222
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,929
You know, you can set a window for when you want it to work and, you know, you can, uh,

223
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,419
it's actually configurable and reasonably

224
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,190
unlikely to break your device or, you know,

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,229
get your windows into some spot where it just, it reboots halfway and dies,

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,309
but there's still nothing better than when you're at a conference and someone's

227
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,849
giving a talk and their windows computer designs right now is the time

228
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,510
I'm going to install that update and there's nothing

229
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,929
you can do about it because you've clicked.

230
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,570
Ignore too

231
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:54,794
many times. It's

232
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:55,674
marvelous.

233
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:58,614
I think you've talked about this and I do the same thing is before I travel,

234
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,635
I may make sure I run update on all my devices.

235
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:02,375
That's right.

236
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:06,424
And it's not even for security. It's so that you can turn them on and they work. Right.

237
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:10,544
Yes. In fact, where was I, I was? Oh, I think, I don't even remember now.

238
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,445
I was, I was traveling not long ago

239
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,080
and a major update for my phone came in and

240
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,799
it was just staring at me and I kept thinking,

241
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,200
I want to click update so bad,

242
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,150
but I also want to get home and my plane ticket is on this phone.

243
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,840
Exactly.

244
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,760
That's, uh, that is a very, very good point.

245
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,190
Yeah.

246
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:29,210
Like if I,

247
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,559
my computer, whatever I can fix that, but if my phone is bricked,

248
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,799
I am in huge trouble because, I mean, Uber

249
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,111
tickets,

250
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:42,471
everything. It's just going to be so unnecessarily painful.

251
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,791
It's like if you have a spare tire, ok,

252
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,442
it's not fun to get a flat tire.

253
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,101
But if you don't have a spare tire and you get a flat tire,

254
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:49,812
that's

255
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:53,291
right. Anyway, anyway, I'm, I tire of this topic.

256
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,911
I guess the thing we should all think about

257
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:56,572
isn't,

258
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,812
what can we do for cybersecurity Awareness Month

259
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,192
because I think the answer is fundamentally nothing.

260
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,583
I think what we need to do is think about how do we create a smoke alarm

261
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:09,823
to make cybersecurity Awareness Month effective?

262
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:14,823
Because I think right now it is ineffective well, to make it unnecessary.

263
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,073
No, not unnecessary because like you said,

264
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,093
you have to make sure people change the batteries in their smoke detectors.

265
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:21,304
So that makes sense.

266
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,494
But modern smoke alarms beep incessantly when the battery starts to run down.

267
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:26,383
And so you'd have to

268
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:29,435
ignore that for quite a while. Like you'd have to try, basically.

269
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:30,495
But in fairness,

270
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:32,765
people do go on vacation and you have to test

271
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,995
them because it could have just up and died.

272
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:35,676
You don't know.

273
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,375
And, and a really important thing, this is just a kind of a, the more, you know,

274
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:41,255
for everyone,

275
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:45,056
the smoke detectors only last for about 10 years

276
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,526
because there's an element in there that decays.

277
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,625
And so that's why it's important to,

278
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:50,815
yes,

279
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,299
you have to test them and make sure they're not

280
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,559
too old because if they're too old they don't work.

281
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:55,979
Actually,

282
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:58,530
I need to clean my smoke detectors now that you say that I've had a

283
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:01,599
lot of dust in the house lately and the dust can get stuck in them

284
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,190
and make them do weird things.

285
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,909
Right. So, anyway, that's a good reminder.

286
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,150
Anyway, anyway, I have a funny personal anecdote to tell.

287
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,570
So I got an ear infection, which I thought only Children got. Right.

288
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,650
Seriously, I went into the doctor and I'm like, what,

289
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,429
what

290
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,830
are you going to? Weird swimming pools or something?

291
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,030
I haven't been in a swimming pool in months.

292
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,349
I have no idea where I picked this up.

293
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,159
I've known, like, whatever, whatever I got an ear infection and by the way,

294
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,320
they're really, really painful.

295
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,080
So, when those little kids cry a lot, like,

296
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,719
they're totally justified and they're crying because it sucked.

297
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,200
But anyway, so I go to the doctor

298
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,479
and they, they were like, wow, this is a really bad ear infection.

299
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:45,150
It must really hurt. I was like, yes, yes, it does. Thank you for asking.

300
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,400
That was super helpful.

301
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,880
So, anyway, they prescribed me a ridiculous amount of antibiotics

302
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,390
and I go to my pharmacist to get them and there are like 100 people at the pharmacy,

303
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,559
which I've never seen so many people at one time.

304
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,460
It, whatever. It's just the way it works when I need medicine, I guess.

305
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,419
And it was, it was comical because the pharmacist is like,

306
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:05,690
do you know what to do with these?

307
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,215
And I said no, and I have no idea what you're even giving me.

308
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:09,885
And so she's like,

309
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:13,015
trying to whisper to me how to use my antibiotics because it's basically,

310
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,544
it's an eardrop in this, like gigantic horse pill.

311
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,434
I have to swallow

312
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,755
and she's like whispering and I'm like, it's just an ear infection.

313
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:23,515
You could talk like it's, it's ok, but it occurred to me at the same time,

314
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,049
I'm sensitive to the plight of this poor

315
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,849
pharmacist because when you have like 100 people,

316
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:31,530
like, what if I was getting some, well, but doesn't hi

317
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,609
a require them probably. Right.

318
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:36,450
And what if I was getting like some super crazy embarrassing, like, you know,

319
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,599
here's your STD medicine, sir.

320
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,609
And like, oh, crap, shut up, you know,

321
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:41,580
and I

322
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,219
get it, it's kind of a weird problem to have.

323
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:47,570
Right, because on one side, how are they going to do this?

324
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,489
Don't they have like the little kind of not booth but the little

325
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,929
thing where you sit down and they give you your meds and explain,

326
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,130
you know,

327
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,109
like you eat these pills and these pills you don't eat and they go up your whatever.

328
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,059
I mean, they, they have a booth and I'm sure if I would have asked nicely,

329
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,289
we could have gone and sat down in it.

330
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,609
But when there's 20 people behind me also,

331
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:06,640
I understand that this poor person and isn't looking to, you know,

332
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,530
tell me a 20 minute story in a little room off to the side.

333
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,960
So it's kind of a weird problem.

334
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:15,200
And at the same time, I can see where when you're under pressure,

335
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,289
obviously, a lot of the rules kind of go out the window sometimes, which is,

336
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,469
I guess just good advice for all of us.

337
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,330
To keep in mind

338
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,969
anyway. Anyway. So

339
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,250
I think the real news this week of course, is the, uh, is the polar bear sized pigs.

340
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,570
This is the greatest story you have to tell it. I love it so well.

341
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,869
I mean,

342
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
how long have humans been breeding animals to be bigger

343
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,969
and meatier and easier to raise and slaughter and eat?

344
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:44,229
10,000 years? Probably 10,000 years.

345
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,270
It's been a long time.

346
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,789
Yeah.

347
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,669
And so, I mean, this is obviously the logical progression is, you know,

348
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,750
big pigs are good.

349
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,429
So bigger pigs are better.

350
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,869
And so in China now they've got these pigs that weigh 500 kg,

351
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:03,099
which is 1100 pounds for Americans. That's insane.

352
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,260
I, I wonder if it's more efficient.

353
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,229
I would imagine.

354
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,059
It is like,

355
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,450
if you get more meat for the input of feed stock and antibiotics and

356
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,820
all the other stuff that you need to use to raise a pig,

357
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,700
I would imagine raising one giant animal is easier than raising three little ones.

358
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,030
Is my suspicion.

359
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,299
It's like the other question, would you rather fight a horse sized duck or

360
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,260
100 duck sized horses?

361
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,869
That is the question.

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,989
What gets me though is I was thinking about this and I

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,150
was thinking logistically like they need fences and stuff because they,

364
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,950
they will try and break out and get into shenanigans because they're,

365
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,450
they're very smart animals.

366
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,369
And I'm thinking like a 500 pound pig like,

367
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,729
if that thing wants to go somewhere and you're in its way,

368
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,750
like that's gonna, that's, that's as heavy as a horse. It's,

369
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,820
it. Now, I, I have so,

370
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,409
I don't know how big it was.

371
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:57,049
There was one time I was at the Indiana State Fair in the United States

372
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,659
and they had the world's largest pig on display and it was,

373
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,090
I think probably

374
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,760
350 to 400 kg. Give or take. It was like, that's impressive.

375
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,869
It was huge. It was like probably six or 700 pounds.

376
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,679
It was enormous and it just laid there and it looked kind of

377
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,780
miserable and I felt bad for it because I have a strong suspicion.

378
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:23,750
It's not the most active animal because I don't think it can move around very well.

379
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,650
And

380
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,369
so that's likely part of the problem here is kind of like how we,

381
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,020
we raise turkeys now on these farms that are basically like too large to move.

382
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,950
So they just kind of lay there and eat and then we, we kill them.

383
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,460
And that like that, that feels mean even though they have an obvious, you know,

384
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,940
sad ending to their life.

385
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,020
But I don't know, man,

386
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,900
I, I feel like a giant pig is the thing of nightmares and I want to eat those

387
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,900
barbecue ribs.

388
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,405
Oh, that would be amazing. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe it's like eating leather.

389
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,364
I have no idea. It's, this is,

390
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:02,585
this is what people have come to is we're creating monstrosities now

391
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,824
we've run out of other things to do. I guess.

392
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,525
I, I do sometimes worry about the industrialization of farming,

393
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,795
but the reality is if you want to feed 7 billion plus people,

394
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:14,214
you're probably gonna have to industrialize it a bit

395
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,895
unless you want 98% of us being farmers.

396
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,473
We tried that. It didn't work.

397
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,558
I mean, that's the reality of it.

398
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:21,958
No,

399
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:22,148
I

400
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:26,138
don't know. I don't know. It's, it's just a crazy story. Giant pigs.

401
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:30,578
Completely not related to security in any way. Just crazy. Awesome.

402
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,818
So, anyway, anyway,

403
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,409
well, when's the last time Infosec

404
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:35,938
did something crazy. Awesome.

405
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,689
Like honestly,

406
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:44,109
apart from chrome shoving http S through and actually getting people to, you know,

407
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,920
between Chrome warnings and Google se search rankings.

408
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,770
Like in the last five years, what's been done that's really made the world better.

409
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,359
I don't know if there's anything amazing we can point at

410
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,199
and

411
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,224
I don't know if that's good or bad necessarily because I believe we

412
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,954
were promised some A I that would fix a lot of stuff.

413
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,125
A I fixes everything. Kurt.

414
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,905
You should know that by now and Blockchain those two things

415
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,125
solve them. All

416
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:09,334
right.

417
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,104
Totally legit. Ignoring the marketing hype.

418
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:12,185
I,

419
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:15,935
I'm struggling to think of any significant game changers

420
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,255
and there's two ways to look at that is

421
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:19,854
on one side,

422
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,540
a mature industry shouldn't see amazing breakthroughs.

423
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,819
Like you could point at I don't know, let's say the, the dishwasher industry

424
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,869
where dishwashers have been basically the same for probably the last 20 plus years.

425
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,780
And it's just like constant march of

426
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,650
progress where they're a little more efficient.

427
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,239
They use a little less water. They clean a little bit better.

428
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,380
They're less noisy.

429
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,260
Yes.

430
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:43,682
Well, the, the expensive ones, the cheap ones are still super noisy

431
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,322
because I have a cheap one in my, in my kitchen.

432
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,642
Well, I had it, it's gone now, but that's anyway, that's another story.

433
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:50,162
But,

434
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,503
and I, I

435
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:56,772
feel like our industry isn't mature enough to be lacking breakthroughs and

436
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:00,192
I can't think of a significant breakthrough in quite some time.

437
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:04,326
And like the things that pop into my head are auto updates, obviously

438
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:08,135
Google forcing hetps and everybody I think is a good thing.

439
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:08,615
I mean,

440
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,345
there's things like content security policies in web

441
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,806
browsers which were a big step forward but

442
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:14,755
it,

443
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:15,625
I mean,

444
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:19,495
everything I can think of is pretty old and it was all pretty low hanging fruit,

445
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,385
I think where,

446
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,790
like where to the point

447
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,780
if I was going to compare it to, you know, many other industries of

448
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,000
the, the really easy stuff is gone

449
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,469
and now you need like impressive R and D to

450
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,750
take the next steps and I don't know who's even doing that necessarily.

451
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,905
I mean, you see people like SNCC

452
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,295
is doing some cool work.

453
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,775
You've got obviously Google project X is doing some cool work.

454
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,744
Well, R and D in general has been outsourced to the start ups, right?

455
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,494
Because that way there's zero risk downside and

456
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:51,464
you just, you have to spend a lot more money to acquire that R and D in the form of,

457
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:53,214
I think you're right.

458
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,290
But I think the problem with that is this is like saying, all right, start ups, uh,

459
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,699
we need you to build a rocket that can go to space.

460
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:05,040
And the reality is you need something with substantial

461
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,400
resources to kind of bootstrap that into a place

462
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,449
where the,

463
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,800
you know, the smaller companies can then take it from there perhaps, or somebody,

464
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,439
you know what I mean?

465
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,939
It's, I, I feel like we have a chasm

466
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,719
where you can say, oh, the start ups are doing the R and D

467
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:23,000
but I don't see anything coming out of a lot of start ups that I would say is

468
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,790
amazingly changing the game.

469
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,910
Like I see cool stuff and I think they're making it the world better,

470
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,949
but I don't see anything that's going to

471
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:36,310
drastically alter the current trajectory of security.

472
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,069
Well, yeah, I mean,

473
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,020
we've been promised a I that would just magically

474
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,260
make a whole bunch of stuff go away and it's

475
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,979
obviously not there yet because it made all my money go away.

476
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:52,989
Yeah. Uh No, I mean, a I and ML are hard and I think

477
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,469
I, I feel like Alexa

478
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,849
is my favorite example where Alexa came out and everyone was like, this is amazing.

479
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,619
I can talk to this thing and it does stuff and now we're, what, like,

480
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,750
three years in and it's like, it basically does the same thing.

481
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,319
It did three years ago. What's going on here guys.

482
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,709
Yeah, I got to say there's really not a lot of compelling.

483
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,670
I mean, I, I do enjoy that.

484
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,905
I can say, you know, I, I set up some key words like, you know, Alexa

485
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,805
Goodnight, which turns off the lights and does a bunch of stuff like that. Alexa

486
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:22,175
Good morning, which turns on the lights and reads me the news and the weather.

487
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:25,415
But I mean, that, you know, has it significantly

488
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:30,015
changed my life? No, not at all. Right. I mean, exactly. It's a novelty.

489
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:33,535
I think the only thing I enjoy is I can just yell

490
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:34,125
Alexa.

491
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,055
What time is it?

492
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:35,935
And

493
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,694
it tells me and I apologize to any of you with an Alexa

494
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,814
that are listening to this podcast

495
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:41,535
with,

496
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,250
but now you know what time it is? So you got that going for you?

497
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,650
No, I mean, for real, actually,

498
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,410
I was in a conference call the other day and someone yelled that out and it was,

499
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,719
it was hilarious. How many people had functional

500
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,890
Alexas in the background, which made my day. No, it's, I mean, I've got an Alexa,

501
00:21:58,069 --> 00:21:59,810
the one with the screen on it

502
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,010
and the integration with the ring doorbell is so poor that it, like,

503
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,689
won't show me on the screen what my ring doorbell is seeing.

504
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,800
They, they own ring. Right.

505
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:09,640
Yeah,

506
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,770
that's ridiculous. Come on.

507
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,449
Yeah. It would be nice to have that capability because I bought this thing.

508
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,729
Actually a friend won it and it was like, I don't want this and I'm like, well,

509
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,569
I'll buy it for, like, you know,

510
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:23,609
about three quarters of what it costs new and he's happy and I'm happy.

511
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,969
But I'll be honest, this thing is useless

512
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:29,280
as far as the thing with the screen on it goes like it,

513
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:33,380
right. Like the screen doesn't, nothing really can use it.

514
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,099
I, I believe that.

515
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:35,560
I mean,

516
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,959
I find it's actually really funny because my wife tries

517
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:41,300
so hard to use the Alexa because I actually,

518
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,599
I got one kind of by accident.

519
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:47,209
I needed a fire TV. And because my Roku died, it's a long bizarre story.

520
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,260
But anyway, I ended up with the fire TV, with Alexa built into it

521
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,209
and

522
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,969
she tries so hard to talk to it and ask it, like, play this show and it never,

523
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:59,130
ever works ever under any circumstances.

524
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,079
And I, I feel bad but whatever,

525
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,589
I, I it's always gives me a good chuckle.

526
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,030
And anyway, anyway, but my, my point is

527
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,650
this is what I feel like security is where

528
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,530
we're just,

529
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,410
I feel like we're just sitting here with this stuff and where do we go next?

530
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,660
And like, I don't even know.

531
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,339
But I guess that's kind of part of,

532
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,140
part of how progress works is because obviously prior to smartphones,

533
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,010
if you would have told me, or rather, I guess prior to smartphones,

534
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,859
if someone would have said, what's the next big thing in computing?

535
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,609
I would have never said, uh, a phone with the screen on it that you interact with,

536
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,760
with your finger in a million years.

537
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,170
Right. It just, it, it, I, I didn't see it

538
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,030
so I don't know.

539
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,239
Yeah,

540
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,900
I,

541
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,969
yeah, it's a strange world. Indeed. Indeed.

542
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:47,489
And maybe it is a I, we just haven't found it yet, but I don't think it is.

543
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,319
Anyway.

544
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:52,079
All right, man, I guess uh this was a bizarre grab bag of nonsense,

545
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:52,979
which is always fun.

546
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:53,560
So

547
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:57,660
I guess happy Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Do you have any parting thoughts?

548
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,420
I know like literally nothing comes to mind

549
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:04,640
and in summary, we're all still doomed.

550
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,869
That's all. Yeah.

551
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:06,930
Anyway.

552
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,910
Oh, well, but again,

553
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,109
it's not that bad.

554
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
No, we still have giant pigs to eat.

555
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,680
That's true. Giant pigs. We got, we got something to look forward to.

556
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:18,069
