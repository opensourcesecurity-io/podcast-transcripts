Hello and welcome to episode 121 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,460
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,880
and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,090
So, listener,

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,620
you, you don't know this.

5
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:20,399
But when we talked about number 1, 21 Kurt and I said, 0,

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,569
100 and 21 that sounds like a neat number.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,899
And so we looked it up on Wikipedia because Wikipedia has numbers and I found

8
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:32,119
a Wikipedia page called List of Numbers and I'm pretty sure it's missing some.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,430
The

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,610
-- dumb
-- is there

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:36,380
P

12
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:39,159
I it's just, it's a page.

13
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:42,619
I'm the bad joke is there's obviously an infinite number

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,180
of numbers so you can't have a list of numbers,

15
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:45,639
right?

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,049
Anyway, anyway, which I guess it's actually ironic

17
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,220
you, you could have a list of numbers. It would just be very large

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,169
and incomplete

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,740
-- because we have finite storage.
-- Well, I suppose if you want to look at it like that,

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,860
right? Anyway, this is actually related to the topic of the day.

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,980
Speaking of numbers,

22
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,540
because something Kurt and I have been talking about is voting security,

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,260
which seems relatively topical given the fact that

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,839
this,

25
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,949
this episode is going to come out right before an election in

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,800
the United States where voting security has been a hugely popular topic.

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,629
So I guess before you reach for the stop button at this point, it's kind of a heads up.

28
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:30,160
Our goal is not to start a political discussion about voting

29
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,559
country.

30
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:32,300
That's right.

31
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:36,849
You live in a nice country where, although you almost certainly still have voted

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,839
security issues because everybody,

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,069
no, not really

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,519
because we have a federally run election system

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,489
by and large for our federal elections. And then

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,339
state level is generally quite

37
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,110
reasonable and well controlled.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,720
It's see,

39
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,400
what's interesting to me is the US has federal

40
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,970
elections that are operated at the state level.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,190
So between states it varies greatly. Like I know some states, for example,

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,550
uh, I think it's, what is it? Oregon? Like, it's all voter mailing.

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,370
Yes,

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,139
it's all done by

45
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,430
mail.

46
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,230
It's actually really cool.

47
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,410
I remember, I didn't know this but I went to college with a guy from Oregon

48
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,880
and he, one day he gets like this huge package in the mail.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,199
And I, I said, what's that?

50
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:21,710
And he says, oh, it's my voting book for, for the election. And I said, what now?

51
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,100
And yeah, he showed it to me and it's like this, it was quite large,

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,360
just this was one of those years where they had lots and lots of stuff to vote for.

53
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:29,889
Basically, they mailed him a book.

54
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,190
It looked like one of those fill in the bubble tests

55
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:36,210
and he voted on all the things and then he mailed it back.

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
Well, see, and that's,

57
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:40,500
that's another problem the US has with elections that Canada doesn't have,

58
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:46,350
is that the US has elections on everything. Like sheriff dog catcher judges.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,039
We do a

60
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,710
lot

61
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,279
and see in Canada, we, we don't, we elect, obviously at the federal level,

62
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,369
we elected at the provincial level that you would call state level,

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,690
we elect at the municipal level. So like

64
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,250
uh school boards and city council and the city mayor.

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,759
And that's basically it,

66
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,380
right. All of our, our legal record,

67
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,880
the entire legal system is appointed,

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,050
right? We don't vote on them

69
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,750
and, and I've always thought that was an odd thing to do, right?

70
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,029
It doesn't seem like the,

71
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,289
-- the sort of position you want to be partisan
-- if you look at the history of the US,

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,679
right?

73
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,895
The, the US was effectively a British colony that broke away from Britain.

74
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,604
-- That's a polite way of putting
-- it.

75
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:32,035
And Canada did not. Right.

76
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,514
So Canada, I mean, we're still a constitutional monarchy.

77
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,675
The queen is the head of state. So, ultimately, what do

78
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:41,005
they call it? The commonwealth, right? Where it's like Canada? And I think

79
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,934
-- the
-- commonwealth is something different.

80
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,100
Oh, that's not, not you. Ok.

81
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,880
Well, no, we're in the commonwealth but that's

82
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,449
different.

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,009
Yeah.

84
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,539
-- Yeah,
-- you can be in the commonwealth but not have the queen as head of state,

85
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,089
for example, Australia no longer has the queen of head of state.

86
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,740
Um But no, like technically, for example, when I, when we, we elect MP S,

87
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,399
the MP S form a government,

88
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,500
they essentially go to the queen's representative in Canada to

89
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,179
well effectively ask permission to form a government

90
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:07,759
and you know, the

91
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,600
queen's representative

92
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,940
representative

93
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:10,750
government.

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,399
No, let's, we need to move on because it's as fun as it is.

95
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,889
-- So,
-- but basically

96
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,519
really what it boils down to is the beauty is Canada. We don't

97
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,549
have as many elections and our elections are

98
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:26,869
like, I don't vote on prop 217. You know, whether or not we should ban plastic spoons

99
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,890
like we just don't have stuff like that. Right?

100
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,109
And so, so the part of the challenge is when you look at the voting,

101
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,049
like when we have a federal election, I literally vote

102
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,940
for my local, like whichever local party I want to support. That's it.

103
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,290
I vote on one thing,

104
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:41,970
right?

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,390
And it's not like the US where they have that like giant sheet of like, well,

106
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,799
we're holding a federal election so we might as

107
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,579
well do all these other elections while we're at

108
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,890
-- it.
-- Sure. Well, yeah. Anyway, anyway. All right. So, so let's, let's start here.

109
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,540
We have the concept of a voting,

110
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,429
right?

111
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,950
Which we've kind of talked about a little bit. But II, I think fundamentally

112
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,760
the,

113
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,309
the ignoring the technology because we'll get to that and I do

114
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,260
think the technology is super interesting and has a lot of crazy,

115
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,010
I guess, problems and opportunities.

116
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,269
But

117
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,029
so fundamentally, if we start with the people

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,739
and we're talking about security,

119
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,029
the big thing we hear about here in the US right now is voter fraud.

120
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,600
Right? Where

121
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:26,000
the idea is you have people who shouldn't be voting are voting in elections

122
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,440
or people voting multiple times.

123
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,619
Right. Right.

124
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,839
And, and the reality it turns out is this is actually a, a comically low number

125
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,029
which, which in terms of security kind of the way I view this is

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,200
no security system is ever going to be 100%.

127
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:45,119
And if you try to make it 100% you actually

128
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,600
end up shutting the door on more legitimate people.

129
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:48,850
You're

130
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,609
disenfranchising a lot of voters.

131
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,070
And just to put this in context,

132
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,890
the vast majority of voter ID laws in

133
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,839
the United States target only a voter impersonation.

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,519
So number one, that's they, they mostly target like, you know,

135
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,940
Josh claiming to be Curtin trying to vote twice both as Josh and as curt

136
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,350
of which there are only 31 documented cases in the United

137
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:09,799
States from,

138
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,470
from 2000 to 2014.

139
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:15,299
That's so it's like two point something a year.

140
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,880
And, and this is this, I feel like kind of

141
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,890
this is,

142
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,929
is one of the fundamental problems we see in the security industry in general

143
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,489
is there's like one relatively inconsequential corner case

144
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,750
and we end up building these enormous systems around it

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,019
that end up like throwing out the baby with the bathwater

146
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,850
when the reality is just,

147
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,690
you can ignore this problem because it really doesn't matter.

148
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,959
I mean, I know locally it's,

149
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,390
for example, students quite often get disenfranchised because, you know,

150
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,420
they want you to bring

151
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,630
some idea or some proof that you live there.

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,630
Well, the students are like, well,

153
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,459
but I moved here from out of province so

154
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,420
I don't have like a driver's license or whatever

155
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:00,049
and I don't really have a utility bill because, you know,

156
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,549
I'm a poor student living with seven other people.

157
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,350
Right.

158
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:07,209
But like I attend the University of Alberta, you know,

159
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,549
and so,

160
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,279
I mean, the, the really rude part of this is,

161
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,320
is that there's a lot of people who are quite happy to disenfranchise people.

162
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:15,369
So they're quite happy

163
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:21,609
to use security, for example, as a excuse to, you know, disenfranchise people.

164
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,549
I mean, a great example of this is the airlines, right?

165
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,190
The airlines love the ID

166
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,489
to ticket laws because it eliminates the secondary market of

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,170
reselling your ticket if you can't make your flight.

168
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,760
-- Yep. Yep, that's very true.
-- You know,

169
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,329
they love that. Right?

170
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,950
Because I remember back in the day you would see ads for like, you know, uh

171
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,619
I have tickets to some nice exotic place a week from now.

172
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,640
I can't make it because I like, broke my leg,

173
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm selling these tickets at like 80% of what they're worth

174
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,480
or whatever. Right.

175
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,839
And you could just buy them,

176
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,450
right?

177
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,510
Because airline tickets were like these physical pieces of paper that literally

178
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,750
didn't have your name on them or anything.

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Sure.

180
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,410
And you, I mean,

181
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,239
you can make the argument about some level of security there because obviously

182
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,869
there are,

183
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,459
I guess evildoers who, who could abuse that. But, but I, I don't disagree with you.

184
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,350
I couldn't abuse it in any way that they couldn't abuse it with the existing

185
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,350
laws of like getting somebody who looks like them or swapping ID or whatever.

186
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:16,679
Right.

187
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,170
Yeah, that's fair. You know, the same thing.

188
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,390
I know some bus companies are trying to do that where, you know,

189
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,959
matching your ID to your bus ticket or same thing with, um, concert tickets.

190
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,369
Right. Trying to prevent scalping.

191
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,010
They have this thing now where, you know,

192
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,089
you have to bring the credit card that bought the tickets with you to get in.

193
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,729
So, the idea and, and what,

194
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:35,729
but what happens is then scalpers will get six tickets or whatever.

195
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,650
The maximum they can get usually is around six

196
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,099
and they'll walk five people in and leave.

197
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,729
Clever.

198
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,780
Right. Because if, if you're scalping tickets at 100% markup.

199
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,840
Well, you know, yeah, you eat one ticket for yourself,

200
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,020
but if you can sell five tickets at 100% markup,

201
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,130
that's still a good chunk of profit.

202
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:52,609
Yeah.

203
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,489
Yeah. Seriously. Seriously.

204
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,409
Yeah. So, anyway, anyway, let's,

205
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:56,710
I,

206
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't want to dwell on this point too much just because I

207
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,159
guess this kind of sets the stage so people need to go vote

208
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,630
and they need to record what they're doing and this is where we

209
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,929
start getting into some of the concepts of like the electronic voting machines

210
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,650
and, and kind of all the man is.

211
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,039
So, so see, what's interesting to me about voting

212
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,869
is the way we've structured voting in most of western democracies

213
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,190
is we have a couple of sort of conflicting goals.

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,179
We want you to cast a vote.

215
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,719
We want you to cast that vote in secret, right? You should be able to vote

216
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,369
and not have anyone know what your vote was. And

217
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,520
we also want you to be able to somehow verify

218
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,479
or validate that your vote wasn't monkeyed or tampered with,

219
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,099
but still be secret

220
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,179
that that part is becoming questionable.

221
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,799
So the way we solve it in Canada, as I've said before is, you know,

222
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,409
we make a mark on a piece of paper, shove it in a locked box

223
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,440
and you're going well. Ok, great. How's that? Secure?

224
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,450
Well, we have this idea of what are called scrutineers.

225
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,830
These are people that sit in the room and watch

226
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,989
and they're from different political parties.

227
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,760
See, that's the trick

228
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,159
you put paper in a box, it doesn't go through like a scanner first or anything.

229
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,840
Well, they, sometimes there are like the, not the federal elections but like the,

230
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:13,770
um, I think it was municipal,

231
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,059
whatever it was scanned and then put in a box so that the recount would be, you know,

232
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,039
it's relatively easy.

233
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,479
Right.

234
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,005
Right.

235
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,234
But essentially the,

236
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,405
the way we secure our elections is we have people

237
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,965
from multiple political parties and you can also have independence.

238
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:27,125
So, like, you could just be,

239
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,844
decide to be a scrutiny and go to a polling station and watch.

240
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,534
And so essentially who watches the watchers?

241
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,484
Well, the other watchers from the other political parties,

242
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,239
right.

243
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:35,780
And, and I,

244
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,390
I know in the US that exists where there are people

245
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,500
whose job is to just keep an eye on what's happening

246
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:43,580
in the room.

247
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,440
But I can't watch the insides of an electronic machine

248
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,580
and you can't. And

249
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,559
so I've lived in a number of places and I voted on a variety of machines.

250
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,820
My favorite to this day still is a long time ago.

251
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,640
They had these giant machines,

252
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,859
they were like taller than a person and they'd wheel them in

253
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,140
and they had like these weird little switches on

254
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,090
the inside and like you'd flick your switches and,

255
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,409
and ironically this

256
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,929
probably has a similar problem to electronic

257
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,590
voting where you'd flick little switches,

258
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,849
vote for the people you wanted

259
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,840
and, and it had like a little curtain that you draw.

260
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,479
So obviously no one could see you vote.

261
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,809
And my favorite part though is it had like this handle on

262
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,479
the front and you'd pull the handle over to it was,

263
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,349
you know, like, I think it was right to left.

264
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,489
If I'm remembering correctly,

265
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,809
you'd like, pull this handle over

266
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:33,729
and it would obviously record the vote in some way. It would reset the machine

267
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,210
-- and it would open the curtain.
-- Are these the ones that punched holes in paper?

268
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,979
I, I assume it was doing something behind the scenes but I know you

269
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,200
didn't.

270
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,049
-- No, I didn't, I don't know what it did actually because
-- I've seen that machine where,

271
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,210
where, like you set

272
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,530
the, the switches or whatever and then you could chunk it,

273
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:52,440
like you pull the lever and it could chunks and it punches holes in paper

274
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,010
and then you take that piece of paper and, and fold it up or whatever and,

275
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,419
and walk it over to the box and shove it in the box and,

276
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,780
and I'm ok with that because again, holes in paper, relatively easy to validate.

277
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,570
Right? I can look at that and understand it.

278
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,539
But you're saying there was this giant mechanical machine with,

279
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,799
-- I'm going to assume maybe a paper tape or something inside of it.
-- Something. Right?

280
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:13,669
I don't know what and, and it was, it was crazy.

281
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,719
I mean, in hindsight now that I think about it, that was,

282
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,570
that was probably my first time voting and I think it

283
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,340
might have been the only time I ever used that device,

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,750
-- which was a long time ago.
-- How do you?

285
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,409
But you never got to see what your vote was recorded

286
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,719
on and see this is what I hate about electronic systems,

287
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,020
is the electronic system will show me some representation of

288
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,429
what I,

289
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,690
how I voted.

290
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:38,099
But that may not be what was recorded.

291
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:41,020
And, and that's really the question, isn't it? Is kind of,

292
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,700
how do you know,

293
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:43,750
you make a black

294
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,940
mark on a piece of paper?

295
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,700
Well, yes, there's that.

296
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,369
No, you're absolutely right.

297
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,940
And it's funny because every security person

298
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,739
I know who pays attention to voting security

299
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,099
and I've read a lot about this just because it's one of those topics I enjoy

300
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,969
everybody who pays attention to this and

301
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,650
actually knows what they're talking about.

302
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,419
It is

303
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,450
almost unanimous

304
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,700
that you should have a paper ballot and people should fill out a paper ballot

305
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,890
and then you stick it in a machine, the machine can read it, it can read it.

306
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,150
Humans can count. It doesn't really matter. But like

307
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,489
that thing

308
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:25,250
is super important. Now, here's the one thing I keep thinking of

309
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,289
is kind of one of the issues with, with this model.

310
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:29,820
So

311
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:35,390
a paper ballot means you probably have to go somewhere to vote. Right.

312
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,719
That's kind of the fundamental behind that. And, and I feel like

313
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:42,289
making people go places it annoys me. Right.

314
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,239
I want to click a button on my computer and have things happen for me.

315
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,210
Well, so um I, I agree,

316
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:52,489
one of my concerns is that we typically hold elections for one day.

317
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,250
Well, and you know, some people like

318
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,640
that's just not super convenient or they might be bedridden or

319
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,369
whatever.

320
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,169
So I, I would prefer to see better availability of mail in voting.

321
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:08,000
I would love that and personally, I, I would almost prefer to see

322
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:08,789
II,

323
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,000
I definitely understand the allure of just 100%

324
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,150
mail in voting like we send out the packets

325
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,469
and when we get the packets back, that's great because let's face it, right?

326
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:20,119
The US postal system and the Canadian postal system

327
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:24,510
are like basically the gold standard for you put an object into it

328
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,150
and it pops out at the other end

329
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,890
end of story like it almost always works

330
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,260
in like two days, right?

331
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,900
It it blows my mind.

332
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:34,650
Yeah.

333
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,830
Yeah and affordably.

334
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,590
Yeah.

335
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:40,900
And like, I mean, I I know for example, you know,

336
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:43,719
you can mail well within Canada, you can't export them.

337
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,909
But you know, people mail firearms around

338
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,700
and the only deal is you got to put a trigger lock on the gun. When you send it,

339
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,070
it doesn't even have to be in a locked case again

340
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,760
just and and literally the RC MP says you must

341
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,979
use Canada Post's highest level of secure mail signature required.

342
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,960
That's what it says on the web page. I'm not making this up, right? I checked sweet.

343
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,400
So, I, I definitely would

344
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,710
love to have mail

345
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,770
voting because, yeah, I mean, I just get my packet.

346
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,369
Scribble Scribble Scribble, shove it back in the post.

347
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,630
I would even assume that they would have like, postage

348
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,070
return handled. So I don't have to go buy stamps.

349
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,190
You know, I, I would assume because like you can,

350
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,309
you can send mail to your MP for free in Canada.

351
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,359
That's neat.

352
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,909
Well, it's, it's part of, well, but think about it 100 100 and 50 years ago.

353
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,260
How else would you contact that guy?

354
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,840
-- Uh, that is true. There were no telephones.
-- Well,

355
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,719
not for poor people.

356
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,929
Right. Right.

357
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
-- Right.
-- And, and sorry to be sexist.

358
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,599
But when I say guy, but if you look at the history of Canada, yeah, like we,

359
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,820
yeah, it's only within about the last 50 years that we've had women in politics,

360
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,559
really, like most of the western world

361
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,400
which we do need more of.

362
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:50,320
If you are a lady listening, please get involved in politics, please.

363
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,539
I think we just need more people that are passionate,

364
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,859
involved in whatever it is they're passionate about. Be it, politics or cooking.

365
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,679
-- I, I think that would not be a terrible outcome,
-- man.

366
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,659
I, that's a topic for another day.

367
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,020
I question if, if being passionate about politics is the right prerequisite.

368
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,619
But, but anyway, anyway,

369
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,159
so,

370
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,880
so here's where I want this conversation to end up at and I think we kind of keep rat

371
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,200
holing ourselves just because this is one of those interesting

372
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,799
topics that we could go off on tangents forever.

373
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,419
But, but here's the real question,

374
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,239
can we make

375
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,799
an electronic voting machine

376
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,479
that is secure?

377
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,479
Well, no, the problem is it doesn't have to just be secure.

378
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:31,520
-- It also has to be verifiable both to myself and to others. I
-- would

379
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,109
-- lump that into the definition of
-- security.

380
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,799
Well, but let's be clear what we mean by secure because for example,

381
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,239
I if I'm voting on an electronic machine, I want to be able to validate my vote,

382
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,059
easily,

383
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,969
not requiring some app and double crypto proof and encryption keys.

384
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:47,219
And this that and the other thing,

385
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,059
right?

386
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,969
It also my vote needs to be verifiable

387
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:55,219
to someone else who may not be very technologically sophisticated. You know,

388
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,299
with the current system,

389
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,330
we have a scrutineer can be like an 80 year old woman who as long as she's not blind

390
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,460
can, you know, it's pretty easy to understand the process.

391
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,130
People get a piece of paper, they go into the booth, they make a mark on the paper,

392
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,660
they fold it, they shove it in the box

393
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,188
at some point. We then

394
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,608
open the box, either there or we take it to a central place and open the box there,

395
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:14,708
take all the votes out, sort them, count them.

396
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,958
That's the process, right?

397
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,138
That is super easy to scrutinize you just watch

398
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:22,279
and make sure like make sure nobody's marking ballots,

399
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:22,428
you know,

400
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:26,198
make sure nobody's ripping ballots up and throwing them away or eating them or

401
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:29,259
whatever has been tried in the past. I'm sure there's millions of things,

402
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,298
you know, hiding them in sandwiches.

403
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:35,519
Whereas, you know, the electronic one is like, yeah, no,

404
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,598
I even with unlimited budget

405
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:38,198
and,

406
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,009
and I know there's cryptography around this where

407
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,159
I can have like a secure vote mechanism

408
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,660
that, you know, third parties and myself, you know, zero knowledge proofs.

409
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,849
We can all validate it.

410
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,050
Yeah, I, and just the cost and the complexity of implementing it correctly.

411
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,160
So that's the other thing, right, is

412
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,510
implementing paper votes correctly,

413
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,390
relatively simple and cost effective implementing

414
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,349
these electronic systems that get used for

415
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,510
once every couple years.

416
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,589
You know, that's the other ugly truth. Right?

417
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,349
That, that is true.

418
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,199
It doesn't, well, once a year, we'll say maybe twice, but generally speaking,

419
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,630
I think once a year is probably correct.

420
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,150
And, and where did the machines go

421
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,310
for the rest of the year?

422
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:18,680
We

423
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,500
store

424
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,920
them

425
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:20,729
vlad

426
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,670
storage service offered to store them for free.

427
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,069
Let's use him.

428
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,530
Right.

429
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,540
You know, and that's, that's the thing, right?

430
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,910
Like even, I mean, unless you're in some really

431
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,630
strange place. Yeah, you're going to be having elections at most, maybe once a year,

432
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:35,920
maybe twice on a really weird year.

433
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,989
I remember one year we had,

434
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:40,750
I think we had two federal elections in one year because it went a whole bonkers.

435
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,930
-- Uh,
-- I know I voted more than once a year,

436
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,469
a couple of times where there's primary elections and

437
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,969
in a bunch of crazy stuff like that.

438
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,050
But regardless it

439
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,780
more, even if it's five times a year,

440
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,270
you're talking about machines sitting in storage for a significant amount of time.

441
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:56,540
Yeah.

442
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,150
Right. Without question.

443
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,589
And, ok, so, so here's,

444
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:03,020
you rattled off a whole bunch of words

445
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:07,170
and they mean something to me and probably some of the listeners. But I think

446
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,930
here's the thing I keep thinking of

447
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,050
is somebody who doesn't really understand computer security

448
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,650
and they hear somebody say, oh, this voting machine is secure,

449
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:19,930
why would they believe them or not? Believe them.

450
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,689
Well, they wouldn't believe them because most

451
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,599
machines of this class.

452
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:28,069
So I think generally we lump voting machines in with say like ATM S

453
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,250
and slot machines and that it's a very sort of specific use computer,

454
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,900
right? It sort of does one thing and one thing only hopefully,

455
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,719
and the reality is what's, what's really sad to me is,

456
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,130
is I know for a fact that like ATM S and,

457
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,910
and slot machines have much higher and

458
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,650
more rigorous security standards than voting machines

459
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,380
-- in the US.
-- We should just get those guys to,

460
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,569
well, the funny thing is no de

461
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,520
bold makes ATM S and makes voting machines and they, they've,

462
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,890
do you not remember the whole kerfuffle about DeBolt

463
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,689
being found to make them much less secure voting machines than they made ATM. S

464
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,079
which doesn't surprise me because the banks were paying much closer attention.

465
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:05,459
I'm sure

466
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,689
the guy running de

467
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,140
bold promised to deliver an election to a candidate.

468
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,209
Remember that?

469
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,130
Yeah, let's not get into that.

470
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,780
Well, but that's part of the problem is so the people making this system,

471
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,739
these systems,

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,270
they're humans, they,

473
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,959
are they not allowed to vote or are they not allowed to participate in politics?

474
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,859
Do they have to recuse themselves from the election?

475
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,660
I don't think so. I think that would be terrible.

476
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,079
So I,

477
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:30,650
I think that would be a terrible system if the

478
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,300
people who built it had to recuse themselves because that,

479
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,300
that would suggest it had some sort of weakness that was so bad

480
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,949
that you can't trust the people who built it. But then more importantly,

481
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:45,140
that just means it's so fundamentally flawed. You really can't trust

482
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,780
-- it.
-- Well, and see, that's the problem is building a system that is both secure

483
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,459
and verifiable by a third party.

484
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,140
And I don't mean just verifiable in the sense of like, oh,

485
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,910
your vote was recorded correctly, it went through.

486
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,349
But like,

487
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,410
you know, I we would need people to verify the bootloader because for example,

488
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,930
the, the voting machine might have firmware that says, OK, you know,

489
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:10,579
for 364 days of the year run the, the correct, you know, safe firmware.

490
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:12,689
But on election day run the, you know,

491
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,729
run the crazy teapot party firmware or whatever,

492
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,209
you know,

493
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,650
how do we validate that? Right. Because that's the thing, right?

494
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,969
Is these things are so complicated that,

495
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,410
you know, just,

496
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,359
just a tiny change to load a slightly different

497
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,780
file and the whole system is completely different.

498
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,140
That is

499
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,010
perfectly reasonable. Yes.

500
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,219
Well, not only that, actually, it's funny you mentioned that, uh,

501
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,780
there was some security researcher at one

502
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,790
point that was attacking electronic voting machines

503
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,119
and there was like a USB port on it,

504
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,599
right? And you're already relatively private when you're voting.

505
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,750
So you could easily muck with the machine itself.

506
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:51,540
Right?

507
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,040
Well, they, they've done that where they had the,

508
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,989
the USB thing where they just basically plug the USB thing

509
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,619
and reset the machine and booted or whatever off the USB and

510
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,540
like you now own that machine

511
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,260
and there's no way to validate it.

512
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,050
So

513
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:04,939
see, that's the thing.

514
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,140
So like here's the, the thing that really annoys me is,

515
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,849
is a lot of these problems have generally been solved.

516
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,189
So a

517
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:12,609
good example might be like a Nintendo switch.

518
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,630
Those things are actually pretty secure because you know, Nintendo

519
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:16,579
actually,

520
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:17,069
so funny

521
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,619
enough, the

522
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,410
first

523
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,260
generation,

524
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,900
the first generation switches have like a special USB boot mode,

525
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,540
like built into the actual processor itself.

526
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,869
Yeah, they can't fix it in

527
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,219
software.

528
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,239
Nintendo's releasing a new version of the switch that has a much nicer screen,

529
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm told

530
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,420
and probably also fixes this problem.

531
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:39,410
And that's a perfect example is the company is incentivized

532
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,699
to fix as many of these machines as they can.

533
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,270
Right. With voting systems is, you know, we're not using them on a daily basis.

534
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
We use them like once a year.

535
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,390
Oh, this thing has a flaw. Well, we can't fix it today.

536
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,579
Well, in, and not only that

537
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,170
they're not widely available, the switch is widely available.

538
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,890
I just read a statistic. They sold 22.8 million units, I think is the number I saw.

539
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:04,699
That's,

540
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,270
and,

541
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,109
and those are in the hands of many people and

542
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,310
some people have obviously done the research and cracked it,

543
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,630
whereas something like a voting machine is not the sort of

544
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,109
thing you're going to see in the hands of everybody.

545
00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:14,630
Right.

546
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,349
It's going to be hard to get a hold of these things.

547
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,369
Well, sadly, it's, you can buy used ones quite easily on ebay and, you know,

548
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,829
people were doing that and finding out that the

549
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,739
hard drives and whatnot had not been wiped.

550
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,630
Oh, I have no doubt.

551
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,739
I would be shocked if they were white.

552
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,270
Um

553
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,880
But so I personally, yeah, I mean, we keep coming back to, yes, in theory,

554
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,469
we can build a technological electronic solution that is secure.

555
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,260
But then even if you build something that is secure,

556
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,910
how do you build something that is both secure and again, like I said,

557
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,349
verifiable by third parties that are not, you know, n

558
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:53,349
or

559
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,819
a university research lab with 20 people.

560
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,390
But like you and me, let alone a normal person.

561
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:02,160
So

562
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:06,640
why, why do we want to say, let's say mail in ballots are secure?

563
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,579
What would stop somebody from intercepting a

564
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,089
bunch of these ballots and changing them

565
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,020
or, or

566
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,199
just removing them from, from voting?

567
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,199
Well, that's a great thing is

568
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,670
these things are not 100% secure but they

569
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,819
are difficult to tamper with and modify at scale

570
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:26,739
now.

571
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,660
And I know there's elections where we've literally, I think we had, I,

572
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,239
I mentioned this before but we had an election and there was a riding in Calgary,

573
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:35,119
literally one vote difference.

574
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,310
Like they had like,

575
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,800
I think some five or six recounts because like

576
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,310
literally it boiled down to one vote difference.

577
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,900
So, you know, so that's not common, but

578
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:45,969
it is.

579
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:50,290
So there even a small amount of tampering could potentially have a big effect,

580
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,430
right?

581
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,979
Like my understanding is with the US election,

582
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,939
there's only a couple dozen or like it was

583
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:57,459
like 50 or 60 counties where if you'd managed to

584
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,420
swing the vote one way or the other, you,

585
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,099
you could have had a totally different outcome to the US federal election.

586
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,359
Yes,

587
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:08,180
it was something like 30,000 people basically decided the presidential election,

588
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:08,819
which is

589
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,939
like an astronomically small number in the big picture.

590
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,250
But so that's the thing is, you know, we, we have to,

591
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,819
we have to concern ourselves with the sort of more realistic attacks,

592
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,739
you know, can somebody subvert a single voter?

593
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,209
Of course, I could glue your doors shut and then you can't go vote.

594
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:31,349
Well, and that used to be a really big problem.

595
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,400
I know back in like the 19 twenties,

596
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,910
early 19 hundreds where basically you'd show up and vote

597
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,099
and then

598
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:41,020
you'd get dinner, but only if you voted for the right person

599
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,319
and like,

600
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,699
if I was hungry, I, I'd do that.

601
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,839
Who, who I vote for? I need, I need to eat.

602
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:50,030
Yeah.

603
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,069
So, and well, one could argue we already have that issue with, you know,

604
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,989
politicians making promises that they then do not follow through on.

605
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,819
Um, you know, like we were, we were, I don't want to say promised electoral reform,

606
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:06,630
but it was very strongly implied and made up, you know, a fundamental campaign

607
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,900
platform piece

608
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,829
and it's not happening.

609
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,069
So I'm a little miffed about that because I would like to see electoral reform.

610
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,099
But, you know, we did get legalized marijuana.

611
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,630
So they followed through on that, which is nice and, and I'm guessing

612
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,199
to put it bluntly, you know,

613
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:21,020
that's one of the promises the liberals made

614
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,250
because they knew that would be popular with

615
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,300
a lot of young voters and a lot of old voters who are against the liberals,

616
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,619
well, that they're still going to be against the liberals.

617
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,359
It doesn't matter,

618
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,979
you know,

619
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,560
it's true. Um

620
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,109
So,

621
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,300
yeah, so I think we have to sort of put that aside to some degree.

622
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,400
So tampering with the system itself. Yeah, definitely. That, that is illegal.

623
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,579
Uh, usually very illegal in most jurisdictions. Right. Tampering with votes.

624
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,670
Uh, but again, it's,

625
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,890
it's difficult to do at scale with something like the post office and,

626
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,130
and quite frankly, if the post office is in on it,

627
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,459
you know,

628
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,349
it's not like the post office is some monolithic, you know,

629
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,699
evil corporation controlled by the lizardman.

630
00:26:59,709 --> 00:26:59,949
Like,

631
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:03,739
I'm pretty sure the post office is roughly like 5050 Democratic and Republican.

632
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,619
Just like the rest of America.

633
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,140
You haven't, I'm sure we could find a website that disagrees with you.

634
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:11,189
Well, you know,

635
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:14,260
it's actually the reason the post office is the way it is because of the flat earth,

636
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,430
right?

637
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:17,650
-- They just shoot the mail out of cannons anyways.
-- That's

638
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:17,989
right.

639
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,469
Ok. Ok. So let's assume subverting the mail is hard.

640
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:26,550
What about a box full of paper ballots? How hard is it to subvert that?

641
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,949
Well, when there's multiple scrutineers keeping an eye on it pretty difficult,

642
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,510
especially when those

643
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,459
are going to transport the ballots to somewhere.

644
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,439
So the, the ballot boxes are sealed, you know, by elections. Canada,

645
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,209
right?

646
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,270
With like those security tags like you'd see on

647
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,209
an electric meter or whatever kind of same idea,

648
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:44,369
right?

649
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,369
Little plastic thing with serial number and whatnot.

650
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:51,089
And so, you know, you'd have to cut that tag to

651
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,729
open the box and tamper with it.

652
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:54,920
Right.

653
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:57,119
What, what if I just steal the box?

654
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,050
Ok. So actually I think once uh hang on a second election missing,

655
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:08,089
I know that's happened in other countries where like just, oh yeah,

656
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,319
all the boxes from this one riding that typically

657
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,290
votes not the way we like went missing.

658
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,250
I think there was a case of some boxes being missing for a while,

659
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,089
but they were like literally left in the back

660
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,189
of the truck by accident or something stupid.

661
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,689
And then they were found a few hours later

662
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,390
and the seals were still intact.

663
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,760
But again, people,

664
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,410
pe people are people, man,

665
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,719
you know,

666
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:30,689
-- it
-- is true. People are

667
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,689
um

668
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,229
again, you know, it

669
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,520
generally speaking, these systems generally work, we don't screw them up too much.

670
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:44,160
And, and here's the important thing that, that you've discussed this whole time.

671
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,599
I've asked you these questions.

672
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,180
If you're going to modify a paper ballot,

673
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:52,160
you have to go to a place and do it.

674
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,660
And in most instances,

675
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:58,189
especially in a country the size of Canada or the United

676
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,849
States because while Canada doesn't have a ton of people,

677
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,599
it is an enormous place.

678
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:05,040
You would have to subvert

679
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,750
probably millions to, maybe

680
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,660
you'd only have to probably subvert a few

681
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,880
tho if you did it strategically, you'd probably actually only have to subvert

682
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:20,160
a few dozen or 100 ridings to swing certain key ridings to whichever MP you wanted.

683
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,630
But still that would be

684
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,819
so, so.

685
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,569
Exactly. Right.

686
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:28,920
Like people would notice that, ok, in these 30 places,

687
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:30,660
the votes have all disappeared.

688
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:33,079
We can't accept this as a valid election.

689
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:34,780
You, you basically,

690
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,939
the point is when you're dealing with paper and physical things,

691
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,109
somebody is going to figure out what happened. It would be in it.

692
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,260
It's like movie, plot security to subvert that to the point. Nobody notices. Now,

693
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:51,089
let's say we have an electronic machine,

694
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,609
you could subvert

695
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,719
that particular election depending upon how it's set up.

696
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,270
But generally speaking, you have the machines that vote

697
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,859
right person goes, they push the buttons on the machine.

698
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,819
The machine is usually networked to some central machine at the voting station

699
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,329
and then that central machine reports the results into some

700
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,410
other central location where it's all tallied and put together.

701
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,290
So you have multiple instances where this could be monkeyed with.

702
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,520
But most importantly

703
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,479
is if somebody could subvert the,

704
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,790
the data and it is probably traveling over the internet, let's face it.

705
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,130
-- You don't
-- have

706
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,030
to be there,

707
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,550
you can be in another country

708
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,420
-- and you could monkey with this
-- election.

709
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:33,140
And that

710
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,130
truth is with most of those, these electronic systems,

711
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,829
you can then tidy up after yourself.

712
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,979
-- Right. Exactly. Like nobody need know if you do it
-- right.

713
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:47,510
And I'm guessing most of these voting machines don't have like really

714
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,780
like NSA levels of like security auditing and you know, cryptographic logging

715
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,410
on the device because like these things,

716
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,619
some of them are still running windows 95 or XP or whatever,

717
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:01,979
almost certainly. And, and I guess that is,

718
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,329
that's kind of the crux of this. Right.

719
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,880
Ignoring all other potential problems with voting,

720
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,380
which are for the most part you can deal.

721
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:11,800
I

722
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,410
wish we just did the purple thumb.

723
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:17,239
Like a lot of countries where they don't have good record keeping.

724
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,290
It's like

725
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,530
you vote, you dip your, uh thumb in indelible ink

726
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,250
and you don't get to vote again that day, right?

727
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,359
We, you know, so you could, in theory have, you know,

728
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,300
a bunch of people dog pile a couple of different writings, you know,

729
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,489
come from out of riding to vote and vote in a riding and swing that riding.

730
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,660
But it,

731
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,920
the purple thumb thing solves the voting multiple

732
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,180
times from assuming that you have thumbs,

733
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,660
right?

734
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,339
And, and that would be acceptable for like a federal election obviously, but,

735
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,969
but could create some issues for local things.

736
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,420
But regardless

737
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,699
it, it is a huge, huge

738
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:54,020
problem solver and it is painfully simple.

739
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,579
Now, now, I guess here's,

740
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,310
here's where we, we bring it all home and wrap this up no matter what we want to do.

741
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,550
There is no way and, and I'm sure you agree with this. There is no way

742
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,829
we can have

743
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:11,880
an electronic voting system and this is even true of internet voting

744
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,040
that we can honestly trust given our infrastructure today.

745
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,949
-- I won't say
-- it'll never happen.

746
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:17,390
It's even

747
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:17,729
worse than

748
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:18,180
that. It's,

749
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,439
they can't even begin to approach

750
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,989
the safety, security and verifiability of a paper based system.

751
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,810
Anything approaching the cost.

752
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:29,949
That's that too. I

753
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:30,630
like

754
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:31,280
that.

755
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:35,560
You just can't build this thing for what it costs to print paper ballots.

756
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,979
And, and I guess that's,

757
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,780
yes, I, I think you just summed it up perfectly.

758
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,939
Is we,

759
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:46,670
we have the infrastructure in the physical world

760
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,380
to operate an election using physical objects,

761
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,310
ie paper ballots in this instance.

762
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:55,989
And that is because we have a certain structure of society that lends itself to this,

763
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,310
right? Like the idea of having a paper vote, if you say are, are in,

764
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,959
we'll say go back, you know,

765
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,979
thousands of years to a tribal like society that wouldn't

766
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:09,079
work because they lack certain infrastructure to make it happen.

767
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,280
We have that

768
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,199
we'd lack the technical infrastructure to implement proper electronic voting

769
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,099
and someday we might get it,

770
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,739
but we don't have it today.

771
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,609
We could do it, but it would not be affordable and I'm not sure it would be verifiable.

772
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,119
II, I don't think so.

773
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,569
I think if I told you, you literally have all the money in the world,

774
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,739
go make the secure.

775
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,030
I don't think you could do it.

776
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,640
Well, see, and that's the challenge is I, you know,

777
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,280
I want something that's more secure than a switch for boot loading.

778
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,619
And I want something, you know, that's,

779
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,030
and these are, yeah, these are,

780
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,660
the other problem is I'm not going to sell 28 million voting machines.

781
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:45,030
Right. I'm gonna sell tens of thousands of voting machines.

782
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,680
Right.

783
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:45,869
And,

784
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,290
and if someone wants to give me all the money in the world to develop secure voting,

785
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,550
like I'm willing to try just in case, just in case.

786
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,229
But,

787
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:56,619
but no, I mean, I, I think you're totally right. There's just,

788
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,630
I think that there's not enough economic incentive to do it. Right.

789
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,310
And I think we just don't have the infrastructure today

790
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:06,229
to have an honest conversation around this topic. And so we end up in a position

791
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:10,899
where we have people, there's half truth and in some cases just lies

792
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,820
for, for something that let's face it. Like paper solves.

793
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:17,530
Right. That's, that's the honest answer at the end of the day, paper solves it.

794
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,870
It's not just the paper solves it, it's, it's worked quite well for over 100 years.

795
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,360
We've ironed, like we've had over 100 years to iron out the kinks.

796
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,760
And if you read about some of the

797
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,070
election shenanigans like Chicago in the 19 twenties,

798
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,168
I think was a good example.

799
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,090
You know, where, get out the dead vote and

800
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,447
give people sandwiches to vote and stuff.

801
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:39,819
Yeah. No, we've, we've largely solved those problems

802
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:44,358
affordably too. Right. It's not like we need some big task force. It's,

803
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:46,368
it's, uh,

804
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:47,467
yeah.

805
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:54,810
All right. So, let's, let's end this one here. I guess in summary, go paper ballots.

806
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,729
Don't, don't use electronic voting, please.

807
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,010
And that is that and,

808
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,860
and I guess unfortunately there are people in places that are

809
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,489
trying to use electronic voting and I weep for you.

810
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,010
So good luck

811
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:11,510
-- vote.
-- Anyway, I was just looking at Estonia. They, but they are a special case.

812
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,489
So they have those, you know, national ID cards with the crypto chips on them,

813
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,389
which they have to replace now because that one crypto chip

814
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,080
was found to generate weak keys but ignoring those minor details.

815
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,199
I'm just looking at this. This is quite interesting.

816
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,649
Uh This is

817
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:25,090
um

818
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,030
doesn't, oh, this is for 2005.

819
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,469
So it's probably changed but number of persons with the right vote,

820
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,310
uh 1,060,000 give or take

821
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,459
votes 500,000. So 50% voter turnout sounds about right for everybody.

822
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,530
Number of E voters, 9000, 317 E votes counted

823
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,439
909,000, 287 E votes canceled 30.

824
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,780
So that's interesting.

825
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,379
So even even a country where they've

826
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:52,479
deployed a huge amount of specialized infrastructure,

827
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:55,179
like, you know, these national ID cards with, you know, the,

828
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:57,530
the the cryptographic chips on them and everything.

829
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Well, 13 years ago was not,

830
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,439
I would say getting a lot of value for their money on this E voting.

831
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:04,459
Uh maybe it's changed. I don't know.

832
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,919
But yeah, fundamentally as a computer security person,

833
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,219
I am just not comfortable with electronic voting

834
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,979
-- and
-- that, that pretty much sums it up and maybe someday but definitely not today.

835
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,320
All right, cool. Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

836
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,810
You can go to open source security podcast.com, hit up the show notes

837
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:26,580
or hit us up on social media with the Pound Os S podcast. Hashtag And I guess

838
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:30,370
more than anything if you're listening to this before the election, please,

839
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,719
please, please vote,

840
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,239
please. It's important.

841
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,929
-- All right, Kurt have a fantastic rest of your day. You too.
-- Thanks everybody.

842
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,120
Thank you. Bye bye.
