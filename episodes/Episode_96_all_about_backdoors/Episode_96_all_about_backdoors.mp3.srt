Hello and welcome to episode 96 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,289
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,050
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,460
-- How are you
-- doing, Kurt?

4
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,800
Good, good, summer's here. It's awesome.

5
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:18,600
Sweet.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,610
So, I assume that just means you have less snow, right?

7
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,059
Yeah. And the grass is going from brown to green.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,889
-- Wow.
-- Fantastic.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,799
-- Oh, goodness. But now you have to mow the lawn. So there's that.
-- Yes. Yes.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,919
-- I think my kids are almost old enough to do it. Maybe next
-- mine totally are.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,029
And it's awesome.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,669
-- That must be lovely.
-- It, it is. It's very nice.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,169
Yes. But

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,470
anyway, anyway,

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,700
so we,

16
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,069
we had a chat after the last episode and

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,340
we thought it could be good to talk about backdoors

18
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:53,330
as, as we discussed the get cookies backdoor last time.

19
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:58,720
But in, in this time, do it in the context of legal backdoors.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,230
Well, or even more, maybe specifically the legally mandated backdoors.

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,510
Right. Because I'm pretty sure,

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,120
yeah, I don't,

23
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,480
I don't fully understand or know what would constitute a legal

24
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,180
backdoor as far as like an end user license agreement goes.

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,089
Uh,

26
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,239
-- so that's
-- that

27
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:22,150
I wouldn't even think of it in terms of end user licenses.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,050
But we'll say, like law enforcement,

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,260
I

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:24,540
mean, by

31
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,690
the

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,150
back

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,110
door where it's not,

34
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:28,250
you,

35
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:33,319
you have to put this back door in or else some consequence occurs.

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,870
And, I mean, this is not a new topic. I actually had to look like

37
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,349
this is, this has been going on literally for decades. I mean, we have the, uh,

38
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,300
sort of the last, yeah, the last sort of major,

39
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:48,190
one of the last major revs of this was in 1994.

40
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:48,940
So that's uh

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,089
oh my God, that's 28 years ago.

42
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,239
Sorry. 18,

43
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:56,440
wait, I can't math so good.

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,319
Yeah, 24 years ago. Holy.

45
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,910
Wow, sorry. That's.

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,980
Yeah. Wow. Uh Anyways, this is this thing called ka

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,239
the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act

48
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09,899
and essentially my understanding of what triggered it is um

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,000
phones, OK.

50
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,539
This is going back, old timey phones were, you know,

51
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,529
like electromechanical relay switch devices

52
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,639
and like literally back in the olden days, you, you would tap a phone by literally

53
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,710
like taping a tape recorder and, you know,

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,800
hooking up the, not a microphone but like a, a wire with like two alligator clips

55
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:32,039
and like attaching that physically to somebody's phone line,

56
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,169
right? You know,

57
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,539
like straight up and,

58
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,770
and because I remember reading about how to detect

59
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,339
wiretaps back in the day and they would,

60
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,779
they would do things like, look for voltage loss, you know, like, oh, like

61
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,869
normally your phone line is like five volts. Now it's like 4.1 right?

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,729
Something like that.

63
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,429
And, you know, just all these things that it's like, like,

64
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,630
and I couldn't understand until it wasn't frame, you know,

65
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,169
till I put it in the frame of, oh, yeah, like really old timey technology because,

66
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,710
you know, back in the nineties everything was becoming computerized.

67
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:01,690
Just

68
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,710
-- it was that simple. And
-- it's also worth noting that

69
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,050
if, if we want to go back in time, you can,

70
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,289
a telegraph is probably the easiest way

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,429
to describe it where a telegraph was literally

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,589
a wire between two places,

73
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:15,350
right?

74
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,339
And so obviously tapping telegraph lines was incredibly trivial.

75
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,029
And then we got the telephone network and now we had

76
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,100
a wire

77
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:23,979
from,

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,330
well, telegraphs used two wires.

79
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,949
They didn't, they used a single wire with the earth as the sink

80
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,289
because I always was wondering about that because

81
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,110
yeah, I mean, how,

82
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,369
yeah, no telegraphs crazy. Cool. A single wire magic.

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,470
Right. Right.

84
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,160
So anyway, but,

85
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,850
but the trick with telephones was you had a wire from your house to a central office

86
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,690
and then the central office could magically connect wires as needed.

87
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,690
But we were still basically talking about

88
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,380
like a hard connection between your phone. Like

89
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,509
-- you were talking
-- to,

90
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,729
it was not

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,270
a packet based network.

92
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,279
It was a circuit based network where and it would

93
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:03,649
literally physically complete a circuit between you and the other party

94
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,139
Right. Right. Exactly.

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,169
And, and even then

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,740
I, I know there were wiretap laws about what law enforcement could and couldn't do

97
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,579
in terms of listening in, on conversations on telephones.

98
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,200
And this was also funny because,

99
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,470
you know, there's always like the old timey movies

100
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,670
where you've got the operator listening in and like that, that totally happened.

101
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,790
-- I mean, there's nothing that really stopped them from doing.
-- Well.

102
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,619
You had party lines in rural areas where you literally had a single phone line

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,059
servicing like 10 houses

104
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,779
and you literally would pick up the phone

105
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,959
and hear other people talking and supposed to,

106
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,040
you're supposed to put it down and wait your turn,

107
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,519
right. Which is just crazy to think about.

108
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,359
I mean, could you imagine something like that today? Just,

109
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,760
um, so

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,750
basically what what happened is, you know, back in the day, physically,

111
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,859
wiretapping stuff was easy.

112
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,809
You basically just had law enforcement drive over to the phone company and like

113
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,320
plug in some equipment. And of course, then, you know,

114
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,399
the phone company started doing it and just

115
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,119
charging law enforcement for it because uh ultimately,

116
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,980
now the beauty is wiretapping has actually become a,

117
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,910
a profit center for a lot of phone carriers,

118
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,399
right? They, uh in one case, they accidentally sent out the bill

119
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,410
for the wiretapping also to the suspect.

120
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,109
Whoops. Yeah,

121
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,040
that happened. And um,

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,690
so yeah, back but the, the thing that was happening is, you know,

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,640
phone systems were becoming computerized and more importantly,

124
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:29,850
uh phone calls were, well, the last mile was still, you know, physically your wire,

125
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:30,609
you know, running

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,529
like an old tiny rotary telephone or whatever.

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,269
But the back end the back haul was becoming things like, you know, FDD I, the fiber,

128
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,529
what is it, fiber distributed data interface?

129
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,730
I don't know. Sure. Yeah.

130
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,910
So you basically, you know,

131
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,140
you had fiber optics connecting all the major phone exchanges, you know,

132
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,630
with computers basically packets

133
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,339
the data,

134
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:51,329
shoving it over this fiber loop. And you know,

135
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:54,859
a lot better because the local phone company actually has

136
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,339
a museum and they have a um a section of wire

137
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,809
and it's a 3600 pair of wire. So it's 3600 pairs of very small wire.

138
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:03,809
And like

139
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:04,989
literally, you know,

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,690
people like you think a backhoe hitting a fiber is bad

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,630
nowadays with like 10 or 20 or 50 fibers in that wire

142
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,730
in that cable.

143
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:12,329
You know,

144
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,540
they literally would have instances where like a cable with

145
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:17,690
3600 physical pairs of wires would get dug up.

146
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,820
Yeah. Good luck splicing that thing.

147
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,070
Some poor bugger had to go down the hole and like spend, you know,

148
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,910
-- the rest of the month splicing
-- wire, man.

149
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:26,570
That's crazy

150
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,790
to think about.

151
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,700
Yeah. So

152
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:31,350
anyways they, so, you know, law enforcement,

153
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:31,959
you know,

154
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,739
they're not stupid and they saw the coming

155
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,890
computerization of it and kind of went well,

156
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:36,380
hey,

157
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,269
we can make this a heck of a lot more, uh,

158
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,779
easy and, you know, harder to detect by basically, you know,

159
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,529
forcing people who build this computer equipment

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,790
and software and whatnot

161
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,839
to put in the legally mandated back door so that we can go to the carrier and say,

162
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,619
you know, that guy over there with this phone number,

163
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,720
I want you to record

164
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,970
all the

165
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,980
conversations on that phone line out and incoming,

166
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,119
you know, and sent us that recording,

167
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,510
however, burn it to CD or whatever,

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,690
you know, and, and Bill of for Sweet. Right.

169
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,709
And, and that's basically what happened, you know,

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,619
the difference here being is that,

171
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:14,980
you know, there was still, the carriers were still heavily involved, right?

172
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,660
Like law enforcement didn't have like a direct line in,

173
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,570
uh, to the equipment to simply, you know, tell it to do what they want.

174
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,570
And I don't think that's really ever happened anywhere,

175
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,410
to be honest, not that I've read

176
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,670
-- what, what has happened where, well,
-- in the sense,

177
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:32,399
I don't think law enforcement has ever really been given like

178
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,809
unfettered access to switching equipment to, you know, turn tapping on and off

179
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,269
documents.

180
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:40,640
Well,

181
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:41,440
-- what happened
-- there?

182
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:47,559
Subtle difference. My understanding of that is that the NSA had traffic mirrored

183
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,609
to them.

184
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,739
Right. So kind of like a port span.

185
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,109
Well, basically it's, it's a, it's,

186
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,970
yeah, it's, it's a hair of a difference,

187
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,399
but essentially my understanding of that is,

188
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,230
is that they had traffic like a span mirror.

189
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:03,000
So, and then they basically just all the traffic coming in out of that

190
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:08,119
whatever device computer was then sent down a pipe, you know, to room,

191
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,489
whatever that magic room in that AT&T building was called.

192
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,170
For example,

193
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,239
where the NSA had a whole bunch of intercept equipment set up.

194
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,709
So it's, it's functionally basically the same thing. Actually. You're right.

195
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,429
Right.

196
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,399
You know, and,

197
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,420
and basically the biggest thing is this is before we even had an inkling of

198
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,230
in properly encrypted communications, especially properly encrypted,

199
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:31,690
end to end communications for, for lack of a better word, civilians, consumers.

200
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,460
Right.

201
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:33,119
Right. Right.

202
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,650
And, and in fact,

203
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,830
that's a really good point because I think in the last couple of years

204
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:42,229
is when end to end communications have really kind of become a big thing.

205
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,708
Whereas before that you had what, like GP G

206
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:49,768
and GP G was terrible to use or I guess P GP, depending upon how you want to call it.

207
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:50,629
-- That's true. It's
-- not

208
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:50,838
like

209
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,289
I'm sorry it has.

210
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,189
And the other thing I think that's really happened, that's interesting to me is

211
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,859
literally every, like, chat program that I have

212
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,960
or not chat program rather.

213
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:02,900
But chat service,

214
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,580
like every chat service in the last five years has just

215
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,380
added voice and video calls as a feature like slack.

216
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:09,510
Right. Right.

217
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,250
One day that little phone icon thing popped up and I was going,

218
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,119
I wonder what that does.

219
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,609
Click ring, ring, ring, ring. Oh, I guess it makes, you know, I can make, uh,

220
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,179
I'm going to sound old because I'm going to say it

221
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,859
makes a phone call except it's absolutely not a phone call.

222
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,400
It has nothing to do with a phone call or, you know,

223
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:28,440
signal being a great example of like, well, it was

224
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
end to end text chat and now it does voice and video,

225
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:33,000
you know,

226
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,440
and so

227
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,109
we have this idea, you know, law enforcement doesn't, for some crazy reason,

228
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,229
doesn't like the idea of, you know, the bad guys having

229
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,739
communication technology that they can't at all

230
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:45,500
monitor,

231
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,340
right? I mean, that, that's a huge,

232
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,260
uh, intelligence gathering resource to lose potentially, right?

233
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,880
-- It,
-- it, it goes even deeper than that even.

234
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,900
I mean, I, I imagine we'll get there, but kind of the topic of

235
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,059
the, the locked iphones keeps coming up in this context, right?

236
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,359
Where, where that you have a law enforcement agency saying we,

237
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,010
we need to unlock this iphone, you know, for reasons.

238
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,510
And of course, Apple is saying no and they're saying, you know, do it or else. And then

239
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,880
so far this like crazy Mexican standoff is, is not, has never ended

240
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,210
-- because
-- that,

241
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,989
uh Israeli company supposedly has provided software and

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,559
I guess effectively zero days to unlock the,

243
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:23,789
um,

244
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,710
the phones.

245
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,789
Yeah. And they sell the box, the box is remarkably affordable.

246
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,820
It's like tens of thousands of dollars. It's,

247
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,219
it's not expensive,

248
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,830
but the size of a deck of cards, I guess,

249
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,809
and you basically plug in an iphone and it unlocks it

250
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,979
using some sort of security exploit.

251
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:45,260
But again, I think that's kind of a different conversation. Right.

252
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,820
I'm more interested in the conversation about,

253
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:52,000
like, what if Apple did supply law enforcement with a,

254
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,659
with a back door into the phone?

255
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:57,000
-- Like, what
-- does that mean? Important distinction to make? Right. Right.

256
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,820
Now, Apple is like, no, we're not going to unlock that phone for you.

257
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,549
But what's more important is Apple is saying, no,

258
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,549
we're not going to build a service or an ability

259
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,340
to where we have like master keys that we can hand out to you

260
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,020
and there's kind of a couple of layers here, right? So

261
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,880
on one level, some of the older iphones,

262
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,270
it's believed Apple could create like an an update

263
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,429
that you could push on to the phone and it would unlock the phone, right?

264
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:25,929
The new phones though.

265
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,400
My understanding is they have their security enclave configured in such

266
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:32,210
a way they couldn't do that if they wanted to.

267
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,250
Well, the older phones don't as I understand it,

268
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,239
have the security enclave processor or whatever they have

269
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,520
is nowhere near as sophisticated as the current version.

270
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:39,969
Right.

271
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:40,770
Right.

272
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:45,010
So yeah, what, what Apple has done is essentially put hardware on the phone,

273
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,080
the security enclave chip where that's where the encryption and decryption

274
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,599
keys physically live and where they physically do their work.

275
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,570
And so my understanding of it, for example, is that you can still

276
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,869
one of the attacks apparently was you, you basically disassemble the phone,

277
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,710
get the security enclave chip out,

278
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:07,609
do a couple of attempts and then reset the chip before it kind of locks itself down.

279
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,429
Right.

280
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,619
So you can effectively brute force it, but you basically have to, you know,

281
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,250
disassemble the phone and have a lab uh

282
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,049
of equipment to, you know, do this attack, right. So it's pretty nontrivial.

283
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:20,270
Well, and not only that, any time you take a piece of hardware apart,

284
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,460
there's a nonzero chance that you're going to ruin it,

285
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,669
be it, you know, slip a screwdriver slips or, or something happens and,

286
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,390
and now it's dead forever.

287
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,030
And so the, you know,

288
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,700
the concern is Apple doesn't really want to

289
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,909
build something that provides a back door where

290
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,109
like I said, they hold all the master keys for example, or the fundamentally,

291
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:42,390
you know,

292
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,419
either Apple holds the keys or a third party

293
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,799
holds the keys or law enforcement holds the keys.

294
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,030
And you can talk about all the,

295
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,830
you know, three parties out of five have to agree crypto.

296
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:59,130
Like there's all sorts of possible technical means to supposedly make this secure,

297
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,299
that's with big air quotes.

298
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,130
But fundamentally, uh no matter how much technology you apply to this problem,

299
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,609
you've now built

300
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:07,900
a

301
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,690
massive potential flaw into the system,

302
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:12,000
uh

303
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,369
not potential,

304
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,570
potential in any way. It is guaranteed to fail at

305
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,059
some point

306
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:21,280
because at some point there will be a threat that, you know,

307
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,059
the government changes or

308
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,280
the government enacts a law that, yeah,

309
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,770
now we're, you know,

310
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,659
all those keys have to be given to law enforcement or you go to jail forever.

311
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,489
Well, in, in part of it too is which governments?

312
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,010
-- Well, exactly,
-- of course, my government is fine so they can do it.

313
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,000
But those other governments, like, we don't like those guys

314
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,479
as a Canadian citizen. Yeah.

315
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,159
Do I want the, us being able to unlock my phone remotely while I'm in Canada to do,

316
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,590
having nothing to do with America.

317
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,539
Exactly.

318
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,239
What gets me is this, this issue keeps coming up like it just won't die.

319
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,380
And, and I don't mean even the issue of legally mandated backdoors because that,

320
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,400
that will always come up.

321
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,190
People will like, there's just people that will never let go of that one.

322
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:01,219
Right. And that's just how it is.

323
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,909
But the fact that there's people who are like, yeah, we can do that securely

324
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:09,440
with like, no risk. It's like, no, that's not how reality works.

325
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,309
Ozzie, we're looking at you.

326
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:11,989
Yeah.

327
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,989
Um

328
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,640
and I, I think the best quote uh on, so Bruce Schneier

329
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,229
has this on his blog right now, you know, Ray Ozzie, former Microsoft guy said,

330
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,950
yeah, we should like legally mandate backdoors into like, well,

331
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:26,909
and that's part of the problem. What, what defines a communication device now.

332
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,190
Well, everything,

333
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,299
my b

334
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,809
Right. Yeah. Well, like my Amazon echo,

335
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,450
right? Uh my Amazon Alexa

336
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,059
or whatever the hell

337
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,109
that one's already listening to you.

338
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,840
So,

339
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,799
no worries,

340
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,090
it's unplugged.

341
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:43,229
But um

342
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,750
that's a funny story for another podcast. But uh

343
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,570
so

344
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,859
one of the proposals was that if you are going to propose this,

345
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,140
you actually have to give a concrete proposal with

346
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,309
specific details and not just this hand wavy.

347
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,859
Well, you know, the the smart engineers will figure it out.

348
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,330
Yeah, because some problems are somewhat intractable.

349
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,200
You know, like there's just, there's no

350
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,719
essentially, I guess how do I put it? There's no set of engineering trade offs

351
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:11,840
but

352
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,869
result in you having the system that is quote unquote, totally secure,

353
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,650
but also quote unquote law enforcement gets what they want,

354
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,159
right? Those are just two opposing views of reality.

355
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,500
Let's let's break it down. Ok.

356
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,150
So we start at the beginning and we'll say

357
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,309
a device manufacturer builds a device that has a back door. Ok?

358
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,229
Ignoring the fact that we know we can't build it today. But let's just say you can

359
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,630
two problems with that. Is that back door in hardware?

360
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,260
Is it like physically there and can't be modified or

361
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,000
is it in software where it can be modified?

362
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,070
I mean,

363
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,150
can't be modified? Ok,

364
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,309
we're gonna say, can't be modified because that,

365
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,130
that simplifies the conversation.

366
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,109
So now you have,

367
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:54,969
you need a way to get in to the device. Ok.

368
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,650
So you kind of have two options.

369
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,080
You can have like one master key that can unlock

370
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,530
every single device or you have one key per device.

371
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:03,090
Ok.

372
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,710
Now you can imagine one master key

373
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,210
is much easier to deal with because you have one key.

374
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,969
But if you lose it,

375
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,880
all the devices are compromised,

376
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,869
if you have

377
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,530
one, you will,

378
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,049
that's we'll get to that.

379
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,450
You have to share it with so many people, right?

380
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,309
And, and you can also have one key per device.

381
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,080
But now in like in the case of apple, they would be managing a billion keys.

382
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,030
What do you think the odds are of handling a billion keys and not screwing it up

383
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,309
-- under zero
-- percent.

384
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,070
The other thing is too, is, is by having this

385
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
legally mandated to back door.

386
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,109
Does it go over regular communication channels or is it like I can

387
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:45,719
-- magically talk to it over Wi Fi even if your device is disabled
-- Wi

388
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,320
Fi? Let's ignore that stuff.

389
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,700
Let's just say you need to have physically have the device. Ok?

390
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,289
You have to plug in a cable and then send it

391
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,150
a magic command and then you can do whatever you want,

392
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:56,549
right?

393
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,070
Because

394
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,020
that's one of the challenges is this,

395
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,630
this conversation can get very out of hand quickly.

396
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,479
Yeah. Well, see that's one of my frustration.

397
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,800
If you physically need to have the device to unlock it,

398
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,150
then your chances are you can also physically have

399
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,910
the owner of it and you can basically,

400
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:12,358
um,

401
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:15,469
what's that law in the UK called where basically if you don't give up your password,

402
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,239
you go to jail.

403
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:17,920
UK Rip Act.

404
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,930
Yes.

405
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:22,959
And, you know, there have been people who sat in jail for a very long time

406
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,118
because of that.

407
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,219
So,

408
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,530
um, and, and the other thing too is, you know, for a lot of this, they're, they're,

409
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,069
they're gonna go, well, yeah,

410
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,109
we could have a back door where we physically need access,

411
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,880
but we want the one with remote access.

412
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,550
Well, well, it's even more complicated than that because, I mean, like,

413
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,770
for example, you could have a,

414
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,229
you could have a victim's phone

415
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,939
and the victim is dead.

416
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,569
Right?

417
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,829
You can't unlock a dead person's phone with

418
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,469
the dead person's knowledge because they're not there.

419
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,510
So there's,

420
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,920
-- unless they wrote it down
-- somewhere

421
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,880
-- there,
-- which

422
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,790
it does.

423
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,430
But anyway, anyway,

424
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:04,459
so the issue kind of becomes you either have one key or, or millions of keys and,

425
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,560
and both come with their own set of problems.

426
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,719
And now here's the thing, anyone who tells you, oh, the keys will be secret.

427
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,930
We'll put them in an HSM, we'll lock him in a vault. What? Blah, blah, blah.

428
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,699
Here's the thing.

429
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,180
Has anything ever been kept a secret in the history of humanity?

430
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,599
No, nothing ever has. Right. The answer is no, because

431
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,359
this is, you know what, you know what I always think of when I,

432
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,750
when I talk about this is,

433
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,780
do you remember like the hacker mantra back in

434
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,780
the day of information wants to be free?

435
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,130
And I remember III I love that.

436
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,219
But the thing is, it's not so much information wants to be free.

437
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,040
It's the fact that once information exists

438
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,150
in public,

439
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,069
you can never make it un exist, right? There's no way to put that genie back in the box.

440
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,160
And just by its very nature and beauty, like digital information is

441
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:52,770
infinitely and

442
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,790
I want to use the word trivial but even more trivial than trivially copy.

443
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,959
Right. Right. And, and that's exactly the problem.

444
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,989
You, you cannot undo this once it is done.

445
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,400
And so kind of from the, from the context of a back door,

446
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,599
you like we could do it today.

447
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,069
But the problem is we can't do it in a way

448
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:12,829
that's even,

449
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,010
I would say 80% secure because those keys are going to leak and let's face it if,

450
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,989
if someone knows Apple has a vault somewhere full of super secret keys,

451
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,790
like

452
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,339
you might as well paint a job,

453
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:28,354
can't target on that building and say, come on in guys because every

454
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:34,844
intelligence agency on the planet is going to make it their job to get that stuff.

455
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,844
-- I mean, how would you vet those people that work there? Good
-- Lord.

456
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:39,444
Right. There's, there's like

457
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,599
there's no way right.

458
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,300
There is no way and, and people will say, oh,

459
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,329
but you need three or five keys and we'll do

460
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,719
multiple things and sign off and it's just no,

461
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,310
it, it,

462
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,160
there is no way

463
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,109
you're going to do it.

464
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,319
And imagine if you were like one of those people, man, you could,

465
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,640
you could be collecting like some fat

466
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,319
paychecks from every intelligence agency on the planet

467
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:58,589
pretty much.

468
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,760
I mean, it's just,

469
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:02,939
it's, it's one of those things that this is,

470
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,589
I don't think we can ever solve this as human

471
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,439
beings because we screw things up way too much.

472
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:10,369
Yeah.

473
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:10,890
Yeah.

474
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,479
And so, I mean, fundamentally what it boils down to,

475
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:15,719
for me is the frustration that these people are like, oh, it can be done.

476
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:19,869
So we should therefore see the problem is you could very easily mandate this in law

477
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,069
without having a good technical solution and then you

478
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,089
would probably end up with a bad technical solution.

479
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,400
They've sort of tried doing that more than once.

480
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,349
It's, it's not made it yet through, through any,

481
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,670
any congress or anything in the US at least.

482
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,229
But it, it would not surprise me if, if we see something similar eventually.

483
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,349
Well, I mean, as, as proof in the pudding, the Rip Act in the UK in 2000,

484
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,910
right? We, we, they basically acknowledged we can't,

485
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,670
there will be technology that we can't subvert or otherwise,

486
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,359
you know, intercept or whatever. So

487
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:54,699
plan B,

488
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,660
if we think you're guilty and we want your passwords and you won't give them up.

489
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,500
We chuck you in jail.

490
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,459
And

491
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,109
so this legislation has passed in,

492
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,410
not just in some crazy despot country, but, like, in the western world,

493
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,839
like, I expect this kind of thing and, you know, the,

494
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:11,619
yeah.

495
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:17,479
No, I, I understand what you're saying though. Right. This is a very fair point is

496
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,329
now

497
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,810
ignoring the politics because I don't want to

498
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,829
get into a political discussion because I,

499
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,569
I no good ever comes of that.

500
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,849
-- Everyone has their
-- opinion.

501
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,780
We also have the entire world, right?

502
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,869
Where every like you're in the US, I'm in Canada. There's some very big differences.

503
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:35,910
Well, I travel places, right?

504
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,609
Like what happens when I go to another country

505
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:40,930
now?

506
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,530
Great. So my country protects my phone but theirs maybe doesn't.

507
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,310
And, and

508
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:51,310
do they get access to my secret backdoor key because I'm in their country?

509
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,729
Right? But I, I don't know.

510
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,530
So, so anyway,

511
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,689
now the one thing I will give Ray Ozzie credit

512
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:02,050
for in his write up about his uh backdoor proposal

513
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,849
is one of his ideas was when law enforcement basically backdoors the phone,

514
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,969
it would have like fuses inside of it that would blow,

515
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,839
rendering the phone or, well,

516
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,000
I guess the device will say basically rendering the device

517
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,280
useless for the most part where it kind of becomes read

518
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:18,599
on

519
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,650
that. That's actually a good idea.

520
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,310
Yes and no, because that's great for phones.

521
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,729
But what about for like general purpose computing devices.

522
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:27,819
What do you mean?

523
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:32,979
Well, I mean, more things like desktops, laptops, tablets, do we put this on every,

524
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,949
you, you'd have to build them special? I mean,

525
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:40,979
so then essentially what you're saying is if I break into the system,

526
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,979
I can render every computer on the face of the planet inoperable,

527
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,780
conceivably sounds like a win.

528
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm not gonna completely disagree with you there.

529
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,339
Um, but, you know, at the

530
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:58,319
same time by building this capability in that, that's a potentially a huge problem.

531
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:04,140
But the, the value of it I think is you couldn't have say law enforcement,

532
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,619
take your phone while you're

533
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,010
in the shower, quick hack it and then, you know,

534
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,560
quick put it back on your dresser while they run out of the hotel, right?

535
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:14,020
Like if this is a one shot deal, you do it and it's done

536
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,310
and, and, but, but

537
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,810
again, it's not technically possible.

538
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,489
-- So,
-- well, it is technically possible, just not in the way that they,

539
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,829
I think are claiming it can be done quote unquote safely and securely.

540
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,770
No, I'm, I'm going to say it's not technically possible using, using the what we

541
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,510
assuming humans have to build it, which is true.

542
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,050
Knowing what we know today,

543
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,829
you cannot build

544
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,670
a, a backdoor, key escrow system

545
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,989
that is going to be secure and reliable.

546
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,709
That is, that is what I will say

547
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,709
100%.

548
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,339
Um,

549
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,310
especially if you care even remotely about the security

550
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,660
and safety and privacy of the end users,

551
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,640
which I mean, look, let's face it.

552
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,640
And that is literally enshrined in law in many countries. Right?

553
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,900
Canada, Human Rights Act, the US, what? Fourth Amendment,

554
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,229
these are some pretty core legal principles here in

555
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,920
most western countries and even non western countries.

556
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,109
And

557
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,359
that, that's all well and good. Right.

558
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,790
And, and I, I appreciate that and I love that aspect of democracy

559
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:19,640
but it's

560
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:24,319
even ignoring the legal ramifications, just technically speaking, it's,

561
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,719
it's not doable.

562
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,319
Right.

563
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,579
And I'm also not sure.

564
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:34,859
I mean, because my understanding is so far we've had many times where, oh my God,

565
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:37,619
it's the end of the world if we can't get access to this and it hasn't

566
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,660
been the end of the world and they also have been able to get access,

567
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,069
you know, through other means.

568
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,939
-- And
-- this is something that

569
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,250
I, I think law enforcement recently has kind of screwed up

570
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,449
is you can't say if we don't get this, you know, think of the Children sort of thing.

571
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,650
And then when they don't get what they need and things still are ok,

572
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,010
it's like you guys lied to us, right?

573
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,489
Like you were making up some crap

574
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,569
and you kind of got caught, you know, and

575
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,140
that's not healthy.

576
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,260
And I think honestly that the security industry

577
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,829
in general is kind of in this position

578
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,489
where we've been screaming at people for so

579
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,189
long about doom and gloom and they're like,

580
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,849
yeah, but like my, my lights still work, you know,

581
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,160
you guys are,

582
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,709
are either wrong or you're lying and either way I don't want to listen to you

583
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:21,849
and,

584
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,489
and that's kind of one of those things that

585
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,520
if law enforcement wants to be viewed as

586
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,000
somebody who could be trusted with this sort of technology,

587
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:37,680
they need to have a certain level of, I guess just upstanding. This isn't a word.

588
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,739
But, you know, you know what I mean?

589
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,760
They have to be seen as like the good guys and in this case,

590
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,119
it's like you guys are kind of being weasels about this one, you know, come on, do,

591
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,359
do a better job here.

592
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,300
Yeah. No, I'll uh, I'll agree with that. Cuz,

593
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,920
yeah, there's been a lot of, oh my God.

594
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,800
Yeah, the end of the world, if we lose this capability,

595
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,959
-- we lose the capability and the world keeps ticking along
-- well.

596
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,520
And it's even crazier too because I, I,

597
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,000
from my understanding is while the FBI was yelling at Apple,

598
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,939
they, they were also working with celeb

599
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,680
right to unlock these phones.

600
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,199
So it's like you guys knew you could do this and you're pretending you can't,

601
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,349
I'm assuming it was, you know, more political in nature than

602
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:12,569
I

603
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,310
imagine so.

604
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,160
-- But
-- still,

605
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,569
I mean,

606
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,310
here's the thing from, from their perspective,

607
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,760
having this capability would just be amazing, right?

608
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,510
Like I just recently downloaded, actually,

609
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,430
I have Google location enabled on my phone

610
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:28,699
and I downloaded the, uh, the file with all the data and, uh, I need to plot it in

611
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:28,949
something,

612
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,630
you know,

613
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,300
and it's gonna be, it's gonna, that's basically my life.

614
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,760
Like you'll know where I get my Slurpees.

615
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,180
There's a way you can view it on Google Maps. I forget what it is off the top of my head.

616
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,280
-- Oh,
-- there's a ton of things to manipulate the data.

617
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,750
-- It's, it's a very standard file format. It's
-- super crazy imac

618
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,209
or something.

619
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:44,349
I,

620
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,359
I don't know, I, I opened mine up.

621
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:51,140
Uh, I don't know, maybe 34 weeks ago and I looked at it. I was like, holy crap

622
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,270
everywhere.

623
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,630
I've been in the last, probably seven years was on that map and it's like, well,

624
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,469
I'm just gonna close this and

625
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:04,430
go back to crawling under the blanket and crying softly.

626
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,569
Yeah, I, I, it's amazing to me that in the span of 12 years.

627
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,609
Uh, well, and even prior to 12 years, you know, smartphones are from 2006,

628
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,689
but prior to that we had phones and logging of this location data,

629
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:19,319
although not quite as fine grained as it is now. But

630
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,369
yeah, in the span of what a good solid 20 years, we've, we've just trained pretty much

631
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,329
half or more of humanity to carry a tracking device.

632
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:29,359
Uh

633
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:29,930
Yes,

634
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,239
that's pretty amazing,

635
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:31,900
you know.

636
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,400
Ok. No, it's not amazing because most people don't realize what's going on.

637
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,540
You and I have the unfortunate reality of knowing.

638
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,599
-- Well, no, no,
-- even more than that,

639
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,800
it doesn't matter because this thing is so fundamentally useful.

640
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,130
-- I don't
-- care.

641
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,479
And I'm kind of in that situation too of. I know they're spying on me.

642
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:53,199
I know they're stealing an insane amount of my personal data.

643
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,739
But at the same time

644
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,339
it's like I, I haven't,

645
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,859
-- I can play angry birds at the checkout line.
-- Ignoring that. My, my, my take is always

646
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,329
I go on a trip now

647
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,949
and I don't bring any paper with me and I get on airplanes and I

648
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,199
get off airplanes and then people pick me up and they bring me places and I

649
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,209
to hotels and it's like this is

650
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,329
magic

651
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,189
is,

652
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,300
yeah, we were, we were running errands the other day and I'm like, oh,

653
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,170
can we swing by the bank?

654
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,050
And I'm like, oh no, wait a second. I poke away at my phone.

655
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm like, oh, wait, no,

656
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,300
I can do this online and I set up a bill payment and paid it and I was like, ok,

657
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,729
never mind.

658
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:25,020
-- We're not going to the bank.
-- Seriously. II I haven't been to my bank in months

659
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,660
and I'm glad,

660
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,329
you know, it's no

661
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,069
lines.

662
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:33,500
They do and they're always very slick. Well, because now they have one teller

663
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,430
because nobody goes to the bank.

664
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,140
Well, I think it's kind of like ts a precheck approval.

665
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,180
It's called this by definition,

666
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:42,079
the people going to the bank are not very good at this and they have a

667
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,530
long time.

668
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,589
-- Probably
-- true.

669
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,800
-- I
-- think that's part of it.

670
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,310
-- I've
-- noticed that, you know what, man,

671
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,020
I was in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago and the TS,

672
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,790
a line was significantly longer than the normal person line.

673
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,109
And it's still like, smoked them in terms of getting people through because,

674
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,579
you know, the normal people are like, what do you mean?

675
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,020
I can't wear my winter coat and boots through this thing.

676
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,560
It's like, just listen to the nice person and take your stuff off. Come on.

677
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:08,510
Yeah.

678
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,819
Yeah.

679
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,800
Oh, well.

680
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,170
But anyway, anyway,

681
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,400
-- all right. So,
-- backdoors, I think, well, no, no, legally mandated backdoors.

682
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:18,709
I, I don't think,

683
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:20,829
I don't think they can be done

684
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,550
on a large scale even remotely securely and,

685
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,000
and that kind of sucks because on the one hand, the magic part of me that's like, oh,

686
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,989
you know, the good guys of law enforcement because

687
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,369
honestly, in my experience, generally speaking a lot,

688
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,030
most law enforcement is pretty,

689
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:37,810
they're not complete raving lunatics. Right.

690
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:41,770
They, I think they do generally have, they do generally want to help society. Right.

691
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,859
Granted, there have been some, well, a lot of bad things

692
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,800
in the past, the thing,

693
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,930
I'm going to the threat of law enforcement itself and just say that

694
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,170
using our current technology and know how

695
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,829
my fear isn't law enforcement.

696
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,130
My fear is Apple accidentally posting the keys to an FTP site and then

697
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,739
that's the thing. Once this stuff is out, it never comes back.

698
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,489
And that's the problem. Right.

699
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,890
Well, what I was trying to get to is there are numerous

700
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,969
cases of, you know, the police abusing their powers to

701
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,209
track people to surveil people, you know, all sorts of naughtiness,

702
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,089
um, especially around journalists and stuff. Right. So,

703
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:26,319
it's, you know, I would like to live in a somewhat free and just society and

704
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,469
we need these checks and balances and

705
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,430
giving, you know, a group like law enforcement,

706
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,790
this unfettered access to everybody's personal data

707
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,310
-- makes me a little
-- nervous.

708
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:39,459
No, I, I agree completely. And it's,

709
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,900
it's tricky man.

710
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,219
II, I guess here's what I'll say again,

711
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:46,300
I'm going to ignore law enforcement and just say

712
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:48,670
we cannot do this today

713
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,770
in a reasonable fashion,

714
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,250
full stop

715
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,780
and it's the way it is now, it is conceivable.

716
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:58,939
Somebody will figure out a way to do this correctly and then we

717
00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:02,699
can have another conversation about the fact that now that this exists,

718
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:03,880
what do we do with it?

719
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,699
Well, and one thing to keep in mind too is do we actually need this,

720
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:09,900
like straight

721
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,050
up,

722
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:10,489
you know,

723
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:11,109
and

724
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,630
that, that's a political discussion in all seriousness.

725
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,599
Well, see that's what frustrates a lot of stuff around law enforcement is,

726
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:19,599
does this actually

727
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,319
help or benefit? Does it make a difference? Right.

728
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:25,030
Like people often call for, I want more police in my community,

729
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,329
like walking the streets or whatever.

730
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:26,660
And it's

731
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,680
the majority of studies have shown that like that doesn't really matter.

732
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:36,069
I will compare this and, and we can kind of close on this is,

733
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,469
it is similar to a lot of security advice. Do you need a password manager? No.

734
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,729
Does it make your life better? Yes.

735
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:47,349
Right. And, and there's a number of security things

736
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:52,560
and this is kind of part of that advice of. Do you need this? Well, technically, no,

737
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,630
but would it make certain things better? It might.

738
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,810
Right. And that's what it's going to come down to?

739
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:01,719
And that, that is not necessarily a decision I want to be trusted with.

740
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,239
It's quite likely no human should be trusted with it.

741
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:06,520
But unfortunately,

742
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,069
that's not how it works because somebody's going to make some laws

743
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,489
and then that's what's going to happen

744
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,010
and they'll probably say think of the Children

745
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,390
and then it will, will get passed. But anyway, anyway.

746
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,329
All right, man. Any, any last thoughts on backdoors?

747
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:25,130
Uh nothing other than, you know,

748
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,660
please don't.

749
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,010
Yeah, that'll work.

750
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,150
All right. Awesome. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks everyone for listening.
