Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:11,529
Josh Resor.

3
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,659
I'm very excited. We have Seth Larson here today.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,620
Seth is the Security Development residence at the Python Software Foundation.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,420
Seth. Welcome to the show, man.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,069
Thanks for having me guys. Always excited to participate in Thought Crime.

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm, I'm really excited.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,299
It's funny, Seth was joking before we hit record that I think on the,

9
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,530
the wordpress episode, we jokingly said if you, you know,

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,819
if we talk about you on the show, you probably did something terrible.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,299
And he's like, oh, I'm coming on the show.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,979
It's like, then we realized if you're a guest on the show, you're probably fine.

13
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,459
But if you're not a guest on the show and we're talking about you,

14
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:42,735
you probably done screwed something up. But, all right.

15
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:45,294
-- Anyway, anyway, happy to get the invite.
-- Yeah.

16
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,444
Right. Right.

17
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:48,284
So, I mean, let's just start out,

18
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:51,014
tell us who you are and tell us about the Python Software Foundation.

19
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,845
Seth because like, there's so much cool stuff going on right now.

20
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:55,904
Yeah. So I'm, I'm Seth Larson.

21
00:00:55,915 --> 00:01:00,115
Uh I do a lot of security stuff over at the, the PSF Python Software Foundation

22
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,610
uh previously and still currently uh maintain just tons of

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,419
open source projects in the Python space a lot around

24
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:11,019
security and networking and HTP and the web and all of that

25
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:16,709
and the Python Software Foundation, it's a US based nonprofit that is just all about

26
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,779
making the Python program language and ecosystem

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,139
packages around it just better and more accessible

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,260
and more international work for more people.

29
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,989
I mean, that's, that's just our mission

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,069
-- so
-- well in, in the the like Python, the language is under that umbrella, right?

31
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:36,169
Yeah. So we do like the trademark, the copyright.

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,389
A lot of the community hosting of infrastructure we

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,839
employ obviously me but other people too that uh

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,330
do a lot of stuff around Python uh trying to improve it and just make it better.

35
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:49,809
We run Python us which is the largest

36
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,485
-- gathering of Python programmers in the world. A lot of community based stuff.
-- Nice.

37
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:55,334
All right.

38
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,574
I want to start out with what I think is the

39
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,605
latest news to come out of the work you're doing,

40
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:01,415
but it might not be.

41
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:06,654
And that is you are using Sig Store to sign the Python releases now, right?

42
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,569
Yeah.

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,110
So that,

44
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,929
that's been the Six Store stuff has been happening for a while even before I joined.

45
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,410
But I think the big thing

46
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,789
that I'm working on right now is trying to

47
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,750
move away from

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,970
P GP

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,699
and I know some people say

50
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,649
GP GP GP interchangeable, you know,

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,089
trying to move away from it because it has,

52
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,500
I mean, I, I don't really like to comment on the

53
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,729
security aspects of things which might be surprising as the security developer.

54
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,830
Uh, I just think that

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,190
there's a huge ergonomic benefit.

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,940
Um, Python release managers have to do this stuff for seven years minimum.

57
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,100
Um, and so like asking them to protect and maintain long lived secure keys

58
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,910
crawl that time as a volunteer, like that's a huge ask compare that to cigar

59
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,990
where you're just like, oh, off signing in a few times like

60
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,320
it's night and day. So,

61
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,020
yeah.

62
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:04,429
Well, this is one thing like I've been using P GP and GP G for

63
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:08,259
25 years I think, and I've given up on it straight up

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,309
and this I think really speaks to, oh, you know,

65
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,970
if we can just all get the developers to floss, everything will be fine.

66
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,059
And like flossing is easy compared to using GP G

67
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,460
consistently in like making a key and protecting it.

68
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,419
But, but also backing it up, but also protecting the backups and blah, blah, blah,

69
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:24,860
blah, blah.

70
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:26,220
And

71
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,479
yeah, I have to, I think at this point, we have to accept that sort of a third party.

72
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,550
Just magically making stuff work is the way to go because like,

73
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,820
that's why Python works, right?

74
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,009
-- Like import food. Like I'm not smart enough to write
-- pandas Six

75
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,580
Store. The, the interesting part of six story is that

76
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,029
it externalizes

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,500
the operation to parties that are already doing that work

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,320
uh in all of the right ways, right?

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,699
Like running, if you're someone who's maintaining a secret key for PTP,

80
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:58,649
it's basically like every individual person running their own C A

81
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,850
and it's like that doesn't scale at the volunteer level.

82
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,089
Um So like, let's externalize

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,970
the operations costs where they are already being paid

84
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,050
and then do our little part

85
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,990
and then make sure everything's working.

86
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:12,860
Um

87
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,850
You know, because like these release managers already have to maintain a

88
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,670
secure access to those, to those identities to those accounts already.

89
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,660
And so they're already doing the part of the bargain that they should be doing

90
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,720
and let's externalize the rest.

91
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,130
Well, I mean,

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,200
this is why github won because it turns out

93
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,220
nobody actually wants to run their own kid infrastructure.

94
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,779
Ok. Ok. Hold on before we go on. I want Seth to tell us

95
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,059
what signing releases, why do we do it? And what does that mean?

96
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,420
-- Yeah.
-- So signing releases, it doesn't matter at all unless you're verifying them,

97
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,660
you know, that's no Ashley pause.

98
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,859
That is a very good point because we've had

99
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,250
a whole bunch of signing strategies going back 30 years

100
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:00,230
where like, oh we put, you know, like, uh uh the, the external as key signatures,

101
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,549
like, so we have a Tar ball and externals

102
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,279
signature, you get the key on a CD, blah, blah, blah.

103
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,239
And yeah, like nobody checks those. Right. So like, what's the point?

104
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:08,679
100%? No, no.

105
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,220
If you're creating,

106
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,315
if you're creating verification material and it's not being checked by anyone,

107
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:12,924
it's basically

108
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:13,125
point

109
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:13,505
right

110
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:16,445
there. There's an XK CD comic

111
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,934
that says how to verify a signed email.

112
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,075
If it's like if it has this at the top, it's probably signed

113
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,484
and it's like to begin P GP text

114
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:24,734
a

115
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:25,195
regular

116
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:25,975
expression. I hear.

117
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:28,565
OK. No, I mean, that's a good point though. So,

118
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,325
so let's pretend

119
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,140
everyone is checking the signatures. So why are we doing that?

120
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,260
-- So
-- I don't think

121
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:35,839
like,

122
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,170
obviously I would love to live in a

123
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,279
fantasy world where everyone checks every signature.

124
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,140
But that's not

125
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,619
like that's not, that's not real

126
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,350
reality, right? Like it's not

127
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:48,959
um I think that a really big part of what is interesting about

128
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:49,920
this verification

129
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,035
is like how it fits into

130
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,484
these downstream ecosystems that are

131
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,154
like in an automated way,

132
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:59,364
pulling source and building it and all of that,

133
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,554
like those are the ecosystems that are likely to be the biggest targets.

134
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:07,304
And so they're also likely to be the best places to actually do the verification.

135
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:09,075
And I think that they're also like the most

136
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,829
able to do the verification

137
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:17,839
uh because if they're able to kind of do that one time and then after that's done,

138
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,559
like it just automatically works, right?

139
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,820
Because if you have these release manager identities, they're valid

140
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,119
for seven years

141
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,459
and you only have to update it once every two years

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,940
to add like whoever the new release manager is, like, that's not that much of a,

143
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,980
of an additional cost to pay as someone who's doing this downstream.

144
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,570
And a lot of downstream verifier for like Linux distro,

145
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,899
they are already doing this with P GP.

146
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,179
And so like part of the work that I'm doing is trying to keep

147
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,220
verifiers involved in the deprecation of P GP, right?

148
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,059
Because we don't want them to just not have anything to do.

149
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,420
We don't want them to be flat footed, right?

150
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,059
We don't want them to feel like this is a surprise that is happening.

151
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,640
But there's um I like to call it like a Gordian knot of signers and verifiers, right?

152
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,380
Where if there's this existing method

153
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,559
that's out there in P GP,

154
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,980
no one wants to do work for, for no reason, especially volunteers.

155
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,100
I don't want to foist more work on the volunteers,

156
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,920
but there's like this other need of like we wanna move

157
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,290
to sig store because it's just better for us too.

158
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,440
And so it's like, how do you, how do you make this happen? Where

159
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,670
from a lot of perspectives P GP is the only

160
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:32,839
verification material that's being demanded that's being asked for.

161
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,399
But that's just because it's existed for so much longer.

162
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,070
Like we're not even close to like answering some of

163
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,670
these questions of like how does the Linux cro use

164
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,679
sig store verification material in their automation tooling.

165
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:47,079
And so like someone has to be first through the wall and

166
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,350
I think C Python has a pretty good spot

167
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,649
there. And

168
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,690
yeah, it's, it's, it's a really tough problem.

169
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,380
So just a quick thing because not all our viewers might know this.

170
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,619
But what exactly is C Python?

171
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,970
No,

172
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,369
no, because this is something when I, when I first saw,

173
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,329
when I first learned what C Python was versus, say J Python, it kind of blew my mind.

174
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,089
-- Yeah. So C
-- Python is, it is an implementation of the Python program language.

175
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,369
Uh It's the reference implementation. A lot of people call it.

176
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,290
Um And it's primarily

177
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,529
implemented, it's like 5050 Python and C

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,440
and uh yeah, it's,

179
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,519
it's kind of the one that like the PSF

180
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:26,040
maintains the Python steering council maintains a lot of times

181
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,519
it's, it's like the,

182
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,790
the one that most people are probably talking about when they say Python

183
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,880
is, it's likely C

184
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,400
Python.

185
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,799
Yeah, for sure. All right. I want to ask about Sig store one last thing.

186
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:41,705
So what does signing with Sig store mean? But let's say from a, a

187
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:48,054
release manager perspective as well as the I am the person downloading this Python.

188
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:51,244
-- What does it mean if it signed with a SIG store instead of P GP?
-- Yeah.

189
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,594
So when it's signed with Sig Store, the,

190
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:56,815
the interesting part about Sig store is that it uses

191
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,190
these extremely short lived keys, right?

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,450
From like a central certificate authority. That's like the special part.

193
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,429
The other special part is that it uses this technology called open ID connect,

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
which allows

195
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,789
third party identity providers. So like Google and github,

196
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,070
it allows them to participate in part of the process where you can bind

197
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,109
this like human readable identity.

198
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:24,690
So like Seth at python.org, the email address, that's a human readable identity.

199
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,849
It's not just this like

200
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,809
dump of hex characters, right?

201
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,960
-- That's like your public key uh finger press
-- that

202
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,190
has worked out so well for the crypto industry.

203
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

204
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,809
And so it takes this human readable identity

205
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,789
and then binds that to a certificate that then can be used to sign whatever you want.

206
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,369
So like a file, for example,

207
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,840
and then that signature and certificate are totally fine to be

208
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:51,380
just kind of like dumped because they expire almost instantly.

209
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,729
They're not valid past a certain

210
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,830
like time frame. I think it's like 1015 minutes or something.

211
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:59,409
And then after those like materials are available,

212
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,750
you can still verify because it's like a certificate with a signature, right?

213
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
You verify it just the normal way,

214
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,010
but then you're usually using the identity

215
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,929
that is bound within the original certificate. So you can say

216
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,580
did this come from Seth at

217
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:13,594
python.org?

218
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,414
And you don't have to know like what my P GP key is ahead of time.

219
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,075
You just need to know that that's the

220
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,455
person that you're interested in and release managers.

221
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:25,484
It's this really big public ceremony of like this will be

222
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:28,994
the release manager for this Python version and here's their identity

223
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:33,304
and it's so it's a lot easier as like a downstream verifier to be like, oh yeah,

224
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:34,914
Hugo is the,

225
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,890
is the release manager for Python 3.14.

226
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,710
That's something that's already known ahead of time as opposed to like,

227
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,630
oh here goes the release manager.

228
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,729
What is their key? But how am I gonna find that? How am I gonna keep that up to date?

229
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:47,650
Um

230
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:51,119
Yeah, it's just, it's just a lot more ergonomic. And I think that the nice

231
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,150
thing about

232
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,729
SAR that is not really captured with P GP at all

233
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,729
is that it lends itself a lot more cleanly to like workload identities,

234
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,750
so not just human identities.

235
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,289
So things like, oh this github

236
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,080
action workflow execution.

237
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:10,030
So anything that I like works with open ID, connect with

238
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,549
github, github

239
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,520
actions. Does

240
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:14,440
it lets you use those identities too?

241
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,690
So you can actually say like this release process in

242
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,250
C I was the one that signed this file,

243
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,280
not like a human.

244
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,330
And I think that's like the

245
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,809
long term end goal,

246
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,830
but we're not quite there yet. So we're, we're kind of doing this analog of

247
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,890
identity

248
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,609
-- matching to a release manager instead of to the to the actual workload. Nice,
-- nice.

249
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:34,799
Sorry, just to clarify.

250
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:35,049
So,

251
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,375
so you're essentially because I knew obviously people can use this to sign stuff.

252
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:43,094
But you're saying essentially there'll be the ability for say AC I CD job to run.

253
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:47,424
And that specific job would generate a certificate key, blah, blah, blah,

254
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:52,224
sign it. And then obviously, like you said, it's good for 1015 minutes. It goes away.

255
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:55,465
Obviously, it can't sign, well, if it does sign anything in the future,

256
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,825
it will be a huge red flag, it's expired key,

257
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,385
but essentially that that

258
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,150
action, not just that like workload,

259
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,349
but that specific action of that workload would have a specific unique signature.

260
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,789
And so, well,

261
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,789
I'm guessing then you could essentially have like a farm to fork model

262
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,989
of kind of where it traverses through different systems C I CD validation,

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,630
blah blah blah

264
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,950
and with sig store that would all be essentially that would work and be automated.

265
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,159
Whereas like I know with P GP,

266
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,150
what we do is we just shove a key in and use it to sign everything because

267
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,969
what else would we do? Right.

268
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:29,320
Yeah. No, it, so the identity in that,

269
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,390
in that certificate, in that signature would end up being like the repo

270
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,179
the workflow,

271
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,000
like how the definition of the workflow uh in addition to like the get

272
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,390
commit that ran and then it also includes like the run id as well.

273
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,020
So it's completely tied back to

274
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:50,890
the actual steps that ran to build that artifact and

275
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,030
provides providence I mean, the real end goal of like, why is this important

276
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,179
is that it makes our infrastructure less interesting to compromise. So like

277
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:01,570
if you're an attacker,

278
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,289
this happens.

279
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,659
Well,

280
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,299
II I believe php also, right?

281
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,159
They had an issue with their infrastructure that was

282
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,880
hosting those artifacts got compromised and injected with,

283
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,940
with stuff.

284
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,799
And like the whole point is like if you,

285
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,900
if you go to python.org/downloads and you just download some files

286
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,849
and there's like check sums on the page and they, oh look, they match out

287
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,539
like,

288
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,799
but that doesn't tell you that the infrastructure

289
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,900
that's hosting those files didn't get compromised.

290
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,500
It's like this is what's providing build provenance.

291
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,289
So it makes,

292
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,609
it's a much higher bar to have to clear

293
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,150
because then you have to like compromise or build infrastructure

294
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:42,989
or the source code or some account. But all of those are risks.

295
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,359
Now there's this other target.

296
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:48,119
You can just compromise python.org and then, and then the host files that way.

297
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,479
So it removes that from the table

298
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,989
and makes it slightly harder for Attackers to do that sort of thing.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,549
Well, and I'm also guessing that there would be, you know,

300
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,669
logs of these certificates being issued,

301
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,630
which obviously should match up to somebody doing something.

302
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,919
Yeah, six store has two certificate logs. So

303
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,229
one for art. Yeah, I

304
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,580
I'm not as well versed on the like super deep technical side,

305
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,979
but I believe there's one for the

306
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,340
artifacts and then there's another one for, uh, maybe the C A itself or something.

307
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,979
So,

308
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:22,340
and, and it's public, right? Their transparency log is public. So it's

309
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,530
anyone can go poking into it to look for the things like set that

310
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,650
python.org has signed,

311
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,309
which is,

312
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,989
you know, I never thought about that, but with P GP,

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,190
like one of the benefits is you control and run it and own it and do it all yourself.

314
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,750
But also conversely, there's obviously no transparency or logging.

315
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,500
No, there just isn't right because like,

316
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,150
yeah.

317
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,460
Ok. Ok.

318
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:49,159
I want to stay on the provenance conversation because that was,

319
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,099
it will be a marvelous segue

320
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:57,489
is you've also been involved with creating S bombs for, for Python, which is I,

321
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,059
I feel like Python is living in the future.

322
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,789
We're all trying to get to sometimes, which is very cool.

323
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,979
-- I take that as a huge compliment. Thank
-- you.

324
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,700
You should like, you've done a ton of work and it's cool.

325
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,929
Yeah, so S bombs, I mean, we've been,

326
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:16,890
we've been publishing S bombs uh in the SPDX format since Python 3 12.2.

327
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:22,239
Um And they're just a part of our release process because

328
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,299
we release all of these different artifacts.

329
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,809
So we release source code, we release like prebuilt stuff for windows. We release

330
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,969
uh like stand alone binaries for windows.

331
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:35,679
Um And so like all of those different artifacts have different,

332
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,559
different dependencies that get pulled in different ways

333
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,440
that get compiled and so trying to provide

334
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,559
s bomb files for all the different things. So whatever you're using,

335
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:48,190
you have a, a nice authoritative s bomb that uh

336
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,919
that matches with the standards. I mean, the old standards.

337
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,460
So like just today, new standards dropped,

338
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:57,880
um I had already looked at the draft and like know what we need to do.

339
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,289
But um yeah, so like

340
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,739
I'll be upgrading to those new standards

341
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:03,919
hopefully soon

342
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,640
and then

343
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,960
can continue being Conformant.

344
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:10,479
-- I
-- I think you're glossing over some of the immense work.

345
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:14,489
This has been because I work for a company that has an S bomb scanner

346
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,919
and Python isn't the sort of thing.

347
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,359
You can just like point an S bomb scanner at and you know,

348
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,179
clap your hands and say we did it everyone.

349
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,520
Good job like this has been a ton of manual work and I know you've,

350
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,989
you've been heavily involved in it.

351
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,989
Yeah, it's, it has been a good amount of like discovery,

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
especially like going through, pouring through all of our

353
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,200
dependencies that we vendor pulling through all the

354
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,640
dependencies that we actually pull in externally,

355
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,299
going through the dependencies

356
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,390
of our sub dependencies. So like PIP is vendored alongside of C Python.

357
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,049
So then like traversing that to see what Pips dependencies are.

358
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,679
So, yeah, I think it's like,

359
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,309
I don't know if it's like 30 or 30 some

360
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,979
dependencies having all the metadata and trying

361
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,919
to make sure that there's identifiers.

362
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,489
So like

363
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,358
in the future, we, there's another dependency that we need to request AC pe for

364
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,439
because we want to be able to provide identifiers for all of our,

365
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,680
the projects that were

366
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:09,959
that

367
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:10,650
just in the ring?

368
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,170
Quick question. Can you tell us what Ac pe is?

369
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,530
Yeah. So ac pe there,

370
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,839
there's a centralized database of software identifiers um that's managed by

371
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,920
uh I don't exactly know.

372
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,310
N

373
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:27,140
I was gonna say that was gonna be my guess, but I wasn't,

374
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,239
I want to be authoritative here.

375
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,000
Um Yeah, so Nist manages the CP dictionary

376
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,739
and it's basically this list of software identifiers

377
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,310
that get attached to CD E records.

378
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,229
And so it's kind of this like magic

379
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,349
in between

380
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,459
linkage between like an actual software project and a version and whatever to

381
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,800
whether that's actually affected by

382
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,160
a given vulnerability,

383
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,760
-- it's not magic. They're the worst things ever.
-- Yeah, it's I personally,

384
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,319
so the full acronym is common product enumeration. And

385
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,520
yeah, I mean, the frustrating thing for me is it was invented what,

386
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,390
like 25 years ago at the beginning of CV?

387
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,619
And it,

388
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:04,369
yes,

389
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,050
-- I the world has changed.
-- It has and C pe has the C pe people

390
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,050
stuck with it. The C pe people know it has tons of problems.

391
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,050
But OK, but there's another piece to this sp,

392
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,260
there's another piece to this s bomb story though with Python.

393
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,579
And that is that C Python

394
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,040
turns C into Binaries and

395
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,270
it is really hard to like,

396
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,329
automatically identify c things that are then built into a binary.

397
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,550
But how you've done it, how did you do it?

398
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:36,010
Well, we did it by just knowing, knowing the source code,

399
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,770
knowing the projects ahead of time, right?

400
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,650
Like we,

401
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,609
we're in this lucky position that we are by being the suppliers

402
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,920
of the source code also know like what goes into the,

403
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,729
into the, the project itself.

404
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,130
Well, you say that, but I like, literally,

405
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:53,390
I'm not going to name names,

406
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,170
but I've worked for companies where we ship software and like,

407
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,209
people went spelunking into what was into it and

408
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:01,469
found things like MP3 is being embedded in from

409
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,334
maybe and stuff and like, we actually didn't know what was in there specifically.

410
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:06,744
And like,

411
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:09,734
I think the whole log for Jay thing, the fact that the world had to spend, you know,

412
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:12,584
the better part of 12 months scrambling and panicking to see.

413
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,724
Like, do, do we have log for Jay in here?

414
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,604
Like, I don't know, you know, people have like grip

415
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:21,545
strings and like all like there was like 40 different detection methods.

416
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,849
Yeah, like a lot of people aren't there yet.

417
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,170
So I, I would not take that for granted.

418
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,189
That's no, like that's, that's a level of maturity that

419
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,810
I think everybody should have, but clearly we don't.

420
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,819
Yeah. And actually so the, the next thing that I kind of speaking on

421
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:38,069
eons, the next thing that I kind of want to work on

422
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,410
is

423
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,079
how do we solve the esper

424
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,650
problem for Python packages generally?

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,089
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah,

426
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,969
I was wondering about that because I just had the experience,

427
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:53,229
I didn't realize this but I, um, I have a, a mac laptop with brew installed as one does

428
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,849
and I, um, obviously installed Python 312 to get a specific version of something

429
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,719
and did, uh, you know, pip three install.

430
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:04,390
Anthropic to get the Anthropic clawed A I client

431
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,709
and it failed to run because I did not have rust installed. And I was like,

432
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:13,770
what the f and it turns out I need to install rust so that it can build that package.

433
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,790
And I'm like, oh boy, well, whatever YOLO

434
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,800
and like

435
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,219
my Python now pulls in rust so I can run my Anthropic thing.

436
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:23,890
Although it's cool that they're using rust for their Python module.

437
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,209
I, I don't want to think about it too much because it hurts my head.

438
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:29,300
But yeah, I mean, that's, this is not an uncommon occurrence for this to be a,

439
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,959
like, I have no idea where all this stuff is coming from.

440
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,489
Yeah, Python

441
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,609
Python is a, it's, it's, it's a glue language really.

442
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,520
I mean, like it is a huge glue language, especially in between, like,

443
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:46,520
providing a nice API or a nice way to use like low level C libraries

444
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,890
or A I models or like just any binary thing that you want to do.

445
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,300
With the Python, like it works really well.

446
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,489
Um But that also has like knock on effects, right?

447
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,560
Especially from a security perspective, you just were talking about

448
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,510
compiled binaries, right?

449
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,790
Um

450
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,069
So how do you create an S bomb for those things where you have tons of

451
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,400
code that is not Python that doesn't play by Python's

452
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,030
rules that's not described accurately by Python packaging metadata.

453
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,650
How do you describe, how do you tell a machine what that means

454
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,089
uh accurately and how can maintainers,

455
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:25,229
how can people that are maintaining these projects, like be a part of that process?

456
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,930
Because right now there's like no avenue, there's no way

457
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:31,729
even if they wanted to tell you what was in the project, there's no way for them to,

458
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:32,849
to help in that way.

459
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,579
Um Because a lot of the work that I actually do is like

460
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:37,609
standards work. So like

461
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,510
figuring out how we're going to do these things,

462
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,140
figuring out how these systems are gonna plug together.

463
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,040
Um I think that that's like the most impactful

464
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,349
use of my time because it's things that will

465
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,939
be useful for quite a long time to lots of people and it just feels like problems that

466
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:58,739
-- like full time staffing is, is especially equipped to tackle.
-- Yes. Ok.

467
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,599
Uh Let's, let's talk about Python packages

468
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,699
to accurately set the stage for the insanity here.

469
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:10,119
So Python packages can contain Python

470
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,719
or binaries

471
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:13,819
and sometimes the binaries were built by someone else

472
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,319
and sometimes they get built on your system,

473
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:15,680
right?

474
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,939
-- Yeah.
-- So like sometimes if you're

475
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:18,969
all,

476
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,180
I

477
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:19,859
was just like,

478
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,050
y

479
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,410
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So um basically there's this format called a wheel

480
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,520
and a wheel essentially is just,

481
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:30,260
it's just like a zip file that you extract

482
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,920
on your machine and that is the installation process,

483
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,239
right?

484
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,380
-- Like I,
-- so I just, I love how everything

485
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,349
eventually devolves into like

486
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,979
uh Microsoft Word file. No, it's actually a zip file.

487
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,859
-- Like everything is ultimately a zip
-- file. It's all zips

488
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:44,739
and XML.

489
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,430
Yeah. So it's a zip file that you just extract onto your machine.

490
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:52,069
And so the implication of that. And so that's great for like

491
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,349
because it's not running code, it means that you can actually like audit it, right?

492
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,089
So you know what it's going to do.

493
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,979
So that is a good property.

494
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:03,030
And the other good property is that as long

495
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,810
as there is a wheel available for your platform,

496
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,910
like your CPU architecture, all that, whatever that matrix of,

497
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,349
of different variables.

498
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,849
As long as there's a wheel available,

499
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,099
it means that you can install it super easily, really quickly and you know,

500
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:17,890
it's going to work

501
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:19,959
and like it should work and it usually doesn't.

502
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,630
And so like because Python has this,

503
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,540
I would say user base of people that are trying to solve problems that involve code,

504
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,719
but like they don't really care about the code.

505
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:32,979
So like scientists,

506
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,119
you know, right. Like

507
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:35,280
journalists,

508
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,560
there's tons of people that use Python that like if they didn't need to use Python,

509
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,050
they totally wouldn't because they're trying to get a different problem done,

510
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,479
right?

511
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,630
And so because installation of these really,

512
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,109
really powerful tools is so easy through the wheel format,

513
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,439
they are highly demanded,

514
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,380
right? Like if a project

515
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:55,890
is published and there's no wheels available for common architectures.

516
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,069
That's a big problem

517
00:23:57,239 --> 00:24:01,050
for, for that project, They're likely to get requests to, hey, can we,

518
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,020
can we get a wheel file available for this platform?

519
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,650
Whatever.

520
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,469
-- I'm
-- just thinking,

521
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:08,319
I don't think I've actually ever used something that I basically can't pip import.

522
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,410
Like I think there was one time, way back in the day,

523
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,329
I manually downloaded some Python source code, but we're talking like Slackware

524
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:16,410
days.

525
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,810
I don't think I've done that in 20 years.

526
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,069
Yeah.

527
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,349
There's lots of wheels available for these days and

528
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,469
the tooling around it has gotten so much better.

529
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:24,869
It's,

530
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,109
it's really, really good

531
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,459
for sure.

532
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,969
So I, I'll point out to you Kurt,

533
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:32,569
like I keep telling you to use poetry for your Python project.

534
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,300
Poetry can actually import a Git repo,

535
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,489
but I don't want to, I want to use Python or PP

536
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,229
because

537
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,709
there's, it's just a, you know, stuff works.

538
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:42,829
I don't wanna,

539
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:46,349
-- you know, that's it. I just Python works. That's what I wanted to do.
-- That's fair.

540
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,739
They'll force it on you someday. It's coming.

541
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,390
But

542
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,550
OK, I I want to kind of bring this whole conversation, you know, into home now.

543
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,349
Now Seth and I think you have an important story to tell in

544
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,319
that you are a full time employee of a foundation doing security work.

545
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,560
And I know there's been a ton of information.

546
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,209
I mean, Kurt and I have talked about it like tide lift, talks about it all the time.

547
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,000
You've got the open ssf talking about it

548
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,300
about basically just pay the freaking maintainers essentially, right? Where

549
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,719
there's this whole,

550
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,959
I feel like a couple of years ago, the attitude was like,

551
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:21,819
oh open source developers love working for free.

552
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:22,920
They don't need money,

553
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,979
you know, they are getting exposure

554
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,099
and I think that Tide is starting to turn.

555
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:27,459
But you,

556
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:30,540
like you have real experience here because you're actually doing the work and,

557
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,130
and I would love to just hear your kind of stories and anecdotes and, and thoughts

558
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,979
on

559
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,199
actually being full time employee to work on open source

560
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:42,050
and you have so much progress to show for it,

561
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,579
I think.

562
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:45,079
Yeah, I mean, one of the

563
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:48,239
one of the personal goals for this role is like

564
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,839
just proving that you can, how much you can do

565
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:56,520
with full time staffing, right? Especially full time staffing that is

566
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:59,599
for the most part, like pretty unrestricted, right?

567
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:00,530
Like I obviously,

568
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,119
I have to work on security related things where Python like I have a whole

569
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,000
mission to uphold,

570
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,719
but it wasn't like,

571
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:12,150
oh you need to do these like three things and then like then your contract is over.

572
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,599
It's more of like a hey,

573
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,729
we want security to happen. We know all these standards are happening.

574
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,910
We know like that open source is going to need

575
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,949
to change that things are going to have to happen.

576
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,479
And we want you to go out there and figure

577
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:25,260
out what those things are and be as useful as possible

578
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,949
in those places. And so it's like super

579
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:27,956
self directed and

580
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:29,276
I, I love that,

581
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:33,875
that Alpha Omega has trusted the PSF and me with all of that, right?

582
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:34,255
I

583
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,395
I think the really interesting thing is that

584
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,916
like there are just so many problems out there

585
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,566
that full time staffing are,

586
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:45,956
is like almost necessary to get it done in the timelines that we need, right?

587
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:48,521
Like I have a theory which is a essentially we've solved all

588
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:51,121
the easy problems and we have a lot of hard problems now that

589
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:54,281
like even just to understand the problem is probably going to take

590
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:58,862
tens of hours of constructing a mental model and finding out stuff.

591
00:26:58,871 --> 00:26:59,241
And

592
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,802
that's not something that

593
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:04,322
you can do in your spare time easily or if you do it's going to take six months.

594
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,082
And I don't think Python has six months or 10 years to get this fixed.

595
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,280
No, that's the thing. Like we don't

596
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,890
like open source, took 25 years to kind of get where it is.

597
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,420
And, well,

598
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,540
except now the world depends on it and we can't take another 25 years to get it.

599
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,619
Right. Like, we have a couple of years. No, it's like, what is it? Like?

600
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,650
Those numbers are 80 to 95% of everything is open source now.

601
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,140
Yeah.

602
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:27,660
Right.

603
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,040
Like, I,

604
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,530
I can WSL to install and then the name of

605
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,729
a Linux distribution on my Windows box like it.

606
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:33,949
Yeah.

607
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,170
Right. Yeah, I, I think the other side of it is like

608
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:38,579
there is

609
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:43,339
so much, like, because open source has one has dominated, right? And

610
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:47,199
security is so important right now, all of these regulations happening,

611
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,869
I think that a

612
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,290
really big part of my role is like trying to make it

613
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,489
so that the work that needs to happen to get those regulations implemented

614
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,650
easy

615
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,000
so that all of these projects can kind of go on with their

616
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,569
lives or keep doing for the most part what they're doing today.

617
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,439
Um And be able to say that like they're complying, right? Like that

618
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,890
is a huge goal for me. Um

619
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,170
Just because like, I don't want,

620
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,339
I don't want all of these regulations which I think are, you know,

621
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:18,619
mostly a really good thing

622
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,339
to kind of crush the flame of open source. Right? And

623
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:27,699
as if it's like, it's already a hard job, it's already a hard, like thing to do.

624
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:31,989
So I don't want it to, like, just get harder and So by

625
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,699
having all this like full time staffing, being able to provide that time to

626
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:40,699
fix those problems ahead of time ahead of like, you know,

627
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,910
when everything comes into full effect,

628
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,180
I think providing as much help there is, is a really big part of my role as well. So

629
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:49,339
yeah, that's why I'm focusing on like

630
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,030
bombs and lots of policy work,

631
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,189
lots of people work making systems actually fit together.

632
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:54,859
So

633
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,890
-- and,
-- and what are the regulations? I suspect I know what you're talking about, but

634
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,839
we, we won't go into the details,

635
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:03,329
but at least we'll let people Google some names later.

636
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,540
Yeah, so it's the Cyber resilience Act,

637
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:06,619
the CR A

638
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:12,469
and also the Secure Software development framework, the SSDF from the US and,

639
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,890
and there's, there's a few other

640
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,920
regulations that are coming into effect

641
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,640
two that are formulating some various stages,

642
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,829
but those are the two big ones that are on our radar right now.

643
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:21,359
Yeah.

644
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:24,030
And yeah, there's going to be a ton more of that show up in the next couple of years.

645
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,859
For sure, for sure. I feel like you have set us all up

646
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,219
for understanding

647
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,089
that

648
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:37,020
paying someone to do what is functionally the we'll say boring important work.

649
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:40,849
And I think that's an important part of this is there are many things

650
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,540
I will not do in my free time but I will do for pay,

651
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,079
right?

652
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:47,060
And I think like s bombs are a really good example of that is if you go to an

653
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,880
art developer and you're like, oh, you should make s

654
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,469
bombs, they're going to be like, I don't want to because

655
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,290
why would they? Right. You know, as you're some SBO

656
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,099
weirdo

657
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,709
which you know, I am but

658
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,260
II I get it.

659
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,290
So I'm curious on your thoughts and suggestions for companies or,

660
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,329
or other foundations or kind of

661
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,250
anyone looking to

662
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,949
maybe somehow fund or hire like full time open source

663
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:14,550
developers to do the kind of things you're doing now.

664
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,609
Like, what, what, what went well, what maybe hasn't gone well along your path.

665
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,439
Yeah, I think that

666
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:23,439
the biggest thing that's gone well, has been,

667
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm just gonna say getting paid is a

668
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,140
sorry,

669
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,239
I was maybe assuming that, that,

670
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,530
that, that was a part of the question.

671
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:35,959
-- No, the big,
-- I

672
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,390
mean, and feed my family everyone.

673
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,229
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

674
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:43,939
Beside besides being paid full time to do open source, I mean, like that's the dream,

675
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:44,349
right.

676
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:44,910
Um

677
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:48,430
Yeah, it's, it's been, it's been a lovely time. I mean, I, I've been enjoying it.

678
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:52,869
Uh, no, I, I think that the biggest thing that Alpha Omega got right,

679
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,619
uh, with this role and with a lot of the roles that they do, it's not just that the PSF is

680
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,660
not,

681
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,270
not restricting

682
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,500
the staffing, not making it this, like,

683
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,089
ok, you're going to do exactly this,

684
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,650
it's going because

685
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,040
the thing about security and the thing about

686
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:11,189
the Real World

687
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,010
is that things change.

688
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,849
Yes, priorities change.

689
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,089
And if we're just going to be doing the exact same thing every single day,

690
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:22,930
it's not necessarily going to end up with that result that we want,

691
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:25,569
especially if this is supposed to be like a long term engagement.

692
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,729
And so I think the best thing that they got right was like putting

693
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:30,609
a lot of trust in

694
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,729
the PSF in the foundation that's actually going to be, you know,

695
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:35,979
hiring the staffing.

696
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:38,180
And so if you're doing that, like,

697
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,819
if you're trying to bring on a maintainer or if you're trying to, you know,

698
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,250
hire someone to do open source part time

699
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,540
or you're trying to contribute to a foundation

700
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:49,520
to do this sort of like foundational boring work

701
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,920
that is really important,

702
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,400
trying to

703
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,319
make sure that it's not

704
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,560
like caveat

705
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:56,439
or

706
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,359
like we want this list of things to happen, like,

707
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:01,479
obviously come to the conversation with things that you'd

708
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,969
love to see because it starts the conversation,

709
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:04,400
right?

710
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,479
But be open to

711
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,069
the person that you end up hiring or the foundation that you're working with,

712
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,469
like, having a different set of priorities than you.

713
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,030
So,

714
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:13,790
yeah, that's

715
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:13,930
good.

716
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,000
I think, no,

717
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,989
I think that's important because that's one thing

718
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,150
I really respected at Red Hat is like,

719
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,859
there's one person on the Red Hat product security

720
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:23,969
team whose primary email address is at debian.org,

721
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,770
right? Like it's,

722
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:30,250
and well, no, like a lot of companies if you told them that they'd be like, the what?

723
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,339
Like, no, we can't hire what? This makes no sense. Right.

724
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,390
Why is he, why are we paying him to work for Debian?

725
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,520
And I've seen that happen with, you know, these enterprises where it's like

726
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,219
they, you know, oh, we'll give you 10% time. Well, no, that's not enough.

727
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:47,109
That's still kind of a hobby. It needs to be full time. And then also, well,

728
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,253
they'll do some of what you want but they won't, you know, they might find,

729
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:50,853
they might,

730
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:51,932
the foundation says, hey, no,

731
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,792
this other thing we need to do is way more important than your corporate need.

732
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,973
And I feel like a lot of companies

733
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:57,983
are gonna,

734
00:32:58,032 --> 00:32:59,613
I think it might be difficult for them to

735
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:01,113
understand that because they're just not used to this.

736
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,762
Right. They're to quote Thomas PP,

737
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:05,542
I am not your supplier and they're used to dealing with suppliers who can,

738
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,282
you know, do this or else I don't pay

739
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:09,652
and I don't know that that's going to work very well here.

740
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,406
Yeah. It, it's really tough to,

741
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:16,245
I guess, I don't know how else to phrase, like, just the ego part of it, right?

742
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:20,336
Where it's like the, like owning the work, having your brand on the work. Like, I,

743
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,436
I think that there has to be some trust that the person that's doing the work

744
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:29,395
is going to talk about you as a sponsor in a very positive light and that,

745
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:32,206
that's going to reflect, it doesn't necessarily have to,

746
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:33,430
you know,

747
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:36,280
be this top to bottom ownership for it to

748
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,579
be this huge positive thing for your organization.

749
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,189
Well, and I think some of the organizations forget too that, like

750
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,560
internally at the CS A,

751
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:46,869
we end up with a developer maintaining an authentication library because

752
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,869
while we were using it, it had to work and it,

753
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:52,709
-- that was vastly cheaper than trying to rip and replace
-- it.

754
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,939
All right, I think we've come to the end Seth.

755
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:58,989
I will give you the last word, your bit of you can,

756
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,060
you can tell the audience whatever you like for this part,

757
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:07,010
pay the maintainers. I don't know, it works, it works. I promise like II,

758
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,840
I spend all day just proving that point and

759
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,050
it would be really, really great to see more of this happening.

760
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,879
I think it would make this huge improvement in the open source ecosystem.

761
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,918
It solves so many problems. And I think that the problem is a lot smaller

762
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:24,629
than people like to think. Like, how many staffing do we need?

763
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:27,358
I don't have the exact number, but I think it's,

764
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:30,759
I think you can do a lot with a little when it comes to staffing.

765
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:32,809
I was gonna say it's also, it's uh

766
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:34,608
in my experience,

767
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,168
a lot of open source projects have like a

768
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:38,998
core nucleus of one or two or maybe three people

769
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:42,958
which in the grand scheme of things is not a lot of people that's not even a bus load,

770
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:43,467
you know,

771
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,319
but you can put them all on a motorcycle

772
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:46,289
if they balance

773
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,279
and that's one thing I've consistently seen.

774
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,168
So I, I think maybe part of the messaging also would help with these.

775
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:54,618
I I can't help but wonder if these companies think about these open

776
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,928
source projects in staff in terms of what they do internally with like,

777
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:00,289
oh, we need 50 people to write this accounting subsystem

778
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:03,049
to have meetings and stuff versus you know, open source. You have

779
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,608
two core people and like 100 volunteers.

780
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:10,289
Yeah, open source has this like incredible multiplicative effect, right?

781
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:12,089
Like the work that happens

782
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,360
at these low like mid stack and in applications and everything,

783
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,040
it it really does have a huge impact even just having

784
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,520
one, you know,

785
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,739
one full time staff on a project can completely change the trajectory

786
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,100
of that project in terms of what it can get done,

787
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,260
for sure,

788
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,459
for sure. All right, I'm, I'm calling it.

789
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,500
Uh I'm gonna put a link in the show notes to like Seth

790
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,689
has a very nice website that has his blog and some contact details.

791
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,110
His blog is marvelous.

792
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,120
You've been traveling all over the place, giving talks about this stuff,

793
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,209
which is amazing.

794
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,489
They're all linked in his blog. So, so go watch him. But yeah, Seth.

795
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,530
-- Thank you so much, man. This has been a lovely chat
-- Thank you so much for having me.

796
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,350
Well, I'm sure we'll have you back at some point.

797
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,090
Like just keep doing awesome work, man.

798
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,330
