Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,689
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,020
-- Josh Bresser. Uh,
-- good old Thought Crime. Ok. I have a, a complaint.

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,840
I, I want to register and this is something I not,

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,209
I've never really thought about before.

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,250
So I was at a small security conference last week called Grassroots.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,200
It's a local show.

7
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,569
I did a talk about what is open source and that,

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,370
that's like a discussion we should probably have someday.

9
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,010
But anyway,

10
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:28,170
I,

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,409
I was giving some cards out to some people I'd met and I realized

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,561
like half my contact info was wrong on these business cards and I'm like,

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,561
I probably need to get new ones.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,471
-- That's why
-- I only ever put my email address.

15
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,471
Well, so, so that's what I was thinking about.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,020
I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna, like,

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,201
make my own cards with all of the contact info I want on it.

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,890
Like it just whatever work I'm gonna ignore like your fancy cards.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,511
I know the CS A ones like we used to put Twitter on there and stuff and it's kind of like.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,221
Right. Right.

21
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:52,451
But

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,070
I, I'm, I'm happy to do that.

23
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,750
I would like to put like Mastodon and stuff like that on there. Right.

24
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,340
But

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,180
so anyway,

26
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:03,141
I created SPG files for all the things I want on this and I go to like Vista Print and I

27
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:06,022
upload the SVG files and the things they show me

28
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,132
are not the things I put in the SVG file.

29
00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:13,692
Right? And I'm like thinking, hm, is the SVG renderer they have bad.

30
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,931
So the thing I see on the, on the website is just wrong.

31
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:19,491
What, where is the disconnect here?

32
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,251
And if I get this card made, what am I going to get back?

33
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:25,232
And part of me is tempted to just do it to see what happens.

34
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,412
But anyway, I was like,

35
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,472
I'd always thought of svgs as like this magic universal file format.

36
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:33,663
Dude, we can't even render text safely. Like,

37
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,623
like people manage to mess up

38
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,642
Asy text. That's probably fair, right? Like there's slash ends in there.

39
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:42,752
Should that be a slash end or an actual break? No, I'm serious.

40
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:43,373
Like

41
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:48,502
I discovered, oh, favorite thing I discovered that in. Oh, what the heck.

42
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,053
So somebody at the CS A sent me a CS V file

43
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:54,392
and I'm like parsing it in Python and it's just like barfing all over the place.

44
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:55,873
And I'm like, what in the heck?

45
00:01:56,244 --> 00:02:00,454
And it's saying some weird UTF eight sequence and I look at the file and it's like, no,

46
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:02,414
and what it was is Excel

47
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:03,893
can put in

48
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:08,184
uh character at the beginning of the line to basically specify that like, kind of, I,

49
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,214
I'm getting this slightly wrong but basically that,

50
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:12,014
like there's unicode or something in this line

51
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:12,893
and something like that.

52
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:16,694
So, like there's special encodings that Excel can drop into a CS V file.

53
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,533
That's exciting. And it was a specific CS V encoding character thing.

54
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:24,744
Yeah. Like there's all sorts of like even quote

55
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,304
unquote, air quotes, simple as

56
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,005
text CS V file with quotes and commas.

57
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:29,514
No,

58
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,994
like I totally messed that up and had to

59
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,235
spend an hour learning about this special command character.

60
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:34,035
Then

61
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,175
you there's probably a Python library that can do this correctly.

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,395
-- No, no, but
-- it's just I, I was expecting a CS V file that was asking and it wasn't

63
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,505
right. Like it's one of those, this is UTF eight and I'm like, but why?

64
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,914
-- But none of the data has UTF eight
-- anyway.

65
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,695
It's all exciting and fun

66
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:50,994
breaks.

67
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,479
Nothing works like this is why animated Jeeps are still used because

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,949
the only video format we can all render.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,100
-- You don't
-- even notice though is now when I download a dot Web P file,

70
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,970
I can actually somewhat correctly interact with it on windows.

71
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,110
Whereas before it was just like,

72
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,779
you know, and I'm like

73
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,259
my web browser can do this. Why can't windows anyway,

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,070
right? Like I would just like to print this image or whatever you know,

75
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
I

76
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,229
know. So,

77
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,020
yeah. So, well, speaking of which, so open SSH is adding a feature.

78
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,050
If it had been added maybe 25 years ago, it would have been somewhat useful,

79
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,880
but nowadays it's kind of useless.

80
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,559
I disagree. I don't think it's useless at all. I'm glad they're doing this.

81
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,639
The, the title from Open BS D Journal

82
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,550
of the show notes says open SSH

83
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,919
introduces options to penalize undesirable behavior,

84
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,639
meaning things doing

85
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,960
like brute force attempts or crashing the open SSH process or whatever will they,

86
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,720
they, they looks like there's, they're not turning down by default

87
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,944
and there's a default of a 32nd time out. It sounds like

88
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,473
I, I love this. I think that I wish they'd done this a long time ago.

89
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,794
-- So
-- what is this? Explain to us what it is?

90
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:58,554
Well, my understanding is, it's kind of like, it's, it's similar to what,

91
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,994
what failed to ban was way back in the day, right?

92
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:04,873
Where essentially if you run an open SSH server on the internet,

93
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:08,294
regardless of support because I run one on a screwy port thinking, oh,

94
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,923
I'll escape all the BRT Marsha, Tamsa.

95
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:13,593
No, if you run open like an SSH server on the internet,

96
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:16,983
it's getting hammered all the time by random

97
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,868
log in attempts. And

98
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,428
the intent being

99
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:23,597
that what will happen is obviously, generally speaking,

100
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:26,507
open SSH doesn't have a concept of

101
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,588
like uh uh what do they call the, the time out

102
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,787
when you try to log in too many times, like rate limiting or rate limiting.

103
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:35,007
There you go. That's the word.

104
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:36,278
It doesn't really have that.

105
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:39,358
So Attackers will just like hammer the crap out of your machine

106
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,278
and try like a million passwords and when none of them work,

107
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,648
they move on to the next machine.

108
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,268
And so the intent

109
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:52,052
is that if it sees behavior like this from either one IP or a subnet block,

110
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:56,511
the subnet block being important, especially in like I PV six land.

111
00:04:56,941 --> 00:05:02,782
So it can basically time out those IP spaces and say for 30 seconds,

112
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,182
you can't connect to me at all.

113
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:06,821
-- So
-- here's my question. What specific

114
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:07,932
threat

115
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,071
is it addressing?

116
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,161
I think there are two specific threat.

117
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:12,302
Number one,

118
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,462
the brute force

119
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,466
problem is real. Why? Why?

120
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:18,165
Because people put crap on the internet all the time that have,

121
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:20,096
-- shouldn't
-- people be using SSH keys?

122
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:21,256
A lot of people don't.

123
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:25,816
So I would point out there if you're using, for example, default passwords.

124
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,376
Well, this will get in actually eventually anyways.

125
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:30,895
-- No,
-- I don't think it, well, I mean,

126
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,946
potentially it depends on how complicated the password is,

127
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:37,165
let's say for the sake of argument using a top 1000 known like test,

128
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,026
test admin 1234 kind of thing

129
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,686
this will get in it won't stop it because the

130
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,160
attacker will just rotate IP S. See the I think part of the problem is

131
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,609
people a lot of people still think

132
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,440
-- IP addresses are hard to get and they're not,
-- no IP S are easy to get.

133
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,809
That's not, that's not the concern though, Kurt.

134
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,839
So the thing is I'm less concerned about brute forcing necessarily

135
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,820
because I think brute forcing, like you said, like if you're using a crap password,

136
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:07,510
someone's going to get in eventually whether you're banning IP S or not.

137
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,640
I, I like that. If it, something is correct.

138
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,970
Dashing the SSH service, it will also ban that.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,190
That one feels better to me because there have been multiple

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,059
attacks against servers where in order to execute the attack,

141
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,380
you have to basically try something a million times.

142
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,799
-- That particular use case, I think is a big deal
-- until you're on a carrier grade. Nat,

143
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,459
like

144
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,500
when I use my cell phone, I am basically on the same IP address as

145
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,660
everybody in Canada on tell us network.

146
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:41,619
That's right. And so if it bans that IP

147
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:42,649
uh

148
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,170
-- oops,
-- well, too bad for you then, but that's

149
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,059
what I'm pointing out is

150
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,299
so turn it off.

151
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,589
That's the thing. Ok. No, no. Ok. Look, here's the thing.

152
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,910
You're taking the attitude too many security people take, which is,

153
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,809
this doesn't solve all the problems.

154
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,790
So it's stupid and useless and we don't need it.

155
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,329
And the thing is when people do this kind of stuff, it, it

156
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:06,540
infuriates me because there is so much that has been helped

157
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,545
back in the world of security for so long because,

158
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:13,385
and I used to be just like this a decade ago, I'll, I'll totally put, put my,

159
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:14,904
all the blame on me here.

160
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:20,154
But there's this prevailing attitude of, if it's not perfect, it's not worth doing.

161
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,885
-- And that is ridiculous, it is wrong and ridiculous to have that
-- attitude.

162
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,234
That's not what I'm trying to say.

163
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,059
-- What I'm trying to say is in this
-- case,

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,790
the cure

165
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,700
my soapbox,

166
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,820
then you have to learn to speak better

167
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,040
-- because that's what everyone hears from security
-- people.

168
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,299
What I was trying to say

169
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,489
is that this is a situation where

170
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,540
here is a cure and in some cases, the cure is worse than the disease.

171
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,440
And that is not really explicitly explained

172
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,660
here in the documentation and everything.

173
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,619
Like if you look at the commits and the documentation added with it, for example,

174
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,179
they don't mention

175
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:55,062
that, oh, you know, if you're on carrier grade net on a cell phone,

176
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,201
there is a high potential that if somebody else scans from that IP address.

177
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,462
And here's the fun thing.

178
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:02,062
There was a thread on hacker news about a year

179
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:05,682
ago talking about how do you download websites very reliably

180
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:09,321
because for example, like I can run a headless chrome and that will solve, you know,

181
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,601
because they're blocking curl and w get user agents.

182
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:14,432
So I run a headless chrome to get all the javascript running and everything. OK?

183
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,032
But they're banning my IP. What do I do.

184
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,511
And the number one answer is

185
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:19,864
you use carrier grade N

186
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:24,803
IP S because nobody wants to block like all of tell us in Western Canada, I mean, sure,

187
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:28,723
because like, as a website, I can't do that because like, uh for example,

188
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,063
when I use the VPN on my desktop here,

189
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,513
you know, Google gets very aggressive about like,

190
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:38,643
oh you need to log in again and like literally every a couple hours, Google's like,

191
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:39,332
who are you?

192
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,073
We're gonna double check because like the IP is so kind of mi

193
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:45,164
uh it's misbehaving badly. Google

194
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:49,116
block the IP address because then they would be blocking everybody on Nord VPN.

195
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,106
I, I'm not gonna disagree with you at all.

196
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:54,856
I think that's an extremely valid point and a good concern. So here's the thing.

197
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,406
There is probably a lot of people who don't understand this.

198
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,776
I don't have a total grasp on this either because quite frankly,

199
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:03,495
I just don't do anything valuable over my cell phone because it's a cell phone.

200
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,966
But the thing is

201
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,995
doing something like this, adding this sort of feature is step one and saying, oh,

202
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,656
it's worthless because of cell phones.

203
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,526
No, no, no,

204
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,848
no. This is like a learning experience.

205
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:18,447
There are going to be multiple steps along the path and if, if this is a problem,

206
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,817
we there there are going to be solutions.

207
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,708
-- I don't know what they are,
-- but we already have a better solution.

208
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:27,468
We have a much better solution for SSH and brute forcing. And that is

209
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,627
permit password login. No,

210
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:31,357
and only a lock key login.

211
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:32,028
I,

212
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,838
well, that's, no, that's not enough though, Kurt, because

213
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,307
the reality is you can have instances where keys get leaked.

214
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,419
You can have exploits.

215
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,239
-- Then
-- how is banning their IP address gonna work

216
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,000
-- because they're gonna log in with it
-- because,

217
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,859
no, no, what you're gonna see is, let's say there's a leaked key.

218
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:50,849
They're just gonna spray the internet with the leaked key.

219
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:54,059
I mean, that's what you see now where if you run an SSH server on,

220
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,030
on the public internet,

221
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,534
you see just like random keys being attempted against my server, like constantly.

222
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:04,854
-- Well,
-- because like open SSL that one time and Debian only generated 64,000 keys.

223
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:05,255
Oops.

224
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:06,614
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.

225
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,094
But, but anyway, my,

226
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:12,525
my point is there is nothing wrong with a feature like this had security.

227
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:17,215
Here's here is my honest opinion. Had security people been less like this

228
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,429
10 or 20 years ago,

229
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:23,309
we could have experimented more and learned more things because every

230
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,909
time you try to do something you're going to learn,

231
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,669
there is nothing wrong or bad with adding features like this.

232
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,270
It is a learning experience. Is it an end? All be all? Absolutely not.

233
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,700
No one should think of it that way. It

234
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,979
is a learning experience and by people coming out and saying, oh, it's stupid or bad.

235
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,669
Like if you read the hacker news comments.

236
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,309
The, it's just like this,

237
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,590
I think it is wrong to claim something is bad or dumb.

238
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,270
For one specific reason,

239
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,510
it is a learning experience and we need to use this stuff to learn.

240
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,590
-- So
-- I'm going to push back on that saying we've learned this, we have failed to ban.

241
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,109
People have run it for decades.

242
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,570
We know how this works and how it happens.

243
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,760
Do we?

244
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:00,929
Yeah, I, I ran,

245
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,900
fail to ban and then I stopped because I

246
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,890
realized the better solution was permit password login.

247
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,530
No, and only allow key access. Sure.

248
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,650
I, I agree.

249
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,349
So my, my problem with fail to ban was it was too jumpy or, or too,

250
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,330
I don't know what to call it.

251
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,969
It was a bit more Banny than it should have been.

252
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,809
-- Well,
-- this is going to have the exact same behavior if that's a problem.

253
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:25,346
This has a 30 second time out though, fail to ban would ban forever.

254
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:29,956
I don't know if fail to ban, could ban for 30 seconds. I honestly, I, I turned it on,

255
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,856
I managed to ban myself and then I just turned it off.

256
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,867
-- Instead of looking deeper into it. You
-- could configure it.

257
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:36,286
II,

258
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:41,666
I did have it either configured or custom mangled up to un ban after a while because,

259
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,106
yeah, that was one of my concerns.

260
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:43,267
Yeah.

261
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:43,427
And,

262
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,346
and like 30 seconds would be perfect because so here's

263
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:49,146
the thing and here's why I love the 32nd idea

264
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:53,064
when you have any sort of brute force going on, obviously,

265
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:56,124
people are going to try probably millions or thousands

266
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,794
of attempts a second to log into an account.

267
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,343
Right.

268
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:03,044
And even if you like, they try five times and then you give them 30 seconds to time out,

269
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,343
now you've gone from like

270
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:07,723
millions of attempts per second to like, maybe

271
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:11,484
100 an hour. Right. That's a huge difference.

272
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:15,473
And to be clear that 32nd is just an example given it's, I don't know what the actual

273
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:16,291
is.

274
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,971
-- That's 30 seconds is what they say. It sounds like it'll be the default. But
-- yes,

275
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,370
no, it said eg 30 seconds against the client

276
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,620
just as example.

277
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:25,770
So regardless. So,

278
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,830
but this leads to the thing. And what I was trying to get at is

279
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,221
this to me is not a good security feature and please hear me out

280
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,880
what this is a good feature is essentially slowing the Attackers down.

281
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,591
It's like the tar pitting with postfix where you have, for example, back in the day,

282
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,940
you have postfix set up to like,

283
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,229
no, you can't send me an email right now,

284
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,609
come back in four hours because spammers don't

285
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,799
like they, they don't come back. Remember that, right?

286
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,650
And now the annoying thing is, is, you know, when you got new email from people,

287
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,570
yeah, you'd have to wait four hours to get a reply from them the first time around.

288
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,469
I want it now right now.

289
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,409
-- But it was only for email addresses you've never seen before
-- so

290
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,309
I could set it, I think to the domain level, which I did some places because,

291
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,960
-- right, like,
-- that's fair,

292
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:07,369
you know,

293
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:07,780
like,

294
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:08,119
yeah,

295
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,309
at least once they sent you spam once, then they can.

296
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:11,320
But

297
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,090
again, it's like, it's like the tar pitting where, you know, somebody sends

298
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,380
connection to you and you, you send a really

299
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,820
slow

300
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:21,380
response

301
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,090
that, you know, that forces their scanning activity to go from like, yeah,

302
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:27,419
1000 scans an hour, 10 or 100 or, and, you know, and it,

303
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,900
it essentially breaks the economics because

304
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,719
Attackers have to be efficient because like, they're,

305
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,210
they're running on a shoestring budget.

306
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:37,229
There's two kinds of Attackers though. One of them has to be efficient.

307
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,309
That's the opportunistic attack. But the, the directed attack,

308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,549
those are the people that will just get

309
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,710
a million IP addresses and do one attempt for IP against you.

310
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:51,789
And so I think the thing here is I wouldn't call this a security feature

311
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,669
because otherwise that's like calling,

312
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,340
oh, you know, those little, like concrete blocks at the front of the parking lot.

313
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:59,270
So you don't like park your car

314
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,869
where, like, you don't go past them.

315
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,929
That's like calling those a security feature.

316
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,390
No, it's like, so you feel a bump with your car and you stop going,

317
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,559
you hopefully don't run into the store or whatever.

318
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,989
Right? Whereas if you actually want security, you put giant honking boards

319
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:12,460
in front.

320
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:13,890
Well, ok,

321
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:17,289
I think the definition of security is broken.

322
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,450
-- I'll
-- agree with that because we have this obsession with like, it has to be a bank

323
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,169
or it's worthless. And

324
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,359
what we're talking about here is the concept we often call defense in depth

325
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,530
where there isn't like one thing that's going to solve the problem.

326
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:33,000
I have 700 little things

327
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:38,169
all meant to slow down or, or steer an attacker away from me

328
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,080
and it's going to give me time to react and detect, not necessarily stop the

329
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,799
attack.

330
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,989
Actually, I think you just said the important thing to steer the attacker away.

331
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,250
-- Right. And a lot of businesses do this where, I mean,
-- for opportunistic.

332
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,750
Yes.

333
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,369
Well, and a lot of businesses do this, you know,

334
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,270
where they have like giant security sign

335
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:57,520
labels all over everything so that hopefully the attacker goes,

336
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,500
oh, I'll just rob that other store that doesn't have those warning labels.

337
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,830
Yeah, I mean, that's right

338
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,700
when you're dealing with opportunistic Attackers. Absolutely.

339
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,590
And I think in this case, this is a good example of like putting up that, you know,

340
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:11,590
warning dog will bite you if you come on my property

341
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,119
kind of sign, right?

342
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,270
This is not going to stop a targeted attacker and that's ok because

343
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,909
the way you would do that is by having

344
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,669
key authentication, not passwords like sure, sure, simple.

345
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,030
But, and I think that's a big part of the prompt too is like, Show Dan, right.

346
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,330
Show Dan dot IO basically scans the internet.

347
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,109
-- Like, what, every couple of hours,
-- 7.5 minutes.

348
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,739
Right.

349
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,320
And you know, and then the thing is like, yeah, they fire off like,

350
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,820
there's like things like mass scan where you, you know,

351
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,880
if you have enough bandwidth and a laptop with more than about four gigabytes of ra M,

352
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,400
it just,

353
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,440
it can scan the entire internet in like eight hours or the entire

354
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:49,559
-- four internet in like a couple of hours.
-- V six. We haven't figured out yet.

355
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,359
Well, I don't think you really have to because you know DNS

356
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,400
but uh anyways back to this. So

357
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,659
I think the problem is this feature,

358
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:01,119
I personally would modify it more so that it is

359
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,789
safer to enable by default and essentially slows down attack

360
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,630
so that it can be enabled by default.

361
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,359
And for example, if you make SSH scanning by default,

362
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,650
let's do a round number 10 times more expensive computationally,

363
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:19,000
that's going to discourage and stop some people from doing it.

364
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,820
Yep. Yep. And ideally what we

365
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,640
see that the flip side of this is, is there's such a an economic

366
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,880
incentive to like showdown dot A O charges money for access to their database.

367
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,280
So they have a strong economic incentive to scan the entire internet.

368
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,479
And what I love then is, you know, as an attacker, I don't have to scan the internet.

369
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,979
I can just pay showdown, like,

370
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,719
100 bucks a year or whatever it is.

371
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,599
-- I
-- don't think it's even that much.

372
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,229
And, like, search for my, you know, I can search for like, all the SSH scanners in,

373
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,080
like the western side of Edmonton.

374
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,159
Yeah, it's got geographic search.

375
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:53,489
And so again, this kind of comes back to the,

376
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:55,599
I don't, I'm, I'm,

377
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:58,619
I want to get away from, like, I'm not trying to say that, oh, this isn't perfect.

378
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,530
So we shouldn't do it. But I'm saying is

379
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,080
the effort we invest in this.

380
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,390
We,

381
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,079
we already did it once with fail to ban and essentially everybody stopped doing it.

382
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,689
So unless this feature can actually be enabled

383
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,930
by default and work safely by default,

384
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,469
I would say, is it worth the effort

385
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,358
or should you put your effort somewhere else

386
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,640
like making sure you get key authentication only?

387
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,170
No,

388
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,180
I don't think that's a reasonable argument because I think

389
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,098
for number one open SSH is an open source project.

390
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,199
They're allowed to do what they want.

391
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,119
If you think they're wasting their time like f off, they don't care.

392
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,949
No, I'm not worried about them wasting their time.

393
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm worried about them wasting my time

394
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,349
-- and everybody else's time,
-- they're not going to waste your time. It's not default.

395
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,439
Are there other things they could do? Absolutely. There, there definitely are.

396
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,270
I think the reason failed to ban

397
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,349
quite frankly. Just never caught on. It's because it wasn't included by default.

398
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,750
-- Uh
-- It was actually in some Linux distro, maybe

399
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,660
in a Linux distro.

400
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,469
But I think fundamentally this is a sort of behavior like if they make it optional,

401
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,270
I bet 1% of SSH users turn this on

402
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,829
less than that. Maybe. I mean, this is an example of we need to

403
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:03,680
make good security defaults because no one is going to turn it on,

404
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,819
It has to come out of the box with this stuff on.

405
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,500
So I think that is the advantage of putting

406
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,180
this kind of functionality into the open SSH server.

407
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,359
Like would it have been more effective 20 years ago?

408
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,040
Yes, 100%.

409
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,969
But I think there's value in doing things

410
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,390
like this now because lessons will be learned

411
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,969
and we can apply those lessons then in the future to even things beyond open SSH.

412
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:27,109
So perfect example here, why not just use zero trust import knocking,

413
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:30,339
boom done and you don't have to deal with Attackers even seeing your SSH?

414
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,560
Some people do that, but that's not default,

415
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:34,729
right? Again,

416
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,489
whatever the default is is what people are going to use.

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,410
I guess my fear here is people are going to get a false sense of

418
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,000
security that this actually somehow stops Attackers when

419
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,810
it's really only just slowing them down.

420
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,410
I don't know, maybe, I mean,

421
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,020
I think slowing down opportunistic attacks is almost

422
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,400
the same as stopping them because an opportunistic attack

423
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,579
hacker isn't going to stick around.

424
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:57,900
They're just going to leave.

425
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,939
Hopefully. No, not, hopefully that's

426
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,060
how they work.

427
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:04,250
Like that's opportunistic Attackers are looking for low hanging fruit.

428
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,500
All you have to be is a little higher than the apple below you. And you're good.

429
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,660
Well, that's back to that school of fish thought. Right.

430
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:10,780
Like,

431
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,459
you only have to swim a little faster than the rest

432
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,219
of the school of fish to get away from the shark.

433
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,790
You know, and the shark doesn't care who it eats.

434
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,689
No, because like, there's like, because it, I think people forget like 25 years ago,

435
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,699
you couldn't scan the internet,

436
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,790
you couldn't attack everybody in a country in an afternoon,

437
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,920
which like

438
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,829
you can do that now, computationally, like I have a gigabit of bandwidth at home.

439
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,969
That's more like I remember when internet backbones

440
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,099
were t like 45 megabits per second.

441
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,060
And now that's like

442
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:42,310
I would call my cell company to complain that my speed is broken if it was that slow.

443
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:42,829
Right.

444
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,150
That was only 20 years.

445
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,989
The whole universe of internet and technology has moved forward very quickly and

446
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,739
I think the way we secure things has moved too slowly.

447
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,109
And my other thought is anybody who actually cares

448
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,430
about this kind of stuff is already using,

449
00:19:56,439 --> 00:20:00,670
fail to ban or port knocking or zero trust or has SSH on their

450
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,010
servers in a virtual private cloud or whatever the heck your vendor calls it.

451
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,420
Right.

452
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:06,900
So, but internally, like,

453
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,040
like I just internally stood up an application that has a bunch of,

454
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,130
it's like five docker containers and it's got like a

455
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,280
Mongo DB that's like totally unauthenticated and freaking wide open.

456
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,699
But it's only available on like that little internal docker network.

457
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,859
So, like, who cares?

458
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,880
Like, if you're into that network, I'm so far beyond up the creek.

459
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,880
It's not even funny.

460
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,520
Yes. And so

461
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,140
again, I come back to,

462
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,650
I want to see this feature done in a way

463
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,650
where it can just be enabled by default and like it

464
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,040
-- makes Attackers lives a little bit more miserable. I mean,
-- I think that's the plan

465
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,160
they, they mentioned in the announcement, like they want to turn it on someday.

466
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,147
Here's what they wrote.

467
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:46,187
We hope these options will make it significantly

468
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:48,797
more default difficult for Attackers to find accounts,

469
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:49,547
blah, blah, blah.

470
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:49,887
Like

471
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,578
this is HD itself. It says

472
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:53,828
per source penalties is off by default.

473
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:56,267
We expect to enable it automatically in the near future.

474
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,738
It's like that's the goal.

475
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:00,228
Yeah, I mean, and maybe it'll work and maybe it'll help.

476
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:04,508
I, it also depends on what like the values that they choose matter. Sure.

477
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:08,748
But that's the thing we get to learn by trying new things.

478
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:12,635
And again, this is, is the sin of security from the past

479
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:16,595
is perfect or nothing and nothing always won.

480
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,576
Well, I think part of it too was you got to remember we have very finite.

481
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:21,956
Like a lot of people have very finite resources.

482
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:24,505
They're like, by definition, if they had more resources,

483
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:26,135
they would update their software once in a while.

484
00:21:26,145 --> 00:21:28,556
Like a lot of people want to update their software but can't,

485
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:29,696
because they don't have the time and,

486
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:32,416
you know, or things might break or will break.

487
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:36,536
-- But
-- again, that's an excuse for poor behavior. Kurt, there is no reason

488
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,803
-- but,
-- ok, but I'm saying that that's the reality.

489
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:40,923
That's not the reality.

490
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,524
There are two sides to this coin.

491
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:47,203
What you're talking about is the consumer side of this. What I'm talking about

492
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,093
is

493
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:49,593
in the past,

494
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:52,864
a project would suggest a thing like this and the whole security

495
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,654
community would come and take a big poop on top of them

496
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,303
and say that isn't going to solve all the problems.

497
00:21:58,313 --> 00:22:00,014
So you're dumb and you're wasting your time and you're

498
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:03,203
an idiot and we would literally hound them so bad

499
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:04,932
they would give up

500
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:06,631
and they would never try it again.

501
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,612
That is what we used to do. You and I have done that to more than one project.

502
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,281
-- Well,
-- you

503
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,862
-- used to still do,
-- well, it's happening right now

504
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:15,102
in

505
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,432
freaking hacker news.

506
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:22,511
But that's the thing that behavior is inexcusable and should be not tolerated

507
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:26,312
in any instance because this is an example of let's try something.

508
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:29,832
Let's see what happens. The people who can't update their software,

509
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,699
they have other problems, but

510
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,300
in theory, if we can make software better when they can update their software,

511
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,260
they're going to get something more secure than what they have today.

512
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,699
Well, and that leads to something I've been thinking a lot about recently,

513
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:43,859
which is this

514
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,550
appeasement, like perfect example on Mastodon, somebody's like the L

515
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,109
journal is issuing all these bad CV S and I'm like,

516
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,219
are they bad, like then get them rejected?

517
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,939
Like there's a process for that and the person literally applied with

518
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,420
you should do that

519
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,660
and tell me how it goes and I'm like,

520
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,030
I'm blocking you.

521
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,579
-- Like, and, and the person even actually Greg
-- ended up blocking them as well.

522
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,910
They got even worse.

523
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,150
Oh,

524
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,349
-- wow! Ok. I'm so glad I didn't. Like, I'm so glad I'm not very
-- happy.

525
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,260
I didn't because I got to see the trade.

526
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,060
-- I might
-- want

527
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:13,829
to see that later.

528
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:19,290
But the point is this person even made like, like he said, if you to me, like, are you,

529
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,589
if you're making a good faith argument and then

530
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,199
proceeded to say I should do all the work.

531
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:23,800
And it's like,

532
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,619
no, that's not how this works at all. Even a little bit buddy.

533
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,229
Right.

534
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:28,026
I'm not even gonna like,

535
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:30,796
invoke an argument from authority where it's like I've done

536
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,105
a lot of rejected CV S my own and others.

537
00:23:33,265 --> 00:23:34,995
Yeah, it's a thing that happens. It's fine.

538
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,735
Well, that's, that's another conversation I think.

539
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,375
But this boils down to, I think the open source world.

540
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,755
I'm very specifically not saying the security world,

541
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,495
I'm saying the open source world

542
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:48,395
needs to stop being so

543
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:49,936
appeasement.

544
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:50,385
Uh

545
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,095
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they need to stop appeasing people.

546
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:55,765
Like I literally just grabbed a new chunk of software,

547
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,281
probably going to use them for the next 5 to 10 years heavily.

548
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,802
And I found a small,

549
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:02,732
technically a security flaw and it, it, I actually pointed out to them, like,

550
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,472
technically it's a security flaw, but it's,

551
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:06,232
I actually viewed it more as a compliance with

552
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,442
GDPR flaw because it can expose email addresses.

553
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:08,881
Right.

554
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:10,682
And I don't care about that from a security point of view,

555
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,682
but I do care about it from my GDP auditors yelling at me point of view.

556
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,572
And so like,

557
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:16,121
you know, and the solution is easy.

558
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:18,602
It's just when you do the forgot password reset thing,

559
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:20,562
don't tell them if the account exists or not.

560
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:21,962
Just say like, if the,

561
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,212
you know, if this exists, we sent them

562
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:25,027
and he's like,

563
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:25,968
he's like, yeah,

564
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:30,208
you're like, yes, from a, from an audit and compliance point of view. Absolutely.

565
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,228
This needs to be fixed.

566
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:34,348
And I'm like, yeah, I'm like, don't even bother getting a CV. Like, who cares?

567
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:36,387
This is so trivial, right? It does not matter.

568
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:39,378
-- Well, and it's gonna take like an hour of work to get that.
-- Uh

569
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,947
not even you change one config message.

570
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,797
No, I mean, to get a CV E,

571
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:44,797
-- it's
-- gonna take

572
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:48,838
and well, but what's funny is like I came to him with this and I came to him, like,

573
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:52,628
here's one way to fix it is like just edit this message to be the same as the other one.

574
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:56,333
But that's the thing I am now coming to him with. I really would like this.

575
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:58,793
Please fixed and here's like a good way to do it.

576
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:00,203
And here's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

577
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:01,014
And that's

578
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:01,933
what you have to do.

579
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:03,813
Well, no, you don't have to because like

580
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:07,343
that guy went to see was a bully about it or this guy on Mastodon,

581
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:09,384
like do tell us like what did he get worse?

582
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:12,034
Like what did he just demand everybody do everything for him.

583
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:12,494
No,

584
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:15,384
he called out Greg for a particular description

585
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,453
but he purposely only copy and pasted half

586
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:21,014
the description and he left off the part that said it was a denial of service.

587
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,739
He was so good.

588
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:25,890
This person cherry picked text to try to prove his point,

589
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,839
but Greg obviously knew what he was going on.

590
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:28,910
So he called him out for it.

591
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,410
And that's a perfect example of like, I don't care if that person is,

592
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,079
I don't care if their intent is good or malicious, their behavior is bad,

593
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,530
but it's time to stop, it's time to start blocking them and just go on with life.

594
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,050
So like for the ssh people, if they're listening to the show, yeah,

595
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,369
feel free to ignore me.

596
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,650
I'm

597
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,959
-- quite possibly
-- wrong. They definitely ignore Kurt. Please ignore Kurt. But

598
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:50,680
in general, I think that

599
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,619
needs to solve. But at the same time

600
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,140
on a totally separate thing,

601
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:59,199
we do need to think about having solutions that are effective and useful because

602
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,900
remember when I used to think having more CV S was a good thing

603
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,599
and we'll have all the CV S for N PM and it'll be great.

604
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,319
And many, I've

605
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,930
talked to some high level people and they're like, yeah, we, we can't handle the CV S.

606
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,729
-- We got, we
-- need better data.

607
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,739
I agree. We were both in that boat. We were both wrong.

608
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:15,699
Very wrong.

609
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,689
We need better data. Not

610
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,060
because we need better data. We need better data

611
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,189
so that we can then enable

612
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,709
the possibility of automation.

613
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,910
Because right now,

614
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,510
like what I realized is everybody right now

615
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,510
reinvents every major CV E wheel by like having

616
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,630
to research it themselves and then can't publish

617
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,859
that anywhere sane to share it with people,

618
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,829
which is completely bonkers.

619
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:39,310
Right?

620
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
And I just did a test one. And it's funny because Miter is like, oh, that's in the NVD.

621
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,060
We can't fix it and go talk to the NVD. And I'm like, oh right. I,

622
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,310
I keep forgetting that the NVD and Miter are two separate CV databases.

623
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:50,140
Yes,

624
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,949
that's

625
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,150
right.

626
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,449
I keep forgetting that because in my brain,

627
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:53,689
they were supposed to be playing together.

628
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,319
-- That was one of the goals.
-- That's ok.

629
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:58,290
We have three now because sis is doing their own thing called bone enrichment.

630
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,869
So now we have Miter

631
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,099
NVD

632
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,660
github. That's true. Github

633
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,180
-- does their own thing too.
-- Github.

634
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:08,189
Count if you type in a CV E into like a read be dot MD on github

635
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:08,719
and publish

636
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,930
and then click on that CV. Where does it go?

637
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:13,459
-- Goes to the get up security advisory now
-- for what it's worth.

638
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:15,979
I, I almost exclusively send updates to

639
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,609
github just because it's so easy to do.

640
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,770
And I don't care if whatever, if miter falls behind, it doesn't matter.

641
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,260
They're the only people that respond.

642
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,709
Yeah,

643
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,920
you send Apr to

644
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,469
github

645
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,739
and usually it gets accepted in like an hour

646
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,300
and that's it. I'm done.

647
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,180
And if they have a question,

648
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:32,640
they ask a question and then we have a public conversation about it

649
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,729
and sometimes it'll be like we disagree with you and I'm like,

650
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:38,239
well, I think you're wrong but whatever, I can't really do anything about that,

651
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:38,800
that's fine

652
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,430
-- and it's ok, it's in
-- public.

653
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,339
That's where my container format was designed to have

654
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:45,359
conflicting opinions in the data and allow that,

655
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,380
but it's not gonna happen.

656
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,150
-- Well,
-- that,

657
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,739
that's too hard to unwind. Ok.

658
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,170
So anyway,

659
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,670
we're kind of running ourselves out of time here and I don't want to drag this on.

660
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,300
Ok.

661
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,119
So I want to end on this point and I think your appeasement

662
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,699
comment makes a lot of sense and I think that's a very,

663
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,099
very powerful and important thing.

664
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,839
I mean, this totally goes all the way back to Tama de Pierres. I am not a supplier,

665
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:03,280
I

666
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:03,750
think.

667
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:07,614
Well, also is it, is it your, is it a supplier or your supplier?

668
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:14,675
-- It was I am not your supplier.
-- I'm looking this up. I am not a supplier.

669
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:17,025
His blog post is titled I am not a supplier

670
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:18,655
success. I

671
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:18,984
thought it was,

672
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:19,964
you

673
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:20,204
know,

674
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,864
-- well,
-- he's also not my supplier but you know,

675
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,535
that's what it was.

676
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,035
Yeah, I remember now it's like, yeah,

677
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:28,165
because part of the argument was I am not a supplier at all.

678
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,170
So

679
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:30,869
I I

680
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,949
think

681
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:35,619
the appeasement story is important for a couple of reasons.

682
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,030
I think there's the angle of XZ of

683
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:42,910
like if you're an open source project, you do what you want to do,

684
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,869
you owe no one anything right?

685
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,290
There's the angle of for so long these

686
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,250
open source projects would like try something like this

687
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,875
open ssh thing like security people would show up and pile it on and they like,

688
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:56,015
well, I must be dumb because everyone's telling me I'm dumb.

689
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,025
So I just won't do this

690
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:57,974
when in reality,

691
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,135
like it could have been an experiment that we got valuable information out of

692
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:04,895
and and that's not how it works, right? And then I think on the other side,

693
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:08,135
there's the if you are a consumer of open source,

694
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:10,704
you can't just like show up making demands and requests.

695
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:14,285
You really like what you were saying, you have show up with a patch, you know,

696
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:17,055
-- try to help.
-- Ah perfect example,

697
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,415
this software I'm using

698
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,609
doesn't have any backup documentation.

699
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:23,170
And so I showed up saying I want to

700
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,329
write the backup documentation because regardless of this,

701
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,459
I need to back it up anyways.

702
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:26,969
And I'm like,

703
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,020
I think it's this thing in the Mongo TB and this

704
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,479
other thing and this other thing in these two critical files

705
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:35,189
is that all? And next question like, how do we go about writing this?

706
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:39,390
Like, do I submit apr do we talk about it? Do we like what, what's the culture here?

707
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,800
Because like, I've kind of looked through it and I'm not really 100% certain

708
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:42,540
and

709
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,939
the guy is talking to me

710
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,050
like, yeah, we're talking, you know, and it's, it's good

711
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,630
and that's, you know, if, if even 1% of people could behave like that,

712
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,969
it would push open source forward quite a bit

713
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:56,260
faster because I'm also beginning to realize like,

714
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,750
like that thing on Mastodon, I am now at the point where to put it bluntly,

715
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,829
I have the maturity to say, oh,

716
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,750
this person is throwing dog poo at people.

717
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,609
I'm going to put up a magical force field so they can't

718
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,150
throw dog poop at me and I'm going to ignore them completely.

719
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,369
-- I
-- ban people like un unmasked and actually there was someone the other day

720
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,109
that I posted one of my CV E graphs and they replied with,

721
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,760
you should never make graphs again and then explained what was wrong with my graph.

722
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,790
And I'm like, you know what ban?

723
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,439
Like I'm not even going to reply to this. It's not worth my time

724
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,410
like it. That's the beauty of, I think things like Mastodon is as,

725
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,479
as poor behavior emerges. It feels much easier to just get rid of it altogether.

726
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:36,319
Well, the other thing I'm realizing is there is

727
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,189
a statistical chance they might say something useful and helpful.

728
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,369
But in most cases, even if they do,

729
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,479
it's buried in so much other garbage and time

730
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,000
wasting stuff that it's just not worth it.

731
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,209
I agree. I agree.

732
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:49,819
And this goes back to like that whole classic trope of,

733
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:52,569
like the rockstar programmer that's like toxic and kills the team.

734
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:55,819
Like, ok, you killed your team but you had one productive programmer. Good job.

735
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,349
And the era of that is needs to end.

736
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,229
No, I think it, I think it's over. I don't think

737
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,520
there's a rock

738
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,609
star concept like there used to be.

739
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:09,729
I definitely feel like there was much worse behavior 20 years ago

740
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:10,530
than,

741
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:14,810
I mean, I think some of the things I did 20 years ago would get me fired today.

742
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,250
I have no doubt. And it, it, I'm glad. Right. That's the way it should be. All right.

743
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,569
I'm gonna call this one. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening. Go,
