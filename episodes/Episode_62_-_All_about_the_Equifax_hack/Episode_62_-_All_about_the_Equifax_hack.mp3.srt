Hello and welcome to Episode 62 of the open source security podcast

1
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,279
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,870
Happy one year, Kurt, it has been slightly more than one year since we published.

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,870
Episode one,

4
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,069
which I listened to the other day.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,489
Holy cow. It's bad.

6
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:30,250
-- It's so bad.
-- I can't read anything. I wrote more than about five years ago

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,370
ever because,

8
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:32,119
yeah,

9
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:35,330
my writing from 1015 years ago is so,

10
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:35,705
so

11
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:36,805
funny.

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:38,944
-- But I think it's done in
-- Kruger.

13
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:43,165
I'm sure that's part of it. And you just, you, you're not the same person.

14
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:47,584
You were five years ago. Yeah, I read a blog post. I wrote about a year ago and,

15
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:47,865
uh,

16
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:51,845
it was embarrassing, I thought, and it's only been a year. I feel like

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,439
I, I don't feel like I'm that different from a year ago, but upon reading my writing,

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,209
I, I was like, that could that person read?

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,040
Like,

20
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:04,449
it's surreal and, and I guess, yeah, even this podcast, although I will say that

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,709
when we started,

22
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,690
we had a vastly inferior equipment

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,470
and we,

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,360
we didn't know what we were doing

25
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,290
and, and we learned.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,430
And that's one thing I, I forget I was,

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,300
I was telling someone about recording a podcast and just kind of doing all the post

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,209
and

29
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,680
I screw something up every time and I learn a lesson, right? Like it guaranteed

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,349
and, and it's been what, 62 episodes?

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,919
And I still make mistakes every freaking time and learn something new.

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,790
So, I don't know, maybe by like episode 100

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,949
we'll figure it out.

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,099
Well,

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,860
the thing I really love is that nobody's actually

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,059
written down a good like podcasting one on one,

37
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,919
like go by this, you know, microphone, go by, you know, get this software.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,629
Here's the process to edit it together. Here's, here's

39
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,635
you and I still haven't figured out is how to do a really good, more than

40
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:53,175
two person audio

41
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,514
that's very difficult to do. Well, no, we know how to do it because we did it with Dan.

42
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:02,014
But Dan, you need uh your gas test to have a certain level of,

43
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,754
I guess recording savviness.

44
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,660
Yeah, that you don't know, he's fine.

45
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:09,008
But anyway, anyway, let's, but before we get too deep in

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,369
-- here, why don't we? Uh
-- Well, I guess the big news this week would be the uh

47
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,750
-- has it been branded yet? I don't think so.
-- No,

48
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,539
no, there's no brand. This is, see, see, this is the problem.

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,380
So we're going to talk about Equifax and at the

50
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,839
same time there's a bunch of hurricane crazy going on

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,559
and hurricanes have names. So we know it's happening, we can easily talk about

52
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,660
three of them right now.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,460
I know, man. It's crazy.

54
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:35,449
It's, it's crazy and, and this Equifax thing is just like a total disaster

55
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,100
and it has no name other than, although in this case,

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,330
the Equifax thing might be what it goes down as just because it's that big.

57
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:48,539
But I know it's tough man. And, and I think the other thing we should keep in mind is

58
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,089
this Equifax story, while it is evolving and will continue to evolve,

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,610
the fundamental privacy problems around this are eternal and will never go away.

60
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,250
Right.

61
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:58,869
Yeah.

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,210
Oh yeah. No, it's,

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,610
it's, it's just, yeah, it's part of how we've architected society.

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,559
It is,

65
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,320
it is, you're so right and we did it wrong

66
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:09,320
this,

67
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,050
-- well,
-- we didn't do it wrong. It's

68
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:11,279
just, it,

69
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,270
it reminds me of like when you look at, for example,

70
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,559
the way certain businesses and certain technologies worked and it had to

71
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,839
work that way in the past because the technology was limited,

72
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,759
you know, like the way phone numbers work,

73
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,800
right? There's

74
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,080
retarded in today's modern world.

75
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,119
But phone numbers back in the day, totally made sense because you had like a like,

76
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,199
well, you started with humans followed by electro

77
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,259
mechanical switches

78
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,610
and, and the numbers did things in the electro

79
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,039
mechanical switches as you dialed and it would,

80
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,679
it was like literally routing your call as you press buttons and,

81
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,369
and connecting wires, which is crazy to think about.

82
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,119
And, well, I guess humans did it before then.

83
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,789
Yeah.

84
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,070
So, so the Equifax thing, well,

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,720
I guess I'll lead off since I'm probably a

86
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,460
bit more annoyed about it than you are because it

87
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:54,639
might be affected

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,470
-- or it might not
-- be

89
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,830
affected.

90
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:58,720
-- I can't
-- even begin to find out yet.

91
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,119
That's, that, that's a shame. Although it's

92
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,029
not like I know, it's just, this is like the 10th time my identity has been stolen,

93
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,949
so I don't care.

94
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,559
Well, no, no, no, it's, no, it's easy. If you're an American,

95
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,720
if you are an adult in America, you're

96
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,520
affected.

97
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,960
Yeah, that's true. You're, you're affected, guaranteed,

98
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,795
either directly affected or you're going to be affected in secondary way,

99
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,915
probably by a friend or family or something.

100
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:22,915
I think it's,

101
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,774
it's a guarantee at this point.

102
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:26,924
I know they have some hokey website where you can sort

103
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,045
of find out if you may get your stuff stolen.

104
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,964
I will say some bad things about that later.

105
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:34,934
That website seems like like one of those magic eight balls.

106
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,684
No, it's even worse than that.

107
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,515
Good. I'm glad.

108
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:39,385
All right.

109
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:40,315
Well, let, let start

110
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,214
beginning and just walk through the whole,

111
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:42,834
please.

112
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:43,334
Please

113
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:43,804
do.

114
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,040
So.

115
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:51,029
Equifax is, uh, basically it's a credit rating bureau like Transunion or Experian.

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,709
And what they basically do is they have data on you,

117
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,500
your name, your social security number, your date of birth where you live,

118
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,339
you know, previous addresses

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,660
so that they can basically identify you and

120
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,779
then they also have information on you financially.

121
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,019
So for example, you know,

122
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,589
any past due bills, any outstanding debts,

123
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,859
um, you know how many, you know, which bank accounts where you have them.

124
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:16,609
Um, for example, lines of credit credit cards,

125
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,429
essentially anything that's like a financial or a debt instrument,

126
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,010
there's a reasonably good chance that Transunion

127
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,549
Experian and Equifax know about it.

128
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,820
And the premise of this is,

129
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,880
uh, so Josh, you, you know, you bought a house, right?

130
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,350
-- Yes.
-- Did you have a bag full of money?

131
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,500
I did not. Unfortunately, the bank didn't.

132
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,510
Yes. Exactly.

133
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,829
And well, then, so the question becomes, how does the bank trust Josh?

134
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,429
Because, you know, this bank's never seen Josh before he just moved there.

135
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,309
Uh Actually I've been using the same bank for like 20 years.

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,260
So

137
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,119
try again.

138
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:53,959
-- But
-- anyway,

139
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,679
but anyway, so the premise is essentially is, you know,

140
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,350
how if I lend X amount of money for some purpose to this person and you know,

141
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,179
how likely am I to be paid back?

142
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,350
Uh, and is that chance high enough that I will lend them the money?

143
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,829
And also conversely, you know, maybe I should increase that rate or not to, to

144
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,690
deal with the risk. So basically these,

145
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,179
these credit rating bureaus

146
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,470
have obscene amounts of information on us.

147
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,989
And by definition, the data they have because of how we've architected society,

148
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,820
this is the data that you use to authenticate

149
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,929
yourself to all the companies you deal with,

150
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,089
either with existing

151
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,170
relationships or ones you want to have a new relationship with,

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
right? Because

153
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,570
you know, at some point, for example, you know, when at some point,

154
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,279
everybody is a first time home buyer, right?

155
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,160
By definition,

156
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,959
and by definition,

157
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,079
-- most of us don't actually have enough money to buy a home
-- even if you did, don't,

158
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:47,359
don't,

159
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,059
don't do that get a loan because it

160
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,079
has other benefits to your functioning in society.

161
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,720
So

162
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,959
and so, you know, the the question becomes, you know, how do we,

163
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,100
how do we deal with this? Especially how do we deal with this efficiently?

164
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:02,010
Now, the beauty is typically the system works quite well.

165
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,549
You know, you phone up your bank, you ask for a credit card and they can

166
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:09,100
within a few hours typically or days, make a decision about

167
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,309
how

168
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:09,549
much

169
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:09,750
credit

170
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:09,880
you

171
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,329
get.

172
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,369
Now, actually,

173
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,880
unless,

174
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:13,380
unless you're me

175
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,779
because I've locked on my credit years ago

176
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,950
-- and we'll get to that
-- later.

177
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,149
We will.

178
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,390
So,

179
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:26,309
you know, it, it the reality is I, I love this system in that it makes

180
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,420
efficient capitalism possible. You know,

181
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,380
I can go get a credit card and go buy a bunch of stuff.

182
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,529
I need that I can't pay for right now,

183
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,660
but, you know, I could probably pay for it later.

184
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:37,920
Um

185
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,899
That I think that's the wrong story.

186
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,910
With credit cards, the value in a credit card today? I see is

187
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,470
I order crap online.

188
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,600
It gets shipped to me if it's broken or wrong

189
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,980
and the seller I'm dealing with sucks.

190
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:54,660
I can just call a credit card company and say don't pay that dude and they won't.

191
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:55,959
-- Yeah,
-- that's definitely part of it.

192
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,040
So, and you know, fundamentally even now when you're applying for a job,

193
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,160
chances are they're checking your credit rating because

194
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,609
let's face it. Right.

195
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,549
The job market is such that when you put out a good job posting,

196
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:09,339
you're gonna probably get more than a few people applying for it.

197
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,359
And does a company really want to deal with somebody who has financial problems?

198
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
The answer is, sadly, no, you know,

199
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,269
they're going to discriminate against those people

200
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,390
because it's just one more hassle.

201
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,779
So anyway, so these, these ratings bureaus have all this information

202
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,700
-- and they sell access to it,
-- right.

203
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,420
We, we are the product, we should also clarify that. Right.

204
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,219
We're, we're not the customers here.

205
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,030
We are literally the product like we are the cattle in, in

206
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,859
this giant farm.

207
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,280
Yeah. And, and it's surprisingly not

208
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,558
well regulated.

209
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,989
I mean, there's,

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,229
there's some attempts at it like the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the US where

211
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,809
like you can basically write in and get a free credit

212
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,869
report once a year and you can supposedly challenge what's on it

213
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,289
and, you know, get it sorted out.

214
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,289
It does work. Ok. And thats

215
00:08:58,859 --> 00:08:59,380
it, it

216
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,630
because you've done it.

217
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:04,510
So I had the experience of I was a contractor

218
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,260
and the company I was working for was bought by

219
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:06,960
Verisign and

220
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,200
Verisign has a, just a policy that

221
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,119
they run a background check on all all new hires contractors. Everybody. Right.

222
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,070
Uh, through a company called choicepoint, that is

223
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,929
essentially the same thing as experience.

224
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,380
Trans union Equifax except Choice Point has even more data on you

225
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,909
because they buy

226
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,099
all sorts of data from all sorts of sources.

227
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,580
And so they basically do like a seven year background check,

228
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,099
kind of just looking for wonky stuff and

229
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:33,219
uh being a Canadian, I was kind of like, well, I'm not super cool with this but,

230
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:34,659
you know, I do like my paycheck.

231
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,390
So I'll agree to it obviously because like, what choice do I have? Right?

232
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,580
I don't have any power in this

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,059
uh transaction,

234
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:44,580
but I would ask that I get a copy of this so I can like,

235
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,919
look at it and make sure it's correct because I've, you know,

236
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:51,169
heard horror stories about, for example, this one town in Texas, the guy went and uh

237
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,549
accidentally got the death or sorry,

238
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,770
he accidentally got the birth registry when he meant to get the death registry.

239
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,239
And so he accidentally killed off an entire town in an afternoon.

240
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:01,690
Oh, man, that's exciting.

241
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,140
Yeah, it happens,

242
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,000
you know,

243
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,500
clerical

244
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,830
-- error.
-- What did you do today?

245
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,979
Um

246
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,880
So anyways I, I got the report back from Choice point and by and large it was correct.

247
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,580
It had all my credit cards and bank

248
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,880
accounts on it which as I understand, Canadian banking privacy laws is not

249
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,979
supposed to be in somebody else's hands.

250
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,140
And, but there was this magic weird $500 credit instrument

251
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,619
and it was linked to my main bank TD. So I went to TD and I'm like, what's this?

252
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,789
And like, we don't know, you have to ask them and I went to Choice point and I'm like,

253
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,130
what's this?

254
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,780
And like, we don't know, you have to talk to your bank,

255
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,599
of course you do.

256
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,059
So,

257
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,820
was never able to figure out what the heck that was.

258
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,619
Um, but yeah, so basically in this process, even, you know,

259
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,260
assuming like the Fair Credit Reporting Act works.

260
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,179
It's a lot of work

261
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,929
-- for a consumer. It is,
-- it's a pain in the neck and I'm familiar with that.

262
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,840
I've had to deal with some things before.

263
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:59,940
Actually when, when I bought my first house, like a million years ago and it,

264
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,659
it sucked getting it all cleaned up.

265
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,859
It took a long time.

266
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,549
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, anyway, this is so all we set the stage.

267
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,900
We kind of understand what the credit reporting bureau is

268
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,989
or, or these agencies. I don't, I don't even know what they're called.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,919
They, I'm sure they have,

270
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,440
-- they,
-- well, the three typically, yeah, they're like credit reporting.

271
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,750
Bureaus, but things like choice point are even more

272
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,530
kind of in a gray area in the,

273
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,390
give them time

274
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,049
to do

275
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,760
next.

276
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,390
So, anyway, let's talk about Equifax first because

277
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,510
they had that massive breach

278
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,390
and,

279
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,520
and, and the thing

280
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,520
-- and
-- 43 million records,

281
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,390
we know,

282
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,739
I, right. And that's exactly it. I, my suspicion is as this story develops,

283
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,059
-- we're going to learn all kinds of new and terrible things because,
-- well,

284
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,549
we've already learned that it might have affected people outside the US,

285
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,820
-- like in the UK and Canada,
-- I'm not surprised

286
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,289
-- by
-- that.

287
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,010
-- Or maybe it didn't, we're not sure yet. Right.
-- Right.

288
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,380
And they're never going to tell you,

289
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,809
look, let's face it.

290
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,080
Unless your government, like, somehow sues them, they're never going to tell you.

291
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,500
Right.

292
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,210
That's the reality of it because they're going to do.

293
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:07,049
It's, it's kind of one of those things where

294
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,750
when you think of risk and liability

295
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:10,750
shut up.

296
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,510
Well,

297
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,559
not yet.

298
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,669
That, that's the thing.

299
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,940
They don't know yet.

300
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:18,909
They're going to get sued, they know they're going to get sued.

301
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,849
And so they're going to say as little as possible because if they

302
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,760
say too much it's just going to get used against them in court,

303
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,479
which is actually sound advice.

304
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,340
Anyone who may or may not be

305
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,080
involved in

306
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,719
-- court
-- cases do not talk about anything.

307
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:37,950
It doesn't matter how funny that Joe was on Twitter. Shut up. Right.

308
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,710
And these guys know that because

309
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,909
given everything we've seen, I'm pretty sure lawyers are in charge.

310
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,159
Well, and that, well, yeah,

311
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:48,309
that goes to part of what they've been trying to do to handle the situation,

312
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,630
how poorly it's been handled.

313
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,140
Oh, my goodness. It's like

314
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,859
you couldn't write comedic gold like this if you wanted to.

315
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,710
I mean, that's the

316
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,210
leave you because it's obviously so horribly poorly written

317
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,650
and

318
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,369
you know,

319
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,229
what else is crazy I think about is with like

320
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,289
all these hurricanes going on at the same time.

321
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,039
Plus just like general events throughout the world,

322
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:13,330
it feels like everything is literally on fire and it kind of is in some places,

323
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,130
imagine what kind of news and crazy would be coming out of this.

324
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,140
If this was the only major story in the news right now,

325
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,400
it would be horrifying, I bet. So. So and that's something else to think about is

326
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,849
this news cycle is overwhelming

327
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:32,760
and this story is still enormous just to give you an idea of the magnitude of it.

328
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,599
Like there's going to be less cities in Florida tomorrow than there are today.

329
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,299
And we're talking about

330
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,400
Equifax stealing, you know, someone hacking them and stealing information.

331
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,679
That's crazy, man. That is crazy that this story is even on the list.

332
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,119
So basically Equifax gets hacked, they sit on it for a while.

333
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,429
Uh we'll get into the stock trading stuff later because

334
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,979
there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there.

335
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:57,299
That's a whole separate

336
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,099
conversation.

337
00:13:58,229 --> 00:13:58,690
Like I said,

338
00:13:58,859 --> 00:13:59,919
you can't write this.

339
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,469
Yeah.

340
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:05,359
-- So they hired APR firm, the name of which dang it, I lost the link. It
-- doesn't matter.

341
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,200
Apr firm. Right. We don't want everyone to hate us by the time we're done.

342
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,400
And they registered a domain called

343
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:13,690
-- Equifax Security 2000 seventy.com.
-- Right? And it's nice.

344
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,789
-- They thought ahead because then in 2018 they can just have a new domain,
-- right? So

345
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,429
at

346
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,880
first the domain was registered, it wasn't uh SSL or TLS encrypted.

347
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,169
And the website,

348
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,530
the idea is that you plug in your name and part of your social security number,

349
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:28,260
if you're American

350
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,609
and it tells you if you, if you have been affected or not, now,

351
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,150
they forgot to disable. Uh Well, the, the, the site runs on wordpress

352
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,700
which not the greatest security record, but whatever, we'll,

353
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,119
we'll just ignore that for sure.

354
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,200
Um But the cute thing is wordpress by default has

355
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,349
a rest API so you can interact with it programmatically

356
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,169
and they didn't disable that. API

357
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:51,919
And so one of the calls you can make to it publicly

358
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,020
by default is get a list of valid users on the website,

359
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,280
like the accounts created

360
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,570
and there was one account created and it's the name of the pr firm that they've hired.

361
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,090
Not, not a surprise.

362
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,229
Uh So anyways,

363
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,780
the idea being that you plug your name and social security number into

364
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,789
this thing and you get like a part of your social security number rather

365
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,169
and you get whether or not you're affected,

366
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,090
turns out it doesn't matter what you plug in, you get the same result

367
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:18,010
and so effectively what it looks like is it's kind of a placeholder website just to,

368
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,489
you know, harvest the data so that they can later deal with it.

369
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:21,299
So I

370
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,130
can't actually, right now,

371
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,530
they can't right now tell you if you've been affected or not.

372
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:30,159
-- So,
-- my suspicion is they don't really know. But I also had some people tell me that

373
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:33,770
they typed in things we say

374
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:34,530
and

375
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,690
not necessarily

376
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,520
some people

377
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,530
-- I think
-- they were sending, I think they were using legitimate information

378
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,570
and

379
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,159
one guy said he was listed as not affected

380
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,929
and his wife was listed as probably affected.

381
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,109
Oh. Right.

382
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,239
-- So that's really interesting to me
-- because I was reading on crib

383
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,979
security that they were just typing in some random verbs and getting back

384
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,280
essentially hang on and find out in a

385
00:15:59,409 --> 00:15:59,440
few

386
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:03,090
-- days.
-- The only thing I could potentially think of here

387
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,130
is if they were using some sort of very crappy hash

388
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,119
where they take like your name and your number and

389
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,330
-- they hash it and they're checking a database of
-- just,

390
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,359
-- they just have the raw data.
-- But I would hope that

391
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,090
the

392
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:18,049
pr company doesn't have all of the raw data.

393
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:18,809
Right.

394
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,219
Well,

395
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,049
anyway, the point is this website is a joke, right?

396
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:29,219
Let's just fix this website is a joke and it, did you read it?

397
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:32,409
Apparently the verbiage you waived your rights to a class action.

398
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,210
So they had their default terms of

399
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,940
stuff.

400
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,049
And the premise is that when you sign up for their credit monitoring, whatever

401
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:39,929
thing

402
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,559
you basically waive any right to sue them or do a class action lawsuit.

403
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,099
Now, they specifically made a statement

404
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,510
specifically saying that they are disclaiming that and that it doesn't apply blah,

405
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,059
blah blah

406
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,969
because, you know, part of it is the legality of that in and of itself is a whole thing.

407
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,090
Like I'm personally quite annoyed that, like, you know,

408
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,450
end user license agreements are a thing where it's like,

409
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:01,549
basically by opening the software package, you, you can't even sue us, right?

410
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,520
You can't even take us to court.

411
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,608
You have to go through arbitration and like a jurisdiction of our choosing.

412
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,638
Um, you know, we're not even asking you to give up rights.

413
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,729
We're just basically asking you to give up any and

414
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,979
all legal recourse ha ha sucks to be you.

415
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,729
Um,

416
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,530
so, yeah,

417
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,079
ignoring that for the moment because they

418
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,530
supposedly fixed that and they're not disclaiming it

419
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,848
or they're not making you disclaim that. Right.

420
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,300
Assuming that that's even a legal thing to do.

421
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,608
Apparently that's becoming a bit of a political hot potato.

422
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:32,099
Um, so we've established they were hacked. It's really bad.

423
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:33,790
Their response so far has been terrible.

424
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,510
They apparently hired, uh, what we call Mandiant security.

425
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,189
To do the audit. And the

426
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:41,750
because to put it bluntly,

427
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,369
it doesn't appear like they have the expertise to look through their own entire

428
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:44,560
system to

429
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,250
find

430
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:45,500
out.

431
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,949
I feel like I read somewhere that,

432
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,500
that Fire Eye was actually the security company

433
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,510
working with them and then Fire Eye hired.

434
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:52,849
Oh,

435
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,550
fire eye own man.

436
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,939
Yes, that's my understanding. Ok.

437
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,380
That could be uh well,

438
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,979
in regardless the point is for those of you who

439
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:02,959
don't know Mandy is the guys you bring in like

440
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,630
they are, they are the last recourse, right? Like this is the super ninja

441
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,630
you bring in when things are so bad. You don't know, like the A team, I guess, right?

442
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,150
They are the a team

443
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,030
of kind of doing intrusion detection and, and just figuring out what it went wrong,

444
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,439
um, which to put A B

445
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,189
does it really matter?

446
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,229
Like the

447
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,390
horse is gone, the barn door is wide open.

448
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,989
Their systems are probably architected in such a way that you can't really fix it.

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,199
You'd have to like burn it down and start fresh to really get something secure.

450
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:32,689
-- Well,
-- ok,

451
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,890
it's more than that though.

452
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,439
I mean, part of it is just, I mean,

453
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:39,119
I've been through these kind of forensics efforts in the past and

454
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,280
a big part of it is just understanding like what happened

455
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,550
and, and not even necessarily so you don't do it again.

456
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,180
-- It's just
-- so you, so apparently the hack was actually quite simple

457
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,780
in this case. That's, that's the really ugly part. Right.

458
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,020
Like, there's, you know, I, if you have like a mission impossible style hack,

459
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,839
I'm like, yeah, cool.

460
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,910
That's really hard to defend against.

461
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,719
It's impossible

462
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:58,920
to

463
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,239
defend

464
00:18:59,410 --> 00:18:59,890
against.

465
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,479
Yeah.

466
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,770
You know,

467
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,489
if you have an adversary with like a budget

468
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,650
of $10 million who's willing to kidnap people,

469
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,479
-- you lose.
-- Right.

470
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,199
And what was, what was this one? Supposedly?

471
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,530
Although it's not been really confirmed, but apparently

472
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,890
-- a flaw Apache straw.
-- That's what I heard. I'm

473
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,270
skeptical, I don't know.

474
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,859
-- It's,
-- you know, the,

475
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,250
the Apache software foundation actually released a really nice

476
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,660
uh statement.

477
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,290
That statement is ridiculous.

478
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,489
It

479
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,569
-- is,
-- but it points out that essentially either it's a zero day in which case, like,

480
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:29,109
sorry.

481
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,089
Um, because there is some speculation that it's a CV.

482
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,140
E I forget the name of the CV, offhand. Uh, hang on a second.

483
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,770
-- Ok. No. Well, you're searching this, here's
-- what I

484
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,369
had messed it up and said that the CV was like nine years old or something. It was,

485
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,310
it's been a bunch of different things. Here's the, here's what I think of with this.

486
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,160
All right. Number one,

487
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:49,810
I don't think struts should have had any comment on

488
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,359
this in any way because we don't really know.

489
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:55,290
And even if it was struts, like how many,

490
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,420
how many organizations have been hacked because of struts.

491
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,979
I mean, let's face it. Struts doesn't have a very good track record here. Right.

492
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,640
Because it's a Behemoth monster.

493
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,689
And, and more importantly,

494
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,609
I think the most important thing in that Struts

495
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,750
statement though is the fact that at the bottom,

496
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,390
the person who signed it

497
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,630
is the vice president of Struts.

498
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,780
Why does a project need a vice president?

499
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,069
Like, that's not a project anyone should be using?

500
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,890
That's something that needs to be dismantled.

501
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,170
Well, it's, it's one of those,

502
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,199
I think Apache struck is sort of the modern equivalent of Cobalt.

503
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,819
Really.

504
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,209
Think

505
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,239
about it, right. It's a giant

506
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,900
Java monstrosity.

507
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,030
Oh, man, you're, you're absolutely, you're,

508
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,760
-- you're completely correct when you say that
-- it's, and, and the thing is though, like

509
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,449
coal, it,

510
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,819
it does let businesses build things that get stuff done,

511
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,849
I guess, you know, as ugly as it is, right?

512
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:41,859
Um

513
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,099
But going back to it,

514
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,979
I think they are actually kind of correct to make the statement

515
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:48,579
because the reality is even if struts was 100% at fault,

516
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,150
this shouldn't happen because,

517
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,550
and this is a question I have for you that I wanted to ask because

518
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,209
uh it kind of reminds me of that whole,

519
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,959
I think it was Lockheed Martin where somebody like ex filtrated like

520
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:01,560
10 terabytes of design data on some plane or something to China.

521
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,569
And Lockheed Martin was like, oops.

522
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:06,359
And here's the thing, 100 and 43 million records.

523
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,390
Like I get that high speed networking is a thing now, like 10 gigabit interconnect,

524
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
40 gigabit whatever,

525
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,900
but 100 and 43 million records

526
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:19,660
in a database. Even if they're small is still a lot of data.

527
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:19,979
They

528
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,719
weren't small.

529
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,430
Yeah. No, I would, I'm guessing tens of kilobytes each

530
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,170
and more to the point, the database activity.

531
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,439
It's like somebody's just like what, you know, where name equals like star

532
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:33,400
download.

533
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,010
Um You know, how is this

534
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,280
number one? How is the activity on the database? Not notice that? Like,

535
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,880
somebody was like,

536
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,680
accessing everything and number two,

537
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,560
they ex filtrated the data successfully

538
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,430
without like, it's not like Equifax said, like,

539
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,199
oh, they got like X million records but we cut them off.

540
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,359
Thank goodness, you know, because that, that has happened before where, you know,

541
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:55,719
companies have been like, oh yeah, they,

542
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:57,439
they started downloading stuff but we killed it.

543
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:57,530
It's

544
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,079
pretty

545
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:58,420
bad,

546
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:58,790
but it's

547
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,290
pretty rare.

548
00:21:59,390 --> 00:21:59,930
Exactly.

549
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,760
And my question is, why is that rare?

550
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,660
Like, I've,

551
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,750
I've heard of strategies like putting in dummy records that trigger your I DS,

552
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:09,430
-- you know, records that should never be pulled.
-- I bet they

553
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:09,869
don't have,

554
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,089
I mean, look, if you have an I DS at all, you should notice this kind of activity.

555
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,650
I mean, that's the reality of it. So,

556
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,739
so you can probably infer they almost certainly don't have an idea if they do.

557
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,369
It doesn't work well,

558
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,270
you know, sending out alerts that are being,

559
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,040
that could be true. I see that a lot. That's actually that's something I,

560
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,199
I,

561
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:33,420
I've seen more than once is people spend all this money on an expensive

562
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,489
I DS and then they don't look at what it's what it's telling them.

563
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:37,979
And so why did you, I mean,

564
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:40,880
you might as well just cash that check and go on a vacation.

565
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,359
Well, but especially with false positives and stuff, you can't,

566
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,829
you can't, well,

567
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,920
if you do it right, you can, most people don't do it right.

568
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,560
There's, there's so many levels of failure that had to happen here.

569
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:53,689
I mean, for example,

570
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,420
the fact that someone could do this tells me

571
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,339
that the data was probably just sitting somewhere,

572
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,550
right? For almost certainly in a database

573
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,989
with no real protections on it.

574
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,369
I mean, look,

575
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,310
let's face it the right way to do this is to have some sort of system architected

576
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,949
that you can retrieve one record,

577
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,630
right?

578
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,829
Someone types in all that personal information they need or,

579
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,810
or what whoever is gonna make a request

580
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,829
and you can get back one record and that's it.

581
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,979
There's no way to get anything else back. And if the system can be broken,

582
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,290
you,

583
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,160
you no doubt have business cases where it's like we want all

584
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,189
the John Smith in Nevada who like have a good credit rating

585
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,270
or, you know,

586
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,630
because the thing to remember is they're not

587
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,069
just selling the stuff for like credit checks.

588
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,869
It's also for like advertising,

589
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,140
like we want a list of everybody who can probably afford a Rolex watch in America.

590
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,010
And, and, and

591
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:39,959
this would be a data

592
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,900
-- to do that.
-- I suspect

593
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,949
what you've just described is exactly what it is where someone

594
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:48,540
figured out a way to send a query that returned everybody.

595
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,469
But again, you could have it

596
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:51,339
obfuscate replies or

597
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,589
no, no, for example,

598
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,290
with the more data you get out sort of the

599
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,189
more coarse grained and fine or less fine it becomes,

600
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,339
-- I
-- will bet you, I bet you a coke

601
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,380
that

602
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,819
somebody ran this query at least once a week on the database on accident

603
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,300
and returned every single human in their data set.

604
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:08,880
Right?

605
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,420
I guarantee it wouldn't surprise me either if this was actually

606
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,359
stolen from a third party and not directly from Equifax itself.

607
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,630
That's entirely

608
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,800
-- possible.
-- It would not surprise me at all if that

609
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:20,760
data

610
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,579
and not, not only like to share data, people never get rid of their data, right?

611
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,920
People think data is magic and they,

612
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:31,015
you have all this super dangerous data and what do you do with it?

613
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:32,145
Right? Like, oh, we better

614
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:32,454
keep

615
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:32,655
it

616
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:33,594
-- to
-- store.

617
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:34,635
It's not.

618
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,714
-- Ok.
-- No, no, I'm stopping you right there. Look data.

619
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:41,415
It is, it is cheap to store crap on disk.

620
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:42,584
But pi

621
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:50,714
I is an enormous liability and having the pi I on 100 and 44 million people is crazy.

622
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:57,010
-- The risk there is enormous
-- storing data correctly and securely is expensive.

623
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,489
But storing it badly and cheaply is

624
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:01,219
cheap.

625
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,930
I love,

626
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:05,670
like I just set up some new S3 buckets for a thing and I was going through the

627
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,969
deletion policy and it's like now you can delete

628
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,890
and send it to the cornfield out in Glacier.

629
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,030
Right? Glacier is Amazon's

630
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,189
long term storage thing. And

631
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,930
I seem to remember reading that they like burn stuff onto optical disc

632
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,819
or onto hard drives that they then take off line or something crazy.

633
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,959
I've heard a lot of rumors and the current rumor I've

634
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:27,369
heard is that they basically have enormous banks of hard drives

635
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,319
and they,

636
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,869
they, they fill them up and when a drive is full, they just turn the power off

637
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,040
and then when they need it, they'll eventually,

638
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,219
every now and then power gets restored and then stuff happens.

639
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,880
That's, that's my current understanding.

640
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:43,739
I mean, that's the, that's the problem though, right? Is, is until you have

641
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,000
best case scenario you have an auditor come through, who's like, oh,

642
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,619
you can't be doing that, you need to stop doing that and then you stop doing.

643
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:51,449
Here's the better question.

644
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,550
Were they violating any rules?

645
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,359
Let's say you were someone working with, with these guys with Equifax.

646
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:00,280
Let's say you accidentally downloaded everyone's record.

647
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,140
Were you violating any sort of rules

648
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,150
tribulation,

649
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,650
violation of any law?

650
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,079
-- Because if you're authorized to do so you're,
-- I bet

651
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:09,369
they weren't authorized to do so.

652
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,260
And so that begs the,

653
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,439
are there even laws for that for banking data. Like I know with banking data,

654
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:15,359
you,

655
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:19,520
-- you have to kind of have a good reason for looking at it typically internally
-- there,

656
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,839
there are certain regulations that exist but they are not.

657
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:25,319
Yes, it's,

658
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,439
and the problem is, here's the problem I have fundamentally,

659
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,109
this is an American company in American jurisdiction

660
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,660
with data on people outside America.

661
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,390
And so it becomes like the border crossing problem of I try to

662
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,189
go into the US and I have a problem with the border crossing.

663
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,209
What's my recourse like? Right to my Congress.

664
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,640
Actually GDPR is going to fix some of this in,

665
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,910
in the EU because GDPR applies to EU citizens regardless of jurisdiction.

666
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:53,680
But does the eu have the wherewithal to enforce it?

667
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,760
Well, ok,

668
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,729
that is going to be the question.

669
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:57,439
However,

670
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,989
most of these companies have some sort of presence in the EU which means yes, yes,

671
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,560
they do.

672
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:03,219
Right.

673
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,530
Well, because I know like for example,

674
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,239
there's that US banking law that says basically to, you know,

675
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,959
for dealing with tax evasion

676
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,619
that if you have even a single American customer at your bank,

677
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,000
you have to report

678
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,500
like their accounts and stuff to the US

679
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,800
authorities. And so

680
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,319
in Canada that, that is a direct violation of our banking laws

681
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:23,719
or was

682
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,150
and the US response was, well, that's too bad.

683
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,839
We can cut you off and of course, we, we can't, that's like 30% of our, you know,

684
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,400
fiscal interactions and trade and whatnot.

685
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,040
So we had to roll over.

686
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,040
Right.

687
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,380
And apparently a lot of banks now in a lot of parts of the world

688
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,489
where if you're an American and you go to do something with your account,

689
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,319
they're like, oh, you're American yet your account's closed.

690
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,119
Here's your cash.

691
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:48,959
Right.

692
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,930
Because, well, no, I mean, you know, think about it,

693
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,390
you're like some regional bank or something.

694
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,280
Do you want to have to deal with us? Authorities?

695
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,640
I would not.

696
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:58,969
Right. I can't even imagine what the reporting costs on this are.

697
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,920
It's,

698
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:01,680
you know,

699
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:07,079
but the thing is the US has the financial clout to like make rules that we don't like,

700
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:07,430
but

701
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,680
like 80% of Canada's foreign trade is with the US. So like, quite frankly,

702
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,000
we, we, we can't, you know, we can't

703
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:17,449
be like, oh, embargo, we just don't

704
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,920
talk to you. And

705
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,670
this is actually what's I think going to give GDPR teeth is the eu as a whole

706
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,839
is big enough to have an impact here.

707
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:29,060
Whereas every individual European country people could be like, yeah,

708
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:29,969
screw you guys.

709
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:30,979
-- I don't care.
-- Right.

710
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,869
Is Luxembourg even a real country,

711
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,680
please send the hate mail.

712
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,050
Not me. I love Luxembourg. It's a very nice place actually, I've never been there.

713
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,239
-- I would like to go though. Good
-- French

714
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,619
fries.

715
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,380
Yeah,

716
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,290
sweet.

717
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:45,810
Ok.

718
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, Lichtenstein, for example,

719
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,670
a friend drove me around the country one Saturday morning.

720
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,050
-- Like all
-- around the

721
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,829
country.

722
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,380
Well, technically not around it.

723
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,810
We drove from the northernmost point to the southernmost point and

724
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,109
I think we did the easternmost point or the westernmost point.

725
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,589
I forget what.

726
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,959
And in Europe it's tiny.

727
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:05,420
It's not like an enormous country like Canada or the United States,

728
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,199
which are just freakishly large.

729
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,689
-- So, anyway, so, ok,
-- so we've gone through 100 and 43 million people,

730
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:15,089
possibly all American. maybe not,

731
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,699
certainly not Americans in there without question.

732
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,060
Oh, for sure. But I mean,

733
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:22,500
like, is it more than a percent or whatever,

734
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:25,645
what else is actually an interesting question?

735
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:27,974
I wonder how many of the people in there are Children or

736
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:32,055
dead where they don't really have the ability to gain credit.

737
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:39,604
The dead thing is still a problem because those records can sort of still work

738
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:41,810
and the child thing is definitely a problem because, you know,

739
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,489
parents open up lines of credit or

740
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,060
I've heard

741
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,050
in

742
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:46,300
their

743
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:50,869
names all the time, which is especially annoying because, like,

744
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,130
you think they would check the date of birth on these people and be like, oh,

745
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,160
you're like three.

746
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,849
Actually, I had something happen once where

747
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,050
I,

748
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,729
my, my kids have email addresses. Right. And I, I get them, but I sign crap up for them

749
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,530
and

750
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:06,849
one day I get a mail from,

751
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:10,880
uh, a bank that I have a savings account with, for my kids

752
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,390
and it basically, it is clearly some sort of like crazy fishy spam thing

753
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,150
and I send it to the bank and they're like, oh yeah, we,

754
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,770
you know, this is probably real so that you're so,

755
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,520
and so must have signed up for this and I'm like, this is my kid.

756
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:28,160
They said, oh well, well, they must have signed up for it.

757
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,300
I said he's six like, ok, we'll take care of it right away, sir.

758
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,780
Yeah,

759
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,500
I mean, come on guys get with it.

760
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,989
But well, and see that's part of this whole thing is like, even if I,

761
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,979
I don't know what the true levels of financial fraud and credit card fraud are,

762
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,680
especially with respect to their cost.

763
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,099
But the reality is

764
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,060
what systems like credit cards.

765
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:53,109
So like without credit cards, we wouldn't have online shopping and like Amazon,

766
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:53,229
I,

767
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:57,839
I now get about one or two Amazon packages a week because I've just,

768
00:30:57,869 --> 00:30:59,180
I've gone to Amazon first.

769
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,099
That's it. I'm done.

770
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,660
I buy this stuff like when I'm in the car with my kids

771
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,420
on the phone and then it shows up the next like the day,

772
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,300
the next day, which is like a Sunday.

773
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,729
I'm sorry, I want to support local businesses, but like

774
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,550
this is just too easy and too cheap and then other things like a great example, right?

775
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,459
Um You know,

776
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,790
going through the house buying process and we have a one week

777
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,500
overlap where we give up possession of this house on the 25th,

778
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,430
but we take possession of the new house on the 18th.

779
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,109
I certainly don't have enough money to cover like

780
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,109
the complete cost of a house for one week.

781
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,589
You know.

782
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,150
And so with bridge financing and stuff, boof, the problem goes away.

783
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,989
You know, the bank and the lawyers do a bunch of stuff and it's like,

784
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,040
I don't know exactly what happened, but like, I have a week to move now.

785
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,489
It's pretty sweet. You know,

786
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,979
the guy that bought this house stomped through

787
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,650
this house two hours after it was listed,

788
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,430
looked grumpy.

789
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,520
And then, you know,

790
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,410
we get a phone call an hour and a half later from our reels were saying like, so yeah,

791
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,319
he's putting an offer on this place does like leaving on the 25th work for you.

792
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,099
And I'm like, I guess it does,

793
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:57,930
you know,

794
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,670
like my, my partner literally, I was like at lunchtime like, yeah,

795
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,060
so we're listening to the house and then when she got home from work, it's like, uh,

796
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:05,650
so good news and bad news,

797
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,810
you know, good news is we don't have to work,

798
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:09,890
we don't have to clean up the place or worry about showing it.

799
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,119
Bad news is you have to like pack all your crap up in the next

800
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,520
-- couple weeks.
-- Go.

801
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,589
I know. I know.

802
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,069
So, I mean, to enable like when I, when I, because I've looked at like,

803
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,839
what buying a house involves in many countries

804
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,849
and it involves saving up all the money.

805
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,329
-- Yeah.
-- There's places have to basically pay for it. It's crazy.

806
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:26,650
Yeah.

807
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,229
Well,

808
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,939
or there's places like the Philippines where they

809
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,890
just don't have that strong identity slash credit

810
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,540
system.

811
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,079
And so, even with, you know, a modernizing economy,

812
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,979
-- it's just, you can't take that risk.
-- All right. So we're in the weeds

813
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:41,479
anyways.

814
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:44,199
The point is as terrible as this Equifax breaches and as

815
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:48,040
terrible as these companies are what they enable is amazing.

816
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,170
Yes. And that's part of the problem.

817
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,780
There's a whole bunch of people saying, oh, we need to like,

818
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,410
shut down Equifax or break them up.

819
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,510
I

820
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,719
don't know how that's going to work.

821
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,170
And the reality is a, that would actually make things much worse

822
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,729
on so many levels. And b it, it just financially can't happen.

823
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,680
-- I literally can't like Visa and Amex would be like,
-- nope.

824
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,819
Well, here's ok. So here's the better question. Ok.

825
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:12,780
We're going to ignore regulation and laws and everything around what

826
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,410
they did or didn't do or should or shouldn't have done.

827
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:15,890
Ok.

828
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,520
I think the real question is the fact

829
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,640
that the identification universe in the United States

830
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,989
is broken

831
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,150
the

832
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,280
-- world
-- too. And

833
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,839
-- maybe, I don't know what the rest of the world is like. I can only speak to the
-- US.

834
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,050
It's the

835
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:30,839
same in Canada,

836
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:31,839
but fundamentally

837
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,560
-- most of western Europe.
-- I, I, I'm sure it is.

838
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:37,819
I don't have a doubt but the point being like, so in the US,

839
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:39,930
you get a social security number when you're born and

840
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:42,560
that essentially just has become your national ID number,

841
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:42,959
right?

842
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,359
I mean, that's what it is. And anytime you do anything

843
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,339
that's what gets used

844
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,540
and we basically reached a point where if,

845
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,050
if someone's social security number leaks

846
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:57,270
-- you can cause immense damage to their personal.
-- The

847
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:57,599
real

848
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:58,260
problem is

849
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,739
how do we authenticate somebody? Well, we need some sort of

850
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,219
either something that they can only

851
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:07,280
themselves do.

852
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,739
Like essentially like if you had a cryptographic chip implanted in

853
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,409
your brain at birth and only you had that secret key.

854
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,478
Cool.

855
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,870
Um Unfortunately, we're not there yet.

856
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,458
I, I hope one day that we are because I think that'd be awesome.

857
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:20,478
But here's the problem, right?

858
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:23,280
How do you authenticate somebody without using a secret?

859
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,820
The

860
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,030
only

861
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:25,219
thing

862
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,290
is secret biometrics.

863
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,320
Well, no, no, no, we, we do have biometrics. So in theory, you know, this is like crazy

864
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:34,179
talk but

865
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,949
no, no, no, they don't have to be because if we have a strong

866
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:42,280
system for actually testing your biometrics that can't be easily subverted.

867
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,100
So for example,

868
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,120
um

869
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,050
I, you come into the bank for a mortgage and I prick your thumb and make you

870
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,949
uh not only sign the contract but put a little blood sample into a thing

871
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,520
and then I, I,

872
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,708
you know, sequence that DNA in real time, which we're basically there, right?

873
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,050
You can actually sequence an entire human genome now

874
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,550
in tens of minutes.

875
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,090
Right. The technology is actually out there, it's just kind of pricey.

876
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,620
And so, you know, without like, for example,

877
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:09,219
if you've ever seen the movie Gattica with the fake blood in the vein thing,

878
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:13,159
it would be very hard to fake that out. Now people do fake urine test

879
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,580
all sorts of

880
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,100
stuff. But

881
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:15,590
the

882
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,169
problem is biometrics is going back to biometrics.

883
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,909
They're way too expensive right now. And

884
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:23,989
the biometrics that kind of are affordable and work.

885
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,239
There's like a lot of people who don't have eyes or a face or arms and stuff.

886
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,080
Like there's enough people that, that would be like that poor guy.

887
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,780
There was a guy that went into a bank and they, like,

888
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,969
we need a fingerprint and he's like, I got no arms

889
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,389
and they're like, well, you're gonna have to go somewhere else and he's like,

890
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,550
seriously, like, I'm pretty sure like

891
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
some legality covers

892
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,429
that to get resolved. I heard about that. But, ok, so here's the first thing

893
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,800
that, that springs into my mind when you talk about

894
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,030
sequencing your DNA on site

895
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,159
is

896
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:59,379
why not just check to see if I have high risk for cancer and don't give me a loan if I do.

897
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,179
Right.

898
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,439
Oh, yeah. See that's the problem. That would be the other

899
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,060
half of that problem. Right?

900
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:04,850
Is the private,

901
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,659
-- there's some minor privacy concerns with sequencing everybody's
-- DNA.

902
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,070
And, and so here's, here's the real issue. Ok. Here's, here's the thing.

903
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:14,860
So I,

904
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:21,060
I think by talking about DNA or chips and brains or national ID cards or whatever,

905
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,750
you cloud the issue

906
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,290
because those are things that have their own set of problems.

907
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,010
Ok.

908
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,879
Well, fundamentally what happens is how, so assuming we have all these regimes,

909
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,070
like, let's say, for the sake of argument,

910
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,620
we have like an estonian national ID card with a crypto chip in it.

911
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,100
It's super secure, blah, blah, blah.

912
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,780
What happens when somebody loses them? Or somebody gets mugged and rolled

913
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,250
and they literally wander into a police station

914
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,090
with a concussion and like empty pockets.

915
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,560
-- Who cares,
-- just disable the old car and give them a new one?

916
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:47,709
No,

917
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,149
no, no. What I'm saying is how do we prove that that person is who they say they are?

918
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,530
Uh

919
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:57,530
Well, I would expect if you're, you, you can acquire other pieces of documentation.

920
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,979
I mean, like,

921
00:36:58,469 --> 00:36:59,699
-- so
-- a
-- good example,

922
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
homeless with schizophrenia

923
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,689
-- and
-- look, I'm not gonna, I'm not saying this kind of stuff works for everybody,

924
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:06,100
right?

925
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,620
There's,

926
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,689
there's without doubt problems

927
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,250
and when you run into someone like say a homeless person with schizophrenia,

928
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,530
you have to have a system that is able to deal with one offs in one off manners, right?

929
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,330
So I know locally we don't have that. What we actually have.

930
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,800
For example, is the Boyle Street.

931
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,340
It's a charitable organization that runs a shelter

932
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,500
will for example, photograph you and basically sign an affidavit saying that,

933
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,199
you know, you are claiming to be this person and here's, it's not photo ID,

934
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:37,489
but it's like a picture of you with

935
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,820
the signed affidavit from the Boyle Street organization.

936
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,850
And people essentially that's quite often the best thing they can get.

937
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,979
They can, here's the problem.

938
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,260
You can't get a driver's license unless you take a driving test.

939
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,080
So, ok, you can get a Canadian identification card

940
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:55,169
but you need like your birth certificate or your passport

941
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,780
or your something else to prove it and get it.

942
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,419
Well, ok,

943
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,500
ignoring all that.

944
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,419
How do you get a birth certificate if you've like lost everything? Well,

945
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,409
ok, easy. If you have a lawyer,

946
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,919
right, there's paperwork and stuff to do that.

947
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,689
Actually,

948
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:08,689
if

949
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:08,879
you,

950
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,375
you can't afford a lawyer or something, you're

951
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:14,324
-- right the creek. And
-- so you're completely correct

952
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,405
-- in everything
-- you say.

953
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,705
He ignores all the people that sell their passports and ID cards.

954
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:19,844
But here's the thing is your,

955
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:22,945
this is where security fails on a consistent basis

956
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:26,004
as we obsess over the like five or 10%.

957
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,209
And

958
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:29,530
when in reality,

959
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,620
there are ways of dealing with those situations,

960
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,699
but the other 90% everything is going to be just

961
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,969
fine for and it's going to work just great.

962
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:41,770
But instead of worrying about 90% we obsess over 10%.

963
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,449
Well, but for me, here's the thing would,

964
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,209
would actually spending money to fix this

965
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,570
problem actually make this problem better.

966
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,300
Would it outweigh the cost, would there be,

967
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,010
would there be a return on investment?

968
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,729
There's, there's two parts to this and this is where we're,

969
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,649
we're down the wrong path here.

970
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,649
We're not having the right conversation, right?

971
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,580
This isn't about spending money to fix a problem necessarily.

972
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,860
What this is about is the fact that

973
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,110
we have an identification system in the United

974
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,459
States based upon a single nine digit number,

975
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:12,110
everyone has one

976
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:14,290
and they're basically not secret, right?

977
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,179
My, my social security number, Kurt has been stolen so many times.

978
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,899
I I'm sad I didn't keep them,

979
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,719
but I would have a stack of letters informing me my social security number

980
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:29,820
may have been stolen due to some event from a number of organizations.

981
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,110
And I've reached a point like,

982
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:34,100
you know what my social security number is no longer secret.

983
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,139
So what I did is I locked my credit

984
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,820
in that pin number, which is only sort of secure.

985
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:39,300
Uh

986
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,449
but that pin number is now essentially my secret identifier

987
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,979
and that is safe.

988
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,780
I don't fully understand the locking the credit thing.

989
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,459
But my understanding of it is is that

990
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,979
nobody can open new like debt instruments until

991
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:56,010
you kind of give that pin or whatever.

992
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,639
So what happens is it's, it's sort of complicated actually,

993
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,969
I just talked to my sister about this uh yesterday because she's like,

994
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,090
what do I do? You know everything's crazy. I said just lack, lack your credit.

995
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,399
There's nothing else you can't do, lack your credit and forget about it.

996
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,100
But then she also was like, uh, do I have to lock my credit with Equifax?

997
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,649
And I said hilariously, yes. Yes, you do.

998
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:17,560
But anyway, anyway,

999
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:21,449
so what happens is you, you basically apply to the credit agencies,

1000
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,850
you lock your credit and then they mail you

1001
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,290
these letters.

1002
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,429
Well, I don't know if they, I don't know, I locked it way back when you first could.

1003
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:31,320
I don't know if they still mail you paper copies, but they did back then

1004
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,449
on purpose

1005
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,090
and essentially the paper copy has a pin number.

1006
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:38,120
And what you do then is, let's say I want to

1007
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,120
uh get a loan or I forget why did I, I had,

1008
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:43,899
I had to unlock my credit for a really crazy reason.

1009
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:43,949
At,

1010
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,510
at some point I don't remember what it even

1011
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,149
was but like somebody needed to pull my credit

1012
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,510
and at first they did nothing

1013
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,959
-- and then I let them
-- pull

1014
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,830
to pull your credit report.

1015
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,419
Yes, for a hard

1016
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,939
pull, soft pulls, I guess, are still

1017
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:57,320
possible.

1018
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,360
So anyway,

1019
00:40:58,469 --> 00:40:59,219
-- anyway,
-- so,

1020
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,030
but they could still open a credit card in your name. Whether

1021
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,659
it would,

1022
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:04,949
-- it would depend on
-- whether or not they do a poll

1023
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:05,409
I'm getting there.

1024
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,399
So here's the deal.

1025
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,469
Let's say I want a credit card. Ok, I'll use that as my example.

1026
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,580
Go to my bank say I want a credit card.

1027
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,350
They're gonna say obviously we need to pull your credit.

1028
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,699
And so what I do is there's two things I can do.

1029
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:20,070
I can either tell the credit agencies I want you to lift my credit like from this,

1030
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,770
starting this day, ending this day.

1031
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,719
And that's what I usually do because I've yet to find a bank that can do the other way,

1032
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:30,030
which is, you can also tell the credit agencies I want you to give me a special pin

1033
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:31,879
for pulling my credit.

1034
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,919
And I also tell them who's going to pull it.

1035
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:37,790
So I could say like, you know,

1036
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:41,320
this blah, blah, blah bank is going to pull my credit,

1037
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,439
give me a pin for blah, blah, blah bank

1038
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:48,149
and then they give me a special pin which I everywhere I tried to do that.

1039
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:48,590
They're like,

1040
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,409
what is this? I'm like, this is the pin to pull my credit. You can unfreeze it.

1041
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,270
They're like, what now I'm like,

1042
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,040
you're a freaking

1043
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:55,699
bank.

1044
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,110
How

1045
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,000
-- do you not know that
-- the whole system has these incentives to behave badly

1046
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,989
because the bank wants to do it as cheap and easily as possible.

1047
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:03,760
So

1048
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,550
anyway, they don't want to be secure unless they have to eat liability.

1049
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,479
And in

1050
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,159
this

1051
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,590
case, they can just

1052
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,070
either you get the credit card or you don't, if you want it,

1053
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,239
you have to play by their rules.

1054
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,969
And so what I do now is, I just like, I,

1055
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:18,959
I tell the agencies like lift my credit on this day and

1056
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,110
then I tell the bank pull my credit on this day.

1057
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,489
You can't pull it any other day, but this day, so pull it on this day. Ok.

1058
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,889
They're like, what are you talking about?

1059
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:30,330
I said, look, just trust me, you can't pull my credit until Tuesday. Ok.

1060
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,649
And you can tell they look at me like this guy's on drugs but

1061
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,889
it, it's worked.

1062
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,429
-- Ok. I actually, that seems
-- reasonable. It's very

1063
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,060
reasonable and it works.

1064
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:44,280
And actually what's really cool is where I live.

1065
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:47,010
And I know I know people are going to throw their shoe

1066
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,570
at their, their speakers when I say this, but

1067
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,510
I have to pay

1068
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,840
$10 per agency

1069
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:59,350
to put a lift on my credit. So it cost me $30 to lift my credit freeze for a day.

1070
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,560
That's amazing though. No scammer is going to do that.

1071
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,199
Right.

1072
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,479
And, and additionally, I'm like,

1073
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:09,040
I'm only lifting this if it really matters because I know, like I keep getting the,

1074
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,030
uh, I play Delta a lot. They're like, oh, you should get the Delta credit card.

1075
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,239
And I'm like, I don't want to pay $30 to get a Delta credit card, you know. So

1076
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,239
in some ways it's kept me from making foolish decisions after having, you know,

1077
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,000
maybe one, too many beers on the airplane.

1078
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:23,179
Yeah,

1079
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:23,780
but

1080
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:28,050
I've always been amazed that people get credit cards at the airport.

1081
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,189
That's just one of those things where it's like,

1082
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,429
but

1083
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,760
it's like people who buy like

1084
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:35,949
-- those I've seen on TV products.
-- Some

1085
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,879
-- of
-- those are awesome, man. I'm not gonna lie.

1086
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,979
Some of them are great

1087
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,389
but the ones that cost thousands of dollars and

1088
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:43,040
it's like you're buying that based on an ad,

1089
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,040
I would never pay more than $20 for anything.

1090
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:48,989
But also the real,

1091
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,985
I mean, to me, what it boils down to is that

1092
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:53,504
to authenticate somebody to say who they say they are,

1093
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:57,354
especially in a first time interaction, uh, name, date of birth,

1094
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:02,465
uh, social security or whatever. What really gets me is none of these numbers

1095
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:07,034
or data can easily be changed if at all. Like I can legally change my name,

1096
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:07,770
but

1097
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,929
can you legally change your date of birth?

1098
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:10,750
No,

1099
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,830
that's what it makes sense. Why would you, you know, you, that, that's insane.

1100
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,669
There's no.

1101
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,709
Exactly. Exactly.

1102
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,149
And, you know, like I did,

1103
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:23,100
it's funny I lost my wallet once in winter in a snowbank in some parking lot.

1104
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:23,530
Great.

1105
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,080
And actually a year later I got a call from a restaurant, like three blocks away from

1106
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,860
where I'm pretty sure I lost it saying,

1107
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,149
yeah, we've got your wallet in our safe. Do you want it back? And I'm kind of like,

1108
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:32,520
uh,

1109
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:36,189
yes, like that's generally how wallets work, right? You want them back,

1110
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:38,139
like, you know, uh,

1111
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,639
and but when I, when I lost my wallet, of course I had to phone a bunch of, you know,

1112
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:45,100
I phoned my bank and everything and they're like, yeah, you know,

1113
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,739
we'll have new cards for you whatever

1114
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:48,870
you like. No problem. Right.

1115
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:49,760
Um,

1116
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:53,290
healthcare card. Oh, no, we can't change that number.

1117
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,850
And our healthcare card here is a piece

1118
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,419
of paper that you're not supposed to laminate.

1119
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,649
But I always do because

1120
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,020
it's a piece of paper

1121
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:02,260
with a number on it in your name. No picture. No, nothing,

1122
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,219
uh, driver's license, same deal, you know, got a new driver's license, but

1123
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,949
we can't change the number.

1124
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:11,169
Uh, so, like, in that case, that's,

1125
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:14,280
that's probably a failing. Is it a failing?

1126
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,409
Should you be able to change your driver's license number?

1127
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,879
Well, I just, here's the thing, the credit card number, the bank guys,

1128
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:22,100
they're all like, yeah, you're getting new

1129
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:22,389
credit

1130
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,770
card numbers are designed to be changed. And I guess at the same time,

1131
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,209
if I lost my wallet,

1132
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:29,780
the only thing I would care about is my driver's license and I

1133
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,949
don't know if they would change the number but like my credit cards,

1134
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:32,959
they get stolen all the time

1135
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,790
and can't, as far as I know in pretty much any

1136
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,010
North American.

1137
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:37,969
Yeah.

1138
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,209
And, well, and the thing is like, it's, again, it's supposed to be like that.

1139
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,250
So the good news is like, my driver's license number isn't really widely used as

1140
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,090
identification of

1141
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,949
my driver's license itself. I use all the time, right?

1142
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,449
But it's like they look at the picture,

1143
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,649
they look at me, it's the same, you know, we're looking to

1144
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,949
just made me realize is I have a passport.

1145
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,129
And so like replacing all of my ID cards would be

1146
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:05,739
trivial as long as I still have my passport because I can

1147
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,010
just show

1148
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:09,649
-- my
-- passport separate from all my other things because

1149
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,250
yeah, I can lose my wallet or my passport if I lose both. I'm really up.

1150
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,449
Well, no, in this case,

1151
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,189
I have my safety deposit box with my birth certificate and you know,

1152
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:18,419
I have

1153
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,239
those as well. But

1154
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:19,929
again, you know,

1155
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:20,760
that

1156
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,544
a lawyer means not too much of a problem.

1157
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:23,715
Yes.

1158
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:29,054
But again, what you're talking about is really corner cases for the most part.

1159
00:46:29,064 --> 00:46:29,445
Right?

1160
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:32,185
-- People lose their crap all the time.
-- They do lose their crap all the time.

1161
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:36,044
But I bet, I bet 80% of people have the ability to

1162
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:39,135
get themselves bootstrapped back up to a point.

1163
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:41,114
They can be functional members of society

1164
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:42,814
and, and some of them can't.

1165
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:44,100
It depends.

1166
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,360
For example, like, you know, I,

1167
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,669
I deal with a bank where there's one branch I've dealt with since I was 15.

1168
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,949
And so they know me by face, right? Like they know me when I walk in

1169
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:55,530
and that's one of the reasons I still continue to deal with this branch in the bank.

1170
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,050
-- Because
-- even then, like,

1171
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,800
-- they could hire new people or it would be just as easy for the bank to
-- just,

1172
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,790
that's why I make the point of going in about once every month or not a month or two.

1173
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,219
But every couple of months, you know,

1174
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:06,689
is because, yeah, they do hire new

1175
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,139
people

1176
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,600
and they remember you once every couple of months, like, I,

1177
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,459
-- I see the mailman every day and
-- the older manager type people do.

1178
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:15,290
Right?

1179
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:17,820
-- Ok.
-- You know, and they're, they're there for a while.

1180
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:18,909
Um, but yeah, so,

1181
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,850
but the problem is fundamentally like,

1182
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,899
unless

1183
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,199
you know anything, I'm going to use to authenticate to a company, by definition,

1184
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,939
I have to give out to a whole bunch of people to get credit to get a utility

1185
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:32,580
to get.

1186
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:34,800
-- And this is actually where
-- the

1187
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,860
store, this crap forever, right? They're not going to delete it, right.

1188
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,290
-- They're gonna like, type it in and be like, ok then,
-- but here's the beauty of this,

1189
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,520
right?

1190
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,419
Is this is where I'm going to talk about

1191
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,820
credit freeze as being a brilliant solution to this.

1192
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:46,250
And by the way,

1193
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,639
if you're listening and you've made it this far through a storytelling, uh,

1194
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:50,899
freeze your credit, please.

1195
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,129
Even if you don't think you need it, you will not regret it.

1196
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:56,300
But anyway, the point is the numbers that identify me,

1197
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,219
I can give it to a company.

1198
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,139
But by the way,

1199
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:02,570
the credit freeze works is there still a second layer of authentication now.

1200
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,179
Right. And, and it's an out of band authentication

1201
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,060
because I don't give the company, I'm dealing with my PIN.

1202
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:10,879
I go straight to the agencies, give them my P I

1203
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,100
identify myself and then tell them what I want them to do.

1204
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:17,530
And that's really the way this needs to be done. I mean, let's face it.

1205
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,679
The solution to all of this exists. It is freezing your credit.

1206
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:25,000
Everyone should freeze their credit. And if everyone had to do that,

1207
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,770
all of these problems go away.

1208
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:29,520
Well, a lot of them would, but

1209
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,290
there's still a lot of

1210
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,379
-- other companies that store a lot of data on us.
-- But who cares? Ok. Ok.

1211
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:38,010
That's a whole another topic.

1212
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,989
-- And we can do a whole podcast just
-- like, for example, like to transfer my utilities

1213
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:45,850
and I decided to combine my natural gas bill with like every other utility I have.

1214
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,290
So I only have one provider now

1215
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:50,159
and they're like, you know, Mr Siefried,

1216
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,060
uh so blah, blah, blah, there might be like a deposit required. And I'm like,

1217
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:57,989
she's like, but you know, if we can I check your billing history to see blah, blah,

1218
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,149
blah.

1219
00:48:58,159 --> 00:48:58,830
And I'm like,

1220
00:48:59,449 --> 00:48:59,479
and

1221
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,199
she's like, no, no, I need like you to like say that I can check your billing history.

1222
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,290
I'm like, oh, yes, yes, you can check my billing history, right?

1223
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,750
Because obviously this call is being recorded

1224
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:09,050
and she's like, Ok. T tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Right.

1225
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,780
And she pulls up my, essentially my,

1226
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,149
my billing history and credit history with that specific company and sees,

1227
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,780
you know, yeah, I paid every bill on time since like, forever.

1228
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:18,850
So. Ok, no deposit needs great.

1229
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:19,879
Um,

1230
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:23,050
and, you know, and conversely there's people out there I know that, like,

1231
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,330
have to put down like $500 deposits

1232
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,250
to get gas or, or, uh, you know, cable or whatever because they have like, terrible,

1233
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,459
terrible track records.

1234
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,810
And what's actually started happening in some cases

1235
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,580
is with sort of addresses that are,

1236
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,290
you know, typically rental properties,

1237
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:42,649
they'll basically say like, yeah, we know, well,

1238
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:45,850
we think you're claiming to not be this person who used to rent there.

1239
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,820
That's cool. Good story. But like,

1240
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:50,889
there's an outstanding bill of like 350 bucks at this address

1241
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,689
and until it's cleared, tough.

1242
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,929
-- You know,
-- that's, that's rough if, if that's the case.

1243
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,719
But when you have like an address where consistently you have

1244
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,219
people renting for two or three or four or five months

1245
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:03,250
and not paying their utility bills at all.

1246
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,810
It's like as a, what do you expect these companies to do?

1247
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:07,530
Just eat the loss and smile.

1248
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,489
Yeah, I mean, that's

1249
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,370
-- II, I get it. I understand
-- that.

1250
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:15,570
And that's part of the problem is we've gone to this model of like,

1251
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,679
huge hyper efficient companies that, you know, they have statistical models.

1252
00:50:20,689 --> 00:50:21,669
They don't know who you are.

1253
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,580
But their statistical model has a pretty good idea of who you are

1254
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,719
and it says, yeah, we can, like,

1255
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:29,919
sign this guy for like a credit card with all but like no limit.

1256
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:30,850
Just let him go,

1257
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,080
you know, dude owns a house, we can take his house. Awesome. You can,

1258
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:35,320
-- you
-- know.

1259
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:37,209
Yeah, apparently.

1260
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,600
But, um, and that's, that's fundamentally, it's like,

1261
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,949
even if Equifax Transunion and Experian and Choice point and

1262
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,750
God knows how many other companies all had like,

1263
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,040
perfect data security.

1264
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,840
They don't, I'd still,

1265
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,459
yeah, I'd still have to be handing out like my,

1266
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,959
you know, sensitive information to

1267
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:58,399
these places where if it were ever leaked or copied, then that person can now be me.

1268
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:00,229
No, they can't. Well, ok, they can.

1269
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,639
But this is where something like a credit freeze is super useful, right?

1270
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,280
It's

1271
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,090
there, there isn't a good answer to this today.

1272
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,889
And,

1273
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:09,610
well,

1274
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,659
my cable company actually just tried to get me to

1275
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,010
set a pin number on my account and I'm like,

1276
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,530
why?

1277
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,270
And he's like, so that basically nobody can like, phone us up and,

1278
00:51:16,419 --> 00:51:19,669
and like, pretend to be you and stuff. And I'm like, does that happen a lot?

1279
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,020
And he's like, obviously can't, you know, talk about that.

1280
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:23,419
And I'm like,

1281
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:25,149
he's like, oh, if somebody were to like,

1282
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:28,669
call and like order premium services in your name and I'm like, I,

1283
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:30,060
I bet that actually happened

1284
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:33,229
to people with teenagers every now and then

1285
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,909
it's probably not a significant threat in all seriousness.

1286
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:40,260
And the thing is with teenagers, how could I possibly defend myself against my kids?

1287
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,639
Like, I'm gonna, like, lock up my ID

1288
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,080
and never let them near it.

1289
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,280
Yeah, we're not going to have that conversation either.

1290
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,040
It's just not gonna work.

1291
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:50,429
It's

1292
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,270
-- hilarious.
-- It's like those kids who have their identities stolen by their parents.

1293
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,149
Uh,

1294
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:56,850
that's a really difficult,

1295
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,310
so

1296
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:00,020
that's another problem. And that's, well, it's illegal. Right.

1297
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,340
I mean, it is illegal to do.

1298
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:05,429
There's, there's laws against behavior such as that.

1299
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:06,600
Right.

1300
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,780
-- It is.
-- But

1301
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,780
this is,

1302
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:13,159
this is one thing where, for example, some form of biometrics, like,

1303
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:17,520
even just a picture would, you know, go a long way to making a lot harder.

1304
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,540
Um, my favorite always is when you look at some of these fake I DS

1305
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:21,979
and, you know, they, like,

1306
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:25,439
just cut and paste and like totally random other person's facing or whatever,

1307
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:27,060
you know,

1308
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,669
or, uh, the case where it's like, you know,

1309
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:34,639
I, I am not like 6 ft seven, like, clearly I'm not 6 ft seven. Like, did you

1310
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,020
not notice that?

1311
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm not 6 ft seven. I'm not even 6 ft.

1312
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:41,229
Yeah.

1313
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:45,629
-- Anyway,
-- anyway, no, it's, I don't know that there's a simple or easy answer,

1314
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:48,679
I think credit freezing and, and by default, you know,

1315
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:51,459
having like a nice little smartphone app that allows you to unlock

1316
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,250
-- it or lock it and not have to pay 30
-- bucks.

1317
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,550
I want to pay

1318
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:55,830
$30.

1319
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,639
Well, ok, it should be hard to do.

1320
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,939
You have to pay 30 bucks upfront. And if, uh,

1321
00:53:02,689 --> 00:53:05,600
you know, and maybe the company, for example, can say, you know,

1322
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,050
here's the password for him to collect his money.

1323
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,790
Right. So essentially you put up a $30 bond and then the company,

1324
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,189
you know, can verify that you wanted this and,

1325
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,879
you know, you get your money back and that

1326
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,030
because remember this happened with DNS, right? With the DNS, the Domain

1327
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:24,110
-- and
-- there's places it's free. It just depends on what state you live in.

1328
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,110
I, I happen to like that. I have to pay for it because

1329
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,530
my suspicion is what's going to happen is after this,

1330
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,070
they're just going to make it free

1331
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,340
because

1332
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:35,500
by making credit freezing free,

1333
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:38,820
these guys might be able to avoid some level of regulation.

1334
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,800
I like how we went to a point where it's like I have all this data on you.

1335
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,449
It'd be a real shame if it leaks,

1336
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:43,669
you

1337
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:43,820
know,

1338
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,860
for a few bucks

1339
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:46,580
anyway.

1340
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:48,560
Seriously.

1341
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,320
-- How is that? Not extortion? Well,
-- whatever it

1342
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,530
is.

1343
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,320
Seriously, that sounds a lot like extortion.

1344
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,639
-- They're gonna offer me credit monitoring if I want it like one year,
-- right?

1345
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:57,949
A free year of credit,

1346
00:53:58,229 --> 00:53:59,250
such a good deal.

1347
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:00,020
No offense.

1348
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,780
But like as somebody pointed out on Reddit,

1349
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,520
-- you can steal an identity and still use that like
-- 10 years

1350
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,510
-- and
-- actually

1351
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,139
so sort of a tangent.

1352
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:12,219
But there was a thread on Reddit a few years ago I read where it was like, it was a,

1353
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:13,610
it was an ask Reddit thing where,

1354
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:14,790
you know, people have Reddit,

1355
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,090
has somebody stolen your identity and kind of what happened.

1356
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,969
And this one guy is like

1357
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,389
my social security number name and everything was stolen by an illegal immigrant,

1358
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,250
but they've totally improved my credit score.

1359
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,270
That's great.

1360
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,550
So he's like, I don't know who this guy is, but like,

1361
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,580
he's like my credit score is like 200 points better now because

1362
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,199
he has like a credit card and this other thing in my name

1363
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,209
-- and he like, pays his bill religiously and I'm like,
-- that's hilarious.

1364
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:45,429
That is hilarious. So actually the real person is ruining the life of the

1365
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:47,040
uh identity thief.

1366
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,739
Yeah, that's brilliant.

1367
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:49,929
That's great.

1368
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:50,649
That's great.

1369
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,300
You know, but, and that's the thing, right? Like, how do we? Yeah, I mean

1370
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,340
this, this whole, I don't know, it just, the more I think about this,

1371
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,120
the more it really does seem like extortion.

1372
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,870
Like I'm going to keep all this data on you

1373
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,419
and like for, you know, a few bucks I can maybe like, try not to leak it so much.

1374
00:55:06,189 --> 00:55:06,570
Yep.

1375
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,469
I, I

1376
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,610
don't know, man,

1377
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,989
-- this is
-- ok. Well, so ignoring all this,

1378
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,919
here's the beauty of

1379
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,739
let's why don't we go to the really juicy saucy part of the story,

1380
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,489
which I think will get even worse.

1381
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:25,159
So, two things. Stock trading, right. We see here's one of the things, right. Like,

1382
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:26,550
I think part of the problem is how do

1383
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,560
you actually monetize 100 and 43 million records?

1384
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,280
That's like, so much that, like,

1385
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,120
you'd have to sell them at some.

1386
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:34,929
Yeah.

1387
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:39,379
How do you monetize that data? Right. Like, it's so bulk, it's like we are selling

1388
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:41,919
like a million records for like $10. I don't know.

1389
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:45,120
Like, I like bulk pricing on that kind of data.

1390
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,679
You know, it's half of North America at this point.

1391
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:49,370
It's

1392
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:49,669
gonna be,

1393
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,409
yeah, it's like, oh, we just,

1394
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,620
yeah, we robbed Fort Knox but ok, now what?

1395
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,860
And yes, I heard that, that the executives sold their stock, what,

1396
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,270
like four days before the story hit, which is, come

1397
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:03,770
on guys, it's insider trading.

1398
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:05,229
Well, unless it's a

1399
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,340
scheduled stock disbursement

1400
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,090
thing where, you know, they do this every six months or a year or whatever.

1401
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,715
But no, no, no, that's not the juicy part. It's not even close to the juicy part.

1402
00:56:13,774 --> 00:56:14,594
That's boring.

1403
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:18,274
What's really interesting. Equifax stock trading is

1404
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:20,784
very minimal. It's very boring. Right. There's

1405
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:23,554
only, it's got, it's a very thinly traded

1406
00:56:23,705 --> 00:56:26,395
stock in the sense of there's not like a high volume every

1407
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:26,854
date

1408
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:32,709
and there's especially not a high volume of options so quick. One on one for options.

1409
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,429
The stock market basically has sort of what most people

1410
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:38,350
know about is you can buy and sell shares,

1411
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,050
right?

1412
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:43,300
Shares are selling at some market price of say $27 and you can buy, you know,

1413
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,179
you make an offer of $27.01

1414
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,129
and of course somebody will probably be like sweet, I just made a penny, you know,

1415
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,550
and sell you a million shares

1416
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,870
and conversely, you know, same for selling, right?

1417
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:54,969
You're selling shares and you,

1418
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:58,090
you price it up market price for a penny below and everybody's like, oh, awesome,

1419
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,429
great.

1420
00:56:58,439 --> 00:56:58,770
You know,

1421
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,830
there's also options and options are essentially a contract that either

1422
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,989
a put or a call that allows you to either have

1423
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,810
the option of selling or the option of buying shares

1424
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,629
on a certain date at a certain price. So for example, I can buy an option

1425
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:21,870
saying I will, I will have the option of selling, say

1426
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,320
10,000 shares of F

1427
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:24,570
Corp at a dollar.

1428
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:29,510
Uh And then when that date rolls around, I can choose to exercise it or not,

1429
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,919
I can either do it or don't do it.

1430
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:31,830
Um,

1431
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,389
the counter party to that,

1432
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,500
uh,

1433
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,219
has to do it. Like if I decide to sell our share, um, or, you know, uh buy, right?

1434
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:42,379
That's, that's what I'm paying for, right? So

1435
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,719
somebody bought,

1436
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,649
uh what was it? 100 and 60,000 options

1437
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,719
of Equifax

1438
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:51,540
to sell

1439
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:54,239
at, uh I forget the exact price, but it's

1440
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,719
um, a little bit below what the stock was currently trading

1441
00:57:57,879 --> 00:57:58,909
before the breach.

1442
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,560
And here's the thing. So those are what are called in the money options

1443
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:09,989
in that essentially normally given normal behavior of the stock.

1444
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:12,500
It, nobody would care because basically,

1445
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:17,100
like the stock trades for the sake of argument between 131 $140

1446
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,679
and somebody bought a bunch of options to sell or sorry to buy the,

1447
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:23,620
or to sell the shares at 100 and 30

1448
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,040
like no big deal, right? Like it,

1449
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,659
chances are those options aren't going to be worth anything

1450
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:31,159
on that date because that's kind of the normal trading range

1451
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,040
and this person wouldn't be able to make any money.

1452
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,790
And then there's what are called out of the money options where it's like,

1453
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,429
say the stock trades between 100 and 30 100 and 40.

1454
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,750
And you know, I, I want, I want to

1455
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:43,979
buy the shares

1456
00:58:44,669 --> 00:58:44,760
to the

1457
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:45,139
point,

1458
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:51,639
somebody bought 100 and 60,000 option at 60 cents a piece. Roughly

1459
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:53,810
that are now worth about $4 million

1460
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:58,110
because they basically bought the option to sell these shares at this given price.

1461
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,189
Normal trading activity on this

1462
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:04,389
on Equifax for these options is like

1463
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,739
tens of contracts per day

1464
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:09,550
and somebody bought thousands of these in a single day

1465
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:11,909
just around the time of the breach.

1466
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:14,409
Yeah, but look, you can't buy stock,

1467
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,550
this isn't Bitcoin. I mean, the sec knows who did that and they're going to go,

1468
00:59:19,439 --> 00:59:20,370
right. Like it's quite

1469
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:20,570
like

1470
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:21,770
this.

1471
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,169
-- Right.
-- Well, that's what confuses me about.

1472
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:26,229
This is, this is one of those cases where,

1473
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,229
uh, if there was enough volume you could hide in the herd.

1474
00:59:31,149 --> 00:59:31,560
Right?

1475
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:35,639
Like it was a, it was a very busy stock, I'd say Microsoft or something

1476
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:37,229
here. Like

1477
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,719
you're proving the point,

1478
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,290
the SEC will have to investigate and somebody's going to get nail power

1479
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,629
and that's the part I don't get is

1480
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,659
somebody sophisticated enough to steal this data and do the stock trading.

1481
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,520
They showed the chart and there's basically like, every other day is flat.

1482
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,929
It's like the, it's like a one Pix

1483
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:54,909
high bar

1484
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:56,459
and then there's the day that this

1485
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,879
entity brought all these

1486
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,110
options.

1487
00:59:58,149 --> 01:00:03,550
Reality is it's probably just some idiot who caught wind of this and they,

1488
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,090
they thought they were going to make a buck and the SEC is just

1489
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,550
going to find him and throw him in jail for like five months.

1490
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:12,100
And, and that's what it's going to be. I doubt this is nefarious because

1491
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,520
let's face it. Like

1492
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:18,080
the, the entire financial industry is designed to make this hard to do.

1493
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:21,959
Well, the one theory is that it's insider trading based on the Equifax information,

1494
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:22,399
which

1495
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:24,989
-- totally illegal, they're going to get nailed.
-- Well, sure.

1496
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,520
That's exactly what it is, right. Guaranteed.

1497
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:29,070
Well, or it's the bad guys. But again,

1498
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,729
this is the bad guys

1499
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:31,439
because

1500
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:32,389
it's too obvious

1501
01:00:33,649 --> 01:00:34,600
No, it's not the bad,

1502
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,300
whatever, but

1503
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:36,739
interesting

1504
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:39,399
to see this activity regardless because it's obviously

1505
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,229
like when you look at 30 days of graphs, this is the only activity of.

1506
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,870
-- No, it's,
-- it's crazy town.

1507
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:48,360
All right, man, we've been, we've been dragging this one out for a long time, I guess.

1508
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:50,760
Here are my, my closing thoughts on this is,

1509
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:53,399
I'm not surprised this happened.

1510
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,169
I am pleased.

1511
01:00:56,129 --> 01:00:58,120
Normal people are starting to pay attention

1512
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,689
and I think the reality is freezing your credit

1513
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,760
is not only the right thing to do today.

1514
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,840
It's probably the easiest long term solution that actually makes this,

1515
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,340
we'll say less important, right?

1516
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,300
I mean, now I I will say though,

1517
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:12,780
here's the

1518
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,260
question.

1519
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,600
No, no, here's, here's the real question.

1520
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:19,719
Did the attacker get my credit freeze ID number?

1521
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:21,360
My P

1522
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:23,139
if they have that,

1523
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,790
I'm screwed. Right.

1524
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,870
Well, yes and no, because you're part of such a big vulnerable herd of people,

1525
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:30,780
hopefully

1526
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,060
be safe. But you get the point,

1527
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,830
you get the point is uh and,

1528
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,040
and that might be that if that information comes out in the next couple of days,

1529
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,310
that would make the story huge,

1530
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,110
-- right?
-- So here's my thinking on this.

1531
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,100
So from the supply side,

1532
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:50,889
obviously buying somebody's identity online is like trivial,

1533
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,129
especially now that there's 100 and 43 million more of them.

1534
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,179
So on the demand side of the people that can actually

1535
01:01:57,189 --> 01:01:59,929
take this data and turn it into cold hard cash.

1536
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:02,250
Does this actually give them a

1537
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:06,100
-- significant benefit?
-- Probably not outside of what they already had.

1538
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,939
I mean, let's face it

1539
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,879
because, yeah, I can't imagine like, these people are lacking for records when you,

1540
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:13,270
because, like, every single data breach,

1541
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,979
it seems like in the last four or five years,

1542
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:18,989
you know, we went from like, oh a few 1000 to a few tens of thousands to now, like,

1543
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,350
it's just millions, every single, you know, major one is,

1544
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,469
-- it's
-- not a story if there aren't at least

1545
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,350
100 million breaches or 100 million records anyway.

1546
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,560
Anyway, uh, I guess, yeah, whatever.

1547
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,649
What, what are your, what are your closing thoughts here?

1548
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,479
My thoughts are

1549
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,780
nothing will significantly change.

1550
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,080
There will be some, uh what's the English expression?

1551
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,919
German Storm and drama, like basically Storm and drama.

1552
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:48,020
But will we see good new, will we see new regulation?

1553
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:48,449
No

1554
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,330
good regulation?

1555
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:51,530
-- Look,
-- let's

1556
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:51,719
face

1557
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:51,850
it.

1558
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,070
The government is locked in

1559
01:02:54,189 --> 01:02:58,209
a stalemate of effort proportions unless basically half of the

1560
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:01,620
Senate has their identity stolen and actually used an identity.

1561
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,889
Nothing will change

1562
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,600
even then I don't know if it would.

1563
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:10,149
Yeah. So I suspect nothing of significance will change or happen.

1564
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:11,419
A whole pile of people.

1565
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,010
-- Here's what I mean, a whole pile of people will freeze
-- the

1566
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:14,229
credit.

1567
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,489
Well, screw the revenue. Just good job doing that.

1568
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,510
Like you should be freezing your credit if you're not freezing your credit, go do it.

1569
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,959
Go do it right now. Right.

1570
01:03:23,439 --> 01:03:24,489
Stop the podcast.

1571
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:25,209
Go do it

1572
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,379
apart from the hassle of dealing with this.

1573
01:03:29,229 --> 01:03:32,770
Has anybody really ever been out the money from identity

1574
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,399
theft in this kind of thing by and large?

1575
01:03:34,689 --> 01:03:35,729
You mean out the money?

1576
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:36,370
Well, you,

1577
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:37,639
you talked about this in a previous

1578
01:03:37,649 --> 01:03:39,790
episode where it's like suing somebody for identity

1579
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,229
theft is really hard because you would have to prove some sort of loss.

1580
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,679
I doubt it.

1581
01:03:44,379 --> 01:03:47,679
And I get that it fucks to have to spend tens or hundreds of hours dealing with like,

1582
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:48,750
no, I'm not debt or

1583
01:03:48,879 --> 01:03:52,969
no, I don't own like 17 houses. Like, can I please have a mortgage,

1584
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:54,060
you know,

1585
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:56,000
47 credit cards?

1586
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:57,070
I don't know.

1587
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:59,469
But actually being on the hook for that money,

1588
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:00,110
it

1589
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,000
-- seems like in most cases it's pretty easy to disprove.
-- It's not

1590
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:06,120
easy. It's like you said at the beginning of the episode, it does take a long time.

1591
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,669
It's doable, but it's tricky.

1592
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,139
That's what I mean. It's, you don't need like an OJ Simpson style lawyer.

1593
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,060
Like you can, you just need to go file paperwork

1594
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:13,830
pretty much.

1595
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,020
So, it's,

1596
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:16,110
I think you're right.

1597
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,669
I don't think, I honestly, at the end of the day it's a crazy story,

1598
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:21,270
but really it's, it's not gonna matter.

1599
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:21,290
I,

1600
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,110
I imagine we're just going to be talking about

1601
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,270
the hurricane more than this in six months.

1602
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,110
Yeah. Well, in a financial sense, I mean, Houston being flooded and

1603
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,030
I was gonna say Miami, but at this point, I guess we'll just go with Florida.

1604
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:36,850
Um Florida being flooded.

1605
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:37,989
You know, the, the,

1606
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,320
the cost financially insurance claim wise and

1607
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,899
everything on that is going to make this

1608
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,959
-- not even be a rounding error and,
-- and we could talk about insurance and risk

1609
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,320
and, and maybe the next episode because there's some fascinating overland

1610
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,870
flood insurance. There's

1611
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,110
a, there's

1612
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:53,169
a

1613
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:53,860
people

1614
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,459
anyway, anyway, when there's some things that have been happening around

1615
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,060
building codes that they've kind of become lax because they were like,

1616
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,310
it's not that bad.

1617
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:03,719
I like, well, guess what it is.

1618
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:06,739
But anyway, anyway. All right, cool. Thanks, Kurt.

1619
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,270
