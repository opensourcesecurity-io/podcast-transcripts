Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,439
Siefried and my partner of Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,810
So take two.

3
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,459
It always amuses me when, when we have just the,

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,760
-- the magic of the
-- podcast in fairness. I've never seen that error message before.

5
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:21,420
It's

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,079
so.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,750
So for you dear listeners,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,360
we started recording a podcast and like literally three minutes into it.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,959
We just had a bunch of ridiculous,

10
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,430
weird technical problems and so we've thrown everything away

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,029
-- and we're starting again
-- and here's the best part.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,159
We have no idea what failed or why. So I just went to a different computer.

13
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:41,340
-- That's right.
-- Computers are magic and we don't know and we don't care. So, whatever.

14
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:44,560
-- So anyway, anyway, in
-- fairness, last time a reboot did fix it.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,090
-- Why not?
-- If I fix it? I mean, it made the problem go away for at least.

16
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:53,009
-- Well, the 30 minutes we needed to record it.
-- Amuses me that when

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,229
my Children come to me with a technical problem, the first thing I say is,

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,299
did you restart it?

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,259
And they say no. And then I say, go restart it and come back.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,819
If it doesn't work and they almost never come back again.

21
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,930
I've literally, yeah, like Felix with his online classes and stuff, like,

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,150
just once in a while, but

23
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,129
just,

24
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,566
did you try restarting Chrome?

25
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,106
Ok. Do that like that? That's all I got, son.

26
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,146
Like, I, I don't know how to troubleshoot this.

27
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:18,966
Right. Right. Or, or the other day, my daughter says, Dad, what's the Wi Fi password?

28
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,496
And I said, why do you need the Wi Fi password? And she goes, my tablet won't connect.

29
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:26,706
And I said, just restart it and yeah, sure enough, it restarted and it was fine.

30
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:30,346
See, I was clever. I did the, I printed out the QR code with the guest Wi Fi password.

31
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,026
So now people just have to point their device at it and boop they're online.

32
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:33,472
Well,

33
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:35,181
you can do that. I didn't know you could do that.

34
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:35,241
Yeah,

35
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,092
there's a special string that you just literally Google Wifi

36
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:41,351
password QR code and there's a generator for it.

37
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,232
There's one that runs like on your clients.

38
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,891
So you don't have to worry about your password getting all lowered, knows where.

39
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:49,791
But it's basically the string is Wi Fi Focal and blah, blah, blah.

40
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,671
And if you have like an iphone, well, if you have an Apple device, it just, it's like,

41
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,741
OK, I know what that string means.

42
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,872
You want me to join that Wi Fi

43
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,370
and if you have an android, depending on what app you're using,

44
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,629
it may or may not be smart enough.

45
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,589
Whoa. That's really cool. I need to look into that.

46
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,480
It takes literally three seconds and it's so much faster than trying

47
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,750
to teach people how to type in your Wi Fi password.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,639
Well, in my Wi Fi password, I have two. My guest Wi Fi password is comically bad.

49
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,309
And my other Wi Fi password will say isn't great, but I don't care.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,710
So if I could only have one

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,809
and then

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,559
just use a QR code because like we've talked about this at length on the show,

53
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,729
I treat my home network as an adversarial zone.

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,550
So I don't care who connects to it.

55
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:31,490
Nice.

56
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,820
No, it's just, it's just easier, right?

57
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,250
Because, and also the beauty thing, you know,

58
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,089
people don't have to go into their settings and look around with it.

59
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,259
They like with an I device,

60
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,369
you just literally point at the cameras smart enough to

61
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,500
recognize a QR code and smart enough to go.

62
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,020
I know what that QR code means and literally one tab

63
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:46,210
they're online.

64
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,110
Wow, that's awesome. I need to do that.

65
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,600
It's a way better experience.

66
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,759
So,

67
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,440
speaking of which Apple in the last couple of weeks

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,699
and some of the security news is kind of older,

69
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,149
but it's just finally now kind of taking effect.

70
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,350
So we're actually going to be using a timer to bang through some of these, right.

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Yeah, I have, I have no idea what's going on. Kurt claims to have a plan.

72
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,869
-- So
-- the long story short is like,

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,410
there's literally half a dozen really kind of interesting security things.

74
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,130
Apple is doing some of which are contentious and some of which are also contentious,

75
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,699
but then other vendors followed,

76
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,500
which kind of says it's probably the right thing to do. Like if you're

77
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,779
like, basically if Apple does something and then Google and Microsoft go, yeah,

78
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,550
I guess we should too, then, you know, it's actually probably the right thing to do.

79
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,910
Maybe, maybe. So, let's start with the quickest, easiest one.

80
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:34,250
Apple has forced quote unquote one year certificate, lifetimes.

81
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,309
It's actually 398 days, which is, what, one year plus a month plus,

82
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,449
like an extra day or two.

83
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,149
-- I mean,
-- that's not just Apple, that's been driven by

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,570
-- a number of organizations.
-- Well, Apple was the first to do it. And so c, a

85
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,789
forum, the certificate of authority

86
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,940
browser forum where, you know, they're supposed to cooper and set this stuff

87
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:52,339
had, you know, they,

88
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,720
Apple and some others had pushed for this last year and the c of course, were like, no,

89
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:57,139
we don't like this, blah, blah, you know,

90
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:00,630
you've already driven it down from 10 years to five years to two years or whatever.

91
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,960
And Apple's like, ok, and then Apple's like, ah, we're doing it anyways.

92
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,020
-- I
-- think that's great.

93
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,479
And I think I'm going to give,

94
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,020
let's encrypt all of the credit for this because I think without, let's encrypt,

95
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:13,320
-- we couldn't have this conversation
-- and Claude flair and a couple others.

96
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,580
But

97
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,699
more to the point like

98
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,769
I, to put it bluntly and I love the counter arguments for this.

99
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,899
So we're going to start the timer.

100
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,769
But basically I love the counter arguments are, oh, you know,

101
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,480
this will increase costs for people.

102
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:27,100
Well, you just knock that one down. We, we got, let's encrypt.

103
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:28,480
So that, that one's dead.

104
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,630
The second one and I love is, oh, this creates a lot of manual work for people.

105
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,630
Let's encrypt.

106
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,519
Well, to which I say, if you're manually managing your certificates,

107
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,049
you're already doing it wrong.

108
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,429
This just exposes that you're doing it wrong,

109
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,160
you know, kind of forces you to acknowledge it.

110
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,369
And then of course, there's the whole thing.

111
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,269
Well, like certificate makers are saying that this is somehow less secure.

112
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:49,559
Exactly

113
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,739
-- if you read the news about any of these companies over the last couple of years.
-- Yeah.

114
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,179
And you know, people are pointing out that like, let's face it. All right.

115
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,220
Certificate revocation.

116
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,269
Remember, like 20 years ago, we were like, oh, certificate revocation.

117
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,450
That's something we should probably deal with.

118
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,200
And OK, you know, we'll do certificate revocation list, right?

119
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,660
Which is literally a list of revoked certificates.

120
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,519
And it worked so well that every time there's a major incident now,

121
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,619
all the browser vendors have to ship an update

122
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,299
with like a manually jammed in CRL to like

123
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,239
block the, the certificates because to put it bluntly crls and then the,

124
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,910
the next one online certificate,

125
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,869
something protocol. What's the s stand for? Nobody cares.

126
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,940
But the point is like number one,

127
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,359
it's a privacy disaster because every time you visit a website,

128
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,089
you have to check with the central authority.

129
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,570
If their certificate is still valid or not.

130
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,579
Number two, if that central authority is down,

131
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,630
then you should probably not go to the site because that means you're being man

132
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,390
in the middle and being blocked from seeing that you're getting a bad certificate.

133
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,809
So

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,100
of course, nobody does that because it just breaks the web

135
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,649
right. 99% of the time, everything's fine.

136
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,559
-- It's just the, the side is down
-- prior to cloud flare.

137
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,059
None of these vendors,

138
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,500
the C A vendors could actually run an O CS P

139
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,709
service that was like more than 90 some percent reliable.

140
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,640
And I don't mean like 99.999 I mean, like 95

141
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,679
I would be shocked if it was even that high when

142
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,040
I turned on whatever the mode was to fail hard,

143
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,250
it was unusable.

144
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,149
So the, so there, you know, Apple went ahead with this Google and Microsoft fa

145
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,630
so I think it's the right thing to do.

146
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,019
I agree

147
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,760
100% good job.

148
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm not giving Apple any credit for this.

149
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:14,029
How

150
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,190
do

151
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,589
we

152
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:14,980
make that?

153
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:15,570
Ok.

154
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,690
So that's a certificate thing banged out, that's done then the next thing is

155
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,829
the uh where to go, where to go, where to go. Strong arms. Yeah, we did that. Oh

156
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,540
Then the next thing we're going to bang up,

157
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,549
we're going to give ourselves a few more minutes for this.

158
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,059
So Apple

159
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,170
is basically declining to implement

160
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,769
16 new

161
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,170
web based API S in the Safari web browser

162
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,239
officially for privacy concerns.

163
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,480
Yeah, you sent me that story yesterday and I love this.

164
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,600
II, I haven't looked at what Firefox has done.

165
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:51,529
I feel like they will probably do something similar,

166
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,809
maybe not as strict as Apple in some ways because I think Firefox is

167
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,709
occasionally a different beast.

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,160
But I think this is one of those examples of the existing browser market,

169
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,769
I think is heavily focused on collecting your user data.

170
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,149
I mean, that's basically, I mean,

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,279
that's functionally Google's whole market and it's different with apple

172
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,200
and so they can start taking a stand here,

173
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,609
I think and I hope they do.

174
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,179
Well, let's give a bit of context. So these, these API

175
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,079
S are interesting actually, I mean,

176
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,500
there's the web Bluetooth which allows Bluetooth or sorry,

177
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,369
which allows websites to connect to nearby Bluetooth le devices.

178
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,000
So for example, that would be useful like I have a bunch of IOT stuff that you know,

179
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,660
I manage through a mobile app.

180
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,510
Well, honestly,

181
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,273
it would be kind of nice if that stuff could

182
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:37,713
be managed through a website app because you know,

183
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:38,632
somebody pointed out like,

184
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:41,102
we're at a point now where every time you go to a coffee shop, they're like,

185
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,312
you need to install our app so that you can order stuff online.

186
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,483
And I'm like, just give me my coffee.

187
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:47,113
I don't want to install your web app or your mobile app or,

188
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,263
but maybe doing it through a website would be nicer because

189
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,903
then I don't have to install junk on my phone.

190
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,013
And as somebody pointed out the advantage of a web app is you go to the website,

191
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:58,153
you use it, you leave the website, there's not a whole pile of cruft on your phone,

192
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:58,502
right?

193
00:07:58,513 --> 00:07:59,513
And then there's a whole bunch of other

194
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,966
things. Like my favorite is the web Midi app.

195
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:04,135
So for those of you who don't know what Midi is

196
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,325
and actually, I don't know what the acronym stands for

197
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,566
musical instrument, digital interface.

198
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,976
So this is like think old timey electronic keyboards, you know,

199
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:12,406
like from the seventies or whatever.

200
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:15,605
And you know, they can be hooked up to a computer. They still exist.

201
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,406
Oh, yeah, exactly.

202
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:19,015
But they can be hooked up to a computer and programs like when you hit a key,

203
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,726
-- it makes a fart noise or a chicken or whatever,
-- go watch,

204
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,555
there's lots of cool youtube videos about this, just go watch them.

205
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,630
And so for example,

206
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,329
the midi one is especially horrifying because apparently

207
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,329
part of Midi is that you can download little

208
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,830
binary blobs of data sound noise stuff to the device so that it can play it.

209
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,039
And so apparently the web Midi app essentially allows the web browser then to send

210
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,150
like binary blobs to your Midi device that it then processes what could go wrong.

211
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,539
That's so weird to me. I don't understand why.

212
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,299
That's even a,

213
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,205
well, somebody pointed out they made a Midi like a website that has Midi app, right?

214
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:51,755
Things like that.

215
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,635
Other things are like a magnetometer app that allows websites to access

216
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:57,835
data about the literally the local magnetic field of where you are.

217
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:58,315
Again.

218
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:02,286
The thing to remember basically is the idea seems to be I think you're right,

219
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:06,195
largely being pushed by companies like Google is that they want to make web based

220
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:08,426
applications like a first class citizen that

221
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,322
can access all the hardware on your phone

222
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:12,921
like a mobile app can. So that

223
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:17,572
because to put it bluntly like I hate installing mobile apps now unless I really

224
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:21,322
want it like all these mobile apps like that whole tiktok thing recently where oh,

225
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,122
it turns out tiktok is like copying your clipboard

226
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,221
every like what 3 to 4 seconds or something,

227
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:26,911
you know,

228
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,242
other things like device memory API allows websites to

229
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,802
receive the approximate amount of device memory and gigabytes,

230
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
you know, things like near field contact. Oh, this is my favorite one.

231
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,380
The network information API it provides

232
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,820
information about the connection of devices

233
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,330
using to communicate with the network and provides a means of scripts,

234
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,260
sorry, four scripts to be notified if the network connection type changes.

235
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,190
-- I
-- mean, you can easily make the argument that all of these features will,

236
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,340
-- they're
-- useful to somebody.

237
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:57,260
They could be useful. But I think the potential for abuse is very high.

238
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,580
I'd say it's over 9000

239
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,609
like, but, but again,

240
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:03,400
it goes back to the whole point of they want to make the

241
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,179
web applications first class citizens that

242
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,080
can access all the mobile capabilities.

243
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,440
Because I mean, to put it bluntly, people are getting tired of mobile apps.

244
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,200
I mean, there was a really good hacker news thread with a lot of stuff.

245
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,760
But one comment that really stood out to me was mobile

246
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,349
apps are the industry's current way of avoiding app blockers.

247
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,640
That's probably fair

248
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,770
because more and more people are browsing.

249
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,489
Like I've been browsing on the desktop with mobile ad blockers for

250
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,520
like a decade because just the web is cancerous without it.

251
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,940
Like literally you will get infected, your computer will get infected.

252
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,489
And on mobile, I've kind of tolerated the ad experience a bit.

253
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,570
But like every time I, you know, read the news outside of like the CBC, it's just like,

254
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,539
oh my, like I go to, you know, reddit and

255
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,059
some like normal

256
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,140
American news site and I'm just like, what is all this like,

257
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,780
you know, what,

258
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:49,179
you know what I've done actually is so I recently

259
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,059
got an iphone which is a story in itself,

260
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,020
but there is a browser you can get for I OS called Duck Duck Go.

261
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:59,289
And it obviously is heavily tied in with the Duck Duck Go

262
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:02,500
ecosystem, but it is phenomenal and it blocks ads by default.

263
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,460
Well,

264
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:06,179
I don't honestly do a lot of web surfing on what

265
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,669
would be kind of considered normal people websites on my phone.

266
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,770
Like I tend to just, you know,

267
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,109
stick to some new sites that are boring with not a lot of advertising anyways.

268
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,440
So what's interesting is number one Apple is refusing

269
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,900
to implement these API S and people are like,

270
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,609
oh, what about opt in?

271
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,409
And the response is, you know, like everybody

272
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,419
like their mom will be like, oh yeah, click to allow, sure.

273
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,010
Like people always click to allow. I literally, oh, what was I just doing?

274
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,820
I was just at some website and it's like I want to send you notifications and I'm like,

275
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,239
-- no,
-- those are a nightmare.

276
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,479
And my, every time I go and help my parents fix their computer,

277
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,840
I have to go in and look at all the websites they click,

278
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,599
allow notifications from and I disable them all.

279
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,590
So

280
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,039
yeah, I mean, and and oh, here's a good one.

281
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,570
So for example,

282
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,739
chrome allows silent enumeration of USB devices attached to your computer.

283
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,109
Why? Because that's in the spec, it's in the spec, right?

284
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:55,400
Like if you allow access to the USB devices obviously as a programmer,

285
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,359
you're going to allow people to like basically do a

286
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,979
directory listing equivalent of like what's attached to this computer,

287
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,419
like, does this user have the specific key?

288
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:06,340
Well, a perfect example. Oh, what's that stupid mouse vendor? I'm totally buy

289
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:06,530
it.

290
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,570
They had like a really goofy logo. Anyways, to

291
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:09,533
use the mouse,

292
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,872
you have to use an application that's connected to the internet to set it up.

293
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:14,172
This is stupid.

294
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,612
Well, and ostensibly the,

295
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,572
the reason is so that you can like save

296
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,132
profiles and stuff for like professional Starcraft players.

297
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:22,312
You know, have their key maps laid out and stuff. Razor.

298
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:24,742
That's the one, the Razor mice and keyboards.

299
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:29,632
Basically, they don't work well or if at all, unless you have like an application,

300
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:33,072
the Razor application running on your desktop connected to the internet.

301
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:33,732
So like, honestly,

302
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,666
I used to have a really nice Razor gaming mouse that

303
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,856
I loved because it had 12 programmable buttons on the site.

304
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,515
So I had them programmed to do a whole bunch of stuff, like go to next tab,

305
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,276
go to previous tab, close a tab, you know, for web browsing, it was nice.

306
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,366
The app was way too intrusive and didn't work that well

307
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,635
and had to be connected to the internet to work properly.

308
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:52,786
And so I ditched on it. It's so dumb. Well, people keep buying these things

309
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:58,765
anyway. So it boils down to, yeah, these are definitely from a privacy point of view,

310
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,849
especially taken in total.

311
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,960
You know, these 16 web API S definitely allow somebody to, like,

312
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,409
really narrow down who you are and like, where you are.

313
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,739
Because I,

314
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,719
one thing I didn't realize the world's magnetic field

315
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,440
is not at all what you'd call uniform.

316
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,070
And I didn't realize, like I knew the North Pole kind of wandered,

317
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,505
but apparently it's one wondering several 100 yards a year.

318
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,515
-- And
-- not only that, your local geography dictates.

319
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,724
-- Well,
-- your local structure, if you're living in a steel frame building, probably,

320
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:26,734
I, I bet they didn't

321
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:28,544
-- DeLoss it when they built it.
-- Of course not.

322
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:33,775
If you can look up the magnetic field, what it looks like where you live and it's not,

323
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:34,835
it's not north.

324
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,739
Anyway. Anyway, did you set a timer? We've been talking about this for a long time.

325
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,539
We got two more minutes. But

326
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,179
the favorite thing and here's where it kind of gets

327
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,590
really interesting is somebody pointed out that app like,

328
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,729
so let's put it bluntly, companies like Facebook and Google

329
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,299
are predicated on advertising to you and advertising to you

330
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:57,465
is based on giving the advertisers a lot of information about you either directly

331
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,835
or indirectly in saying that we can, like

332
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,854
you want to advertise to left-handed males who play Starcraft

333
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,364
on Thursdays between the hours of three and 7 p.m.

334
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,184
Yes, we have that market segment,

335
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,140
um,

336
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,700
or flat out, you know,

337
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,130
the way a broker networks work now is when you click on a web page,

338
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,950
they generate a bunch of info about you.

339
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,479
Like your IP address, your browser blah, blah, blah, attach that to the request.

340
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:21,919
It goes to these, these uh essentially ad broker sites,

341
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:25,320
you know that then bid on it like, oh, I, I really want to advertise to Josh,

342
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,299
I'll pay $7 to show him this ad for a new bicycle.

343
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:33,739
And so Apple can't sort of directly go against Facebook and Google, you know,

344
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,445
for both legal and kind of technical reasons.

345
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,205
But what they can do is champion privacy

346
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:41,385
and basically got their business model and I'm ok with that.

347
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:41,965
I think,

348
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:44,815
-- I
-- think there's a moral question here that I think

349
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,794
is strange is if Apple becomes a champion of privacy,

350
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,494
which I totally would approve of.

351
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:51,744
-- And I like,
-- well, somebody has to champion privacy.

352
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:56,684
-- Well,
-- but it also means privacy becomes a feature of the rich. You know what I mean?

353
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,965
Because let's face it, Apple Gear is expensive,

354
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:02,794
having privacy and having confidentiality has always been

355
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:07,830
-- something for people with money.
-- I don't think you're wrong, but I think it is

356
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:12,000
-- exacerbated in today's world.
-- Oh, absolutely.

357
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,619
It's much worse than the class divides.

358
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,179
And somebody pointed out because I was kind of, you know,

359
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,590
I was always one of those people I believe strongly in privacy.

360
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:22,140
But if you'd asked me why is privacy so important, I would have been like,

361
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,390
because it's good.

362
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,710
But a friend of mine who's smarter than I pointed out. You cannot have.

363
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,340
Ok. Well, I'm going to finish this up. You cannot,

364
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:36,250
you cannot have social change without people going against the grain.

365
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,960
And that has to be able

366
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,590
to start in private.

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,020
Yeah, I, I agree with that completely. That's a really good point.

368
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm like, oh, yeah.

369
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,679
No, that, yeah, because things like letting women vote or, you know,

370
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,659
letting everybody over the age of 18 vote regardless of, you know,

371
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:52,940
skin tone or whatever.

372
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah, these things happen because people could discuss this in private.

373
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,159
Had they been forced to start this movement in public? Well, the established

374
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,580
entrenched forces would have squished them.

375
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,859
Yeah, that, that's a good point actually. That's, I never thought of it that way.

376
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,856
-- That's why privacy is important.
-- I like it.

377
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:08,177
Yeah,

378
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:13,596
-- that makes sense.
-- I really hope Apple holds the line on this one because I get why

379
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,697
websites would want these things to make full featured apps.

380
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:19,706
-- But at the same time and from a privacy point of view. Ouch.
-- Yeah. All right.

381
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:20,916
What's, what's the last one?

382
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:25,956
-- So
-- the last one, it's been around for a while and, but it's sort of finally, you know,

383
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:31,666
being enforced and this is Apple is enforcing notarization of applications.

384
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:33,763
And so it was sort of initially noticed,

385
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,693
I think one or two Mac Os updates ago where somebody was like, hey, you know,

386
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:40,633
when I start a script on my laptop, my laptop like stalls out for a few seconds.

387
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:42,533
And then the second time I run the script, it runs fine.

388
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,174
Like, what,

389
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:46,124
what's the deal you and the deal is your computer is making

390
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:49,124
a hash of that binary and sending it back to Apple,

391
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,533
you know, and getting a reply.

392
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:55,013
Ok. So there's two sides to this that I have thoughts on.

393
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:58,213
There's the concept of signed binaries

394
00:16:58,721 --> 00:16:59,000
and

395
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,830
-- computer security. It,
-- it totally did. It's not new.

396
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,070
And in fact, in the new Os X, which is what Catalina, I think it was, they enforce it

397
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,349
-- versus in the past they did not,
-- well, they don't

398
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,951
enforce it, enforce it.

399
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:19,630
They, they force the system to do it but it doesn't like block stuff,

400
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,510
-- does
-- it,

401
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,470
the bar was raised,

402
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:22,869
we'll say,

403
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,290
and

404
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,390
I'm not opposed to that.

405
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,069
It's not going to stop Attackers necessarily,

406
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,689
but it's definitely a defense in depth move in a lot of ways.

407
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:34,410
Now.

408
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,569
Apple check something,

409
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,010
anything I run

410
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,560
and phoning home with it.

411
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,109
I,

412
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,890
and we weren't really, I don't remember a pop up asking me for permission on that.

413
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:45,849
It's,

414
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,880
you can make a lot of arguments you can say, oh, it's just a half.

415
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,500
Well, and for all we know, I, I don't,

416
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,540
I haven't looked into it but they may be anonyms

417
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,770
it like they did for the iphone location stuff.

418
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,000
Remember that whole thing with the iphone location thing.

419
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,119
And it turns out they actually did a lot of work to ensure

420
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,359
that it's anonymized and safe and secure as much as it can be.

421
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,920
And, and whether it is or isn't,

422
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,969
I think is even less important because let's say they know it's me

423
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,920
and

424
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,479
they know what I'm running.

425
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,790
It's the fact that they didn't tell me they're doing it,

426
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,709
I think is the bigger problem.

427
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,650
They technically did tell people they were doing it like in,

428
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,420
through their developer channels and stuff like they announced this, you know,

429
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,380
over a year ago.

430
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,219
But the reality is like, I don't pay attention to the developer channels for so

431
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:31,079
like,

432
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:31,959
yeah, exactly.

433
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,839
And apparently most companies don't either because a

434
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,150
lot of them are complaining that like this

435
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,709
-- stuff broke their apps.
-- This is like ebay port scanning your machine.

436
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,660
And then everyone's saying, oh, but

437
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,859
the browsers have had this forever.

438
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:49,209
It's in the, it's in like section 57 of the license of the terms of service agreement.

439
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,099
Like they may have had this feature,

440
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,810
we didn't know about this feature and now we all

441
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,280
think this feature is stupid because it's being abused.

442
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,640
And so anyway, anyway,

443
00:18:57,229 --> 00:19:01,130
my my take on this with Apple is that

444
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm not necessarily opposed to this behavior because

445
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,170
I think there can be some benefits to

446
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,449
essentially maintaining some sort of functional registry of known bad stuff.

447
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,810
Phoning at home.

448
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,130
I'm not as big of a fan of necessarily and not telling me

449
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm not a big fan of either. And so this is a fine line

450
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:27,420
for sure that I think Apple probably took one step in the wrong direction.

451
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,229
Well, and, and the other thing too is to consider the longer term effects of, well,

452
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,229
you can sort of avoid all this by getting a proper

453
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,910
Apple developer account and code signing and blah blah blah,

454
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,270
which you know, basically by embracing and join

455
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,369
the Apple ecosystem fully, you can avoid this, you know,

456
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,109
so all you got to do to avoid this is just totally come in house.

457
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,170
That's ridiculous. Like I, I get what they're doing and why they're doing it.

458
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,040
But at the same time, yeah, it's kind of like, well,

459
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,380
you and I come from the Linux world where

460
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,709
it's completely normal to go download random source code,

461
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,849
compile it and use it

462
00:19:55,959 --> 00:20:00,250
-- because like 20 years ago that that's how it worked.
-- It's still pretty normal.

463
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:01,530
Have you,

464
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,430
you know, I was running like slacker 1.1 which great distribution, you know,

465
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:08,130
Patrick Folker thing, man, that dude's a machine.

466
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,329
He's still doing it, man.

467
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:13,170
I know blows my mind but you know, he can't package everything I want. And so

468
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,839
yeah, you know, like my favorite Irc client had to, you know,

469
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,319
download and compile from source and get the extensions and all that stuff.

470
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,660
So yeah, I don't know, like, but on the other hand,

471
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,459
there's the part of me that for example, I kind of prefer

472
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,719
my mobile devices because the way apps install and

473
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,430
get removed is much cleaner and less hassle.

474
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,800
And I don't have to worry about, you know,

475
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,180
some mobile app completely pooping all over my system and compromising it,

476
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,599
you know, whereas every time I run like

477
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,189
or what, what is it like pip, like when I run pip and it's like, oh yeah,

478
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,209
I want to install this to the system so I can use it properly,

479
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,030
which means I have to run it with pseudo which means like

480
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,180
-- man, I hope that pip code's OK.
-- I don't do that with Python.

481
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:52,750
-- Python supports virtual environments.
-- Yeah, I know I need to set that up.

482
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,150
You totally need to use those because it's life changing and then you don't have

483
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,119
to ever worry about installing trash because

484
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,380
you just whatever the virtual environments broken,

485
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,550
I delete it and start again

486
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,699
virtual and has been on my to do list forever.

487
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:08,510
But the point is I'm also a lazy normal human being sometimes which means pseudo

488
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,900
space block. It worked. I'm done. I'm moving on.

489
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:14,660
You brought us to where I was going to hopefully

490
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,739
slowly nudge this conversation is that I think focusing on whitelisting

491
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,959
and taking hashes of your binaries

492
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,619
is a lost cause

493
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,339
because it is very common, for example, in the malware universe to just, you know,

494
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,869
all you have to do is add a couple bites

495
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,069
to the end of your binary and now it's different.

496
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,619
So

497
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,459
the thing is those, for example,

498
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,310
this will give Apple a much better idea

499
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,829
of stuff distributed through their store that is,

500
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,349
and is not causing problems more to the point.

501
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,349
Yeah. Against like an APT

502
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:49,400
style attacker who, well, we just had this happen at the cloud security line.

503
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,699
Somebody emailed like all of us an Excel file that had a different name

504
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,069
and different contents like the hashes were all different,

505
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,819
but it was the same Trojan.

506
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:02,459
Sure. So shockingly, Google didn't catch it. But anyways, I'm not shocked at all.

507
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:03,689
Two of the scanners on virus total.

508
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,564
But uh anyways,

509
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,324
the point is the majority of us aren't dealing with that we're dealing with,

510
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:10,295
you know, somebody who compromises, for example,

511
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:14,314
like uh whatever random text editor you use that's popular, you know,

512
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,255
like Notepad plus plus or Adam or something, you know,

513
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:19,364
somebody gets into their DEV process or something and put something nasty in.

514
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,625
Well, now this gives you a way to more easily detect and block that,

515
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:23,449
you know.

516
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:23,770
So it's,

517
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,020
it's basically the doing stuff at scale where

518
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,130
the supplies and it works quite well there.

519
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,569
All right. So here's my counter argument to that. Nothing you said is wrong,

520
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,750
but it is functionally ineffective and has basically never really worked.

521
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,489
Whereas things like containment

522
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,290
have sandbox applications works and is effective.

523
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,449
But you can't make developers sandbox their stuff.

524
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,849
You don't make the developers,

525
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,405
you build this functionality into the operating system.

526
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:50,984
You were just talking about

527
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:51,984
apps

528
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,645
and how apps work.

529
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,224
I mean, that that is,

530
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,655
-- I think more effective
-- well, and funnily enough,

531
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:59,505
that's where Apple's headed clearly with, you know,

532
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:02,265
it's good looking at their new arm based

533
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,305
laptops and developer kit.

534
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:10,214
I'm assuming that the next like when the new arm based Apple laptop thing comes out,

535
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,214
which apparently

536
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,359
has shockingly good performance even with completely, you know, on the fly,

537
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,540
translated binaries to X 80 or from X 86 to arm or whatever.

538
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,650
But I assume

539
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:23,699
at some point in the near, near like one or two years future with Apple,

540
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,130
I'm going to be able to run all my mobile apps on my desktop.

541
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,800
-- Like assuming I have new the newer arm hardware,
-- maybe whatever, who cares?

542
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,489
That's boring.

543
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,630
Well, honestly, that's kind of what I want because you know,

544
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,359
I have a bunch of mobile apps that I use where on my desktop,

545
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:36,729
I have to use the website and it's just like uh

546
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:39,530
it would be nicer just to have the consistent experience.

547
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:44,329
But even then if you're using your web browser, all the web browsers use sandboxes.

548
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,900
Well, but for example Slack,

549
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,339
I use the Slack desktop app because honestly the Slack web app kind of

550
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:53,869
-- blows
-- whatever the web app and the desktop app are functionally the same.

551
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,469
But their,

552
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,989
their desktop app is a Turd man.

553
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,150
Yeah, and the mobile app is actually not that terrible.

554
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,280
The other thing I'm thinking is like the mobile apps

555
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,489
running on my phone are running on way less hardware

556
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,199
compared to like these desktop apps and yet

557
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:09,290
performance and usability seems about the same.

558
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,160
So quite honestly, I,

559
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,599
I feel like my computer would be a lot

560
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:15,180
faster running mobile apps than these huge electron monstrosities,

561
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:15,540
right?

562
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,060
All of the desktop apps are just basically web browsers

563
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:22,099
plus all the other crap shoveled together and held it.

564
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:26,020
You know, you've tied it up as best as you can with some bailing wire.

565
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,859
It's,

566
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,619
it's a, it's a total map.

567
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:33,208
I like that Apple is I think pretty clearly headed towards this actual,

568
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,598
I hate to use the word convergence

569
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:37,517
of the desktop and mobile space,

570
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,498
but kind of with the best of both still being allowed like

571
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,628
it sounds like you'll still be able to run your full fat,

572
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:43,958
you know, Microsoft Office or?

573
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:43,998
Oh,

574
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:47,287
what are those productivity apps that all the content creators use the Adobe stuff?

575
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,557
Adobe Suite, whatever it's called?

576
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,498
Yeah, there's like illustrator and photos

577
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:51,527
and

578
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,605
all that video editing stuff and whatnot.

579
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:58,215
And at the same time, have all your mobile apps or if you want the desktop app,

580
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:01,255
I can't help but feel like this is the future because to put it bluntly,

581
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:04,296
if I had to pick one device, it'd be my phone hands down, right?

582
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:07,676
Because it's always, it's actually with me like I actually have it like, yeah,

583
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,215
it would be nicer to have a faster computer.

584
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:11,495
But the computer I have is the best computer. Right.

585
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:12,936
And I always have my phone with me.

586
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:18,255
I hate when people say things like this because that is a, you can't make a reason,

587
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:19,154
argument.

588
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:22,144
It's like saying, if you could only have one tool out of your toolbox,

589
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:22,774
what would it be?

590
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:23,244
And it's like

591
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:25,673
that doesn't make sense because

592
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:30,274
-- hammers and screwdrivers, they're not the same in any universe.
-- True.

593
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:32,524
But my phone has like, I've owned now what,

594
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,994
three or four iphones and they've gotten a lot better.

595
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,053
-- Of course,
-- they've gotten better.

596
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:38,333
-- All the technology has gotten better,
-- you know, and well,

597
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:41,484
compared to my flip phones and my Motorola eraser, like, holy,

598
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:45,612
like, look, man, write a document, a long document on your phone.

599
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,572
No, that's ridiculous. You need a keyboard.

600
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,911
-- Yeah, I can talk to a Bluetooth keyboard.
-- Oh, whatever.

601
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:53,271
-- Kurt, you're splitting here.
-- I'm sitting on a Bluetooth keyboard with my desktop.

602
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,962
Exact same keyboard can talk to my phone

603
00:25:56,072 --> 00:26:01,131
as soon as you hook up keyboards and mice to a phone. It's not a phone anymore.

604
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:04,511
-- That's my argument.
-- That's exactly it. The phone is not a phone anymore.

605
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,271
It's a small computer that fits in my pocket.

606
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,852
-- That's my point.
-- Anyway,

607
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:12,500
anyway, I would love to, I want to see you do some development on your phone.

608
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:17,130
-- That's what I want to see.
-- I've actually, well, I've done full operation stuff like

609
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:18,020
Aws and Ss

610
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,430
Hing into servers to fix them on my phone without a keyboard.

611
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,310
-- I want to see some, no js development on that phone.
-- No, I'm a Python guy.

612
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:25,689
Whatever.

613
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:27,869
-- Python's fine. It's all the same.
-- I guess

614
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:32,589
what it boils down to for me is that the enemy of my enemy is friend

615
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,550
ish. And I definitely hate Facebook a lot more than I hate Apple.

616
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,949
I, I would, I would not structure it in that way.

617
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,869
I think here's how I've been thinking about this.

618
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,680
So you've got these companies and we, we talked about this.

619
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:46,310
There's an episode in the past where we basically discuss

620
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,699
the fact that

621
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,430
all this data

622
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,949
people like Facebook and Google have on us is, is like nuclear waste

623
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,530
where it's a mess.

624
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,430
And

625
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,709
I think Cory Doctorow has a comment where he compares it

626
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,339
to having like a pile of oily rags in the garage.

627
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,339
Their business model

628
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,729
was built up based upon this whole, oh,

629
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:10,000
we get all this cool stuff for free and they're just

630
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,869
going to take a little bit of my data or whatever.

631
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,339
It's fine, but it's like anything where it's never enough in.

632
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,260
And I think this is just human nature of

633
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,300
I want a little more or a little more, a little more.

634
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,140
And like my comparison is always, I started,

635
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:27,420
you know, playing with SDRS for fun and now I'm trying to buy a satellite dish, right?

636
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,569
Like it's always a little more which I haven't found my,

637
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,420
my price is free functionally.

638
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,739
But,

639
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,180
um,

640
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:37,020
you know, you get the idea is I think it's, it's just human nature to, oh,

641
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,729
just a little more, a little more, a little more.

642
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,300
-- And before you know it, you know, you're,
-- oh,

643
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,550
I've consistently noticed more and more apps.

644
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,410
I get the warning. You know, this app wants to use your location. Always.

645
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,380
Do you want to allow it always only during use or never?

646
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,250
And I'm kind of like, never like

647
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:53,839
the Starbucks app I get but officially, you know, oh,

648
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,339
so I can find the nearest Starbucks easily.

649
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:57,859
But yeah, whatever. Yeah, that's

650
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,680
-- not what they're doing with it anyway.
-- Anyway. So, so here's my point. I think

651
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,459
it's, it's a false dichotomy because

652
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,349
this business model these companies created is now growing out

653
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,510
of control to the point we're even noticing it,

654
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,819
which means it's way worse than we can imagine.

655
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,810
That's the thing you always have to remember is

656
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,859
anything we see is it's the iceberg effect.

657
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:22,339
Now, you look at Apple and I don't even view it as like the enemy of my enemy

658
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:25,916
rather, I'm Apple's customer. I'm not Apple's product.

659
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:29,036
So it's in Apple's best interest to do things that are good for me.

660
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:32,196
It's in Google's best interest to do things that's good for their customers,

661
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:35,765
-- which is functionally the advertisers and
-- even worse than that for Google,

662
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:39,276
like they have tried to transition out of, you know, being what is it?

663
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:41,546
Like, 90 something percent of their profit comes from adss.

664
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:45,531
Very few companies have ever successfully transitioned business models

665
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:49,552
-- and I don't see a reason to believe they're special in any way.
-- Well, exactly.

666
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,991
And same with Facebook. There's no way Facebook is going to, like, Facebook has.

667
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:53,722
Good Lord.

668
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,452
How many things have they tried that are supposed to make a ton of money that have,

669
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,281
you know, flopped.

670
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:01,881
-- I don't know. I got, I got faith in Libra. Right.
-- There you go, man.

671
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:02,371
Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:03,092
Libra.

673
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:03,819
Yeah.

674
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,689
So I maybe that's what it boils down to is we're actually Apple's customer,

675
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:09,540
not the advertisers, not the app makers,

676
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,750
-- not the developers and it definitely costs
-- more.

677
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,400
It does. Well, sort of, I mean, I'll end on the story of why I have an iphone now. And

678
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,380
so anyone who knows me knows,

679
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,530
like I have been incredibly critical of Apple pretty much forever.

680
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,329
And

681
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,979
there's a variety of reasons both founded and unfounded for that,

682
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:29,069
that attitude I have.

683
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,670
But functionally I bought a Google pixel two

684
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,790
phone some basically shortly after it came out and

685
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,229
that phone is only getting proper support for three years,

686
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:43,359
which is like basically the bare minimum Google offers on phones.

687
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:45,250
And then there it's getting brutally murdered.

688
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,689
This really upset me a great deal because there's nothing wrong with my phone.

689
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:52,170
And that's assuming you also bought the phone day one when it came out

690
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,670
-- and I didn't
-- I bought it like two months after it came out,

691
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,609
whatever, close enough.

692
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:55,869
Right.

693
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,729
But basically I have this phone that's pretty much only working for,

694
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:00,729
for three years.

695
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,920
And my daughter has an iphone six that's still freaking supported.

696
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,050
Well, dude, my kids, I gave them iphone fives and it's getting updates from Apple,

697
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,979
-- but
-- the iphone five is end of life.

698
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:15,329
-- Right. That doesn't count.
-- Yes. Oh, it is. But it's been out for like a

699
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:19,780
-- long time and that's,
-- and, and that's just it. Right. So Apple devices

700
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,589
are currently getting a lifespan of five plus years.

701
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:27,800
And that's becoming very important to me is the fact that like the fact that

702
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,510
your people are throwing this stuff away every couple of years is frustrating to me.

703
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,869
There's nothing wrong with my pixel phone except Google tells me it dies in October.

704
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,469
The five S was released seven years ago.

705
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,300
Yeah, whatever the five S is six fired.

706
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,420
I don't care about the five S, the six S is actually still supported.

707
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,819
It was released in 2015.

708
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:48,339
You're talking five years of support and then some, and it's still going,

709
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,310
that is

710
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,819
amazing to me.

711
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,780
And that is what I want. I don't want to keep throwing things out constantly.

712
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,219
There's no reason to do that.

713
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,380
Oh, I agree completely because I'm now clearly at the point where, you know,

714
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,839
like pants, the phones are, you know,

715
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:02,579
I'm going to get a new phone and then there's going to be that,

716
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,489
you know, crab shell effect going down the line with my kids.

717
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,030
Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

718
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,790
And, yeah, I bought the iphone Se Two, which is their, their new phone,

719
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,709
the cheap phone.

720
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:17,189
It was like 400 bucks, I think. And I'm pleased with it.

721
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:20,030
I would say there's nothing drastically different

722
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,229
about my life having switched phones,

723
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,849
which also shocked me a little bit.

724
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,430
I just want to comment like iphone, the five

725
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:29,234
is still supported. Like the last security update was a few weeks ago.

726
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah, Iowa is 12.4 0.7. Like it's still getting security updates. That's

727
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,944
my point. Right. Yeah, exactly.

728
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,785
So like every two or three weeks I update all the I devices

729
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,944
in the house and it eats up a couple gigs of bandwidth.

730
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,905
But yeah, I mean, compared to that, yeah,

731
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:45,145
I bought one Android phone and I just hate it because it's just,

732
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:48,219
yeah, it's so not properly supported.

733
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,479
-- But
-- again, we're talking about an ecosystem where you're the product,

734
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,040
you're not the customer.

735
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,319
And I think it's really starting to show

736
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:01,489
the more I just pay attention to what's happening in the universe around me. Yep.

737
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,619
So, all right. There we go.

738
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,270
We talked about Apple and the open source security podcast. Again,

739
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:10,984
-- it's not the first time it will be the last
-- looking at Microsoft and Apple.

740
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:13,104
It's clear that open source one and they've embraced it.

741
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:18,064
Open source is everything is open source. I always, I always love that when I read

742
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:23,145
a, some report saying, 0 97% of businesses are using open source.

743
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,084
It's like, no, it's 100 it's just 3% don't know what's going on.

744
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,305
-- They
-- don't have licensing compliance. Yeah. Right.

745
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:28,944
Anyway,

746
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:31,689
