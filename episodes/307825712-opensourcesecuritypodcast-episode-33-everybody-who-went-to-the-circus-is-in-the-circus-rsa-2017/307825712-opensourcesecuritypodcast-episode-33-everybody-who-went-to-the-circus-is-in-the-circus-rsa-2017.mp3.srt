Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 33 with myself,

1
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,090
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,659
-- Kurt. You always say my name. Come on, man, we're face to
-- face.

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,780
-- I gave you the,
-- it's actually very exciting.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,729
So we have never been in the same place at the same time while we recorded the podcast.

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,389
So that's very exciting. And, and why are we at the same place at the same time?

6
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,559
-- Kurt, we are the amazing extravaganza that is RS A 2000
-- 17.

7
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,090
I don't know if extravaganza is the right word, but this place is a zoo.

8
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:34,900
I'll admit that.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,240
-- Oh, I
-- mean, basically, it's 40,000 people that are like us,

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,860
which to me makes it a

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,450
it's ridiculous.

12
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,830
It's like the circus came to town and everybody

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,069
went to the circus was already in the circus.

14
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,909
That is the best description I think I've ever heard.

15
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:53,750
But so we are standing here at RS A at the end of the day

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,900
and both of us just finished our sessions.

17
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,349
-- And so why don't we, why don't we talk about it?
-- Sure.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,669
-- You want to go first,
-- Josh, I would love to go first.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,580
So I did a session, a peer to peer session about managing your open source.

20
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,099
And so what that

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,500
is, the room holds 25.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,860
And so it fills up with people. And then we have a very quite frank discussion about

23
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:17,970
in my case, the topic of managing your open source software

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,900
and what that means for each organization. And of course, as you can imagine,

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,419
there's no set agenda.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,500
People come in, we start talking and then we decide what do we want to talk about.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,830
And the best part is

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,379
people discuss these things with one another as it goes on, which is fantastic,

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,250
especially kind of from my point of view because

30
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,730
I get to sit there and essentially let other people do all the hard work, right?

31
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,569
Which is the best part by far.

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,010
But no, I mean, I mean, in all seriousness, they were fantastic and funny enough.

33
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,849
So I was not expecting this, but licensing

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,290
was a really big topic that kept coming up over and over again,

35
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:52,830
right?

36
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,129
So I'm curious when you say I,

37
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:58,389
I'm assuming these are people consuming open source projects, libraries code

38
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,569
and they're worried about the licensing

39
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,580
being some sort of problem with cross

40
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,349
contamination or how they ship their products.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,669
So that's part of it. But also the fact that

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,039
a lot of organizations didn't realize that open source has a lot of licenses

43
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,050
and it doesn't just mean free software right there.

44
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,169
Are actual responsibilities that come with some of this stuff.

45
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:21,179
And so that's what really made it interesting.

46
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,869
And in fact, more than one person you could tell was

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,100
we say a bit upset by the fact that they were going to have to

48
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,789
go and start talking to lawyers when they got back to work on Monday.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,580
Yeah,

50
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,699
I'm guessing a lot of these people haven't actually read the

51
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,789
open source licenses of the stuff they're shipping in some cases.

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,899
Nobody reads. Right. And it's like terms of service.

53
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,460
I mean, how many times do you just click? Agree.

54
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, and two, I mean, who enforces this stuff? Right.

55
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,600
There's only literally a handful of cases where somebody's

56
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,660
actually gone and legally enforced an open source license.

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,610
Yeah,

58
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,199
I

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,699
can only

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,029
-- think
-- of

61
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:55,179
one,

62
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:55,910
to be

63
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,860
-- honest,
-- there's been a handful of them and in fact, there's a

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,250
Bradley Coon, I believe his name is. He's a fellow I met some years back he worked for,

65
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,419
oh, I don't even remember the name of the organization now, but essentially

66
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:12,190
they were, their job was to enforce

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,240
GP L against a handful of open source projects.

68
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,949
And the big one being Busy Box. Right.

69
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,220
Because Busy Box is used all over the place in these days when you buy a product.

70
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,410
It is not uncommon for there to be the GP L

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,779
in the back of the book or maybe in the menu or wherever that talks about this. And

72
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,460
you know, five or 10 years ago, that was not the case.

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,645
And so these guys were one of the groups that really kind of

74
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:40,764
helped make that a thing where these large organizations started to realize,

75
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,845
you know, this isn't free code you just take and do whatever you want with.

76
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:49,565
There's actually a purpose behind this and that there's essentially the authors of

77
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,645
it had some sort of intent and that's why it carries this license.

78
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,115
So I'm curious, I hadn't really, uh

79
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,544
really ever given that thought to be honest.

80
00:03:57,554 --> 00:04:00,354
Um, because quite honestly I throw, whenever I buy a product,

81
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,125
I pretty much immediately throw the manual out.

82
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,600
-- Um,
-- you know, and it's really funny because, you know what I do, I look for the GP L.

83
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,610
-- That's the first thing I do in most instances.
-- And I,

84
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,080
I've honestly had one or two thoughts of like

85
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,800
requesting

86
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,988
the, so the open source software from the vendor.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,488
You know, actually, because I, I, it seems to me when I do see the GP L,

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,950
they do have that classic, like

89
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:23,709
write in,

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,730
send us an envelope and like we'll send you a CD burnt with the software or something

91
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,609
like they don't make it available on FTP dot food dot com.

92
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,649
You know, a lot of people do though, in all seriousness is,

93
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:38,059
well, I bought a Toyota car that has the fancy entertainment,

94
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,644
whatever screen thing that lets you hack the car

95
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,295
and in the menu.

96
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,684
It tells you how to acquire the source code if I want it.

97
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,535
No, I don't care. I just look for the GP L. Right.

98
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:49,614
I mean,

99
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:54,535
I don't really want to do any of this stuff and goodness knows if I started doing it,

100
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,575
I'm going to end up breaking my car.

101
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,515
Like that's the only inevitable outcome of this

102
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:01,325
-- journey
-- or on some sort of manufacturer's blacklist.

103
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,679
Don't sell this man a car.

104
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,480
Nothing would surprise me. I mean, in all seriousness, nothing would surprise me.

105
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,640
But I mean, another popular topic we had was how do you manage all of this stuff?

106
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:16,459
Like obviously you've got a scan for vulnerabilities, how many things are in there?

107
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,019
What's on it?

108
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,779
And actually there was some really good discussions

109
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,540
people had around kind of internal white lists

110
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,989
saying these are the open source libraries

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,510
and projects that the security team approves.

112
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,470
We vetted them, we made sure they're ok.

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,049
We looked for security flaws and, and you know, yada yada

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,260
yada

115
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,480
kind of the whole nine yards. And I was

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,279
impressed by the number of people there that had what

117
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,910
sounded like very mature programs based around this whole concept.

118
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,820
Cool. Uh One thing I'm wondering

119
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,959
how many libraries on average are these people using?

120
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,739
-- Is it like one or two or is it 100?
-- It's in the hundreds without question in effect.

121
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,500
So uh Black Doug actually just published a paper about a month ago.

122
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,070
I think it was talking about open source use in the enterprise.

123
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,829
And one of their findings was that your typical project or,

124
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,510
or product or whatever you wanna call it has

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,540
on average about 100 dependencies on other things.

126
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,549
And you can imagine it's turtles all the way down

127
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,609
where, you know, your product might

128
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:11,529
100 dependencies.

129
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,679
But then one of those dependencies that's 100 dependencies

130
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,959
and so on and so on and so on.

131
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,750
And in fact, this was one of the things that came up was someone was saying that

132
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,220
they were using node and they did their N PM install and

133
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,869
it pulled in 200 dependencies and all of a sudden they,

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,070
they said, whoa, like, what's the deal here?

135
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,170
Where did all this crap come from? And that's totally legitimate. Right.

136
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,730
Well, I'd also be curious,

137
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:33,450
uh so how many of these people are building the software in a

138
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,700
way that actually records those automated dependency polls like node or maven or,

139
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,750
you know, all these modern systems that will just go

140
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,709
and grab whatever library is needed automatically.

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,350
It sounds like it is not happening very often.

142
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,309
And that's one of the things that was a topic that

143
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,649
came up over and over again as well is the fact that

144
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,500
how do you start recording this stuff?

145
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,070
How do you understand what is in the software and making sure that,

146
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,510
that people aren't even, you know,

147
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,119
maybe on purpose or accidentally including a whole

148
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,140
bunch of extra stuff nobody really knew about.

149
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,149
And now all of a sudden when it's time to release you take a look and it's like,

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,750
holy cow.

151
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,910
Where did all this stuff come from?

152
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:09,459
Yeah.

153
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:09,730
Well,

154
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:10,600
because I know there's also been the

155
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:12,640
problem with some libraries being taken offline

156
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,959
and all of a sudden then,

157
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,790
uh, what was it? That was that a note

158
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,369
shift? It was,

159
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,429
-- we talked about that as well.
-- It literally broke. I think

160
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,339
every

161
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,399
-- two thirds
-- of no, because everybody used it

162
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,190
and it was like a

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,119
-- fine library. I
-- think it was three,

164
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,640
which is just sad, but actually the thing that came up then as well.

165
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,049
And this is something that

166
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,600
I believe node is aware of, but I don't know exactly what's going on.

167
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,790
This is something I want to research.

168
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:44,119
Uh the fact that apparently someone just wrote a new one and put it in place.

169
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,369
And so there was no

170
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,359
kind of chain of command in that instance where one developer took it off.

171
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,359
A new one, basically unrelated, put it there and all of us

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,779
and it's like, whoa, you know, how,

173
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,179
how come people can just start changing this stuff without any sort of checks?

174
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,859
Well, it's actually a bit worse than that. I know in the Ruby Gems world

175
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,220
uh prior to Ruby gems.org sort of being the clear winner of the Ruby Gems ecosystem.

176
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,559
There was another site I can't remember the name of

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,579
and they ran into the situation of people would

178
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,299
have a popular ruby gem on that other site

179
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,859
uh say like uh calculation library

180
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,140
and somebody would then squat that name on Ruby gems.org.

181
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,540
And it wouldn't necessarily be nice code.

182
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,380
And the Ruby gems.org people didn't really want to be

183
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,700
like enforcing the name space and taking on all this,

184
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,779
you know, work

185
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,899
um

186
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,099
until it kind of got bad enough that they had to.

187
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,909
And so there's also those questions um because I know

188
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,780
there are definitely there's been uh instances of typo squatting,

189
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,940
you know, where people have created projects

190
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,099
with a name

191
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,630
that is remarkably similar to a popular project and all you

192
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,299
need is a typo and you're sucking in their code,

193
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,229
right? Oh, yeah, that guy did research on that. I forget, I forget what it was.

194
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:56,630
I, I'll find it and I'll put it in the show notes because that was fascinating

195
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,710
and he had people from like the,

196
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:02,109
the department of Defense had installed his fake library

197
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,359
by the time he was done, which is, is horrifying to think about in all seriousness.

198
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:10,369
Well, I think it's uh uh fundamentally a lot of this is Black Magic.

199
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,919
I mean, it just, just the act of getting software to compile

200
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,400
can be, you know, very much a nontrivial task, right?

201
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,359
If you, if you've been in the open source world,

202
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:20,820
you, you know what we're talking about.

203
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,760
Um There's those whole magic build chains where, you know,

204
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,869
you have to have a specific library or a specific configuration or Lord knows what.

205
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,679
And, um, you know, so when things build

206
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,099
nine times out of 10, we're real happy about that

207
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,520
and,

208
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,919
you know,

209
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,119
asking somebody to create a build system that's completely offline so that they

210
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,280
know exactly what's going into it and can prove what's going into it.

211
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,880
-- That's a lot
-- of work. Oh, absolutely. You have to build the ships. Right.

212
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,119
-- Yeah.
-- Until left shift disappears. Right.

213
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,909
Right. Yeah, seriously. Oh, man.

214
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,049
No, it, it was great though.

215
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,609
The, these folks really, they understood a lot of the problems and fundamentally,

216
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,400
I think

217
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,960
the consensus that we all came to was the fact that

218
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:02,409
there are tools that can start helping address some of this.

219
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,789
What is the open source in your infrastructure?

220
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:05,429
But

221
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,460
they're not quite there yet. And I think if you kind of go out on the floor here,

222
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:12,049
there's a bunch of vendors that can scan your

223
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,229
software and they can look for various things and

224
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,039
they aren't going to tell you that it's perfect, but

225
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,609
obviously it's a good start.

226
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,039
And in fact, one of the topics that came up as well was somebody said, well,

227
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,809
why should I buy this tool?

228
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,520
Why don't I just hire some developers to kind of manually audit all this stuff?

229
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,270
And then

230
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,320
we started discussing what that really means and you're talking about, you know,

231
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,400
probably millions of lines of code and hundreds

232
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,400
to thousands of open source projects included.

233
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,750
And they, they quickly realized that

234
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,580
this is probably something we want a tool for.

235
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,599
This isn't something we're gonna hire out for.

236
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,169
Yeah.

237
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,940
Well, and I've also encountered even in the open source world,

238
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,640
a lot of cases where people embed,

239
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,679
uh, the common ones are Gzip

240
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,789
expat and Lib XML.

241
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,090
So that it will compile on windows cleanly

242
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:00,309
without forcing somebody to pull in some dependency or

243
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,359
-- deal with it. Basically, it's just they embed a copy and bam it works.
-- Yeah.

244
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:08,849
Well, I, I wrote a blog post about this a couple of weeks ago actually was Z li

245
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,390
was kind of the wake up call for the Linux distributions back in.

246
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,659
Was it like 04 or something? Maybe even before then?

247
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,099
But essentially, so the story is a long time ago,

248
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:23,750
basically, every application embedded its own copy of Z.

249
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,349
And then one day a security flaw was found in Z

250
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:27,900
lib

251
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,440
that meant these Linux distributions had to rev

252
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,619
hundreds of packages to fix one security flaw.

253
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,219
And of course,

254
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,869
the correct solution was to start using the Z

255
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,119
lib library instead of embedding your own copies.

256
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,219
But I guess ironically now with things like containers

257
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:46,440
and kind of the way development is going again,

258
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,580
we're moving back in the direction of just including copies of this stuff.

259
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,000
And

260
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,559
I'm not going to say we're doomed because that would be foolish.

261
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,219
But I think this time around the solution isn't

262
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:59,700
going to be kind of that dynamic linking,

263
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,679
let's pull it all out.

264
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,349
But rather it's going to be things like continuous integration and tooling

265
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:08,950
that are going to solve this because right now if there is a serious problem,

266
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,789
well, I mean, they kind of have been but you know, if there was like a warm

267
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,460
flaw

268
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,020
that was going to really be a huge issue,

269
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,580
there are literally

270
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,299
probably thousands of containers out there that are all going to have to be updated.

271
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,090
And that's not something that's going to happen

272
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,460
in a couple of minutes. It's probably going to take months if ever.

273
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:27,210
Well,

274
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:29,900
and I think the continuous integration in the testing aspect is

275
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:33,020
even more important than because no matter what solution you have,

276
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:35,820
people will not use it unless they can be certain

277
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,859
-- that their software will continue working.
-- Yeah.

278
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:40,719
And actually funny enough that was another topic that came up as

279
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,440
well was the fact that one of the people there was saying,

280
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,719
you know, OK, so my developers are using this library,

281
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,719
but the library is changing constantly and it keeps breaking my stuff.

282
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,330
What is the solution to this? And of course,

283
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,750
there isn't a good answer.

284
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:57,846
But part of that story is things like continuous integration and lots of testing,

285
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,776
making sure you've got like regression testing and functional

286
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,927
testing and unit testing and all these things.

287
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:02,637
Because

288
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:06,406
the challenge isn't necessarily how do we avoid the breakage,

289
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:10,296
but rather let's find the breakage fast so we can deal with it instead of, you know,

290
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:11,646
hey, we're shipping in two hours.

291
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,206
Oh, crap, everything broke.

292
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:15,327
Well, and it's also too, I, you know,

293
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,046
I've been in situations like that and in some cases I've

294
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:20,807
stopped using that software because it was just too painful in that

295
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:24,314
I have to regress to something with less functionality because quite frankly,

296
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:27,364
it was more important that I had 90% of stuff working all the time

297
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,133
than having that extra 10% of functionality that like broke every Thursday.

298
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:31,354
Yeah.

299
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:32,213
And that was that,

300
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,494
that was part of the story as well is the fact that you

301
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:37,093
need to pay attention to some of these projects because some of them,

302
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:37,294
I mean,

303
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:40,164
it could be just a dude and obviously you have

304
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:43,124
to worry about some prominence things then or you could

305
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,864
have a project that's essentially hostile to the users in

306
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:48,234
that respect where they keep breaking things on you and it's

307
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:52,161
not productive to be using that. And so it, I mean, needless to say

308
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,010
we only had 45 minutes and we covered a lot of ground.

309
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,171
We probably could have had three hours and, and still had more to talk about. But

310
00:13:59,281 --> 00:13:59,971
I mean, this is

311
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,171
on the plus side, people understand this is a problem they need to think about.

312
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,760
And I guess on the minus side is we're still so early in

313
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,310
this problem space that there aren't great solutions to all of them.

314
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,861
But I admit I do have, I have hope. I have tons of hope

315
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:15,411
and

316
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,169
well, and I think especially with things like containers, you know, we're,

317
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,849
we're in that fortunate case, I think of where

318
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,710
people are redoing a lot of their, it and how they do it and it's,

319
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:29,320
they're being forced into more mature models of it,

320
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,739
right? Definitely, definitely. All right. So that's enough about me.

321
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,539
-- What about you, Kirk? You talked about CV
-- E? Yeah.

322
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,520
So I talked about the common vulnerabilities and exposures database.

323
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,239
Uh and how myself,

324
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,010
Kent Landfield and the CV board were saving

325
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,419
it with some open source process and methodologies.

326
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,580
And actually more interesting to me

327
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,460
was there's two big misconceptions that keep coming up with CV E

328
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,719
and those are,

329
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,630
what is a CV E?

330
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:58,880
A lot of people think it's

331
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,890
any number of things but fundamentally, all a CV identifier is, is a CV identifier

332
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,349
with a description of the problem and then some reference URL S

333
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,380
that is it.

334
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,760
Now, here's the problem

335
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,119
Mir

336
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,489
has a CV E database. That is the actual true one source of CV data.

337
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,369
There's also the national vulnerability database,

338
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,669
there's also CV

339
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,890
-- details dot I wanna say org,
-- there's gotta be

340
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,929
so

341
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,010
more than 10.

342
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,239
And so for example, the NVD, the national vulnerability database, nvd.n.gov

343
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:33,580
is

344
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,419
for the US government that is their one true view of CV E

345
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,510
and NVD actually adds data to their CV E entries including a CV SS score.

346
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,119
So a common vulnerability scoring system basically which tells you how bad it is.

347
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,590
If it's a 10.0 you need to fix it. If it's a 4.3 it's a pro

348
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,539
uh cross site scripting vulnerability and you can probably ignore it.

349
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,770
Uh And then they also very nicely add some

350
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,049
uh C pe some common product enumeration data,

351
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,679
which is basically a way of describing, you know,

352
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,770
what is it Microsoft Windows version X or whatever, what's affected.

353
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,010
And a lot of people seem to think that a CV E identifier

354
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,530
includes a CV SS score. Well,

355
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,330
this is not true. The NVD data view

356
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:16,539
adds that

357
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,530
but an actual CV ID, like I said is just purely the identifier itself.

358
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:25,750
So CV hyphen the year hyphen the number like 1234,

359
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,559
the description of the vulnerability. So like

360
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:31,750
which basically boils down to a

361
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:36,190
uh vulnerability of type food in product X results

362
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,099
in this outcome when an attacker exploits it,

363
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:42,080
you know, it's like a buffer overflow in Apache results in code execution,

364
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,919
uh you know version 2.3 0.4

365
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,090
whatever.

366
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,940
And then the reference URL S which are actually really super valuable for a

367
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,080
lot of people because it allows you to do more research into that issue.

368
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,640
And you know, find like really how bad is it what's the context behind this, you know?

369
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,880
Um,

370
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:05,819
well, and I think it's also important to note that NVD does add the CV SS,

371
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:13,780
what V three now, I think scores, but the CV SS score can differ by product or by use or,

372
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,400
I mean, there's a million

373
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,628
things that can happen and NVD kind of sticks to a very general purpose.

374
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:19,928
It's actually worse than that.

375
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,229
NVD doesn't always have all the information they need

376
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,828
to make AAA correct scoring assessment.

377
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,848
So they have to default to a worst case scenario essentially, right?

378
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:30,859
They can't just be like, well,

379
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:34,348
we don't know if this is locally exploitable or remotely exploitable.

380
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,739
They have to default to the what, what is worse, right?

381
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,819
And so their CV SS scoring is quite often a little bit,

382
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,260
-- well, it's basically, it's pessimistic because it has to
-- be,

383
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,520
which is the right thing to do, right?

384
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,010
You don't want to have an optimistic score

385
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,160
and they'd be like, oh crap actually, no, this is a 10,

386
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,319
you know, so I,

387
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,359
I get that and that makes sense and they're doing their job in that respect.

388
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,119
But of course, I know like, like us as vendors,

389
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,959
it can create challenges because sometimes

390
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,560
the score from NVD is very high when in the way we might be using it.

391
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:07,599
It,

392
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:12,000
it's actually not that bad and then you have to start arguing and convincing and it,

393
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,680
-- it's,
-- or even more extreme,

394
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,535
we've had flaws. Uh

395
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:20,255
the Apache file commons upload flaw, remote code execution. Very bad flaw.

396
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,155
So in our middleware products, very bad flaw

397
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,454
satellite six shipped that library

398
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:28,025
but did not use any of the functionality. I had them check the code twice.

399
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:31,165
So it wasn't even that. It was a lesser vulnerability.

400
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,814
It was not a vulnerability at all.

401
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:37,155
And of course, we had customers saying why aren't you fixing this? Well,

402
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:38,280
it's,

403
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:41,030
it's technically yes, the vulnerable code is present,

404
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:44,969
but we do not use it in any way, shape or form or have any plans to.

405
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,069
And we actually will be updating this library at some point in the future

406
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,900
in case that happens. But fundamentally,

407
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,300
you know, we also made a note of it to make sure that we don't use this.

408
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,420
Um which is, I mean, and so in all seriousness,

409
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,199
that's a great reason that even if you

410
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,219
aren't necessarily vulnerable to a specific issue,

411
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,500
you should still update it eventually

412
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,060
because someday someone is going to try to use that functionality

413
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:12,530
and then you're gonna find yourself in a world of hurt.

414
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah.

415
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,219
No, it's, it's incredibly important to know what you're shipping,

416
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,650
what version you're shipping

417
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,930
and what is it pulling in? You know, is it,

418
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,010
if you're building stuff in pretty much any modern build system,

419
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,109
it's going to be very helpful and manage your dependencies,

420
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,130
which is awesome because

421
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,770
my God, I do not want to go back to the days of old

422
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,550
I don't,

423
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:33,630
I, I, yeah, I

424
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,430
know what you mean.

425
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,069
-- Like getting gnome compile.
-- I, you know, I don't know if I ever did that.

426
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,839
I don't want to. I believe I tried and I'm pretty sure I gave up because it was a night.

427
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,729
Well, it's still a nightmare. It's just that

428
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,510
there's nice ways to do it.

429
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:51,540
So, anyway, those were the two biggest misconceptions around CV E

430
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,479
and then what we've also found is that people really do want

431
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,920
better coverage of issues, you know,

432
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,160
especially, um,

433
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,969
where we have a lot of cases where we have vendors

434
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:03,810
that are

435
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,750
not as either maybe mature in their security process or are in

436
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,479
some cases outright hostile to having CV ES attached to their products.

437
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,699
You know, because they, they want to have these products that don't have flaws.

438
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,689
If you don't have CV S,

439
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:19,880
they don't have flaws. And that's the reality

440
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,560
for a lot of,

441
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:22,589
uh,

442
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,880
organizations until a vulnerability has a CV E identifier.

443
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,170
It is not a real vulnerability.

444
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,800
Right. Right. Well, actually, so funny enough is one of the guys I had in my session

445
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,680
that something he brought up is, he said,

446
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:41,010
if this library I'm looking for in the open source universe has no CD E I DS.

447
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,949
That's a huge war

448
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,176
sign. Right. That's not a good thing.

449
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:48,786
That's a very bad thing because it means nobody's paying attention

450
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,686
or they've, you know, it's

451
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,296
either nobody's paying attention. They've been actively hostile or

452
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:55,446
nobody's ever looked whatever.

453
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:56,225
And,

454
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,855
and that's part of what I'm trying to do with the uh the distributed

455
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:03,426
weakness filing is make it so easy to get a CV E that A

456
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:03,806
pro

457
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,192
projects will get CV S

458
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,592
and B if the projects don't want to get CV S or don't even know they exist,

459
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,482
which let's face it.

460
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:09,572
You know,

461
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,612
some of these projects are literally a guy

462
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:14,271
on the weekends banging away on the software.

463
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:16,612
And some of these things are super widely used.

464
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:16,911
You know,

465
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,631
some of these image uh library format parsing

466
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:22,182
libraries that are used in literally everything are,

467
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:23,641
are one guy.

468
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:24,791
And you know,

469
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,829
so what I want is also the model where an external

470
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,329
person who maybe uses this software and cares enough can make

471
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,540
the request to add the CV S and actually maybe do it themselves.

472
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,560
So that essentially you could have somebody who becomes

473
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,540
what's called a CV numbering authority

474
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:43,180
on behalf of a project that maybe they're not even officially a part of,

475
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,579
you know, a great example being wordpress,

476
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,089
I believe you have a recent experience with this draw.

477
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah, that's right. I, I just assigned so I'm uh what was it?

478
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,949
DWF CV E mentor, number one.

479
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,400
So I, I should get a shirt.

480
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,949
But

481
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,949
so

482
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:03,630
Kurt and I have been working to make this happen. And obviously, I'm uh we say more

483
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,949
uh uh

484
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,619
willing to deal with, we'll say uh uh missing pieces. So,

485
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,910
so we've been working through it to make this happen.

486
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:12,959
And

487
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:16,119
it was what last it was on Friday? I think it was.

488
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,300
I had somebody basically contact me and said, look,

489
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,839
there's this horrible wordpress flaw

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,239
that there's actually like they think it's in the millions

491
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,839
-- of sites that are being exploited and essentially
-- all of them

492
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:34,020
-- prior to 4.7 0.1 which only came out about a week or two ago.
-- Uh 4.7 0.2 was

493
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:37,062
they fixed it silently 4.7 0.1.

494
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:40,682
They made it even more confusing and

495
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:44,133
this is a great reason not to silently fix things anyway.

496
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:47,353
Anyway, so the issue being like they needed a CV ID,

497
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,442
I could get him one.

498
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:52,113
And I said I'm doing it because it's way more important to just have the ID.

499
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,953
So people have that common language they can use when they talk about this

500
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:59,446
versus necessarily kind of doing it the right way of getting

501
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,855
a hold of Miter and working with Wordpress or whatever.

502
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:04,225
And so, yeah, we threw it out there in the universe.

503
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,956
And, and so I think in that instance,

504
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:10,385
this is where the flexibility of DWF is going to be phenomenal for the the industry.

505
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,586
Well, and the reality is, you know,

506
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,306
the wordpress people had good intentions.

507
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:17,936
This was a remote code execution flaw effectively in the rest api

508
00:23:18,225 --> 00:23:22,026
they fixed it silently in version 4.7 0.1. Hoping that

509
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:23,426
people would update

510
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:24,709
and then

511
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,140
well, and, you know, some did, some didn't, uh,

512
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,959
I religiously stay on top of my wordpress updates

513
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:31,619
because they do things like this.

514
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,119
-- You know,
-- everybody learned a lesson here.

515
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:38,699
And so, and then they shipped version 4.7 0.2 which was a known security update.

516
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,780
It, they listed three security updates

517
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,339
and then another researcher

518
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,930
basically went, oh. Interesting.

519
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:50,260
And wordpress had to publicly admit to this fourth flaw

520
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,209
in four point

521
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,550
but and even more confusingly, they updated the 4.7 0.2 change log to say that they,

522
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,579
you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

523
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,310
And this is a great example of why we need a CV

524
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,119
number with like a description and an entry

525
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,329
that makes this all clear because right now,

526
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,369
like I know the some press and some bloggers and stuff were talking about

527
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,109
-- this and it was getting horribly confusing
-- saying issue number four is not helpful

528
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,770
and that's kind of what was happening.

529
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:16,579
So, yeah, no, it's a great example of why,

530
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:19,810
you know, ideally the project itself would get the CV E right?

531
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:23,650
And but if they don't want to or if they're not able to or if they just flat

532
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,339
out don't care or literally there are people that don't know CV E exist and you know,

533
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:29,540
that will always be the case

534
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,869
and I want people, external,

535
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,290
people that care about it to be able to get those CV numbers in and get it done quickly

536
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,219
so that we don't have these messes, you know, so that we can all talk about CV.

537
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,920
What is it? 1 million, 1000?

538
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:43,550
-- One
-- million? 1000? It

539
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,969
is. Yeah,

540
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,689
that's right.

541
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:46,920
Well, you know, so that's the thing, right? Is

542
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,540
the,

543
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:52,530
the whole power in this isn't necessarily getting it right or wrong all the time.

544
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,359
It's being able to move fast because by being able to move quickly,

545
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,359
we put ourselves in a position where we can

546
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,609
adapt to the environment and what's happening around us,

547
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:04,530
which today in security is insanely important

548
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,609
because everything is crazy all the time.

549
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:09,050
Well, I mean, a great example of this is the,

550
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:14,680
the database format that DWF uses for our CV S also includes a state for the CV.

551
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:15,250
Like, is it

552
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,869
reserved? Is it public? Is it rejected?

553
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,209
And more importantly,

554
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,500
what happened to it if it was rejected or if it was

555
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:28,310
merged into another CV? Or if this CV was split into multiple CV S

556
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,069
because that way you can automatically consume and process this.

557
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,390
So given a CV V number

558
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,160
that was, for example, rejected, your system would go oh,

559
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,410
this CV number was officially rejected.

560
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,989
It turned out not to be a flaw

561
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:44,390
or it turned out to be multiple flaws or it turned out to be a copy of that other flaw.

562
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,859
So go look at that entry.

563
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,300
Um And we've had that happen where miter assigned a CV number. I didn't know about it.

564
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,699
I assigned a CV number.

565
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:57,010
Oh, miter already did this. Ok. So in my entry it says, go see CV, whatever on Mir's

566
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,560
end.

567
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,250
And

568
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:01,270
you can now in a very easy automated fashion,

569
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,579
discover the truth

570
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,319
and even better yet. That means we can fix mistakes quickly and easily,

571
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,500
which is key,

572
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,380
which means now we can move much faster because we can make

573
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,739
mistakes that we can recover from easily and quickly and cheaply.

574
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:19,189
Yeah. Right. Right. And that, you know,

575
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,099
I will say that's one of the things that I

576
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:25,199
think is a theme that's becoming more and more common

577
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,099
is people are recognizing now,

578
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:29,540
especially in security that you're going to

579
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,989
make mistakes and it's ok to make mistakes

580
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,199
here. Right.

581
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:33,400
Yeah,

582
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,280
that's true.

583
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,760
But I mean, I remember, you know, five and 10 years ago,

584
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,040
it was very much focused on the get it right every time

585
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:40,800
and that,

586
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:44,979
that never happens in no universe. Are you? Right, all the time. Right.

587
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:46,369
It's just, it's how it is.

588
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,540
Yeah. Well, and the reality too is like 98% of these cases are not super complicated.

589
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,729
Like it's not,

590
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,219
it's a single vulnerability that we can fix relatively easily

591
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:02,209
and we don't need this huge heavy process to deal with this stuff all the time.

592
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,670
But, you know, sometimes we do, like,

593
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,430
for example, if there's a, you know, a significant flaw in open SSL then, yes,

594
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,140
then you, you bring out the full heavy procedure

595
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,209
but if it's a cross site scripting, vulnerability and wordpress, I mean,

596
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:14,869
it's bad but it's not the end of the world.

597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,310
-- Yeah.
-- Oh, definitely. Well, and that's the thing, right. When you need the big guns,

598
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:19,354
they're there,

599
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:23,204
but then they're not bogged down with the easy stuff so you can

600
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:25,545
use them for what you need them for. Right.

601
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:28,474
And, I mean, I think that's kind of what happened with CD E to this point is

602
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,594
Miter got bogged down with the easy stuff,

603
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:35,305
which then obviously hurt when it was time to do the big stuff.

604
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:35,594
Right?

605
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:38,275
I think a lot of what we need in security is,

606
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:42,814
is more of an idea of proportional response and escalation of force as needed

607
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:43,915
because

608
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:48,275
in my experience pretty much everybody, it boils down to one, having one response.

609
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,319
You have to make it perfect or we have to completely block it the nuclear option,

610
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:52,689
right?

611
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:55,170
And, you know, maybe good enough is good enough.

612
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,170
-- Like, um, you know, enough
-- is the best you're gonna get. Right.

613
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,650
Well, that's the reality. Right.

614
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,630
Yeah, you can, you can try for perfect. But you're gonna be lucky with good enough.

615
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,010
And that's just the reality of it.

616
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,660
Very cool. Good. Good.

617
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,739
So this is, so I, I must admit as the, uh,

618
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,579
official editor of the open source security podcast, I'm,

619
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,349
I'm slightly terrified of this one because we're recording in the

620
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,150
Mosconi kind of in public and there's lots of background noise.

621
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,209
I can't cut this because if I cut it it's gonna sound really weird. Right. So,

622
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,439
I don't know, let, let's hope we haven't screwed anything up too bad.

623
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, I guess we just, you know, we go with the go live thing and run with it.

624
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,160
Yeah, we'll figure it out, man. So, so what you doing for the rest of the show now?

625
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,900
I mean, we're, although, oh, I'm not done yet. Oh, man. So

626
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,479
I have a birds of a feather session that they asked me to do,

627
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,439
but it's at seven o'clock in the morning tomorrow

628
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,439
and they told me what time it was after I agreed to do it. Which,

629
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,420
uh, I don't blame him because I don't know if I would have agreed.

630
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:53,099
-- There's people
-- awake at seven in the morning.

631
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:54,069
I'm gonna be awake at

632
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:54,939
seven in the morning.

633
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:55,489
Yeah. Right.

634
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,430
Well, I, in fact I woke up at 5 a.m. today, which I was pleased I made it to 5 a.m.

635
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,739
So I consider that progress. Right.

636
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,569
And, and maybe if I'm lucky I'll make it to 6 a.m. tomorrow and then I can wake up and,

637
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,380
and come here

638
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,229
and,

639
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,699
and hang out with the other folks from the east coast. Right.

640
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,630
Well,

641
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,930
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow and my plan is to actually catch a few talks.

642
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,859
-- Yeah.
-- II, I went to a handful today. Actually, it was good. I saw Schneier

643
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,530
talk and he was discussing about kind of regulating the internet of things.

644
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,530
And he had, he had some really interesting insights.

645
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,530
I mean, you know, Bruce always gives, gives a good talk. There's no denying that.

646
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:33,329
But he did the one thing he talked about that really made me think and I not,

647
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,729
I sort of knew this but I didn't really put it together

648
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,969
a lot was the fact that

649
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,729
if you look at the way computing has worked in the past

650
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:44,650
when there was failure, it didn't really matter,

651
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:48,119
right? Because you were dealing with a computer somewhere

652
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,329
and it failed. Nobody died. It was no big deal.

653
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,089
But now you kind of look at the other end of the

654
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,489
spectrum and you have things like automobiles and medical devices and,

655
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,196
and heck even to a certain degree appliances in people's homes that

656
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:03,875
when these things fail, people are literally going to die.

657
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:07,355
So now it's not a matter of, oh, I screwed up. Oh, well, no big deal.

658
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:11,355
-- It's like, yeah, oh, I screwed up. A bunch of people are dead. You know, that's
-- crazy.

659
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:13,836
That's actually come up in CV E discussions and that

660
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,755
we need coverage of these things because let's face it.

661
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,755
CV E traditionally covered issues that while bad

662
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,095
would typically work.

663
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,531
Worst case scenario result in

664
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:24,541
a loss of money. You know, a bank gets robbed

665
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:26,241
or, you know,

666
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:29,511
an airport gets shut down and it's really just inconvenient.

667
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,001
Um, but yeah, with

668
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,842
like with self driving cars,

669
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:36,482
right? I mean, I mean, cars, pacemakers, um,

670
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,832
you know what the, the diabetic dial,

671
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:41,342
not dialysis, uh uh the insulin pumps,

672
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,442
right? I mean, there's,

673
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:44,589
yeah, this is crazy to think about.

674
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,349
I mean, and to be quite honest,

675
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,310
what's gonna be really wild is these things are full of open source.

676
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,030
So

677
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,790
what is gonna happen when you find out like

678
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,989
this git commit literally killed somebody.

679
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,310
It's gonna be, I mean,

680
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm gonna feel really bad for that developer because he's gonna have to, you know,

681
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,130
he's never gonna forget it but you think about it, that's,

682
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,719
that's going to happen where we're gonna be able

683
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,520
to say this get commit literally killed a person.

684
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:11,290
I suspect we're gonna see a model where we have to have,

685
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,829
I don't wanna say like layered security but some checks and balances, you know,

686
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,670
uh a great example is what is a fail safe condition?

687
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,060
For example, a car,

688
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,449
what is a fail safe condition? Quit driving?

689
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,319
Yeah, pull over to the side and stop driving ideally

690
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:26,829
-- um until
-- you pull over in front of a semi,

691
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,069
right

692
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:29,560
flies you over, you know, obviously

693
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,890
like with a with a self driving plane, what is a good failure scenario?

694
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,040
I think you crashed? That's

695
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,750
pretty much the fail.

696
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,469
I suspect a lot of what will help is actually figuring out

697
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,579
how we want these products to work and defining how we want

698
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,369
things to work so that we then have something to shoot for.

699
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,670
-- So
-- actually Schneier had an interesting analogy

700
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:48,810
in

701
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,439
this respect was the fact that if you look at nuclear power,

702
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,989
nuclear power before the Three Mile Island incident in the United

703
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
States was on fire and it's all everyone talked about.

704
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,250
In fact, you can buy kits from like the sixties that are, you know,

705
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,489
like my own radiation lab or something for

706
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,530
your house that came with uranium or something,

707
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,119
which is horrifying to think about now. But,

708
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,290
and then Three Mile Island happened and people said, well,

709
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,569
we need to think about this now, the unfortunate thing though,

710
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,650
that he didn't say that I suspect he thinks

711
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,569
is we aren't going to do this until we have some horrific accident

712
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:26,069
that makes people realize we have to take security

713
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,530
in these cars and medical devices and whatever seriously.

714
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,260
And that sucks that it's going to come to that

715
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,359
well, or worse an intentional attack.

716
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:36,680
Right?

717
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:38,890
I would, it, it's gonna be in the same,

718
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,280
the same bucket right where it may be intentional.

719
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,599
It could be an accidental flaw. I mean, who knows what, whatever I mean?

720
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:49,300
Well, look at you have that, uh, that router. You said that is going to what in a year,

721
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:50,920
right?

722
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,589
Happens when it's like, all right, we've got,

723
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,180
you know,

724
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:57,869
4000 pacemakers that in six months are gonna quit

725
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,319
working and kill the people that are inside of

726
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,630
-- what do you do? I mean, that,
-- that's crazy.

727
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,949
Well, it's funny, I mean, in the case of a medical device,

728
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,670
you already have an established legal framework

729
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:08,030
to deal with this.

730
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,530
And then, you know, ideally the outcome would be, is that, well,

731
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,650
you have to go replace all those pacemakers, which is

732
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,319
not super awesome for the people.

733
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,550
-- And
-- then you think about it,

734
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,760
some of those people will die because they're too sick to be operated

735
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,119
on. I mean, that's, that's crazy.

736
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,859
I mean, I think fundamentally it boils down to what I've been talking about,

737
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,959
about quality of life, you know, did we basically do more good than harm?

738
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,280
Right. And because we'll never answer that in 50 years, I,

739
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:33,939
I,

740
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,479
you know, I,

741
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:38,020
because I don't think as security practitioners we can aspire to do no harm.

742
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,250
I don't think that's possible anymore because it's so complex and so complicated

743
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,060
and this is a can of worms.

744
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,849
I know, but the reality is I should, I would like to do no harm.

745
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,949
But at the same time,

746
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,410
you know, what? If we can make a major improvement?

747
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,229
-- We,
-- we should finish this discussion at the pub later tonight. Right.

748
00:33:58,349 --> 00:33:58,920
So, oh

749
00:33:59,170 --> 00:33:59,939
man, that

750
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,520
stuff.

751
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,180
But I guess here's the deal too.

752
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:04,920
And this is something that gives me hope even though things

753
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,890
can seem crazy is the fact that we are starting to

754
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,688
have these conversations finally and now a bunch of us have

755
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,120
been complaining about this for longer than we can remember,

756
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,080
but it's starting to happen.

757
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,760
And that's,

758
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,500
I'm not going to say

759
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,379
that we're going to solve it quickly. But

760
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,208
the first step is to understand the problem and I think

761
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:27,469
we're starting to understand at least we have a problem.

762
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:27,750
Right.

763
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,570
We don't understand the problem, but we know we have it,

764
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,208
which I think is too stupid as it sounds, that's a huge first step for us.

765
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,469
You know,

766
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,610
it's like that whole Dunning Kruger Curve we've now realized, oh,

767
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,560
we're on the Dunning Kruger Curve.

768
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,860
We don't, we don't,

769
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,449
we're now aware that we don't know what we don't know to quote Cheney, you know,

770
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,600
-- that's actually,
-- and that's a big step forward.

771
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,188
That's a really good point, you know that and I, I think that wasn't Cheney.

772
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,040
-- That was
-- Rumsfeld

773
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:52,580
Rumsfeld.

774
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:52,790
Sorry.

775
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:53,659
No, no,

776
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:53,820
I,

777
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:56,800
-- yeah, we won't quote Cheney on this one.
-- No, my apologies.

778
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,199
No, no, it's all good. No, I mean, this is,

779
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:03,110
it's cool stuff and I guess that's part of what makes,

780
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,560
you know, hanging out at a show like this some fun is,

781
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,860
is you get to think about this stuff and

782
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,090
have conversations with people about what's going on and,

783
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,800
and so it's,

784
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,639
yeah, it's, it's been crazy, man.

785
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:13,560
I, I don't know, we'll see what tomorrow brings, I guess.

786
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,750
All right, man, we got things to do.

787
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,570
So folks, I would like to Thank you for listening.

788
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,679
As always, I'll tell you,

789
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:24,520
you can go to open source Security podcast.com where I will post

790
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,310
the show notes to whatever it is we've been talking about.

791
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,379
And if you want, you can hit up Kurt and I on Twitter,

792
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:33,040
we'd be happy to have a chat if you're listening to this

793
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,550
during RS A which I'm hopeful I'll get it posted during RS A

794
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,260
come find us, have a chat. We, we'd love to talk

795
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,419
and I guess until next time, Kurt,

796
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:44,000
you have a fabulous evening.

797
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,530
Yeah. And I hope you have a great birds of a feather session

798
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:47,870
-- yet.
-- Seven AM.

799
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,919
It's 10 a.m. for you. That's not even late. Well, that's not even early.

800
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:54,600
I, I don't want to think about it, man. Uh, 7 a.m. That's all I keep thinking of.

801
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,689
I, I'll get a bucket of coffee and I'll

802
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:57,909
keep drinking it.

803
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,989
All right. Until next time, folks. Thank you both. Thanks for listening.

804
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,040
Bye bye bye.
