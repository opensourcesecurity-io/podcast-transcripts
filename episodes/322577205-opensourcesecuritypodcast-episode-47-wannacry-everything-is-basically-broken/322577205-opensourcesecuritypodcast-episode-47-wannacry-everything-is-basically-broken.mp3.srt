Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 47 with myself,

1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,220
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,020
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,649
You chuckle because this is like, take two here.

4
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:19,270
I've, I've given up on trying to work with garage band for recording,

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,879
but that's another story and, and the world is on fire while, while I'm screwing

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,059
around

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,309
on.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,959
-- That's true. Actually, everything is kind of better now, isn't it?
-- Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,170
A guy accidentally fixed it.

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,590
Yeah. That's always nice when people accidentally fix things. I appreciate that.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,009
So, anyway, for the sake of posterity,

12
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,360
why don't you explain what on earth we're talking about?

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,560
So, for those of you who I guess, don't read any tech news.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,490
Well, no.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,630
And there's those of the listeners from the future, like, hello, 27th century,

16
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,590
you found this buried somewhere and

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,669
you've given up on any hope for this race of humans

18
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,889
as

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,159
they

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,610
-- exist today. But
-- anyway,

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,790
still vulnerable.

22
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,150
Yeah. So there was a, there was a nasty worm that went around the internet,

23
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,379
especially showing that it was a crypto locker

24
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:07,129
worm that then demanded $300 worth of Bitcoin.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,889
But the thing is it was exploiting a vulnerability in Windows.

26
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,000
That is uh well, it's essentially, it's a well known vulnerability,

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,269
Microsoft fixed it back in March of 2017 with MS 17-010.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,269
And it's basically one of those flaws.

29
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,610
It's like it's as bad as it gets for Windows, right? It's a

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,980
remote code execution flaw in the windows, server message block.

31
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,000
So the file sharing bits uh version one

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,769
now that's on by default, right? With

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,349
that's installed and on by default on

34
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,180
all the things because

35
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,430
that, I mean windows file sharing, that's something everybody uses basically.

36
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:42,419
Yes.

37
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:46,650
Anyway, so the real problem though is that there was that NSA

38
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,410
uh dump of exploit tools

39
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:53,279
and there was a weaponized version of the exploit for this flaw.

40
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:58,180
Now we should also clarify that the issue was fixed before the dump was released.

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,819
Yes.

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,029
And so this weaponized exploit um is especially dangerous in that there's,

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,379
there's a lot of exploits for vulnerabilities that are, you know,

44
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,699
more proof of concept, right?

45
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,929
Like it actually will

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,399
trigger the exploit but then just cause the, you know,

47
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,259
the program or the system to crash, right?

48
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,259
It doesn't actually cause code execution because

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,820
there's actually quite a few protections.

50
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,619
Now on a modern system, you know, with like um a dress stack lay

51
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,289
randomization. And you know,

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,699
all these different tricks that we use to essentially make it hard

53
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,490
even if you get code execution to actually properly exploit it,

54
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,229
you know, and get what you want.

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,399
Um But in this case, there was a fully weaponized exploit in the NSA dump,

56
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,970
which basically means that the attacker

57
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,169
just kind of had to take their existing worm kit and, you know,

58
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:45,039
plug the exploit into that framework and away they go.

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,470
Right. Which is kind of crazy if you think about it.

60
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,820
Well, I mean, there's been these worm kits selling now for,

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,059
oh jeez, it's, it's over 20 years now.

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,179
Um, and I know back in the day, like some of them had 24 7 email support out of Russia,

63
00:02:59,690 --> 00:02:59,710
you

64
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,759
know, they still do.

65
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,320
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,660
And they would have announcements like, you know,

67
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,350
now with like ebay fake email support and like now with, you know,

68
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,899
um anyways,

69
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:12,070
so this, this exploit was really bad because it basically affected

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,259
every single version of Windows that is currently in support and

71
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,539
basically all the versions that are not supported like Windows XP.

72
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,259
And so like, as it turns out,

73
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,190
like we all knew there's a lot of Windows XP out there still.

74
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,410
And,

75
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,309
you know, by definition, Windows XP is, has not been getting security patches for,

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,539
what is it?

77
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,660
Two or three years now?

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,339
And, and

79
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,169
I heard

80
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,940
that they released a patch for

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
-- this.
-- They actually,

82
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,580
well, I mean, from a public good point of view, they, they,

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,919
I don't even think it's a public, good point of view.

84
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:43,800
I think it's a

85
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,089
apr point of view

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,369
because

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,520
let's face it. If you're running XP, you have tons of other problems affecting you.

88
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,210
Well, yeah, I mean, the thing is if you're running windows XP, this is going to happen

89
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,369
again and again and again, it's just a matter of time,

90
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,610
right? Because there will be more flaws.

91
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:05,300
Uh, some of which, you know, will be exploitable and some of which will have

92
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,479
weaponized, exploit code. And, you know,

93
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:11,100
the problem now is that by exploiting this fly, you know,

94
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,759
this guy made some real money.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,460
You know,

96
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,798
people have been monitoring the Bitcoin wallets that the money was sent to.

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah, they, a lot of people paid the 300 bucks because let's face it right.

98
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,609
For most places,

99
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,799
you know, if you don't have good backups of your system,

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,769
once you got backups, it's gonna cost you more than $300 to restore those backups.

101
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,500
Totally.

102
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:32,690
So,

103
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,260
yeah, so the good news is this guy who was on his week off, um, accidentally fixed it

104
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,630
accidentally,

105
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:44,670
you know, it's not every day you fix a worm, like just in general and, and

106
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,950
I don't know if anyone's ever accidentally fixed a worm before

107
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,890
which makes it hilarious.

108
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,709
Well, and especially a worm that was doing this well, like this thing was, I mean,

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,829
apparently, you know, all of the NHS, uh, fedex, uh, Telefonica

110
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,929
-- Banks,
-- you

111
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:00,250
wanna

112
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,250
know something really funny. So, when

113
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,209
I, I was, I was in Europe,

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,089
and I was on an airplane and I land and you sent me a message saying, holy crap, what,

115
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,049
what's going on with this worm?

116
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,130
And I thought, what, what are you talking about?

117
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,529
Like, I don't know it because I kind of had a media black out there for a while

118
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,649
and you, you just said check Twitter and that's when I knew it was gonna be bad

119
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,450
and I opened up the Twitter client and it's bad.

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,160
And then I remember thinking I was sitting in the airport and I thought

121
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,079
I have one more flight to get home.

122
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,299
I hope this thing doesn't hit the airlines because I don't want to be stuck here.

123
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:32,779
And that was,

124
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,760
-- that was my first thought and, and thank goodness
-- you

125
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,839
-- air systems
-- and whatnot. I'm certain it did.

126
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,559
But luckily for me, it did not prevent me from getting home.

127
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,829
So if it did get at the airlines, it obviously didn't shut down anything critical.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,739
And actually, I mean, that's a great instance. Right.

129
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,359
Where if it costs the airline $300 to make it go away or they can literally probably

130
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,640
spend tens of millions of dollars missing flights

131
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,609
and things like that to restore from backups.

132
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,519
That's a no

133
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:01,649
brainer. Right.

134
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:06,170
Well, I mean, the good news is they're hopefully not using windows XP on the back end,

135
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:06,619
you

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,239
know, and if they have windows on the back end, they're hopefully patching it.

137
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,929
No, they're, they're probably using windows 95 on their back end.

138
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,829
-- Yeah. But uh
-- it's true.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,970
But uh no.

140
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,470
So, I mean, this, this, this worm was, you know, it, it was very successful.

141
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,190
Um, but apparently it had a built in kill switch

142
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,869
where basically if you uh registered a certain domain,

143
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,190
it would check for that domain and if the domain exists, it,

144
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,510
it would stop functioning.

145
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,200
Now.

146
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,119
It's interesting to me is this guy found the domain name when he was like doing a,

147
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,940
you know, binary analysis of the worm, right?

148
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,179
He

149
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,670
got the worm code and he's taking it apart and looking at

150
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:39,989
it.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,579
What's interesting to me is there's, you know,

152
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,720
these thousands of organizations that got clobbered by this worm

153
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,820
and like none of them, for example,

154
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,149
found this or noticed this, that, you know,

155
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,929
these things were all making the same DNS request to this, you know,

156
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,660
uh for this uh one DNS host name,

157
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:56,799
right?

158
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,790
You know, um which I mean, and, and realistically too,

159
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,690
even if you are recording all your DNS queries and everything,

160
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,859
you, you then have to actually do something with that data and correlate it.

161
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:09,519
And you know, and if here's part of the problem with incident response,

162
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,559
the your world is literally on fire, everything's falling down,

163
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,769
everything's caught fire.

164
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,260
You don't have time to take the measured,

165
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:17,679
you know, proper approach.

166
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,320
You're just, you know, you're sticking your finger in the holes as,

167
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:21,459
as fast as you can.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Right.

169
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,859
You know, I, I would actually compare this to, this is, this is something I actually,

170
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,779
I was talking about this last week with some people but

171
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,579
I, I would compare it to. It's like you're

172
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,980
a bodyguard

173
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,290
in a crowded marketplace

174
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,320
and

175
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,739
your goal is to protect the person. But let's face it. The reality is nobody cares.

176
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,100
And there's really no threat

177
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,420
but there,

178
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,369
there could be one but it is impossible to tell the difference between the

179
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,899
guy with a gun and just the guy trying to sell you a chicken.

180
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,459
Right?

181
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,779
That's the kind of the issue there is how do you figure out which is,

182
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,299
which until of course,

183
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,720
once they pull the gun out and shoot the person you're trying to attack,

184
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,760
it's super obvious who the bad guy was.

185
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,329
But um prior to that, it's very difficult or maybe even impossible.

186
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,119
Well, and this is part of where I think, you know,

187
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,049
what's gonna happen is um places that share and

188
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:12,209
gather intelligence will start to notice these things.

189
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,970
You know, these things can be noticed. You know,

190
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,760
if you have a cyberattack hitting 1000 sites

191
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,970
and these 1000 sites all have

192
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,010
one dns look up in common,

193
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,130
you know, it's going to be pretty obvious.

194
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,399
Yes. And

195
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,480
you know, I had this conversation also actually

196
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,429
was that

197
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,929
there, there is the,

198
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,010
the current sharing that happens isn't super useful because

199
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,200
it lacks kind of that next level of correlation.

200
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,200
That you need to do this

201
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,179
because, right, like one random DNS request,

202
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,469
not impressive

203
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:41,950
10

204
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:42,308
million.

205
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,469
Right. Exactly.

206
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,679
And, and let's face it.

207
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,330
If you visit any website,

208
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,080
it's gonna load like 25 bazillion ads from crazy looking domains.

209
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,799
So why would this one be different?

210
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,239
Well, and it's funny, I mean, so not to, you know,

211
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,409
completely plug a commercial product, but this is something that, you know,

212
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,900
we've been working with at the, the Cloud Security Alliance,

213
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,469
this platform called True Star.

214
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,510
And one of the main things that this platform does that a

215
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,950
lot of others don't is it allows you to anonymously share,

216
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,130
right? And that's one of the biggest things, right?

217
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,989
Is, is a lot of people kind of want to share

218
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,010
but they don't want to share

219
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:18,789
their data explicitly and, you know, and be embarrassed. Right.

220
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,570
That's, that's the other big problem, right? Like,

221
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,719
you know, these, I mean,

222
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,520
I'm sure there's lots more banks that got hit than just the ones that were

223
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,809
listed and lots more phone companies that got hit than the one that was listed,

224
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,719
you know, but they're never gonna like, publicly be like, oh, yeah, by the way,

225
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,280
last weekend, uh, we had a rough time.

226
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,280
Right.

227
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:34,700
No,

228
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,690
no, I know

229
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,539
exactly what you mean. No, nobody's gonna admit it.

230
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,200
I mean, it, it's embarrassing. Let's face it. Right.

231
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,859
Well, and especially if I wonder now here's a question.

232
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:47,900
I wonder how many infosec teams or even just operation teams got popped,

233
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,179
paid the Bitcoin

234
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,900
and pretended everything was cool.

235
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,229
-- Probably more
-- than

236
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:53,429
too

237
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:54,520
much.

238
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,390
Yeah.

239
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,799
I mean, the,

240
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,719
yeah. No, it's, it's, yeah, it's one of those things.

241
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,960
Well, by definition, if this worm popped you, you,

242
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,020
you're already doing a lot of things.

243
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,919
Not very well,

244
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,549
you know,

245
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,599
you've got either out of date systems or systems that are not being patched,

246
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,979
you know, with patches that came out months ago.

247
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:13,869
Um

248
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,369
Alternatively,

249
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,849
you know, and this is what's interesting to me is that

250
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,859
this

251
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,979
vulnerability could be easily avoided by just disabling SMBV version one,

252
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,659
which you can very easily do on windows and get away with.

253
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:26,849
Now,

254
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,799
you cannot disable version two and version

255
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,130
three like that will break everything horribly,

256
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,010
right?

257
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,849
But you can disable version one and that's fine, you know.

258
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,549
-- Well,
-- is that

259
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:36,820
a

260
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,900
practice? I honestly don't know,

261
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:39,640
it's,

262
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,799
I was just gonna say if you need backwards compatibility,

263
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,799
don't do it

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,080
right? Because there is stuff, well, it's like TLS or SSL, right?

265
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,200
There's still stuff that only speaks the old stuff.

266
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:52,640
But again, by definition, if you have that old stuff that only speaks the old stuff,

267
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,409
you really want to start thinking about transitioning that thing.

268
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,729
And I get that it's not easy, right?

269
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,840
Like everybody's making fun of the NHS for still using Windows XP.

270
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,020
But, you know, every time I've seen one of these, like,

271
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,049
let's replace all of our Windows systems with something, you know,

272
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:07,200
it always goes horribly wrong and costs

273
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,130
some ridiculous amount of money.

274
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:10,179
Right.

275
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,770
I mean, that's just, you know, replacing, you know, everything

276
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,140
-- while it's in motion is not easy.
-- It could be the year of the Linux desktop.

277
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,909
Finally, Kurt.

278
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,780
Right. This is the, this is the time everybody

279
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,729
anyway.

280
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,859
Well, assuming those are like those phones that you plug into a TV, then maybe.

281
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,369
Oh, I

282
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:33,140
know. I

283
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:33,719
know. I

284
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,809
-- know.
-- But uh

285
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,059
and see that's, that's you were mentioning earlier about the um

286
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:38,849
Well,

287
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,090
there's been some rumors that maybe

288
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,919
the dump with this vulnerability was intentional

289
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,770
and not like an actual attack that got a bunch of good stuff.

290
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,929
Uh What not. OK. No, no, I don't.

291
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,200
That, that doesn't make sense to my brain right now and it's possible it's just me.

292
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,429
But so here's

293
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,419
what, what I was making

294
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:56,909
it

295
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:57,090
was

296
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:57,979
leaked.

297
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,799
Well, well, so the NSA had an issue.

298
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,330
Shadow Brooker got a hold of some stuff and this was in one of the leaks,

299
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,650
but the

300
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,679
Microsoft fixed this

301
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,919
not a long time before the shadow brokers leak.

302
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,739
And obviously the NSA was aware

303
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,320
that certain,

304
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,580
well, certain tools they had had been leaked.

305
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,119
And so there are some conspiracy theories,

306
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,489
I've read that say basically the NSA knew it got stolen and told Microsoft, hey,

307
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,659
uh we know about this bug, you better fix it

308
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:33,179
and then Microsoft fixed it. And then shortly after the shadow brokers leaked

309
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,000
and it's not outside the realm of possibility.

310
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,200
It could just be a coincidence, it's hard to say, right?

311
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,020
Because I mean, and part of the challenge as well is when you have a tool like this,

312
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,299
as soon as you use it,

313
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,830
you risk run the risk of burning it because there are

314
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,859
organizations that literally log every single piece of traffic they receive.

315
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,539
Well, yeah, I mean, storage is cheap now and you know,

316
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,320
even one or 10 gigabits per second is

317
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,659
actually not that much data if you only have to keep, say 30 days of it.

318
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:02,919
Yeah.

319
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,400
You know,

320
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,500
um

321
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,630
Yeah, so II I,

322
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,289
yeah, I don't know about that obviously, but

323
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,169
in my mind, it's pretty obvious that, you know, uh the NSA is not stupid

324
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,599
and, uh, you know, generally speaking, I guess they would probably have,

325
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,349
I'm guessing they have a spreadsheet somewhere that,

326
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,650
you know, has some numbers and some formulas for like essentially,

327
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,390
you know, if we find this flaw, do we, do we use it? Do we tell somebody, do we ignore it?

328
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,750
-- You know,
-- that is,

329
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,190
we could probably discuss that topic for days and never come to a resolution.

330
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,520
So, so actually I do have a thought on that, that, that I was mulling over

331
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,609
earlier today.

332
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,200
In fact,

333
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,390
is these days I think regardless of what you do

334
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,640
and this includes three letter organizations around the world.

335
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,239
It is clear everyone is compromised.

336
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,849
And so I think if you're sitting on top of something like this,

337
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:02,190
I'm not gonna say it's wrong for these organizations to use it or not.

338
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,229
And that's up to the, the listener to decide for themselves.

339
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,789
But I think it's safe to say that

340
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,070
if you sit on it for too long,

341
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,849
the, the little graph of, of odds, someone else knows about this,

342
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:16,750
it approaches 100%. I suspect in less than one year.

343
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,590
I would disagree.

344
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:22,830
Only because we've seen flaws that have taken a long time to come out.

345
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:23,760
Well, that, yeah.

346
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,179
Does

347
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,630
anyone know about it?

348
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,020
Well, there, there have been, um,

349
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,729
Linux flaws that were like, you know,

350
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,429
brutally obvious in hindsight that have been there for years, you know.

351
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah.

352
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,239
No, I, I mean, I know, I, I think there have been some, but again,

353
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,520
does the NSA have a bunch of guys reading the Linux kernel mailing list?

354
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,280
-- I would assume so
-- if they don't, they're fools. But,

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,039
-- yeah,
-- because that's, that's like free gold. Granted.

356
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,010
You got to go through a lot of chaff but it is.

357
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:55,000
And just because you have people reading that mailing list.

358
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,520
So it doesn't necessarily mean there aren't. I mean, let's face it.

359
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,400
Every piece of software has egregious

360
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:00,885
bugs waiting to be found.

361
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,844
You don't. It's kind of like I always love when people joke about,

362
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:07,044
oh, you know, that they need to pay someone to put a back door in the software and

363
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:11,044
no you know what? It's a lot easier to just read the code and find the bugs.

364
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:12,085
Let, let's face it

365
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,005
because everything is, is basically broken. But

366
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:15,825
no, I don't know.

367
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:16,505
This is,

368
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:19,184
this is an interesting one to think about and I'm certainly

369
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:21,645
not gonna take any sort of public opinion because II,

370
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,994
I think there's too much nuance for me to really have a, a

371
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:26,565
proper judgment here.

372
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,539
Well, and not just nuance but there's all sorts of weird legalities involved.

373
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,270
Well, I mean, that's fair too. It's, I, I do enjoy living in my civilized country

374
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,469
where, where I like to think these people are, are fighting the good fight.

375
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,289
So

376
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,130
anyway, we, we will not dwell there.

377
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,909
I think here's, here's the thing I really keep thinking about

378
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,099
in terms of this, this war

379
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,650
is

380
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,500
you're gonna have people who talk about. Well, why didn't you patch your systems?

381
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,619
Ok. And

382
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,169
I, I don't disagree with that necessarily, but this is an ongoing

383
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,330
problem

384
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,289
that has come up again and again and again

385
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,750
for as long as I can remember now,

386
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,429
and I feel like if people actually were going to take it seriously,

387
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,010
they would have been patching their systems properly 10 years ago.

388
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,109
But it keeps happening over and over and over again.

389
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,950
And I remember like when this all started, people were saying on Twitter, oh,

390
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,330
finally everything is going to change and you know what?

391
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,169
I don't think anything's going to change

392
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,849
well, or ignore patching for a minute.

393
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:32,150
People still running Windows XP, which is now out of support for two or three years.

394
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,520
And the reality is there was some really good comments on Reddit where this one

395
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,724
I was like, yeah, we still have a bunch of Windows XP systems

396
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:43,085
to do wire transfers, millions of dollars a day worth of wire transfers.

397
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,114
That's horrifying.

398
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:46,875
And this software we, well,

399
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,325
I guess they don't have the budget to replace it because I mean,

400
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:52,505
obviously there's got to be wire transfer software that runs on Windows eight or 10.

401
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:54,784
But fundamentally, you know,

402
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,125
one of the banks I use, for example,

403
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,724
doesn't have the pin pads at the tellers.

404
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:03,284
They only have only one of the tellers has a pin pad and it's a cost cutting measure.

405
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,569
So what they do do is they ask for ID when you do a transaction, right?

406
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,390
One of my other big banks I deal with, it's a bigger bank.

407
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,390
Every teller has a pin pad, right?

408
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,520
And you put your debit card or your credit card in you type in your pin, right?

409
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,250
And it talks to their computer and it says like this is curtsey fried and blah, blah,

410
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,219
blah, blah, blah, right?

411
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,579
And they don't ask for ID.

412
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,890
But this other bank basically to save money because, you know,

413
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,750
they would need several 1000 pin terminals

414
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,739
for every single one of their workstations.

415
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:27,368
You know, they just ask for ID,

416
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:31,469
which I also kind of appreciate because the reality is, you know,

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,050
somebody walks into a random branch with my debit card and pin

418
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,030
number that they beat out of me with a lead pipe.

419
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,530
-- No problem.
-- Why would they even go to a branch? They could just go to an ATM.

420
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,119
Right.

421
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,560
ATM has withdrawal limits.

422
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,180
Oh, but the, the teller doesn't.

423
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,939
But I would, I would hope if someone's asking for, you know,

424
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,579
thousands of dollars they ask for some ID.

425
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,319
Uh, I don't know. But anyways point being,

426
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:53,780
you know,

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,819
test that and find out because if they let you withdraw,

428
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:57,239
-- send
-- me some

429
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,560
thousands of dollars so I can

430
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,000
play this out because that's, I, I feel like there's step one, there's a little flaw,

431
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,589
-- let,
-- let, let's kick, start it.

432
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,119
Right.

433
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,910
Yeah. No fun.

434
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:09,439
Um, see what happens when Kurt asks for a big pile. Right.

435
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,079
But, uh, no, or somebody else was pointing out Hipaa compliance. Right.

436
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,430
There's all these things that,

437
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,130
on the one hand you're out of HIPAA compliance by running Windows XP.

438
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,020
But on the other hand,

439
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,270
you know, you've got this like

440
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,949
machine that does something and only talks to Windows XP.

441
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,189
What, what do you do? Right.

442
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,550
-- Replace the million dollar machine. You get
-- a waiver

443
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,069
and then everything's fine

444
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,540
and ideally stick a little firewall in front of it.

445
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,800
But apparently a lot of people didn't,

446
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:39,359
well, even, even if you have a firewall, I mean,

447
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,619
once this thing gets inside your network.

448
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:41,900
Well,

449
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:42,579
it actually

450
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,599
-- for the actual device. Right.
-- I see.

451
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,729
-- I understand what you're saying now,
-- but some of them again,

452
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,760
you can't do that because you have to share out for the

453
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,020
-- work.
-- Right.

454
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:50,699
It's,

455
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,439
it's tough, man.

456
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,319
And I, well, ok, so here's, I guess my, my real thoughts on this is first of all,

457
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,660
the concept of zero trust networking is real

458
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,380
and if you're not thinking about it,

459
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,000
you're making foolish architectural mistakes.

460
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,060
I think the reality is, it's not that it's,

461
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:11,040
it's not so much that it's real. It's, it's

462
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,020
provably where we are today.

463
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,589
Yes. Right. And that's actually true. It's not coming. It's here.

464
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,729
Right. Here's the reality. Right. You send,

465
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:20,819
uh,

466
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,739
you have a company with 1000 people

467
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
on a network.

468
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,339
It only takes one of them to open up that email and click that attachment.

469
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,180
Right.

470
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,869
Yep. Yep.

471
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:29,250
Absolutely.

472
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,869
You know, and, and again,

473
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,150
there was that Reddit thread that I tweeted out where this guy was like, lamb.

474
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,920
He's like, oh, a small medium business, this idiot user, like,

475
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,000
opened up their email and opened up an attachment

476
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,439
and, like, infected the network with this thing. And I'm like,

477
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,619
yeah, I mean,

478
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,589
because we've spent like the last 20 years teaching users like you get emails.

479
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,819
Oh, but don't open emails from an untrusted source. So they don't.

480
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:50,459
But, you know,

481
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,650
this email came from Bob who I email with

482
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,939
daily and he sends me attachments because like,

483
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,709
their invoices or whatever the heck they are.

484
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,479
And this invoice looked a little weird but no biggie and I opened it and oops.

485
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:03,119
Yeah, then

486
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,099
-- you know,
-- whatever face it too. I mean, any good fish

487
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,689
is often attacking someone else's address book.

488
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,459
And so you obviously already have that connection if you're

489
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:14,500
on their address book.

490
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,819
Well,

491
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,290
and more to the point my take on this

492
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
would be no wonder everybody hates it because like,

493
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,530
shouldn't it be safe to open an attachment on

494
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,660
my computer and not have something truly horrible happen?

495
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,859
Like, shouldn't that either be blocked because it's a virus or sandboxed or,

496
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,859
you know, it should be.

497
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,439
I mean, the reality is I am a security guy and I open attachments from my email.

498
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:33,569
Now,

499
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:37,390
granted I take some rather ridiculous measures sometimes when it's from somebody,

500
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,310
I don't know, but

501
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,430
generally speaking, I mean, I can't

502
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,510
not open attachments in email.

503
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,189
Well, you don't have to anymore. You just open this cramp in Google Docs now.

504
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:47,630
-- Exactly.
-- It's Google's,

505
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,489
you know, and, and, and I do do a lot of that, like I, I'll say like,

506
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,469
I'll save it to Google Docs and then open it there because, you know,

507
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:58,069
the hope being is if this like hostile PDF somehow manages to break

508
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,530
out of Google Docs into my web browser and compromise my system through that

509
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,369
nobody's willing to burn that many zero days to take over my system.

510
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:05,530
At

511
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,479
that point, it'd be cheaper to just, like, drive to your house and kidnap you and fly

512
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,199
-- country.
-- Give me a suitcase full of money.

513
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,109
Seriously. How

514
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:19,079
many, again, how many of you users wouldn't take $10,000 to do, like, plug a USB,

515
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:19,930
drive into the network?

516
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,119
And that, I mean, that's part of it as well. Right.

517
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,479
Is, you can't, we can't protect this stuff. We just can't.

518
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,469
I mean, that's the reality of it. Right. It,

519
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,829
well, it's like physical protection.

520
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,109
If somebody really wants to throw a brick at your window,

521
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:33,150
they, they will.

522
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,310
Yeah. Right.

523
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:34,910
And,

524
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,810
and I guess funny enough though is we always

525
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:39,109
complain about how people are the weakest link and,

526
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,910
and people had nothing to do with this, this worm.

527
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,380
We, we, any way you look at it, it's, it's doom everywhere.

528
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,030
I love it.

529
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:50,150
Yeah.

530
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,589
Well, and the other thing that really worries me is again, this guy on his week off,

531
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,880
found the domain registered.

532
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,689
It stopped the worm and we have all these

533
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,849
cert teams and all these law enforcement teams and,

534
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,619
like, you know, I'm really beginning to look

535
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,430
at certain teams and law enforcement teams and I'm beginning to kind of wonder

536
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,459
they do some good coordinating work and they do some really good work, you know,

537
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:08,030
tracking bad guys down

538
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,449
on certain networks and stuff.

539
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,599
But for something like where it's happening fast and happening, you know,

540
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,109
rapidly like this,

541
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,469
I don't think

542
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,459
-- they're capable of handling it well, or very few people are
-- ok.

543
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:23,020
So, I think there's a couple levels to what you just said and, and first of all

544
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,349
this guy got lucky.

545
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:27,829
Right. It's not like he tried

546
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:31,469
to necessarily shut the worm down. It's just he happened to find this

547
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:36,089
and thought I'm gonna register this domain. Honestly. He probably registered

548
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,890
it in hopes there'd be some sort of like,

549
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,270
awesome thing that happened later on because of it.

550
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:40,829
Right.

551
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,819
And, and,

552
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:42,609
or

553
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,680
some sort of command and control thing, at least then you can black hole it or

554
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,109
Microsoft, look at it. Ok.

555
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:51,510
So, so there's that aspect of it, right? But then if we think about these

556
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,239
kind of cert teams in law enforcement and all that stuff is,

557
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,839
first of all the amount of noise these people are going to have is

558
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,180
out of control.

559
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,239
Yeah. But you don't think every single major vendor security team

560
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,900
wasn't looking at this worm in the last 48 hours.

561
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,359
Ok. We're going to get to that.

562
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:09,160
I mean,

563
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,000
they, they were, but here's the thing, the reality is

564
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,579
it's really hard to do this kind of work.

565
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,939
And if I had to guess,

566
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,290
I bet there's

567
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,319
at most a couple 100 people on the planet who are

568
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:25,859
capable of actually doing it right and doing it well.

569
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,219
And so it's

570
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,040
there, there isn't,

571
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,079
most organizations might think they have the ability to do that sort of thing.

572
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:34,839
And they don't

573
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,369
and they might have staff who even think they can do it,

574
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,359
but they don't

575
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,640
because

576
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:43,310
-- it's, it's so complicated and so detailed
-- often.

577
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,439
What's interesting to me is is if you look at some of these cyber challenges,

578
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:49,599
people have put up like uh the cert cyber challenges or uh the def

579
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:50,479
con ones or whatever,

580
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,619
some of them are easily as complicated as this thing.

581
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,270
And quite a few people manage to pull those challenges off.

582
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:57,334
But again, they're not,

583
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:01,614
they're not running that time. Constraint or like, oh my God, the world's on fire.

584
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,275
This is, this is like

585
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:07,314
when, when someone is shooting like, like for example, military, right?

586
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:08,895
You, you can train all day long,

587
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,954
but as soon as someone starts firing a gun at you while you're doing the thing,

588
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:12,795
you need to do,

589
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,875
all the rules are gone and you don't know what to do.

590
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,540
And, and in fact, I just had this conversation with my kids today.

591
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,160
So I was driving down the street

592
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,239
and

593
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,560
I get to a, a roundabout,

594
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,910
right?

595
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:26,229
Or

596
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,680
traffic circle for, for some of you,

597
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,739
whatever. I still love the word roundabout.

598
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,719
You have those uh where you live. I thought America hated them.

599
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,709
-- Uh
-- Many do and I hate those people,

600
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:37,760
but that's another story.

601
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,109
Uh

602
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,949
So anyway, anyway, get, gets to the roundabout

603
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,280
and there's a guy in a truck in front of me

604
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:45,050
and he's not going

605
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,969
and there's nothing in in, in the circle and I'm thinking,

606
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,030
what's wrong with this idiot?

607
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,530
Right.

608
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:53,170
And all of a sudden I hear a siren behind me and I look in the mirror

609
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,060
and there's an ambulance behind us

610
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,859
and the ambulance, like,

611
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,160
you can't get through because that's just how these things work.

612
00:24:59,170 --> 00:24:59,699
And I'm like,

613
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,910
and I'm thinking, yeah, well, you're right. This one was the one that,

614
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,280
and, you know, you know how they are, they like, set it up.

615
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,099
So you like, the cars can only go in one direction and stuff

616
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,180
and there's only, that's

617
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,739
generally held traffic circles.

618
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:11,109
I

619
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:11,339
know,

620
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:12,589
but I've,

621
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,760
I've seen in like the UK where they just have like,

622
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,880
nice painted things because people are civilized

623
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,410
enough to actually do the right thing.

624
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,180
-- Not like a giant,
-- like, like, not like concrete barrier things to

625
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,040
sure you cannot screw it up even though I've seen people screw that up that whatever.

626
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:31,329
And, and so anyway, this guy, obviously he froze when he saw the siren and of course,

627
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:33,180
the ambulance pulls up and finally just starts talking.

628
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:34,380
It's horn like crazy. And this

629
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,680
pull over to the side of the road, get out of the way. But

630
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,609
-- there was
-- no, there was nothing to pull over on, right? Like in a traffic circuit.

631
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,839
You, you just get out of the circle. That's the answer, right?

632
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,979
You don't stop in the middle and be like, now what? Right.

633
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,900
So anyway,

634
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,780
the point is though this is totally like fight or flight kind of where there,

635
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,260
there are certain people and, and, well, I, I'm sure it could happen to anybody but

636
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,880
something like that happens and you just freeze and you don't know what to do.

637
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,099
And so you do nothing.

638
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,500
And I would imagine in a lot of instances where you, you know,

639
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,319
you're an infosec team or something and you might be very talented.

640
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:06,199
But if you,

641
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,459
if you lack the experience and the training to

642
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,329
understand how to do this work under pressure,

643
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:11,869
you're useless.

644
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,729
I mean, that's true.

645
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, II I see this, you know, come across, well,

646
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,660
having done over 5000 CV si meet people who

647
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,380
are like seriously panicking about something and I'm like,

648
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:22,459
no big,

649
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:23,829
right? Well, you know, I mean,

650
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,589
man, I remember this dealing with like zero day flaws or, or when

651
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,420
something crazy happens or there's like some super crazy critic

652
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,165
issue that comes out is

653
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:34,854
the new guys are always like running around in circles on fire

654
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,875
and, and it's like I've done this enough times before that.

655
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:43,415
It's cool guys just chill out and we'll let the grown ups work, ok?

656
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:44,535
We'll take care of this.

657
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:48,025
Well, it's, it's part of it is having that perspective and you know, like, yeah,

658
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,064
we've done this in the past.

659
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,025
We know what happens

660
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:51,915
and what's always interesting to me is, you know,

661
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:54,375
we think these things that are like fresh and hot are going

662
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:57,145
to like blow up in our face and be just a massive mess

663
00:26:57,484 --> 00:26:58,574
and they do sometimes,

664
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,079
you know, once in a while they really do blow up.

665
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:01,430
Um,

666
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:06,239
but quite often, you know, it's, it's well after the fact that the poop hits the fan,

667
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,800
you know, like, and this is a

668
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,689
good example of it, like two months, three months later,

669
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,609
Kabui, you know, like

670
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,469
from my understanding is there's,

671
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,890
there's entire countries that got like bushwhacked by this.

672
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,869
And somebody mentioned, you know, Chinese manufacturing,

673
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,150
which I I find really fascinating because let's let's face it, right?

674
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:27,650
Chinese manufacturing, you know, these guys cut corners and do it cheap,

675
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,609
right? That they're good at that, right? They do a lot with very little

676
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,810
and chances are they have

677
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,020
more than a little bit of windows XP floating around

678
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,739
or just windows servers in general like hooked up to

679
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,239
ska

680
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:42,760
systems or manufacturing systems or,

681
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,599
or just the front or back office systems or whatever, right?

682
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,189
And you know, my my real thought was like, is this,

683
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,079
you know, are we going to see like a 1% hit to Chinese manufacturing this month?

684
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,609
You know, I bet not because you know what, they're going to pay the 300 bucks

685
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,300
well, or they're just, you know,

686
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,250
they're so used to stuff pooping out that they'll just be like, sure whatever

687
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:06,859
it was like reading an article they were pointing out that in India,

688
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:07,780
you know,

689
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:12,140
people live with daily power interruptions. That's normal. That's the default.

690
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,969
So it's just not a big deal because they all have generators and UPSS and everything.

691
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,810
Whereas, like, you look at a place like North America. Right.

692
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:21,140
And you cut the power to say a downtown core for half an hour, an hour.

693
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:22,930
Oh, what a mess.

694
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,300
Like

695
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,920
it's the end of the world.

696
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:25,569
Yeah.

697
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,689
You know, but that, that kind of stuff is normal in certain parts of the world,

698
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,530
like very industrial parts of the world,

699
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:31,719
you know.

700
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,099
And so,

701
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,920
yeah, I mean,

702
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,660
I, I don't know the answer here because the reality is, you know,

703
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,160
anybody that should have moved off of windows XP would have by now by definition,

704
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:43,709
like they've had years.

705
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:46,310
And so if they haven't moved off of it, then clearly

706
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,079
they have some good reason not to,

707
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:49,979
you know,

708
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,930
budget or availability or whatever

709
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,699
and, and clearly there, you know, we can't, basically, we can't tell people, oh,

710
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,229
you should patch quickly because again,

711
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,609
if they were going to patch in a timely manner they would have,

712
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:01,119
they would have done it 10 years ago.

713
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,489
I mean, this has been an ongoing problem and it's quite frankly,

714
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:09,729
as long as we have people running their own systems, they aren't going to patch them.

715
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:10,890
That's the reality of it.

716
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,560
It's,

717
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,930
yeah, it just is what it is.

718
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,949
This is.

719
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:18,479
And, and then on the flip side, which is kind of painful, like so I look at things like,

720
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,260
you know, um what is it, the, like the zero trust networking and stuff.

721
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,500
And I,

722
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,199
that's how I've kind of built my network and

723
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,050
how I live my life now because quite frankly,

724
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,430
most of my devices are mobile and they float around,

725
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,109
you know, sometimes they're at home, sometimes they're at the coffee shop,

726
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,359
you know, once in a while I might go to defcon or something

727
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,099
and, um, or go through customs,

728
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:35,780
you know,

729
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:36,530
there's

730
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:36,880
no,

731
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,329
seriously, I'm way more scared of them than I am

732
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:40,180
totally.

733
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,880
Well, or, you know, with the theoretical laptop ban on all flights from

734
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:44,290
life. I mean,

735
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:47,880
it's gonna be so much worse than

736
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,790
people can imagine because,

737
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,459
well, but the,

738
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,939
well, and here's, but here's the really ugly thing.

739
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,930
It's not just that you won't have your tablet or your laptop on the plane.

740
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,420
I won't have it in the terminal.

741
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,270
-- So, not only do you not have it while you're flying but on the two hours before,
-- well,

742
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,430
and screw that even, that doesn't concern me the fact that I've got, like, some,

743
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:04,939
some,

744
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,229
it's out of my possession and

745
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,020
goodness knows what's happening. I mean, honestly, if they do this, I'm just gonna,

746
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,589
truckers alone are a problem, let alone an actual attacker.

747
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,569
Right. Yeah. Right. That's the thing.

748
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:18,910
And so I figured, like, if this happens, honestly,

749
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:22,920
I might just go to where I'm going and buy like, a $200 chromebook and then, like,

750
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:25,849
like, pawn it before I leave and be, like, whatever.

751
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:29,020
-- I
-- suspect that's going to become a bit of a thing because

752
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,949
there's a lot of people who legally aren't allowed to have their,

753
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:35,380
like, laptop out of their sight for, like, 12 hours.

754
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,060
-- That's true.
-- You know,

755
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:40,040
in certain industries, just

756
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,890
anybody in fintech, anybody. Well,

757
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,380
like, I, I,

758
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,560
I mean, seriously there's,

759
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:47,359
you know, and,

760
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:50,410
and the thing is you can encrypt your hard drive and you can do all that stuff.

761
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,810
But

762
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:54,140
there's, you know, if I have physical access to your machine for five minutes,

763
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,420
there's all sorts of shenanigans.

764
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,550
Like,

765
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,290
totally, man. Absolutely.

766
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,050
-- You
-- know.

767
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,209
Um,

768
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,390
but, and, and ignoring all that,

769
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,959
just the productivity hit of not having a laptop for like, 8 to 12 hours

770
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:05,780
when you

771
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,119
travel.

772
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,439
That,

773
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,829
that's ridiculous.

774
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:08,189
I can

775
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:09,010
read

776
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,410
-- nothing.
-- Well, I'm guessing maybe this will be really good for airport bars.

777
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,079
Uh, they seem to do fine as it is.

778
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:16,739
Yeah.

779
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,250
But, uh,

780
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,550
no, so, going back to this, I mean, the, the reality is

781
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:25,780
by definition, the world we live in is this way for some very good reasons. You know?

782
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,219
And then we,

783
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:29,130
and it's not gonna be easy or quick to fix unless

784
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,339
somebody comes up with some super clever solution that everybody's like,

785
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:35,704
-- wow, that's clearly better. Let's do that.
-- Yeah. It's called software as a service.

786
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,314
Although I guess here's,

787
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:40,415
here's one of the things I was actually thinking about though, on this note is

788
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:41,484
so obviously,

789
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:44,224
software as a service is becoming really hip and a lot

790
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,545
of people are using it and like you look at something,

791
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:47,584
we'll say Google

792
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,505
and there's the G suite and all that stuff

793
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:53,464
and, and they do a very nice job and I don't have to worry about updates.

794
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,625
It's just kind of magic.

795
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:55,844
But now,

796
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:58,545
but now here's the thing that I think about is

797
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,489
as software as a service becomes more important and more used,

798
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,939
there are going to be way more software as a service providers,

799
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,939
which means there's going to be some

800
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,369
that don't patch

801
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,660
and we're gonna end up in this situation again,

802
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,219
except now we have even less control than we do today.

803
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,199
Yeah. So the good news there and again, not to plug the CS A too, too much.

804
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,689
But the CS A has a program for that called Stars,

805
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,530
you know, where essentially it's like, oh,

806
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,920
what 200 question give or take or maybe more now, I don't know.

807
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,989
Um, but this like massive questionnaire that people fill out.

808
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,390
Uh, you can also, so you can have self attestation, you know,

809
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
where we basically trust the provider to what I said.

810
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,560
What they said is correct.

811
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,479
They can also be audited for it.

812
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,130
You know, they can undergo an audit to prove that what they said is correct.

813
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:49,829
And essentially they, they attest to things like this.

814
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,390
Like we have physical security. Right.

815
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,150
Like how many services and software providers have really good physical security.

816
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,930
You know, how many of them

817
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,949
actually properly destroy media when they, when the hard drive dies,

818
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:02,619
most of them probably run in Aws.

819
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:03,819
Yeah,

820
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
or whatever, you know,

821
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:08,270
um, how many of them encrypt at rest, how many of them encrypt in transit?

822
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,609
You know, where are they actually physically located?

823
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:12,189
Which jurisdiction, you know,

824
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,510
after the whole safe harbor debacle.

825
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,150
Um,

826
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,599
and again, you know, this basically boils down to is

827
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:19,239
us.

828
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,160
Hopefully these companies mature, the mature ones will take on security as,

829
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,250
you know, being a serious thing.

830
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,609
Like

831
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,109
Microsoft is a great example, right?

832
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,150
Microsoft used to be absolutely terrible at security 20 years ago.

833
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,790
Like they were the joke of the industry

834
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,410
and now it's like, oh, you know what, this is really bad.

835
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,030
Let's drop an, you know, let's drop a patch for XP even though it's out of support

836
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:41,609
and here's a patch and not only that, but the patch was pretty quick.

837
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,800
Uh, sure.

838
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,209
But here's, well, honestly if I guess, I bet it's very similar code base if it's S MD V.

839
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:48,579
Well,

840
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:50,579
I'm guessing they already had the patch because I

841
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:52,800
think there are some customers that are still paying

842
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:55,439
lots of money to get XP like updates.

843
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,569
I know the NHS was for like two more years.

844
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,459
Um,

845
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:02,420
but yeah, like you said, they might have had it waiting in the wings and just like, ok,

846
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,540
now we actually should release it publicly.

847
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,689
Yeah. Right. Right.

848
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:07,119
And,

849
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,168
and I'm hopeful the things you've described about stars

850
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,300
can make a difference for software as a service because

851
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,790
my, my biggest fear

852
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:20,599
and, and today I believe it's kind of the answer to many of these problems.

853
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:22,819
But my biggest fear is that it eventually

854
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,539
ends up with very similar problems to this. Just because

855
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:29,178
once you, once you become a certain scale,

856
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,697
things start to get weird.

857
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:32,878
And like today where it's very like the,

858
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:35,668
there's a handful of really big Softwares of service companies

859
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,539
and, and they seem to get it right.

860
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:38,688
And,

861
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:41,717
and I don't know that that's what really just scares me today.

862
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,489
I mean, that's, you know, I look at Google and one of the reasons I use Google is they,

863
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:47,589
they seem to be really on the ball for security.

864
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,717
And then, you know, you, well, there was that incident a week ago,

865
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:54,569
apparently one of my users had one of their uh, passwords exposed.

866
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:55,978
So I get this email from the Google

867
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,678
security team saying basically we found one of your

868
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:58,849
cre.org users

869
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,399
in a password dump,

870
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:02,100
go deal with it.

871
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,629
And they gave me specifics go change their password. And

872
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,219
very importantly to remember which a lot of people won't including myself,

873
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:09,739
probably

874
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,469
check their email forwarding rules,

875
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:14,290
right? Because maybe somebody went into their account

876
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,689
and changed, you know, set up their email to forward to them so that,

877
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,909
you know, their, their two fa, or their password resets or whatever, you know. Boom.

878
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,350
Some dude in Russia can fiddle with it,

879
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,489
you know, and so forth this user, you know,

880
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,689
I forced them on to two factor authentication and everything and, you know, and,

881
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:29,989
and so did, uh, you know,

882
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,050
it doesn't look like anything truly malicious happened

883
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,300
and it doesn't look like it was a,

884
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,250
you know, a, a significant password that got dropped.

885
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,659
Um, but yeah, I mean, basically

886
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,969
-- Google seems to be taking a lot of proactive security.
-- Oh,

887
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,080
they totally are.

888
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:45,260
And they're,

889
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:48,100
they're amazing. I mean, you look at things like project Zero

890
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,530
and it's, it's chrome.

891
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,189
Yeah. Right. Chrome

892
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,870
is fan. Even chromebooks, man. Chrome

893
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,739
is like they, they did a lot of that. Right. And it's amazing.

894
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,570
It's

895
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:00,229
so,

896
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,780
I, I think there is hope for the future and,

897
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,800
but the problem is gonna be is that even if only

898
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,159
1/10 of a percent of the world runs out of date g

899
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,500
garbage stuff,

900
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:12,290
that's millions of devices.

901
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,689
Well, we haven't even gotten to IOT yet.

902
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,969
Oh, that's gonna be such a horror show.

903
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,439
And honestly, I think the only solution for IOT is brick worms.

904
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:21,770
That's,

905
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,870
that's the only thing that's going to force people to

906
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,429
update is when they get their light bulbs bricked.

907
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:30,469
I know. I know. I, I think it's terrible.

908
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,790
I don't want to advocate for it, but at the same time I don't see another solution

909
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,419
and I know that's the least horrible thing that, that could result in it.

910
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,010
It's, well, until you're like, you know, um, in Anchorage,

911
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,139
Alaska and it's January and all your light bulbs stop working.

912
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,800
Yes.

913
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:51,199
Or your furnace.

914
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,510
I bet the furnace would be swelled.

915
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:56,959
Honestly, this is why I'll never buy an IOT furnace controller.

916
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,399
I just can't not have heat in January.

917
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,209
I live in Canada.

918
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,889
You know, this, like $30 thermos, uh, thermostat furnace control. I have, you know,

919
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,689
doesn't talk to anything. It's super simple.

920
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:11,500
No, I know exactly what you mean.

921
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,429
I, I have a similar thing where I know some people who are saying, oh,

922
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:15,919
you should get a nest thermostat.

923
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,060
I just kept thinking this,

924
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:21,479
this thing I have uses like literally a little piece of mercury, I think to,

925
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,580
to turn things on.

926
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,699
I mean, it's not gonna break,

927
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:25,179
it's not gonna wear out. Um,

928
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:26,320
is,

929
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,209
-- does my name, I don't think, I don't know
-- what my name,

930
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,780
the old style ones have. Mercury.

931
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,219
The new, anything made in the last, like 1020 years.

932
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,310
-- It definitely does not. No,
-- I think I, I think I've replaced it.

933
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,270
No, I did, I did replace it and it had a mercury one in it

934
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,149
-- that
-- spring. I got rid of

935
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,959
a B

936
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,479
meal

937
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,469
metal strip with the mercury bubble thing.

938
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,899
-- It worked
-- really well. What's

939
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:46,060
totally, I mean,

940
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:49,040
other than having deadly mercury inside.

941
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,030
-- But,
-- well, more to the point, you know, not being super accurate.

942
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,129
So, like 72 here is not anyways

943
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:54,860
though.

944
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,560
I grew up with that and the whole house being cool anyways it was. And now I'm the dad.

945
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,409
So it's like I'm a total fascist about it.

946
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,090
-- I,
-- I used to be, I've, I've given up, I'm like, you know what? I just don't even care.

947
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,310
I mean,

948
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,370
here's the thing I realized is one day I kind of sat down and figured some of this out is

949
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,040
when I'm a thermostat fascist, I'm,

950
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:13,750
you know, turning it down and whatnot.

951
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,379
I'm literally saving like $20 for quite frankly, misery.

952
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,419
It's not about saving the money. It's about just control.

953
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,370
I cared about the money. I'm,

954
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,500
I, I meticulously track my finances and then I finally, I'm like, 20 bucks, like,

955
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,179
-- for real, I'll just like,
-- well, the same thing I had with email attachment sizes,

956
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:31,429
right.

957
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,409
Like the defaults were usually around 10 megs

958
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,719
and I bumped it up on all the list servers to like 25 or 50.

959
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,020
And worst case scenario I was like, this is going to cost us like three bucks a month.

960
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
I just don't care anymore.

961
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,889
And, yeah, people should use dropbox or Google Drive or whatever. But you know what?

962
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:47,139
I can't be bothered to care.

963
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:51,459
I can't be bothered to care. That's exactly what got us into this in the first place.

964
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:51,739
Yeah,

965
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,649
pretty much.

966
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:53,719
Well,

967
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:56,699
and, you know, here's the thing as bad as this was.

968
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,709
Even if it hadn't been kill switch, the world keeps moving along.

969
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,030
Granted the NHS, you know, hopefully nobody died because of this because, I mean,

970
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,260
a lot of people missed their surgeries and, like, emergency treatment was down.

971
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,969
That's gonna cost, like, I mean, that is a huge productivity hit.

972
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,530
That's,

973
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:16,030
it's probably in the tens of millions of dollars for Britain alone for the NHS.

974
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,820
You know, the thing else, I, I, the thing I really keep thinking about here is

975
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:25,419
if it hadn't been kill switched, it might have gotten bad enough to make people care.

976
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,620
But I guarantee at this point

977
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
nobody's gonna care. This is,

978
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,340
this is an asterisk on the bottom of a crazy 2017

979
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,810
by Monday, we'll have moved on to whatever, uh,

980
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,679
something new and crazy

981
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:41,189
by

982
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:41,790
Monday.

983
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,860
It's a crazy world.

984
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,040
It's, it's the world we built Kurt.

985
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,840
It is literally that. Yes.

986
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,709
Oh my goodness.

987
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,590
So I guess, you know, here's the other thing I keep thinking of here is if,

988
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,510
if you were going to give people advice,

989
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,750
offline backups, I was thinking about this

990
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,350
and the only security advice I think I

991
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,770
can reasonably give anybody again at this point

992
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,510
is to have

993
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,760
some form of offline backup.

994
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,850
And when I say offline backup,

995
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,370
I don't actually necessarily mean like a

996
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,550
USB drive that you keep physically offline.

997
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:17,370
It could be, for example, like something like say Google drive or, you know,

998
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:20,000
icloud where, even if you delete stuff, you can still recover it.

999
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,800
Essentially, you need some form of backup solution

1000
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,010
that even if an attacker gets your credentials and goes in

1001
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,610
there and like nukes everything or encrypts it or whatever,

1002
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,790
you can still get it, your data and like, recover it from a previous time and point.

1003
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:36,870
-- And that's all I got.
-- That's it. No, I, I agree completely.

1004
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:41,639
And that's actually where the, the cloud backups are vastly superior because

1005
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:45,540
I used to do a bunch of shenanigans with local hard drives and,

1006
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,100
and keeping some off site and various things like that.

1007
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:53,800
And now Google Drive or not Google Drive, I'm sorry. Uh Now S3

1008
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,139
has the ability to upload data

1009
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,020
and

1010
00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:58,310
when you upload or no,

1011
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,979
no, no, I mean, when you upload or delete

1012
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,530
a file

1013
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,590
it, you can snapshot it and store it for some period of time.

1014
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:10,979
And so, for example, I might set up now that if, if a file changes or is deleted,

1015
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,100
it keeps the older revision around for 100 days.

1016
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:18,949
So obviously, even if like somebody came in, deleted all my stuff,

1017
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,070
I still have that revision.

1018
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,560
I basically have 100 days to restore my backup at that point.

1019
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:23,610
So it's,

1020
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,919
that's fantastic.

1021
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,679
Like with the things I was doing with hard drives,

1022
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:28,500
I didn't have anything close to that.

1023
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:28,899
I mean,

1024
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,760
at best I'd have a month old backup and that I had off site.

1025
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:33,969
And that's

1026
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:35,100
silly.

1027
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:35,360
Yeah.

1028
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,689
The only reason I do local backups is just to restore

1029
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,949
the system in case I brick it on an update or

1030
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,949
my laptop gets run over and I need to, you know,

1031
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,360
restore it because downloading that would take forever.

1032
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,620
Exactly. Well, that's the thing too. Right, is I've got,

1033
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:51,409
you know, hundreds of gigabytes of data backed up now.

1034
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:54,199
And, well, that 2 S3 is so cheap that that's quite reasonable.

1035
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,540
And by having,

1036
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,350
uh I do keep some local data just because I could restore at some

1037
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,270
point in time and then update and I maybe only have to download,

1038
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,750
you know, tens of gigs instead of hundreds, which would be a huge difference.

1039
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,840
I think honestly from, because I was really thinking about that,

1040
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,750
what is the like one piece of security

1041
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,870
advice we can give people that's actually useful

1042
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,030
and I really think it is that whatever it is some sort of,

1043
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:23,120
some sort of backup that is resistant to an attack, even like by you and by that,

1044
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:26,129
I mean, like I've also accidentally deleted the wrong folder.

1045
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,860
I mean, I think everybody's done that at some,

1046
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:29,330
of

1047
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:29,860
course,

1048
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,459
you know,

1049
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,780
and, and so it's not just Attackers but it's like me fat fingering or

1050
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,860
whatever, you know, RM hyphen RF space star,

1051
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,020
you know, putting a

1052
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,459
star between whatever I meant to put in whatever

1053
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,500
we've

1054
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,080
got. N

1055
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
and, and so quite frankly, I think that's really the only,

1056
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,979
that's like the one useful piece of advice I can give anymore

1057
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,870
because everything else is so contextual, uh, so specific and, you know, well,

1058
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,550
it depends, you know, that classic,

1059
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,189
you know, should I use two fa, or should I use this or whatever? It's like,

1060
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:03,110
you know?

1061
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:03,350
Yeah.

1062
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,530
There,

1063
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,969
there isn't a great answer to any of this and I don't

1064
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:09,030
think anyone's going to learn any serious lessons from it either.

1065
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,580
I mean,

1066
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,929
-- and all the
-- lessons, I mean,

1067
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:15,419
we, we already know most lessons around this, but again,

1068
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,179
due to whatever economic reasons,

1069
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:20,139
we can't just chuck it all the Windows XP and we can't just patch

1070
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,629
five minutes after Microsoft releases

1071
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,800
-- in here or we will
-- is

1072
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:26,209
let's think about this.

1073
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,340
So you've got

1074
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:33,449
a worm going around infecting these systems for $300. You can make it go away.

1075
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,939
If you have an upgraded XP, you're not swimming in cash.

1076
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,340
-- So that 300 bucks probably looks pretty good.
-- Right.

1077
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:45,239
I don't want to blame the victim because clearly they

1078
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,659
have whatever rational reasons they believe for not doing this.

1079
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,860
The problem is society, right?

1080
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,979
Society it's your fault.

1081
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,879
Well, and also software vendors that, you know,

1082
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,520
write software that just doesn't work on newer versions of Windows

1083
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,459
or whatever, you know. Like,

1084
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:03,439
yeah,

1085
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,879
because I've seen stuff that, like, I've seen D OS programs running on Windows 10,

1086
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,199
-- like at the dry cleaners, but
-- at the same time there,

1087
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:11,840
there's newer things your dry cleaner could get,

1088
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,459
they just choose not to because they probably don't care.

1089
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:16,919
Well, you got to remember too for a lot of people. Like,

1090
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:20,560
-- what does it cost to train somebody on a new piece of software?
-- Oh, my goodness.

1091
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:23,399
I know. I know exactly what you mean. This is,

1092
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,419
this is what I feel like when I, when I give, like, my parents something new

1093
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:27,820
and

1094
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,070
it's

1095
00:44:28,229 --> 00:44:28,280
like,

1096
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:31,729
-- this is why I
-- made my parents go to an apple ecosystem.

1097
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:34,020
So, like, at least, for example, one thing I love

1098
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:37,580
the buttons on the tablets and the phones are basically in the same location.

1099
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,060
That's really nice.

1100
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,500
You know, stuff like that matters when you're, like,

1101
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,429
trying to teach somebody who's,

1102
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,820
you know, I don't want to go through another major technology cycle.

1103
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,689
I, I'm done personally and I turn 40 next month and I'm, I'm done. Like, that's it.

1104
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:55,199
No, I, I'm literally at the old crotchety man stage of it. Now.

1105
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:55,939
You

1106
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:56,179
can,

1107
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,530
-- well,
-- I, I'm seriously thinking like I

1108
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,669
do, I avoid VR or embrace it or just ignore it as long as I can until I have to,

1109
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,969
-- ah, it's,
-- it's not super popular yet.

1110
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:09,510
I think you got a few more years before you have to choose.

1111
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,169
Yeah.

1112
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,939
But I mean,

1113
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,580
fundamentally, I mean, it's, yeah, I, I'm already there and I'm, I'm an it guy,

1114
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:18,350
you know, so I can't imagine normal people. It must be hell for them.

1115
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:20,810
I know.

1116
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:22,209
I know. It's,

1117
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,639
it's madness

1118
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,489
anyway. Anyway,

1119
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,889
so I guess in summary,

1120
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,629
this was interesting.

1121
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,260
It was,

1122
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,070
the worm was accidentally shut down.

1123
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:37,689
There is literally no actionable advice we can give out about

1124
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,689
it. It just kind of is what it is.

1125
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,530
And, and the really, the really terrifying thing though is probably going to be that

1126
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,139
I would imagine there's somebody working on a

1127
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:50,820
new version of this ransomware without a kill switch

1128
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,879
that we

1129
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:52,820
launched.

1130
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,530
And heck, it wouldn't even surprise me if the original author

1131
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:58,080
is gonna re release it at some point.

1132
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:00,810
No,

1133
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,010
-- everything old is new again.
-- Everything.

1134
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,479
Yeah, everything new is new and everything old is old.

1135
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:07,600
It's

1136
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,010
it.

1137
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,290
That's the thing I've loved, man is what do you even do about this?

1138
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,459
I mean, there's people giving all this advice and making all these claims,

1139
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:16,719
but the reality is just

1140
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:18,229
what do you do?

1141
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,260
Honestly myself, I've moved as much of my stuff into major cloud providers as I can.

1142
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:28,080
And that's probably the only, actually that is some action of ability. And

1143
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,189
that's the

1144
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,899
reason I moved to the Apple ecosystem, right? I buy an Apple laptop, I log in

1145
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,209
and it's my laptop. I get all my apps, I get

1146
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:38,219
all my data.

1147
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,419
It's it, right? Like

1148
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,719
same with my phone. Same with my tablet.

1149
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:45,540
It just magically all that data is there in the icloud.

1150
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:46,020
Yeah,

1151
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,659
totally, man.

1152
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,340
All right. So anyway, our advice is we have no advice.

1153
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,189
So

1154
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,959
maybe try a really nice scotch.

1155
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:57,939
There you go.

1156
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:02,679
That, now that I like I can get behind that one, our advice is to buy Scotch or,

1157
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:03,860
or there you go,

1158
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,919
get, get $300 worth of Bitcoin.

1159
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,909
And in one month, if you haven't spent it on ransomware, purchase a

1160
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,199
fine bottle of scotch for yourself. Is your

1161
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,300
picture that would actually maybe be a really good way to incentivize teams.

1162
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,620
-- That sounds fantastic
-- to

1163
00:47:16,629 --> 00:47:16,860
me.

1164
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,620
Whatever you don't spend on the ransomware budget you

1165
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:21,000
can buy with you spend on booze and cigarettes.

1166
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,919
I love it. That, that's perfect that I there's no better way to end this episode.

1167
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,139
Kurt. It's well done.

1168
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,659
All right.

1169
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:28,010
Uh

1170
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,330
Thank you.

1171
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:31,500
Thank you for listening if you want.

1172
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,100
Well, we have a handful of show notes but nothing too exciting.

1173
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,260
You can go to open source security podcast.com.

1174
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:39,530
We got links to Twitter and Facebook and all those fun

1175
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,899
things you want to get a hold of us and,

1176
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:43,179
and make any comments about any of the crazy things

1177
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:46,750
and I guess for nothing else. Thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt.

1178
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,229
It was fun as always. And until next time,

1179
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,139
-- thank
-- you folks.

1180
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:53,979
And I'm actually looking forward to seeing what changes between this recording and

1181
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:56,250
the release of it with respect to what we know about this form.

1182
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,189
-- That is true. That is true.
-- I can't wait. I'm looking forward to that

1183
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,659
all Right. Have a good one.

1184
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,459
Bye bye.
