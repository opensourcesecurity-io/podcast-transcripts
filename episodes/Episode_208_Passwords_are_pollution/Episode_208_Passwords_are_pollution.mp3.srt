Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,579
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,319
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:12,600
So, what's new?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,049
You know, it's like proper summer here. We've actually had heat warnings,

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,209
which for us, hang on a sec. What is that in,

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:19,899
in

7
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:21,729
uh

8
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,389
86

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,620
Â°F, which I know is comically not hot by most us standards.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,229
But that's ok.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,370
That's ok. I would say

12
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,810
that is a normal temperature in the summer where I live and I live pretty far north.

13
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,939
If you go down to Arizona, it

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,650
is

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,139
winter,

16
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,090
right? They would laugh at you for the heat that's hot.

17
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:44,680
Although it is always funny where

18
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,919
I will go to the southern part of the United States.

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,150
And if I go in the summer, I look like I'm going to die and they're all fine.

20
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,080
And if I go in the winter I'm wearing shorts and a T

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,880
shirt and they're all bundled up and they're looking at me like,

22
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,340
where is this freak from?

23
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,260
That's my favorite memory. I went down to DC in January

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,209
and I checked the forecast and the stuff and I'm like, oh,

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,589
I'm not even bringing a jacket

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,669
and number two. And I'm like, oh, this is where all the Canadian geese go in winter.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,230
Yes, they all go south.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,089
-- Yeah. To DC.
-- I hate

29
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,709
-- those geese, man. I hate them so much, dude.
-- We hate them too.

30
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:24,919
They're, they're like, they, they won't get off the road.

31
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,569
Like, if you're driving on a road and there's geese on the road,

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,150
-- they won't get off the road.
-- They're, they're like the meanest creatures ever.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,040
It's lovely.

34
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:33,790
I

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,220
haven't heard a story in a long time but

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,349
for a while it felt like every spring there were

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,739
stories of geese attacking people coming out of stores because

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,720
they would build their nest next to the door.

39
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:49,470
And of course, then they, yeah, anyway. Ok, what are we talking about today?

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,910
-- Well, I was thinking about necessary evils
-- and

41
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,699
I'm interested in this topic for a variety of reasons.

42
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,230
So it's, I mean,

43
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,230
it was inspired by that politician that said something

44
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,410
I can't even try to repeat because it's so horrifically

45
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:06,180
horrible, stupid. But I was kind of thinking about, do we,

46
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,270
you know, like a great example is like, printers are a necessary evil.

47
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,860
Like, I love that. It's 2020

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,869
everybody still complains about what a pain in the butt it is to print.

49
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,610
Is that a necessary evil though? I don't think so.

50
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:21,210
I went to IKEA to get a quote on my kitchen cabinet stuff. And this poor lady,

51
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,520
she's like, ok. I just got to print it now and I'm like,

52
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,380
ok, and then like, two minutes later, I'm like, what do you like?

53
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,539
I'm just curious, like, what are you doing?

54
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,729
And she's like, I'm looking for the printer

55
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,029
and so she had to scroll through a list of every

56
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,369
printer in the building to find the one next to her.

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,809
She told this story a couple episodes ago.

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,809
I'm buying a new computer because this one, the video cards failing.

59
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,250
So we got a nice little purple line up and down my monitor. Honestly, I realize

60
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,649
the operating system doesn't matter because the one app that was specific

61
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,279
to Mac Os is now available as a web version as well.

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,050
So like literally the only app I need

63
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,029
it. Well, two apps I need is a web browser and an SSH client that's San

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,779
and something that'll run Linux like in a Docker which, well, everything will.

65
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,630
-- I
-- like how you added is San. If you have SSH, you don't need something that runs Linux,

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,860
you just SSH to Linux

67
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,990
and I realize I just,

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,304
the operating system is essentially a necessary evil at this point.

69
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,434
-- I don't care
-- is that there? I mean, so what's the definition of necessary evil?

70
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,524
I feel like we have a disconnect here.

71
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:19,514
Think about how much time and effort I'm going to spend maintaining and setting

72
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:22,964
up the operating system and tweaking settings and stuff just to get it going.

73
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,184
Like how much time do you spend being angry at

74
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:27,145
Mac Os Audio before you gave up and used Linux?

75
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,104
I more than I wish. Yeah.

76
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,330
Ok.

77
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,649
So here's a definition of necessary evil and this might, this,

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,119
we'll set the stage here.

79
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,380
It says a necessary evil is an evil that someone believes must be

80
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,369
done or accepted because it is necessary to achieve a better outcome.

81
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,660
So, printers,

82
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,630
I don't think printers are evil if I was going to, I mean, you can joke about that,

83
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,089
but like

84
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,050
in all seriousness, printers aren't evil.

85
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:54,970
I,

86
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,929
so the fact that they sell the ink jets now

87
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,210
with performance cartridges that like dry out and only have,

88
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,809
you know, like 50 pages in them.

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,529
But that's, that's the printer company

90
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:07,330
and they make printers that are evil.

91
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,210
This sounds like an episode of Futurama

92
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,009
our printers evil.

93
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:16,540
So,

94
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,890
but like the operating system is a great example because I think about like,

95
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,679
how much time did you spend setting up and

96
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,970
tweaking the operating system on your mobile devices?

97
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,130
-- Like almost
-- zero.

98
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,850
It was pretty low,

99
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,529
like

100
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,410
with a mac device as far as I can tell I logged in.

101
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,170
-- Uh oh, and I turned off the clicking noise when you type
-- on the on the phone,

102
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,329
I just leave mine on perpetually silent mode.

103
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:39,950
So I,

104
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,500
-- I don't hear any noises
-- and that's like literally all I did versus

105
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,230
like my desktop where I probably spent a good 10 to 20 hours

106
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,459
initially customizing it and then,

107
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,119
you know, every week or so I spend, what, half an hour updating apps,

108
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,600
updating the Os Docker.

109
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,019
-- Oh my God. Docker updates and then eats
-- itself.

110
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,920
That's because you're running a Mac if you run containers on Linux,

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,040
which is the whole, that is literally the reason I switched to Linux.

112
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,720
-- And
-- how much time do you spend running them?

113
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,359
I run containers for almost everything I do.

114
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,399
-- But
-- what I mean is how much time did you spend setting that up and getting it working?

115
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,730
I mean, almost none

116
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,500
almost

117
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:16,630
worked

118
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,089
seriously. Containers on Linux

119
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,329
are

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,890
-- beautiful
-- but like do you have them backed up and everything?

121
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,100
No, because I don't care. I use them as containers are meant to be used where they are

122
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,649
like, yeah, I spin them up. I do the things I need to do and then I throw them away

123
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:36,779
-- like most people are just, oh cool. I've reinvented vps poorly.
-- Right. Right.

124
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,940
No, no. II I try to use them

125
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,179
in a very containery way.

126
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,510
And actually the thing I love the most about them

127
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,799
is so obviously I work at elastic and there's elastic

128
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,959
search and cabana are like the two big kind of

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,130
things I have to deal with on a regular basis and

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,660
I consistently have to spin up all different versions all the time.

131
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,279
-- Yeah, that's one area where yeah, containers
-- I, I have,

132
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,269
I just have a little script like if I need to run version, let's say 7.5 0.2 I just,

133
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,179
I type run stack 7.5 0.2 and like magic.

134
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,940
And then like 10 seconds later I have running

135
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,670
well, but in fairness on the back end,

136
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,644
somebody did the heavy lifting of building containers that work properly.

137
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:18,404
Yeah, we did. And that's the whole point of containers.

138
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,614
That's why we have them.

139
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:22,834
No, I, I was trying to like,

140
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:26,125
passwords are a good example of a necessary evil where they passwords do

141
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,644
accomplish a lot of good right to keep people out of my account.

142
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,015
Right.

143
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:29,535
They,

144
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,565
they generally allow people secure access to their account and especially

145
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,285
if you use a good password and a password manager,

146
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:34,684
you're

147
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:35,894
honestly, it's,

148
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,380
you're not going to get like, unless you get fished,

149
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,559
they're not going to get into your account.

150
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,589
Generally speaking through you unless they

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,079
like hack Twitter's admin control panel.

152
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:44,429
And then,

153
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,109
well, it doesn't matter what you did.

154
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,350
Ok. So

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,869
I want to reframe this, I think because you're saying necessary evil.

156
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,339
But you know what I'm hearing, I'm hearing relic

157
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,940
-- of the past
-- and I think that's part of it, right?

158
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,459
Is things that were once good and new and shiny, you know,

159
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,339
tarnish over time and then turn into a necessary

160
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,859
evil where a great example is fax machines.

161
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:07,179
Apparently,

162
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,410
fax machines are still really big in health

163
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,179
care in the US because they're essentially,

164
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,380
they get a hipaa exemption,

165
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,239
right? There's all kinds of law.

166
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,399
So II I found out about this when I bought my first house.

167
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,079
And the reason is there were all these documents I had to send to the bank

168
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,079
and I was like, can I email them?

169
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,100
And this was back when like emailing documents was not something everyone could do.

170
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:34,359
Like I would email PDF S and people would say, how did you make a PDF?

171
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,519
And it's like I'm not telling you because

172
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:37,600
I run Linux

173
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,239
and I don't want to get into this,

174
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:39,640
but

175
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,190
it was a big deal. And I remember I said, can I email them?

176
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,679
And he said, no, you have to fax them or mail them to me? You can't.

177
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,390
Yeah, they don't have the workflow for that. Well, no, it wasn't workflow. Kurt.

178
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,829
It was, it was legal like the law specifically said mail.

179
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,220
In fact, it did not specifically say email.

180
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,609
Well,

181
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:59,869
because there's no precedent yet because people haven't used it enough

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,750
to actually end up in court where a judge is like,

183
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,450
yeah, I'll allow it.

184
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,290
Well, it's not even just that just like the law literally said it mail

185
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,540
-- facts. It did not say email like it was madness
-- on a complete tangent.

186
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,170
I just found out.

187
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,540
So in Italy,

188
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:16,160
85% of banks are now using the Korta Blockchain

189
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,339
to exchange data because back in the seventies and this

190
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,859
is quite ahead of its time for the seventies they

191
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,940
mandated that the banks would interchange data using tapes,

192
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,019
which back in the seventies, like, how else would you do it?

193
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,579
Right.

194
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,239
So the average time for reconciliation was between 3050

195
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,890
days. Right. And

196
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,207
I would, you know, well,

197
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:40,068
-- if you're swapping bank tapes around and you need to confirm stuff,
-- but 50 days is

198
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:40,828
dude,

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,429
ok,

200
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:44,309
money transfers from the US,

201
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:48,068
depending on what kind of money transfer it is can take a, you know, a couple of hours.

202
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:52,008
But if I get a check from the USA, lot of places want up to 20

203
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:54,309
sometimes 30 business days to clear it.

204
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,958
Because the U uh up until recently,

205
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,588
the US banking system was so slow to clear checks properly

206
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,909
and you now allow electronic images for clearing checks,

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,260
right?

208
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,510
Whereas before they literally had planes flying bags

209
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,109
of checks around the US every day,

210
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,500
which blows my mind.

211
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,299
But whatever,

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,190
like I literally remember getting paid by a check from the US and like

213
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,500
the bank sat on the funds for 30 business days is a long time.

214
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,950
That's a ridiculously long time.

215
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,150
Yeah, but that's how long it takes the check to actually clear,

216
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:23,429
you know,

217
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,039
back in the day nowadays, no big deal because you can use the electronic image,

218
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:27,179
right?

219
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,299
The bank images, it sends it off to Wells Fargo.

220
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:32,080
Wells Fargo is like, yeah, we, yep, that's a legit check,

221
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,530
clear it, you know, and that's, I think that's part of the biggest thing is

222
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,275
so there's the necessary evils that are like unnecessary evil from day one.

223
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:40,994
And then there's the necessary evils

224
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:45,104
that become necessary evils over time for, you know, either because it's, well,

225
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:46,864
mostly a relic of the past, like you said.

226
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,525
So I, I think

227
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:53,145
it's worth focusing on the relics of the past, especially in the context of security

228
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,590
because

229
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,869
I feel like, and I, man, I have so many stories I could tell about this, but

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,669
I feel like there's a lot of organizations, especially when it comes to,

231
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,890
I'll pick on passwords because they're easy where you can say things like

232
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,989
Nist said, don't do this.

233
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,854
And people will say, well, I don't believe them.

234
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:12,734
And it's like,

235
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:13,565
what?

236
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:18,195
Well or even better Nist did say this but then recanted because we have better data

237
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:22,724
now and we learned not to force people to swap their passwords every like 67 minutes.

238
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,525
-- The
-- thing
-- that kills me is

239
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:28,190
I will show people the statements by Ness and the

240
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,549
research even that says this is a bad idea.

241
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,109
And people will literally say, I don't believe that.

242
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:33,969
Well, people,

243
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:36,859
this is the central thing about the scientific method that drives me

244
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,989
nuts is that one of the most fundamental premises of the scientific method

245
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,659
is that we have a framework and methodology to

246
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,609
sort of determine reality and interact with it sensibly.

247
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,260
And as part of that framework,

248
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,340
-- it's self modifying. Well,
-- so I don't think everyone understands that.

249
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,229
Exactly.

250
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,020
And so like,

251
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,280
there's lots of things where it's like, well, we used to say this but then, well,

252
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,690
we found out new data and we were wrong.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,419
So

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,880
I have a great,

255
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,200
you know what my favorite example of this actually is I have another side project.

256
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm not going to go into just yet because it's really early, but it's,

257
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,559
it's the same problem of,

258
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,090
I look at my blog post, I wrote about CV S S3 scores and like,

259
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,880
I started out looking to disparage NVD.

260
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,039
Like that was literally my goal was basically to be like,

261
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,140
these people don't know how to use CV SS.

262
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,320
And by the end, I'm like, wait,

263
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,469
it's not NV, D's fault at all. Like CV SS just sucks.

264
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,780
Well, it's, it's the relic of an, of a, of a more gentlemanly time. It definitely

265
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:33,409
is.

266
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,659
But it's one of those things where it's like

267
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:40,289
over the course of extracting my revenge. Like

268
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,140
I ended up in a completely different place and you think about that.

269
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,690
I could have easily just said, screw it. I don't care. NVD sucks.

270
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm going with this written a Rage post.

271
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,099
And at the same time, I'm like, part of me, I'm just, every time I think about it,

272
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,890
I laugh out loud because I,

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,559
I ended up in such a weirdly different place.

274
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,270
And so, like,

275
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,929
my other project is I'm working on

276
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,729
something to basically measure container scanning.

277
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:04,070
Right.

278
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,890
And

279
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,549
it turns out the numbers are nothing like I expected them to be because I thought, oh,

280
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,429
this scanner is going to do really bad.

281
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,510
I'm like, no, they're all the freaking same. They

282
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,179
-- all the same. They all suck, but they're all the same. I'm like, this is
-- ridiculous.

283
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,820
Any scientist would go wait. You found weird data.

284
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,250
That is totally at odds with your conceptions. That's awesome.

285
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,809
-- Yeah.
-- Right. No, I agree.

286
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,700
It's very exciting when something isn't what you thought it was,

287
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,650
but a normal person would be like, I don't like those results.

288
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,580
I'm throwing them away.

289
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,440
Right.

290
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,049
A lot of people do that.

291
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:38,109
-- You
-- know, I just, I don't like these results. I'm going to ignore them.

292
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:44,369
I mean, we, we suffer that now with just the, the politicalization of, you know,

293
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,719
reality. I agree with that.

294
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:52,760
We have anti mass protesters up here in Canada and I'm like, really,

295
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,380
-- uh
-- we, we have plenty of, I,

296
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,530
I know people man that are talking about how none of this

297
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,090
is real and we're all wasting our time and it's like,

298
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:04,239
all right, look, here's the deal and this is even true of security is

299
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,479
there are actions you can take

300
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,590
that.

301
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:08,679
We say

302
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,359
the worst case scenario is they don't work and so nothing matters.

303
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:16,840
The best case scenario is they do work but not doing them can have a negative effect.

304
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,169
So here's the thing, I would rather do something

305
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,239
that maybe doesn't work for a net zero effect

306
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,630
than not do something that ends up being negative,

307
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:25,830
right.

308
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,039
The problem is traditionally,

309
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,359
is a lot of those things did have a cost associated with them.

310
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:31,640
And if you did all of them, you,

311
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,859
you'd kind of like waste a bunch of time and effort doing nothing of use,

312
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:35,760
especially if it worked.

313
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,549
Right. Your management is like, well, we didn't get hacked.

314
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,320
Why did we spend all this money on firewalls?

315
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,590
But the problem is now a lot of those security measures are dirt cheap.

316
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,710
Like firewall is

317
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,739
built in, like to Amazon and Digital Ocean and everything.

318
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,280
Like there's a control panel where I don't run firewalls on my hosts anymore because

319
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,390
it's done at the Amazon level probably five or six years ago.

320
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,179
I stopped doing firewall on all my servers because

321
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,349
I do it at the Amazon level. It's better.

322
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,210
It is.

323
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:05,710
-- The management is much nicer and you can control,
-- well, and I don't have to accident,

324
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,039
like hands up who here has locked themselves

325
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:11,000
out accidentally by changing a firewall rule.

326
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,590
And like, you know what I mean?

327
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,950
Like, it drops your SS a connection and you can't get back in.

328
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,309
I think it's been at least a week since I've done that.

329
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,210
Yeah.

330
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,419
Yeah.

331
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:19,859
You know,

332
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,849
and I love the fact that like all my servers are SSH

333
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:26,539
only allows specific IP S and then when my IP randomly changes.

334
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,469
Oh, ok. I just log into Aws and change the IP. I'm not locked out of my server.

335
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,250
Yeah, I've done that too more than once.

336
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,059
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,580
So, I mean, so, no, no, this is,

338
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,619
this is a good topic and I think this is a good context to kind of explore it is.

339
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,299
I, I always imagine

340
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
there is

341
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:45,080
II, I like number lines in my brain. I don't know why that is.

342
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,940
It's just something about me. So imagine there's, there's zero cost, right?

343
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,229
In terms of what happens?

344
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,780
And you can imagine that

345
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:57,903
spending money we could think of as, as being a negative cost, right?

346
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:01,812
-- Obviously, so you spend money on security.
-- I would say it's worse.

347
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,922
You spend attention and time because I can always get more money,

348
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,502
but I can't get more attention and time.

349
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,572
-- I mean,
-- that's a good point,

350
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:12,223
especially these days where hiring anybody is a freaking nightmare.

351
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,622
And I mean, that's a good point. But

352
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:17,685
you get the idea where there's that we'll just say resources, right?

353
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,926
You spend resources on security.

354
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,166
I would just say that there's,

355
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,046
there's some resources that are horrifically fine out.

356
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:27,306
Like both I and Jeff Bezos only have 24 hours in a day. That is very true.

357
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,036
Now, monetarily, obviously, yes,

358
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:31,625
he's got a little bit more money than me and you can buy time.

359
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:35,385
I'm guessing he's never, you know, unloaded his dishwasher this decade.

360
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,869
I, I

361
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,729
don't know,

362
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,700
-- you know, I don't know,
-- I mean, it's funny,

363
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,049
some of those people are strangely normal.

364
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,729
I don't know if he is or not. So,

365
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,450
the funny story I have there actually is. So

366
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,890
there's a story from Melinda Gates when Bill and Melinda gates',

367
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,320
Children were young, she would make him drive the kids to school.

368
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,869
I think that's awesome. Yeah, it is.

369
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,530
-- It was part of being like a father in a normal house
-- because

370
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,770
that's actually one of the things I enjoy most with my kids.

371
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,479
Yeah. Yeah. So the funny thing though is because he did that.

372
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,130
All the other parents dropping kids off would tell

373
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,072
your husband's,

374
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:09,921
you can bring the kids to school if Bill Gates can do it, you can do it

375
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,471
when you, when you look at the opportunity cost on his time.

376
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:18,692
It's just like, I imagine like his car odometer, like, just like a spinning,

377
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:19,091
you know,

378
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,171
it's like that number spinning.

379
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,461
So $17 million you have the kids out.

380
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,281
But anyway, anyway, here's my point. Here's my point. Right. So

381
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:28,812
as humans,

382
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,541
we, we always think, oh,

383
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:34,531
I spent money on this thing but we sometimes it's very difficult to justify like, oh,

384
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:35,533
so you spent,

385
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,693
let's say a million resources we'll just use as

386
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,963
our made up term a million resources on security.

387
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,854
But you saved 3 million resources by not getting hacked.

388
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:47,523
-- But how do you prove something like that? Right. That's super
-- hard. Number one.

389
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,424
How do you measure that. And number two. Yeah. How do you prove it?

390
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:53,343
Like a great example of this is Garmin. Right. Garmin just recently got

391
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,273
ransomware, they're saying.

392
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:58,643
And I love, yeah, they're like, no data was stolen or got lost.

393
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:02,953
It's just, you know, all of our products haven't worked for a few days and,

394
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:03,934
and, and, you know,

395
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:07,086
ok. Fitbit, whatever. Yeah, it's annoying. But

396
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:07,776
like, they,

397
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,415
they make software for the aviation industry and

398
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,656
so there's pilots who can't file flight plans.

399
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,586
Oh, I suppose I didn't even think of that.

400
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:17,576
I was only thinking of their, like, human devices.

401
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,776
No, no, no, there's like they make, um, like a really nicely integrated, like,

402
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:24,255
it's not just an ipad app but it's also like flight electronics, gps, like

403
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:27,625
the whole, like you got a nice little Cessna or whatever and you want to, you know,

404
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,526
they call it nextgen equipment, blah, blah, blah.

405
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:30,885
And it, it is nice stuff.

406
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:33,336
Like, it's, you know, I've, I've seen some videos where these

407
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,588
pilots are using this stuff and it's like, wow, that's actually really nice. Yeah,

408
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,378
-- none of that stuff works.
-- That's something, man.

409
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:41,057
The part of the problem too is,

410
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,927
is not only how do you measure that you didn't get hacked or you

411
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:48,907
did get hacked or what the efficacy of this security controller or strategy is,

412
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:51,197
but how do you measure it against a new one?

413
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,657
Like, do you do a double blind trial,

414
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,728
run both separately at two different companies for

415
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,057
a year and see which one gets hacked,

416
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,078
sort of.

417
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:01,137
So there is actually some I've done, I've started doing some reading.

418
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,738
There is at, at work,

419
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,619
we have some,

420
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,439
we'll say lawyers on our security team that

421
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:10,420
are becoming very interested in something called the

422
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,569
Fair Institute and Fair is all capitalized and

423
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,959
it stands for something I don't remember.

424
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,979
But fundamentally what it comes down to is it is a way to start

425
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,880
kind of quantifying your risk and assigning monetary values

426
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,810
in many cases to it to say that.

427
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,260
Ok, so if this thing gets hacked, it's going to cost us a million dollars.

428
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,449
And let's say,

429
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:31,849
and,

430
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,550
and obviously the million dollars accounts for

431
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,300
reputational loss and things like that.

432
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,459
Right. I'm just oversimplifying

433
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,689
here. I love when we do this reputational loss and like, I've never actually,

434
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,810
-- as far as I know it, actuaries
-- have like data for that.

435
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:46,234
They, they actually do, which is mind boggling to me because in my brain,

436
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:47,084
I'm like whatever.

437
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:47,954
But I mean,

438
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:49,805
because garment obviously right now is suffering

439
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:52,525
reputational loss for what's happening to them.

440
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,685
I always wonder about that because it's not like, you know,

441
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:58,744
somebody's going to just ditch on their flight software.

442
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:04,295
I mean, probably not, but when it comes time to buy my next flight software device.

443
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:08,954
Oh yeah, I, I specifically ditched on Fitbit because their stupid area scale won't,

444
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:13,560
it will not import my data into Apple health, but I can buy an $8 app. That does it

445
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,150
right.

446
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,390
That's stupid.

447
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,989
But so anyway, anyway, the idea being

448
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:18,729
there's ok.

449
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:22,040
So if this gets hacked, it's going to cost us a million dollars, let's say.

450
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:22,829
And

451
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,310
-- so if we invested, let's say, does it
-- also quantify the chance of you getting hacked?

452
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,849
Uh, yeah, there's sort of, there's some of that, it gets really complicated.

453
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,349
I don't totally understand it yet.

454
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,949
I'm like just getting into this and it intrigues me

455
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,829
because I have been harping about measuring security for decades now.

456
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:45,449
And this is literally the only I think quantifiable solution I

457
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,449
have seen to date that I would say wasn't garbage.

458
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:48,770
So

459
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,449
I don't know, I don't know if it's going to make sense or not.

460
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:55,469
Well, so the thing I've always seen is getting the data to feed into that system.

461
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,910
Right. Right. So here's where it gets cool. Right.

462
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,550
Here's where it gets cool is so there's obviously actuarial data for part of this,

463
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:08,349
there's a security team can offer certain data as well based upon things like,

464
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,130
you know, this is how effective this particular tool is.

465
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,400
Like a great example is a firewall.

466
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,599
We know firewalls are extremely effective, right?

467
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,359
And then it is up to the legal department at your organization to basically say

468
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,030
this is how valuable we think this is.

469
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,719
And obviously legal departments have that skill

470
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,109
because legal departments are always making,

471
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,069
I don't know if I'd call it an estimate.

472
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,390
But, you know, like part of their job is saying this is what the risk is.

473
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,150
How likely are we to get sued?

474
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,890
Right. Exactly.

475
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,199
Money.

476
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,459
Right. And what is that worth to us?

477
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:46,989
And so this is an interesting melding of security and law and insurance in ways

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,949
-- I honestly never thought of
-- that makes sense

479
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,750
because having the legal department handle it,

480
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,890
like they are kind of the adults in the room for that kind of risk management.

481
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Well, not only that, look, I'm,

482
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,790
I'm gonna say this out loud and it's going to sound funny,

483
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,430
but

484
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,319
I don't want to get blamed. They will. Right.

485
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:10,010
Well, and that's part of their, I don't want to say that's part of their culture

486
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,709
is

487
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,510
they accept the blame and they,

488
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,790
and, and it's not,

489
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,329
yeah, that's something I find interesting because that's,

490
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,619
that's one thing I do appreciate about lawyers is, you know, they, they,

491
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,869
they offer a vigorous defense or offense and they,

492
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,430
they own their failure of their success.

493
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,229
Right. Right. And, and, like, look as a security person,

494
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,050
we already have enough pressure and enough problems

495
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,739
accepting unnecessary blame

496
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,329
is a stress I rarely want.

497
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,209
And I mean,

498
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:39,030
this is something I'm always mindful of is I'll work with someone who's like,

499
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,829
brand new and they're like, oh, I don't know about this.

500
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,479
I'm like, look, if it goes south, blame me

501
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,066
and it's like, I know, I, like, I can I can stand up to this fire if it happens,

502
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,306
like you won't.

503
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:50,836
And that's part of the challenge too is like, you know,

504
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,485
constructive blame versus just

505
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,586
-- anger
-- blame.

506
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:57,026
Right. Well, and lawyers also, they know how to talk about things.

507
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,026
So if you show up and you start yelling at them,

508
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,735
they're going to probably make you feel really bad in

509
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:04,505
a couple of minutes because it's literally what they do.

510
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:07,465
So we've decided that lawyers are good.

511
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:08,641
Lawyers have always,

512
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:16,161
passwords are dumb. They're not bad. There's a difference.

513
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:20,751
Passwords have always been dumb. It's just they're dumber now than they used to be.

514
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:21,812
It's

515
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,121
well and in fairness though 20 years ago, we did not have good alternatives.

516
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:27,911
-- But now
-- we know alternatives.

517
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,979
This is like,

518
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,449
you know what my comparison here is always

519
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,729
is you look at like developing nations and they often have

520
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:41,319
horrendous environmental policies and in some ways you can argue,

521
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:41,479
well,

522
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,500
they need that because like you can't build a solar

523
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,770
panel until you build a coal fired power plant.

524
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,229
And like

525
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,609
that is correct.

526
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,430
I play a

527
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:49,162
of a factorial.

528
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:53,422
So yeah, I'm just actually in the process of transitioning from steam power

529
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:59,022
and coal based, you know, smelting to solar panels, energy accumulators and parks.

530
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:04,223
But the downside is man, my, my oil processing plants and my chemical plants are like

531
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:07,463
that's a dark red spot on the map for pollution

532
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,703
like it's bad

533
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,316
-- and the biters are getting angry
-- and, and right, I,

534
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:15,926
I understand this and I think that right, passwords are

535
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:18,556
the, the oil powered,

536
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:21,666
you know, electricity plants of days of Yore.

537
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:25,426
And we've reached a point now where we need renewable energy.

538
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:29,026
Not your, like, oil soaked passwords. Get rid of them.

539
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:30,836
That's not, that's not healthy.

540
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:31,810
And

541
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,900
it, it,

542
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,060
it,

543
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,010
it's like anything. Right.

544
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,890
There's always these transitions and I feel like in security we are on the verge

545
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,310
of the next thing.

546
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,290
And I think part of that though is you can't,

547
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,170
you can't make progress until you have a scientific method.

548
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,530
Essentially. That says this is good.

549
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,969
-- This is bad.
-- How do you make progress? How do you know it's progress?

550
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:55,900
Exactly.

551
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,729
Exactly.

552
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,699
So, and I mean,

553
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,189
I think the one ace in the hole we have right

554
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:03,369
now is we've magically got a computer in everybody's pocket,

555
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,130
right?

556
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,369
-- Smartphones
-- for you mean multi factor authentication

557
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,449
for,

558
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:11,550
I don't know what the future is but everybody's carrying around a computer now.

559
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,109
And that makes a whole pile of stuff possible. That just was not before.

560
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,609
Like I don't even ignoring multi factor authentication, stuff like

561
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,479
sending and receiving messages data.

562
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:24,410
Like it was so frustrating when I was so I injured my thumb

563
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,280
and I'm talking with health link, you know,

564
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,060
which is 811 on most phones in North America now.

565
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,540
And I'm like, oh, you know, I'm trying to explain to her and I'm like, no,

566
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,390
there's not like a drill in my thumb.

567
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,109
Like no, there's not a screw in my thumb. It's, can I just send you a picture?

568
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,729
Like, really? It's, if I could just send you a picture, this is

569
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,729
so much easier and she's like, unfortunately we can't yet accept that.

570
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:43,979
And it was like, well, ok, yeah, that's our, you know,

571
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,189
but I know the police locally, for example,

572
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:49,630
are they now have a dedicated email addresses?

573
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,209
You know, where they're like for this case,

574
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:54,209
send your stuff to whatever eps something,

575
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,880
something at Edmonton police service dot C A or whatever their email address is.

576
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,260
And so you can actually send them, you know, links or

577
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,869
a photograph

578
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:05,150
because I mean, quite frankly, like,

579
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,949
well,

580
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,290
how often now do the police say there was

581
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,479
an incident at this time and date this location?

582
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:13,319
If anybody has dash cam footage, can they please send it to us?

583
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,160
-- I have never heard that. Oh, well,
-- that happens all the time here in Canada

584
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,630
and more to the point,

585
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:19,989
especially as a cop,

586
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,540
I would way rather have your dash cam footage than like you try to

587
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,939
explain what happened and what you think you saw at three in the morning.

588
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:29,800
Eyewitness testimony has been proven time and time again to be worse than nothing.

589
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,410
Pretty

590
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,150
much. I mean, it's, it's useless. Ok, so I want to back up for one second.

591
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,199
You said something. Uh

592
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,829
So you said you dialed 811

593
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:39,310
that's like what non

594
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,359
emergency,

595
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:40,939
it's health.

596
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,760
It's the, the, the health care,

597
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,880
like you talk to a nurse and they're like, yeah,

598
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,119
like their advice was you need to go to see a proper doctor in 3 to 4 hours.

599
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,280
We don't have anything like that here. I, I,

600
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:55,910
11 is who you call before you dig a hole in your yard to come mark out the,

601
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:56,829
we,

602
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,770
we don't, the slogan here now is click before you dig.

603
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,510
It used to be dial before you dig. But then they got a website.

604
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,589
Yeah, that's fair.

605
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:07,229
-- So, it's
-- literally click before you dig because,

606
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,189
yeah, why would you use? The phone?

607
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,910
Phones are dumb. I agree.

608
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,849
Like, man, my phone has been going crazy, stupid politicians.

609
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,510
That's all it is. It's like surveys and political ads and I'm like, I'm gonna,

610
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,790
-- I don't answer my phone anymore. It's, I hate it. It's useless.
-- Yeah.

611
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,300
No, there's a bunch, like 411 is the director. I think that's pretty much universal.

612
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:31,829
Yeah, we have that one. Although even that, I don't, who uses that? Like, I don't,

613
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,750
I did use it once. I was out in the boonies and didn't have a good data connection.

614
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,800
I haven't used it in probably 30 plus years is my guess.

615
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,609
Well, and the funny thing is now it's automated

616
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,760
mostly

617
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:49,569
that you talk to a computer and then if you ask something tricky enough you hear

618
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,229
the human go tap, tap tap, tap, tap. Did you mean this? 00, here you go.

619
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:56,390
And then, and, but the best part is the human doesn't answer. She's like, bye.

620
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,510
-- And then, like, the computer voice reads it out.
-- Ah, interesting.

621
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,380
-- So, they basically turned it into mechanical Turk work.
-- That's cool. That's cool.

622
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,939
Anyway, anyway, we're, we're in a rat hole, which is,

623
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,369
which is the only thing we're good at.

624
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:11,359
But, ok, ok. We are running ourselves out of time.

625
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,750
But I feel like I want to try to sum all

626
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,930
this up because I think we've covered a lot of ground,

627
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:18,119
not necessarily on purpose, but that's part of the fun.

628
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:22,800
How do we measure stuff so that we can know what forward progress is.

629
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,569
I would go even farther back in the discussion and say, like we started talking about

630
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,420
necessary evils and then we talked about kind of wrapping the old way

631
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:37,949
into the modern, which is often viewed as bad

632
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,489
or unacceptable in many ways.

633
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,750
Well,

634
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,459
because you end up with fax machines and test

635
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:44,699
results that take like days or weeks to process,

636
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:45,229
right?

637
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,349
And so I feel like

638
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:48,349
the,

639
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:53,540
the real challenge for us and when we look at all of this stuff is

640
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,900
we just need ways to say this makes sense for these reasons.

641
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,709
And something like obviously being able to

642
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,829
measure what you're doing is hugely important

643
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,060
because let's face it.

644
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:09,310
-- If you, if you can't measure what you do, it's basically just voodoo and
-- witchcraft.

645
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,670
How much stuff have we seen on Twitter and whatnot with people, you know,

646
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,869
basically being asked to come back into the office so that they can, you know,

647
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,099
so that their boss knows they're working.

648
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,109
And it's like,

649
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,400
wow, you're, you know, if, if you have somebody doing work for you and you can't

650
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,550
me, like, especially white collar work and you can't measure it remotely.

651
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,390
You have to have to, like, stare at them doing it and make sure they're doing it

652
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:31,400
that's broken.

653
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,660
I know people like that that are in those kind of positions. And now I would argue

654
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,689
that in that situation,

655
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:43,709
what that really means is you have ineffective or managers that don't need to exist

656
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,280
and people claiming, oh, we have to open the office. People have to come in.

657
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,770
I have to watch what they're doing is one of those situations of

658
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,500
people are going to figure out I don't have any work to do

659
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:57,130
and they're going to fire me if I don't do these things

660
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,109
and that's a whole different problem by all means.

661
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,689
But I, I agree fundamentally if, if you're working from home

662
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,290
and people don't know what you're doing, like what,

663
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,040
what's going on here, right.

664
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,810
That, that's bad. Management is what that is.

665
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,729
And unfortunately the management rarely gets blamed,

666
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:17,040
but whatever, whatever, that's a whole,

667
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,130
that's another can of worms we're not going to touch today.

668
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,150
So.

669
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:23,849
Ok. Ok. So

670
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,920
let's bring it all home. Right. We are in a place in security today

671
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,260
that I think

672
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,319
things are going to get better.

673
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,729
But I don't know if they're going to get better in the way we think they are.

674
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,170
I would say overall the trend has been to better,

675
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,619
but with these sort of legs where things got a bit uglier for a while

676
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,920
and then started to get better again. I mean, that's probably fair

677
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,359
and that's kind of normal. But I think overall we're,

678
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:50,329
well,

679
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,979
we're starting to gain the benefits and reap

680
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:54,369
the reward of cloud computing and other people like

681
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,030
handling basic infrastructure, stuff like backup power, you know,

682
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,750
where just stuff is way more reliable than, you know, you can do it on site

683
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:03,150
without a lot of effort.

684
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,479
And even then look at cloud computing,

685
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:09,880
I remember probably a decade ago there were loads of people that were like, oh,

686
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,670
the cloud is just someone else's computer

687
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:14,782
-- and there's people who still say that even if,
-- yeah, and you know what?

688
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,692
It's true and it's fine like that car

689
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:19,623
manufacturing plant is just someone else's manufacturing plant.

690
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:24,662
Like I'm not going to make my own car parts. I'm gonna go to Napa or Canadian tire.

691
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:25,662
I won't argue.

692
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,463
There are times when running your own gear

693
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,142
makes sense and there's times it doesn't like,

694
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:31,902
you know what I mean?

695
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:33,936
I don't, I don't generate my own electricity. I

696
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:37,995
don't, I don't have a, well, in my backyard that I pull water out of, like I would,

697
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:40,855
there's more, there's easier ways to do this

698
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:45,495
and, and I think, yeah, it, this is how everything goes. Right.

699
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:46,436
And, and I also,

700
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:49,645
I guess 11 kind of thing to add to this is I

701
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:52,215
was having a discussion with someone just the other day is,

702
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,926
I think security teams are historically notorious for.

703
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,576
That's my job. Go away.

704
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:58,416
And

705
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,895
sometimes we have to be like,

706
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,079
you know, what, if you want to do this,

707
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,319
go do it. Good luck. It's hard.

708
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:07,599
And that's ok. Right. Sometimes it's ok to say

709
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,520
I'm, I can't be in charge of everything.

710
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,020
I can't control everything and I, I don't think we're good at that.

711
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,250
Well,

712
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,000
traditionally we got heavily punished for stuff going wrong

713
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,839
whether or not it was under our control.

714
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:17,160
Yeah, that's,

715
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,640
we're going to blame. Right.

716
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,449
And, and I suppose if, if something did go wrong and you told people no,

717
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:23,439
or you just did nothing.

718
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,170
You're like, well, you didn't give me the money to, to buy that firewall.

719
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,400
So I told you this would happen

720
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:28,589
and,

721
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,420
or I, I told them they can't run that website but they did anyway.

722
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,510
And then we got hacked. So, not my fault.

723
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,109
That's an interesting topic too. We should talk about someday.

724
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,540
It's just kind of that, that security mindset and how we got to where we are.

725
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,040
One

726
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,849
-- painful, well, meaning decision at a time. I mean, yeah,
-- that's fair.

727
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,599
Like I really, as a child,

728
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:52,180
I never really understood the hotel was paid with good intentions.

729
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,130
But now having seen like government process and had it explained to me, I'm like,

730
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,540
oh God, yes.

731
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:58,459
Yeah,

732
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,979
-- to see how we got there.
-- I mean, that's probably fair.

733
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,680
That's probably fair.

734
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,689
Anyway, that's a topic for another day. I'm not, we're out of time.

735
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,800
All right, I'm going to call it. So, thank you, Kurt.
