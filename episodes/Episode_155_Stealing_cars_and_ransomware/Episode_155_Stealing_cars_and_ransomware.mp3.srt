Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,449
episode 155 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,350
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,550
So, what's new man?

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,079
Uh, actually not much.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,350
It's been a nice summer except with a lot of rain because of the jet stream.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,510
It is true.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,899
There has been an insane amount of rain

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,030
and unfortunately for the poor farmers,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,459
they have had a struggle to plant anything in their fields

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,740
which I'm sure is going to get us come winter and spring

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,229
because all of the food will be expensive.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,389
Yeah, my understanding is meat prices are going to go way up.

13
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,709
So, I guess now is the time to buy your half ac and stick it in your freezer. Right.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,360
Me,

15
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,569
I like food.

16
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,250
Yes, it is true. It is true.

17
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:50,380
I,

18
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:53,459
I feel like every year during the summer it kind of quiets down

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,799
and I think honestly part of it is just maybe because people are,

20
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,590
you know, outside having fun instead of, you know,

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,840
on their computers trying to raise a ruckus,

22
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,630
whatever man, everything's on fire all the time.

23
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:07,190
But it's like, it's just an exciting fire. Yeah, it's, I, I, honestly there's,

24
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,809
well, we both struggled to find anything truly interesting for the show.

25
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:14,809
And, I mean, the best I could do was, you know, 75 Mercedes cars got stolen in one day,

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,529
which is

27
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,839
amusing and

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,419
quite well, I imagine that's a bit of money right there.

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,129
Yeah, probably because Mercedes are generally on the high end.

30
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:27,930
So I guess it was the Mercedes sl, a sedans and G A sport utility vehicles.

31
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,199
So those are who,

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,279
those are a bit pricey. Are they $100,000 each?

33
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,739
Oh, no, these are the cheap ones. Sorry, these are like a 53,000 us max.

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,559
That's still a lot of money.

35
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,769
No, these are the, the ones that have the uh the, yeah, they're only,

37
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:49,589
I wanna say only like 50 grand but still 50 grand times 75 is that's uh three

38
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:52,742
$0.7 million at the top end.

39
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:56,023
But what's funny to me is, is how do you think they got stolen?

40
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:01,333
I will let you tell the story because you're way more excited about this than I am.

41
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:04,612
But it's a very interesting story to say the least

42
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,453
car to go is a car sharing service that

43
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,705
was actually introduced by the maker Daimler A G,

44
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:11,936
which is the parent company.

45
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,565
My understanding is a lot of these car companies are bidding to understand that

46
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:15,716
it's not so much that they make

47
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,085
cars but that they're transportation service companies.

48
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,166
So they're sort of trying to transition into instead of selling you a car,

49
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,345
selling you like a transportation solution, you know, basically like Uber.

50
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:29,035
Uh so when you kind of like, just let somebody grab your car and take off with it,

51
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:29,975
typically

52
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:34,705
you have sort of background checks or some degree of checking

53
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:37,425
to make sure that this person will care if you,

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,899
if they steal your car and you charge them with it. Right? Because uh

55
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,990
you don't want, you know, for example, some destitute,

56
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,669
like you're not going to let a homeless person rent a

57
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:48,410
Mercedes car because like you charge them with car theft,

58
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,240
they're not going to care.

59
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,520
Not, not just that, the other way I would look at it is if I give you my credit card

60
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,399
and I steal a $300 scooter,

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,639
you can probably charge $300 to my credit card and get it.

62
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,800
If I take a car

63
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,300
and you have my credit card,

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,669
you're not going to be charging $50,000 to my credit card.

65
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,839
Just a minor pre off.

66
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,039
Right.

67
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,720
So they, they apparently did background checks

68
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:17,240
and then apparently they loosened up the background checks

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,759
and so what could possibly go wrong? Exactly.

70
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,639
And, but what was really fascinating was not so much this because honestly, this is,

71
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,639
I'm not going to say it's expected, but it's not shocking.

72
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,429
But what's really fascinating to me is it's, it's expected.

73
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,199
Kurt it's totally expected.

74
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,070
There was a really interesting thread on hacker news with a bunch of people

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,050
chiming in about their experiences at various companies with this kind of thing.

76
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:38,149
And,

77
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,649
and one thing was, for example,

78
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,520
was what a lot of companies have tried to do because here's the thing,

79
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:46,009
companies don't want to do proper background checks because those cost money.

80
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
Right. You have to pay for them.

81
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,699
When I joined Scouts, Canada, I had to get a police background check

82
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:50,529
which

83
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,009
like costs money and you know, I'm not gonna, you know, if car to go is like,

84
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,210
you need to go get your police truck and mail it to us.

85
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,600
I'd be like, I'm no, like I'm not going to, that's just it, there's two sides to that.

86
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,529
It costs the company money from the perspective of doing

87
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,809
the background check and maybe you charge the customer whatever.

88
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,669
I don't care. Well, ultimately they always charge the customer.

89
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,289
The bar to entry is sky high at that point and you're right,

90
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,070
it becomes a matter of, oh, I'm not going to do that.

91
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,230
I'll just call an Uber. Right. Right. Seriously. And I will tie this back as well.

92
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,589
So in the U SI have my credit locked

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,390
where

94
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,910
you basically can't,

95
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,570
no one can, can do anything with my credit unless I unlock it and unlocking. It sucks.

96
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,380
And so that's actually had the side effect of

97
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,690
if the few times I've thought about maybe going to

98
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,529
get a loan for a car or something or whatever.

99
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,589
I'm like, ah, that's so much work I don't want to. So I just haven't,

100
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:43,869
it's like a friend of mine.

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:43,890
Uh,

102
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,859
she had a credit card for emergencies only and she found

103
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,000
herself using it for online shopping once in a while.

104
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:53,390
So she froze it in a block of ice in her freezer.

105
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:57,619
That's definitely an emergency. Whatever worked, man.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,049
So, what a lot of companies have been doing is

107
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:03,100
you take a picture of your driver's license or?

108
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,260
Well, in this case,

109
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,290
it would have to be a driver's license

110
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,000
because you probably should have a driver's license.

111
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,459
If you're using a car share service, one would hope.

112
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,540
Um, but other places, you know, they'll use a passport or ID card or whatever

113
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,019
and

114
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,149
no offense. But that's, it's not hard to get a hold of a picture of somebody's ID

115
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,029
or

116
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,269
just to borrow their ID or steal it or whatever.

117
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,589
There's, I mean, there's entire, we've talked about this in the past where there's,

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,390
you know, with passport security, there's entire

119
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,269
communities where it's not really seen as such a big deal to

120
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,070
lend out your passport to people that kind of look like you

121
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,329
or they cut out your picture or whatever.

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,869
So what they'll do is, you know,

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,070
we need a picture of your driver's license and we need a picture of you,

124
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,410
right? Because what could go wrong?

125
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,350
Well, I think they wanted you with the driver's license. Right.

126
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:48,290
I think I read which in theory raises the bar slightly but probably not that much.

127
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,649
Yeah, except Photoshop.

128
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,769
So, anyways, this one person was talking about how they tried that

129
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,920
and they had a whole bunch of fraud and what

130
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:58,130
they found was when they did reverse image searches.

131
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,760
It was all pictures of like us senators and famous people.

132
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,000
And so what these people were doing

133
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,130
was simply taking the driver's license pictures,

134
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,760
they could like harvest or otherwise get a hold of

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,239
uh you know, take the picture of the person and then use like a reverse image search

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,760
to find images that were relatively close to that.

137
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:18,320
And let's face it. If you're not paying a human to validate these

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,799
and you're doing it with a machine learning A I type system,

139
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,179
it's gonna be super easy to fool whatever man. Even even if it's people,

140
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,500
how many have you looked at people's ID pictures? It

141
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,940
they never look like themselves. It's

142
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,320
Yeah, what do people know? I mean? Right.

143
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,739
As long as you basically have this bright color hair and skin tone,

144
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,989
they're going to pass it here in Alberta.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,459
At least my driver's license photo was black and it's gray scale, right?

146
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,299
It's not my passport and my nexus card.

147
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,209
Uh actually my next yeah, my Nexus card is color if I remember, right?

148
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,179
My passport is definitely color but yeah, my driver's license is uh,

149
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,660
it's gray scale, which I always found odd because, yeah, I mean,

150
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,829
it would be much easier to fake that because now you are missing

151
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,839
tons of skin tone information or even hair color to a degree.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,850
Well, I, and I love that the lady at the DMV

153
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:09,005
last time said she would let me keep my hair color as brown on

154
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:12,095
my license form and I didn't have to change it to gray yet.

155
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,464
Old man.

156
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,595
Pretty much. Yeah.

157
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,445
No, I hear you actually. That's a good point.

158
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:18,535
I have to go get a new driver's license soon

159
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:19,415
and

160
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,894
I need to, I haven't even thought about that.

161
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,894
I'll have to ask him like, what is my hair color now? I don't know.

162
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:26,855
It's brownish.

163
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,690
So, and it,

164
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,230
it got me thinking because realistically there's a lot of businesses

165
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:35,309
where I need to entrust you with something that's pretty expensive.

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,970
Like, um, you know, I've rented stuff from Home Depot where

167
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,609
that stuff is easily worth of a couple of grand. Sure. Yeah. Some of those tools.

168
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,239
Well, or you can rent those little baby back

169
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,010
from them. I rented a bobcat once. That was fine.

170
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,190
It's, it's really cool for an hour and then it gets really boring

171
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:56,250
and it was, it was better than going to the amusement park to say the least.

172
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,010
I, I rather enjoyed it. But, yeah, you're right. I mean, I bet that was Crepes.

173
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,359
I bet that thing was $100,000 at least.

174
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,540
And I don't remember giving them any,

175
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:08,739
anything other than a driver's license and maybe my credit card.

176
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,470
And then, and, yeah, a couple 100 bucks later I had a,

177
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,859
I had a bobcat in my backyard and I was moving dirt.

178
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:18,179
It, it really calls into question because another aspect of this is, I mean,

179
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,500
I've met very few

180
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,739
people outside of law enforcement who actually know how to validate an ID.

181
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,739
I would agree with that. I have no idea.

182
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,940
If you showed me your ID, I would have no idea how to prove it was or wasn't you?

183
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:29,339
Yeah.

184
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,140
Well, like my,

185
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,219
my partner got a new driver's license and it looks completely different from mine.

186
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,260
Like, it's got a dinosaur bones on it.

187
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,890
You know,

188
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,919
he's got new graphics and stuff. Yeah, it looks pretty nice

189
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,000
when you have dinosaur bones. What's the significance of dinosaur bones?

190
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,940
Alberta is famous for dinosaur bones.

191
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,400
The Toll

192
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,830
museum. Yeah,

193
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:46,919
Albertos

194
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:47,559
Arus.

195
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,559
There's a dinosaur called Albertos

196
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,190
Arus.

197
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,869
Yeah, I think we were part of the precambrian basin.

198
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,239
So there's,

199
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,690
there was a lot of sedimentary rock laid down with a lot of dinosaur bones.

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,640
And if you go down to, um, Drum Heller Provincial Park, you know, they,

201
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,950
they have a giant, a really good dinosaur museum.

202
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,380
And you've got like, honestly,

203
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,119
it's funny for me because all our museums and

204
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,039
stuff are just full of dinosaurs and dinosaur bones.

205
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,500
And I was like, what's the big deal? Right. Doesn't everybody have that

206
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,409
well? And the answer is no.

207
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,820
That's right. That's right. Uh Yes, I found a picture of the Alberto Saurus.

208
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,119
So I will put that in the show notes for anyone who is interested.

209
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,960
But it is a, it is a real thing. Kurt did not make this up.

210
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,849
I almost never make things up.

211
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,219
You don't. But some of your stories are unbelievable. And so I always fact check them

212
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,619
and

213
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,580
this is one of those, one of those instances.

214
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,739
So anyway, anyway,

215
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,359
identifying people.

216
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,340
And so the reality is, I mean, the good news is, you know,

217
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,969
99 times out of 100 when you rent a car to somebody, they're not going to steal it.

218
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:46,630
The problem is if you have a weak process,

219
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,270
well, that's who the Attackers are going to go after

220
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,479
because it's just easier. Right? They'll be more successful.

221
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,960
This is, this is a fair point. I guess when I rent a car

222
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,020
I show up, I give them a credit card and an ID

223
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,679
and then they give me a car

224
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,559
and I feel like

225
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,530
there's not a lot of crazy process going on here. So what made this?

226
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,960
They don't take a picture of you.

227
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,469
They don't take your fingerprints. No, they don't.

228
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,489
No, they don't do any of that stuff. I've, I've never had a problem. So,

229
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:22,210
so why is this? Although I guess the one difference with this

230
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:26,684
particular services. It was all like online magic, wasn't it? Versus

231
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,505
having to talk to a human.

232
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:29,354
Yeah, I know this was,

233
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,575
you could you get the app and you give the app the right data and

234
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,945
you can use the app to unlock a car and drive off with it.

235
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:38,344
So why, why would people be different?

236
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,210
Well, I think part of it boils down to is, is the retribute of getting caught aspects.

237
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,510
So for example, you know, all those spam phone calls we get, you know,

238
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,049
with various scams,

239
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,169
there's basically zero risk to the scammer of number one getting caught.

240
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,859
And even if they somehow did get caught,

241
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,590
you know, uh, the CBC news here has done investigations and gone,

242
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,539
actually gone to India and

243
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,039
paid a person to go work in the call center to collect video.

244
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,409
Like, so what, you know,

245
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,520
and they even got one of these call centers shut down and it

246
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,479
was hilarious because they show they have this like truck full of like,

247
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:10,909
you know, old P CS and

248
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,799
the police are hurting like 200 people out

249
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:16,729
and, you know, and it's up and running the next week,

250
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,010
right? And by the end of the day it was back.

251
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,929
And so that's the thing, if, if I can go around,

252
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,960
commit a trying to commit a crime with no sort of downside for being caught.

253
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,739
You know, for example, those people who walk around testing car door handles

254
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,840
to see if they're locked or not and if they're not locked, you know, they,

255
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,799
they rummage around your car and try and steal stuff

256
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,109
if there was zero chance of getting caught.

257
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,320
Well,

258
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,000
somebody is more likely to do that than to do an

259
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,320
activity where they could get caught and could get punished.

260
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,559
That is potentially fair. And

261
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,559
if it's all digital, you also have the instance of,

262
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,070
you probably don't need a very believable ID, right?

263
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,830
You could either Photoshop it or potentially even just

264
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,010
print it out on a piece of paper.

265
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,539
Yeah.

266
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,059
Well, and I was also thinking kind of like that,

267
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,969
remember we talked about the Russian casino scam thing where it ran on your phone,

268
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:05,700
but that sent the data to rush to be interpreted and

269
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,179
then send it back to you telling you went to hit.

270
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,900
I think there's an element of that here where you can have somebody smart

271
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,820
who figures out how to scam the system

272
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,609
and then they can get, let's say mules

273
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,280
to actually go pick up the cars.

274
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,109
That's probably true too because if I was a mastermind behind this,

275
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,099
you wouldn't catch me dead with one of these stolen cars

276
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,679
because that's like you're going to jail if you have it.

277
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:30,150
And if you're smart, you're living in Russia doing this or somewhere,

278
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,940
you know where you just the, the chances of extradition and well,

279
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,760
the chances of getting caught and extradition are zero.

280
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,179
And so, and I think that's a big aspect of it because if I,

281
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,869
if somebody can commit crime across borders,

282
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:44,570
I mean, it's at the point where, you know, even in the US now, right? Aren't there?

283
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,419
I think it was the FBI was sort of off the record quoted as saying, ok, ransomware.

284
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:52,799
Yeah, go pay it. Like, what, what do you want us to do? That's an interesting topic.

285
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,650
Also. I was reading a story

286
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,890
either earlier today or yesterday where all of these cities

287
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,000
now are getting hit by ransomware it seems like.

288
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,690
And a bunch of them are obviously just paying the ransoms

289
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,070
and certain people are are losing their minds saying, oh,

290
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,280
how could you possibly do that?

291
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,530
You know, you're, you're creating a market for ransom. I

292
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,549
mean, it exists already but whatever,

293
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,349
but now I believe it was the city of Las Vegas just basically signed on to some

294
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,539
charter thing that says we will never pay ransom

295
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,390
if, if we're random. I'm like, yeah, that's easy to say.

296
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:27,229
Now wait till you're hit with it. A great example of that.

297
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,500
That's how the market for kidnapping was shut down in the

298
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,270
US was a combination of we will not pay the ransom.

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,130
And number two, we will chase you to the ends of the earth and make sure you get caught.

300
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,010
But that's different.

301
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,520
Well, I'm just saying, but it is essentially possible to eliminate

302
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:45,809
pretty much an entire class of crime which is kidnapping for money.

303
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,849
Right. You still get a lot of, you know, parental kidnapping type stuff.

304
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:52,960
But the actual kidnapping for money as a business is basically not a thing in the US.

305
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,510
Whereas in other countries it's doing well.

306
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,289
Sadly,

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,010
I, I have no doubt

308
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,229
but in the,

309
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,359
I don't think it's a fair comparison because

310
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:04,669
something like ransomware or stealing cars or whatever.

311
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,030
Oh, it's definitely a lot harder. Right. You can do it from a remote location.

312
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,630
Whereas if you're going to kidnap someone in the United States,

313
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,989
you have to be in the United States.

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,950
Well, and I think the,

315
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,380
the impact of the crime is a lot higher.

316
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,260
Like, I think the impact of the crime is a lot higher and it's a lot more newsworthy

317
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:22,140
because to put it bluntly, you know, somebody kidnaps a person for money.

318
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,590
Yeah, that's,

319
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:25,565
but somebody, what do you mean your computers are encrypted?

320
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,684
Why don't you just whatever restore from backups? Like, who cares?

321
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:32,364
And not only that if you're kidnapping someone for money,

322
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,965
you have to kidnap someone with a lot of money.

323
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,164
And chances are if they have a lot of money, people know who they are.

324
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,065
So you're talking about kind of celebrity level

325
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,025
incident here.

326
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,984
Whereas if the city of Baltimore has a ransomware event, people are like,

327
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,169
ok.

328
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:53,010
And I bet in the United States if I pulled out a map and said point to Baltimore for me,

329
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,969
less than half of the people could get it right within a circle.

330
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,489
That is 100 miles large. True.

331
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,789
I would point sort of at the east coast generic.

332
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:05,250
But in Canada we actually had a case of an armed kidnapping of,

333
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,830
I believe he's a Chinese national.

334
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,130
He's over here as a student

335
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,159
and apparently comes from a wealthy family.

336
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:10,650
And, yeah,

337
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,330
now the police have arrested the four sus suspect in the armed kidnapping.

338
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,580
So, you know, and,

339
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,059
and that made the national news here because literally the

340
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,390
number of armed kidnappings like for money in Canada is,

341
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,739
it's like in the single digits yearly.

342
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,419
I would hope so.

343
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,659
I I agree because what is, yeah, here it is saying the city of Baltimore,

344
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,520
uh they wanted a ransom payment of 13 Bitcoin.

345
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,780
So whatever that is now

346
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,260
probably a bigger number than when this

347
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,770
article was published apparently because they are

348
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,619
not paying is my understanding and trying to clean up and fix it.

349
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,489
Here we go in total young,

350
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,669
estimated the aftermath of the attack would cost the city $10 million in

351
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,780
addition to the $8 million lost while the city could not process payments,

352
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,140
the figure could rise as the city pays for

353
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,640
cybersecurity experts to bolster their systems in the future.

354
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,940
So that 18 million doesn't even include fixing it,

355
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,280
right. It'll, it'll go up, it'll go up a lot. I I think

356
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,940
when, when the city of Atlanta got nailed

357
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,280
the the ransomer wanted like $46,000 and I feel like it cost them

358
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,000
28 million or something. It was ridiculous.

359
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,969
$46,000 is, I mean, that's like single digits,

360
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:18,179
numbers of servers being purchased and maintained and run for a year.

361
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,919
But at the same time,

362
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:26,119
people don't want to pay ransoms because they feel it empowers the ransomers.

363
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,719
Well, it makes a market right.

364
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,919
There would be no market for ransomware if nobody paid. But I,

365
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,200
man, there's so much, there's so much here.

366
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,909
Oh, somebody starts throwing paint at my house and says I'll stop for $10.

367
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,640
Yeah, I might just pay the $10 right. You know,

368
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:44,270
so let me ask you this and this is,

369
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,669
this is a conversation topic that comes up on

370
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,330
a regular basis when I discuss this with people

371
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,919
is ransomware.

372
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,239
The tax you pay for being insecure effectively.

373
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,799
Yeah, it creates a market and you can call it a tax or, or it's,

374
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,450
it's an external and are we comfortable saying that?

375
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,239
Well, to me,

376
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,239
a tax implies taking money and then doing something good with

377
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,290
it or maybe not good or at least filling potholes or,

378
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,839
you know, trying to, trying to do something good with it.

379
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,118
Let's go with that. Right.

380
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,640
I think we can generally agree that

381
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,329
as annoying as taxes are, they're, we're,

382
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,180
we're generally trying to do something useful with them

383
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,709
like infrastructure or paying for firemen or whatever.

384
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,868
I'm, I'm sure this will go to infrastructure in

385
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,130
Russia or something.

386
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:25,329
Yeah.

387
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,869
So the, the challenge would be, I mean, the reality is if you're bad at it,

388
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,750
there's all sorts of costs.

389
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,430
Like you can't be agile, you can't upgrade systems and take advantage of new things.

390
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,109
You can't

391
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,260
do things that your competitors can do when it comes to security.

392
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,839
A simple example would be, you know, you get shut down for a week or two and your,

393
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,079
your competitors don't, you know, all the people that can,

394
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,569
well, how many people get d

395
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:47,109
dost

396
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,119
and die

397
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:49,650
versus how many people that get de

398
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,250
dost. And they're like, yeah, that's Tuesday. We get de

399
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,390
Dost on Tuesday. Now, let's ok.

400
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,079
So let's, let's take this and, and turn it on its head a little more

401
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,189
if you're bad at it.

402
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,660
And I'm assuming if you're bad at it, you're probably also bad at security.

403
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,520
If you're bad at it,

404
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,810
you're going to have more downtime than someone who isn't bad at it.

405
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:06,439
Right?

406
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,689
So, is a ransomware incident any different than your infrastructure just,

407
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,079
you know,

408
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:15,910
you know, committing suicide one day because it sucks.

409
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:19,140
I'm gonna say yes, because you, you actually, generally speaking,

410
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,040
have a guaranteed way to fix it for a guaranteed cost, which for most it problems,

411
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,010
that's not the case, right?

412
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,560
A lot of it problems boil down to.

413
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,630
Well, we, we think we can fix it and we think it will cost this much and then of course,

414
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,959
it goes way over budget.

415
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,079
And so ironically, ransomware,

416
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,589
it sounds like most of these ransomware attacks are reasonably

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,829
legit when it comes to you paying and getting your encryption keys.

418
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,849
Yeah. No, you can say like we will pay X and they will give us the keys and,

419
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:43,619
and it's done

420
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,579
and for a lot of businesses that kind of certainty, they love that

421
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,270
because how many it projects have you? And I seen

422
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,900
go over budget over time or just fail

423
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:53,479
all of them?

424
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:56,099
Well, you know, the stats I read are the,

425
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,219
the average seems to be at least 50% as high

426
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,640
as 90% depending on what sector and type it is.

427
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,939
I, I believe that

428
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,300
I believe that so perversely in a way paying the, the Attackers,

429
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,410
I suspect a lot of these people would trust

430
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,250
the Attackers more than their own it department.

431
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,349
And as evidenced by the fact that their it department

432
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,329
ran it so poorly that they got hit by ransomware.

433
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,859
That may be a reasonable description even

434
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:22,479
though I imagine it's not popular honestly.

435
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:22,819
I mean,

436
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,800
I've been doing it for over 20 years now and this

437
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,900
is the reason I have all my stuff in the cloud.

438
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:30,790
I am as good as I am. I am not competent enough.

439
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,790
There's no way I can defend against

440
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,390
DDOS.

441
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,189
No,

442
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,640
no. And I pay cloud flare

443
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,030
like 20 bucks a month.

444
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,150
I, what can I do for 20 bucks? A month, like, seriously, although

445
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:44,079
cloud flare went down the other day and everyone lost their minds.

446
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,790
Well, and at least what I like is they went down for a somewhat interesting reason,

447
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,650
which is, as it turns out, operations of global scale is still hard, who knew?

448
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,020
You know,

449
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,290
at least they're not going down like Verizon where it's

450
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,319
like if Verizon had implemented this well known security protocol,

451
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,949
so they didn't get fake B GP routes,

452
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,099
there wouldn't have been a problem as far as I know. Pretty much all the ransomware.

453
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,510
Very few of them use a zero day.

454
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,689
I think. Not. Petya used a zero day in that accounting software.

455
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:13,410
That wasn't ransomware. That was like a cyber attack.

456
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,089
That was war.

457
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:15,550
Yeah.

458
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,569
In general, the majority of ransomware use known flaws or if they do use a zero day,

459
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,729
then why is that ransomware still chugging along months or even years later?

460
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,770
Right. I mean, that's fair. And

461
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,849
I think an important point to that also is

462
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,250
when you have a zero day,

463
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,530
you can only use it a couple of times before it, it's gone. I'm going to disagree.

464
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,650
You can only use it a couple of times against competent defenders. That is true.

465
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,449
That is true.

466
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,050
But, like,

467
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,849
look at member Stuxnet that was a zero day and the people are

468
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,800
still getting hit by those flaws because they haven't patched their systems.

469
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:52,489
You know, they, they failed so poorly at basic hygiene.

470
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,910
I, I mean, come on, you and I both know

471
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:58,609
of people with systems that are a decade out of date running in production.

472
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,369
But that up time. Right.

473
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,609
It's so good. I haven't rebooted in two years.

474
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:04,880
You know, I, I'm guilty of this.

475
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,329
I ran Fedora in production for six or for three years and as

476
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:11,609
everybody who's run Fedora knows you actually only get 12 months of support.

477
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,300
I, I don't remember if I said this on the podcast,

478
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,739
but I actually migrated my breast.net machine to running in S3.

479
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,709
Amazon S3

480
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,780
because I logged in one day

481
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,709
and I realized that

482
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,390
I was two years behind

483
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,270
schedule.

484
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,569
And I thought, well, this isn't good.

485
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,599
And I thought I, for whatever reason in my brain,

486
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:36,800
I thought I was running Sent Os and I had

487
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:38,469
automatic updates on and I logged in,

488
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,689
I did have automatic updates on there. Just weren't any automatic updates.

489
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:42,119
So

490
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,150
the last year or two,

491
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,170
it's like, well,

492
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,829
this is a great reason to get rid of this.

493
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:47,250
Well,

494
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,650
and there's a perfect example of the cost and time of upgrading Fedora across what,

495
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,650
three or four versions,

496
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,839
it's actually not that bad, right.

497
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,739
You're looking at probably one or two hours, but it was less work to just dump it in S3.

498
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,069
And now I never have to think about it again for the rest of my life.

499
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:08,599
And, and I mean, that's the exact same thing I did with c.org Right.

500
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,089
It's been an S3 bucket for about

501
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,469
almost a decade now. And that's part of the challenge though, is a lot of companies

502
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,339
as bad as their, it is, it's kind of not bad enough to make those decisions.

503
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:21,380
Uh That could very well be, I, I don't doubt it.

504
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,020
How many places are still running their own email servers

505
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:27,699
with, and let's say running their own email servers with less than

506
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,109
20 users Even. That sounds like a sad, sad email server.

507
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,699
It's, I mean, small medium business, the whole thing. I, I think

508
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,800
fundamentally I think it boils down to that. That's the challenge with security.

509
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,329
Right. Is that

510
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,689
it's not that you

511
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,849
are dealing with computer bugs or weird behavior.

512
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,969
You're dealing with an intelligent human adversary

513
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,280
and the human adversary will wait.

514
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,030
You know, I, I'm sure there's people now keeping an eye on car services going.

515
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,420
Hey, that worked with car to go.

516
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,000
Ok, let's keep an eye on all these other car services and wait for them to, like,

517
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,339
decrease their requirements for renting cars and when they do that

518
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,699
king it, it wouldn't shock me at all.

519
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,300
Or now they're going, hey, how much does it cost to hire some patsy to do this? Oh.

520
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,439
Right. Right. Absolutely.

521
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,449
Yeah. I don't, I don't know.

522
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:16,209
I, I mean, I think about this and there, there's so many problems here. Right.

523
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:18,040
There's the fact that we don't have

524
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,439
a way to easily identify people

525
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,380
I mean, I think that's kind of problem number one.

526
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,160
Well, not just identify but validate that identity.

527
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:30,140
Right. Yeah. Sure. Exactly. I consider it the same thing, but. Right. Right.

528
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,069
Same, same thing.

529
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,760
You've got that issue

530
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,410
then you've got the problem of, so you've got this crazy expensive vehicle.

531
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,569
What now?

532
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,329
Right. How do you, how do you keep something like that safe?

533
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,849
Well, and I'm kind of surprised they don't have, like,

534
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,949
tracking systems installed in them because they would have had to fit it

535
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,609
out with stuff for the app to talk to and unlock the car and

536
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,849
whatever. Right.

537
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,010
Yeah, you, you'd think so al although, although at the same time, Kurt,

538
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:58,790
would you rent a car if the company is tracking exactly where you're going with it?

539
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,829
That's already a thing with some rental car companies. Is it?

540
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,989
I don't know, I don't, I don't feel like I'm aware of that

541
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,900
and I would think twice about it.

542
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,150
Uh, for example,

543
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,180
I know somebody that ordered a Mercedes ship

544
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:12,349
from Germany and they lost the damn thing

545
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:13,750
for a while

546
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,709
and, and my thought was like, I know that cars are kind of,

547
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,089
well, they're not big, but come on, like, really?

548
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,089
And my thought was they're pretty big.

549
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:23,650
Why do I have, like, real time delivery information

550
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,530
on

551
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,459
my small packages?

552
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:27,569
What you know, like,

553
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:31,849
can't you literally just glue an Android phone to the inside of the container

554
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,089
with the car in it poke a little hole in it for the antenna

555
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,770
and, you know, stick a car, like, stick a, a big, you know,

556
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,199
marine deep cycle battery in it to power the phone for

557
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,689
a month or however long it takes to ship the darn thing

558
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,459
and then you just know exactly where the car is pretty much in real time.

559
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:50,069
Um, you know, unless it's like on a container ship in the middle of the ocean,

560
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:50,530
in which case,

561
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,119
you can probably guess that it's on that container ship and just track that thing.

562
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,849
You know, assuming the container doesn't fall off the ship, you're fine.

563
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,910
And, I mean, it just kind of blows me away though.

564
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:02,229
I have, you know, better tracking on my pizza than on a car.

565
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,410
I'm ordering from Germany.

566
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:03,920
Yeah,

567
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,069
I mean, that's, that's fair.

568
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,630
That's interesting to think about.

569
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,089
So, I, I suspect as time goes on we'll see more of this tracking

570
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,219
and telemetry on

571
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,459
stuff. Right. Because internet of things, I will say

572
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,540
the one other thing to consider is

573
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,939
if we have a universe where people aren't driving their cars,

574
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,140
it kind of makes car theft go away

575
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,660
in a lot of ways. Right. Because now the car is just gonna drive itself. Yeah.

576
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,160
Well, exactly.

577
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,359
Like, if there's no controls to you, you'd have to what, I guess, get a tow truck and

578
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,859
physically, like, lift the car up and take off with it.

579
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:45,329
But then what are you going to do with it once you have it chop it up for parts, uh,

580
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:47,140
who's buying the parts,

581
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,550
people in other countries that ask less questions of what cheap parts.

582
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:51,910
And they could be,

583
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,500
I mean, those, those Tesla batteries they're worth, uh,

584
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:59,050
I forget what they're worth but it's, I think it was like, 10 grand or something.

585
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,790
I'm sure it's not zero.

586
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,390
Yeah, it's to say the least.

587
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,449
I guess the problem is we still have the same problems we had 1020 years ago.

588
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,750
And are they going to get better? No, that's it. That's, that's the

589
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,829
end of my thought

590
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:13,709
that, that, that's the thought. And I feel like

591
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,199
this is one of those instances where criminals are

592
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:21,900
very opportunistic and sometimes the technology and the,

593
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:25,459
the function functions of society have to catch up

594
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:29,020
to accommodate dealing with crime in that way.

595
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,319
And, and this is one of those instances I guess is how do we have online services

596
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,989
where you're trying to validate who a human is and

597
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,109
you can't.

598
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,609
So criminals abuse it.

599
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,500
Well, and a second problem is it's not just about identifying the user,

600
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,839
but intent is their intent to rent the car,

601
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,859
do their thing and return it or is there intent to steal the car?

602
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,430
I, I don't know what the answer is.

603
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,359
I feel like we will probably figure it out

604
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,800
because we've always figured it out in the past,

605
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,479
but I don't know.

606
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,750
Yeah, I don't know where we go, we will, we will see.

607
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,400
So. All right, man. Um I'm ending it. So, thank you everyone for listening.
