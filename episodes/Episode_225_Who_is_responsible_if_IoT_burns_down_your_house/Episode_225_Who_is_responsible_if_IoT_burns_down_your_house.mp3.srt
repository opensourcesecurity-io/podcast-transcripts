Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,409
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,670
-- Josh Bresser.
-- After the show last week, when we recorded, I went and got a COVID test.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,659
-- It was a fascinating experience.
-- Did they tickle your brain?

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,420
They did not.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,979
I was shocked by this.

6
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,090
I was expecting that because I've had the weird

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,260
brain tickling test when I had the flu.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,270
No, I, so I was feeling extremely bad and in the last episode, my voice sounds ok ish.

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:32,639
But

10
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:34,220
I was not. Well.

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,020
And

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:38,419
so it was like the whole thing was crazy though. So I call my doctor

13
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:40,659
and they have a recorded message that says if

14
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,540
you think you have COVID go to this website.

15
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,259
And I thought,

16
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:47,669
ok, that's fair because I was, I was experiencing some of the symptoms,

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,290
we'll say not a lot.

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,139
And I didn't have a fever and a fever supposedly is the biggest one.

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,650
So I go to the website,

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,849
I fill in their little, tell me about your symptoms

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,319
and then I click next and it says, oh, you should get a COVID test,

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,569
schedule it by clicking here and I'm like, oh, this is, this is, you know,

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,760
like I'm getting all excited because I'm thinking this is really cool.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,750
So I click next and I scheduled it for like 10 minutes later, right? Because why not?

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,669
And it's literally down the street from where I live. So I thought

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,529
I can do this. It's a drive through testing place. I schedule my test.

27
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,069
I pull up and it's got a big sign that says,

28
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,275
call this phone number to check in. You have to register before you come. Right.

29
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:31,514
-- Which? Ok, that's great. Well,
-- so, so here locally I know, like, something like

30
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:35,764
between 10 and 30% of people weren't showing up for scheduled COVID tests.

31
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,275
Oh, my, that's terrible.

32
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:40,135
Well, but it's a bit different here in Canada too because, like, well,

33
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:42,665
this is also when they were testing asymptomatic people.

34
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:43,785
-- Ah,
-- gotcha. Gotcha.

35
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,790
And, and in fact, if I didn't click the right buttons,

36
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:50,040
you can't get a test. Like you have to,

37
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,519
you have to be sick. Right. Exactly.

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,279
So, anyway, I called the number and the people that like, oh, is this you?

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,279
And I'm like, yes, this is me.

40
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,360
They're like, ok, and they asked me literally all the same questions again.

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,309
And I'm thinking, ok,

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,589
I understand this because some people are confused or

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,139
they lie or whatever and you're just double checking.

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,585
But it's no, no, no. But it's, it's how

45
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,945
hospitals and medical stuff operates

46
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:13,134
right. Every time you go to the hospital. What's your name? Ok.

47
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,875
Can you spell that out for us? Tap, tap, tap. Ok. Here's your record.

48
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,164
When's the last time you were vaccinated? What's your date of birth?

49
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:21,395
Is this your current address? Are you still allergic to killer bees?

50
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:25,154
Like, because, well, no, because medical records get messed up. And that's fair.

51
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:29,285
And, you know, one of my kids is allergic to penicillin and it's like that's a major,

52
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:32,035
that's a, you know, that's an important thing for the hospital to know.

53
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:37,035
Right. And, yeah. Ok. Ok. So, anyway. Right. Call him up, get the thing, wait in line.

54
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,130
And then

55
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:43,800
it was just a, like in a barn basically that they had people driving through

56
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,929
and, yeah, they, they, of course, read all my information to me,

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,759
made sure it was me that people were wearing like, hats,

58
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,059
mat suits who did the test and they just, like, swabbed the inside of my nostril

59
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:53,979
and it was, it,

60
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:01,199
and then I waited, what, six days for my not positive test and then it, I, I feel,

61
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,339
I feel fine today.

62
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,050
It was, it was just a head cold or whatever, but it was,

63
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,410
it was definitely an odd and unexpected experience, I guess.

64
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,229
And I'm glad I went through it just because

65
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:16,149
I love learning new things like this and this is one of those

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,179
strange new things that I hope I never have to do again.

67
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,429
-- Yeah.
-- No, I've, I've had two COVID tests and, well, I suspect,

68
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,750
you know, with the way things are going,

69
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,610
I'll probably end up getting tested again and

70
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,440
-- on to happier news.
-- Burning down a house. Yeah,

71
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,229
apparently.

72
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,360
So ring doorbells are

73
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:33,809
basically long story short.

74
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,809
It's a little box with a camera and like Wi

75
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,199
Fi and then there's two main sort of differences.

76
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,550
There's the ones that have batteries

77
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,589
and there's the ones that you like, wire into that 12 volt circuit,

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,779
your doorbell runs on.

79
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,630
Right.

80
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,380
I personally will never use the ones with batteries

81
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,050
because they're only rated to work to minus 20.

82
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,429
-- And I live in Canada.
-- Right.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,679
I have a similar problem where I have,

84
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,660
I briefly investigated getting a video doorbell

85
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,389
and they need the batteries or hard wiring and one of my doors,

86
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,229
I don't have a doorbell wire to yet and I could run it there, but I'm kind of lazy.

87
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,589
So I'm like,

88
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,669
that's a lot of work running

89
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,550
that one stupid little wire.

90
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,020
Like, because I had to look at this at my parents' house and it's,

91
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,669
it would have been at least a 10 to 20 hour project to run a wire.

92
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,589
I guarantee I can do it in two hours or less.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,548
-- I have, I would have
-- to take down part of their ceiling in the basement.

94
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:25,816
-- See,
-- I don't have, do anything like that. And in fact, I, so my, my old back door

95
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,596
is not my back door anymore because we put like a

96
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,585
little addition on the back of the house to be,

97
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:31,825
we had no entryway.

98
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,205
And so it was very frustrating because there's like shoes everywhere and stuff.

99
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,865
Right. Exactly. So, we added a mud room

100
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:38,825
and

101
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:42,946
the doorbell is on the inside door so you can see it through the door.

102
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:48,471
-- It's the old door. And I'm like, I need to move that. 00,
-- I thought you put that there.

103
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,171
And I'm like, yeah, that's no, no, no. Somebody explained how doorbells work to you.

104
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:54,191
And the thing is when they, when the people did the work, it's like,

105
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:58,421
how did none of us realize the doorbell needed to be moved and like,

106
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,782
none of us realized it till it was done.

107
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,712
Have you thought about maybe just drilling a hole

108
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,272
in your door and having a poking stick?

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,760
That sounds totally practical.

110
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,559
No. But anyway, anyway, the wire is basically like in the basement.

111
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,399
I know where it is.

112
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,679
And I literally just have to kind of sneak a wire around the outside of

113
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,809
the house and then drill a hole into the side of the wall and it take

114
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,640
like an hour maybe. But whatever, whatever. Anyway, ring doorbell.

115
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,320
-- So
-- basically you've got the, so if it's the battery version, whatever, it's,

116
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,040
it's easy.

117
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,640
But, you know, it only works in California.

118
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,920
Right.

119
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,962
Probably south of the Mason Dixon line in the United States is my guess.

120
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,141
Yeah, pretty much like it's rated to minus 20

121
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:37,971
people are showing pictures of their things that, you know,

122
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:41,471
like just the battery is free solid at minus 3040 or

123
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:44,821
worse at like minus 20 ish or towards minus 20 ish.

124
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:49,002
The stuff gets pixelated because the power output gets kind of wonky. Got you.

125
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:49,381
Right.

126
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,962
So, anyways, I went with the wired ones and then, like,

127
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:55,302
pretty much anything you have to attach it to your house.

128
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,161
Right. This is reasonable. And I've actually seen doorbell products

129
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:00,234
attached to your house with like double sided sticky tape.

130
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,584
You know, like the little, the little cheap, like $10 wireless ones,

131
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,204
sticky tape is terrible.

132
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:06,734
-- It never works. The
-- gorilla

133
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:09,523
double sided sticky tape works. But that stuff's expensive.

134
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:10,084
That's

135
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,243
also three M makes one that's really good.

136
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,204
But yeah, the generic stuff is garbage, don't use it.

137
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,864
So obviously, you know, a ring doorbell will cost like 200 bucks.

138
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:18,973
You're not going to sticky tape to the side of your house.

139
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:19,924
You're going to,

140
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,604
there's like two screw holes and you put like two screws in to hold it on to your house.

141
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:24,764
Right? And apparently

142
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:28,045
if you use two large screws on a couple of models

143
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,335
of doorbell that have the batteries in them that will,

144
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,765
I guess damage the battery enough.

145
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:31,946
But

146
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,906
no, you didn't read the, you,

147
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:38,246
you sent me a link to the Canadian recall website and you clearly didn't

148
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:41,276
read it because it actually has a link explaining what was going on.

149
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,406
And this is fascinating.

150
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:47,626
So what happens is the ring doorbell, you mount a thing to your house, right?

151
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:51,365
And then you like, put the doorbell on it and there's a screw on the bottom

152
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,398
that like screws it into the mount

153
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:55,648
and the screw on the bottom is very short

154
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:59,447
and I assume the battery is right there. And people were putting wood screws in it.

155
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,488
Yeah, you puncture it

156
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:04,028
and they were, they were screwing into the battery then, like screwing straight up.

157
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,888
-- Like, that's fascinating to me.
-- Sorry, I was thinking of my doorbell.

158
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:07,847
Not the battery one.

159
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:08,977
Right.

160
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,208
Yeah, basically the way it works,

161
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:13,278
you can mount a plate and then mount it to the plate or you can, like,

162
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:17,917
just obviously you can just go through the two holes on my doorbell like it,

163
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,230
they just go straight through and you mount the plate and then

164
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,230
you attach the doorbell to the plate with that small little screw.

165
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,739
It should be a small screw.

166
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:30,350
Not ok. And we should be clarified. It shouldn't, it's not so much small as short.

167
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,910
There's a difference if you're into screws. If you puncture

168
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:37,269
-- a battery,
-- a lithium ion battery specifically.

169
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,709
Yeah, then bad things will happen.

170
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,260
And, you know, it's funny,

171
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,980
I was actually just watching Lena's tech tips and

172
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,880
he was talking about how the old radiators,

173
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,690
you know, for your computers, for whatever reason they would have.

174
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,220
It sits in like behind a plate and the plate

175
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,089
has screw holes in it to attach to your computer.

176
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,779
And the radiator grill is in the middle.

177
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,869
And, well, where are you going to run the hose for the radiator?

178
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,529
Well, you've got some spare space around the outside, run it there,

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,899
except that's where the screw holes are.

180
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:59,109
And so apparently on a lot of older radiators,

181
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,339
like if you drove the screw in too tight, you puncture the hose for the radiator.

182
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,170
You know, I'm a kind of an amateur fix it.

183
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,119
And I, for example, electrical screws are all flat on the end.

184
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,350
So that if do hit a wire or something, it squishes it instead of puncturing it

185
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,519
and you hopefully don't have as bad of a result.

186
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,950
Obviously, if you drive a too long screw and it's just got to go somewhere.

187
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,820
Well, and I will,

188
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,760
I will find a video on the internet to put about people puncturing lithium

189
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,350
ion batteries. It is like, it is like a firework.

190
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,899
-- Yeah,
-- I tried that with one I thought was lithium

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,169
ion. It was labeled and I punctured it and like, nothing, it just kind of

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,789
it a bit but nothing really happened.

193
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,630
-- I was sad but it was like, also, like, 10 years old.
-- Did you have it fully charged?

194
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,729
-- It has to be fully charged. Oh,
-- yeah.

195
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,130
Probably wouldn't fully charge because it was like 10 years old.

196
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,330
Yeah, because so, I mean, you have to imagine when you charge a batter,

197
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,729
you're adding energy to it.

198
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:50,609
And then like when you puncture it, you're causing a runaway thermal reaction,

199
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:51,609
the energy comes out.

200
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,530
Yeah, exactly.

201
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,250
So, anyways, yeah, it's what's interesting to me is like,

202
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,830
I get that there's construct

203
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,349
in this device because it's physically small.

204
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,020
But at the same time,

205
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,830
I feel like a mounting system where you're

206
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,789
driving a fastening device towards something that,

207
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,469
well, when punctured gets angry.

208
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,849
Well, ok. Ok,

209
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,039
let's first, let's,

210
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,909
let's call back to the last episode we did where we talked about old android devices,

211
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,320
right?

212
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,239
And now we're talking about something new that has a different sort of problem.

213
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,510
But I think fundamentally

214
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,520
what these all boil down to

215
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,549
is

216
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:25,849
tech. People

217
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,429
are bad at designing physical things

218
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,539
and that is my takeaway from this.

219
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,200
This is more interesting though because when

220
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,500
like your android phone breaks the liability,

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,989
there is almost non existent just because of the way liability laws work.

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,159
But if your doorbell lights on fire and burns down your house,

223
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,580
that's a liability issue because someone built an unsafe product.

224
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,239
Well, and also we have lots of case law. Here's the thing.

225
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,619
If my android phone breaks, I go to bat for my Android phone.

226
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,078
If my house burns down,

227
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:55,578
my insurance company goes to bat and my insurance

228
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,328
company is massive and hateful of people who cause

229
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:01,598
-- houses to burn down and make them pay out money and
-- they don't want to pay you,

230
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,388
-- they want someone else to pay.
-- Exactly. So, it's,

231
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:06,718
I mean, well, and this is how, you know,

232
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:10,007
we got the whole fire department's fire safety thing was, you know,

233
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:12,357
people's houses burning down and then literally you'd get a

234
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,617
plaque on your house and you paid your insurance and,

235
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,028
like, you know, if your house starts burning down,

236
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,518
people show up with buckets and put it out.

237
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,088
-- I don't
-- know if you remember we recorded an episode of,

238
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,437
yeah, a long time ago.

239
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:24,395
Well, it was like years, I'll find it. I'll put a link in the show notes.

240
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:24,815
-- But
-- yeah,

241
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,075
so the long and the short of it is what's

242
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,145
fascinating to me is because it's burning a house down.

243
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,335
That's something we understand

244
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,755
and it's something that's covered by this larger company.

245
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:35,455
Like a large insurance company can go up against Ring or

246
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,056
Nest or whoever.

247
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:37,776
And, you know,

248
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:39,406
they're big enough to scare them whereas you or

249
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,416
me going up against Ring or Nest or doorbell,

250
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:41,945
whatever.

251
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,656
-- Who cares
-- we can though?

252
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:48,846
-- Because the way the laws work is you have to show physical harm,
-- right?

253
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,193
But I mean, they can just drag it through court for five or 10 years. Bankrupt you.

254
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:53,994
That is, that is a very good point, right?

255
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:57,494
And that's, that's what I mean is like if you go to IBM and threaten legal action,

256
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,434
they're like, yeah, so what?

257
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:02,153
But you have no standing I'm saying in general, the way companies work is if,

258
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,893
if an individual goes up to a fortune

259
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,434
100 company or something and threatens legal action,

260
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:07,153
they don't care.

261
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:10,294
But if a large insurance company goes and says we have a problem,

262
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,484
then we have a problem.

263
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,033
Right. It's a meeting of equals. Not David versus Goliath. That is true.

264
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,754
And I think thats interesting here because having a large

265
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:20,333
organization to go to bat for you is great.

266
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,031
You know, that's like food safety.

267
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,861
There's all sorts of things where if something bad happens to me,

268
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,031
it's not that I have to deal with it.

269
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,971
It's I go tell somebody who then deals with it on my behalf

270
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,651
-- and that somebody else is much, much larger and more powerful.
-- There's also law

271
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,771
that surrounds this, which the world of technology

272
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,562
-- has nothing. I'm going
-- to disagree slightly.

273
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:45,452
-- There law is important, but also we still have cigarette companies
-- and

274
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,682
that is a special case because they have

275
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:52,130
been specifically exempted because they let's face it.

276
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,510
They just bribed all the politicians to get off the hook.

277
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,750
But I'm just saying like having the law on your side doesn't mean you're going to win.

278
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,270
-- And I, yes, I will agree with that.
-- Right. It helps. It certainly helps

279
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,479
it.

280
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:08,840
Well, if you, if you don't have legal standing, you have a 0% chance of winning.

281
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:12,669
If you have legal standing, we'll say you have maybe a 50% chance of winning.

282
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,030
I understand.

283
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,309
You know, because I have a lot of products that have like,

284
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,969
little flaps with screws and stuff.

285
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,070
Right. And none of them have where you drive, like,

286
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,848
none of my children's toys have a situation

287
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,617
I've ever seen where you're driving a screw

288
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,877
into a hole where if you drove it too far it would touch a battery.

289
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:29,057
It's always off to the side.

290
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,288
Yeah. You know why?

291
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:34,057
Because the people who did that got sued and they learned their lessons

292
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,968
well, and it's just also generally cheaper to manufacture that way.

293
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,057
You know, because you have a flap with a latch on it.

294
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,857
And I'm kind of wondering like I, because I've bought a couple of, you know,

295
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:42,538
various IO

296
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,117
products.

297
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:46,817
And what's interesting is the nest products actually came with

298
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:50,997
a custom design screw for mounting the nest fire alarm

299
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,640
to either wood

300
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,409
steel studs or into drywall.

301
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,849
And the way the screw does this rather cleverly is

302
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,099
it's got like a fine thread and then a coarse

303
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,549
thread so that it will grab into like drywall or

304
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,039
it will grab into a piece of wood or whatever.

305
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:07,760
But it's got like these magic screws because they basically, to be blunt,

306
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,409
they're selling to a lot of people who have

307
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,520
trouble like putting a screw in their wall.

308
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,909
I, I get that

309
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,320
and that's a really clever screw and a really clever solution.

310
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,380
What I don't get though is, I mean, I guess one of the challenges here. Is there

311
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:21,684
such a custom screw? Because if you look at the screw, it's a very odd shape.

312
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,734
Like it's, it's like a t, I guess I would call it.

313
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:24,835
Like,

314
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:28,955
it's a flathead screw with an Allen key and it's got a shank that's got thread

315
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:31,965
on it and then it's got like a little piece that sticks out from there.

316
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:32,284
Right.

317
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:32,395
Like,

318
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,445
it's got a little knob on the end and there's no

319
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,465
way you're going to be able to buy that screw anywhere.

320
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:37,405
Right? So what are you gonna do?

321
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:38,784
You're gonna use a screw of approximately the

322
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,445
same size that goes in which is probably,

323
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:41,174
let's be blunt.

324
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:44,695
A number eight wood screw will fit in most things and you can jam it in there.

325
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:45,585
It fits in everything.

326
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,770
You just turn your screwdriver way up to

327
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,130
fast and it'll make it through about anything.

328
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,500
Also,

329
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,700
what's fascinating to me is because it's an American thing they show that they

330
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,330
show the woods screw here with the Phillips head and OTA Robertson's head,

331
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,409
which is, you know, the superior woods screw head.

332
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,650
-- It
-- is superior.

333
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,479
So, actually funny enough,

334
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:05,179
I watched a youtube video just the other day about this as to why

335
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,409
the Phillips head basically took over in the United States in the Robertson head.

336
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,729
For those of you who don't know Phillips head looks like a kind of an X

337
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:17,604
across and the Robertson screw is the square hole in the head of a screw.

338
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:18,674
But now I will say

339
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:22,864
having done a lot of work with screws in the last probably couple months,

340
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,294
the Star drive is the superior screw, unquestionably.

341
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:28,294
Oh, the power drive.

342
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:32,734
Yeah, the deal is Robertson being a Canadian wouldn't license his patent.

343
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:34,094
He wanted to make the screws and sell them.

344
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:34,715
Right.

345
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:36,554
And obviously that's going to be more expensive

346
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:39,934
and conveniently enough too. Phillips head actually has

347
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,679
a design flaw that actually is a feature in manufacturing,

348
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,719
which is where you overdrive it, your screwdriver slips out.

349
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:48,039
-- So it's harder to overdrive.
-- It's called camming

350
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,179
out caming out.

351
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,659
-- I know that from watching youtube
-- videos

352
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,700
and that's actually really quite useful when you're building something

353
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,989
like a car because you can have like a powered

354
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,840
screwdriver that just like smashes that screw in and cams

355
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,179
out as soon as the right torque is reached.

356
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,500
-- Exactly
-- magic. So you can't overdrive it and mess up the hole.

357
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,283
And so funny enough, you know, I'll just put the, I'm not going to talk about this.

358
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:09,023
I will put the link to the marvelous youtube video in the

359
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,953
show notes and anyone interested in screws can go watch it.

360
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:14,633
It sounds boring. But it actually is very, very interesting.

361
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,573
Here's the quote, why do we steal a flathead screws?

362
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,643
Because those things are slit,

363
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,794
they slip and they're dangerous and they're horrible.

364
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:19,874
I

365
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:20,323
know, I

366
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:20,604
know,

367
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,133
regardless, whatever.

368
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:25,093
But so I would say there's actually, I would say there's two failures here.

369
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,653
Number one is that they use such a weirdly custom screw.

370
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,763
And number two that obviously if you put something in that hole,

371
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:31,453
that's long enough it,

372
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,348
choose the battery.

373
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:32,788
Look,

374
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,487
I think you can't say it's a weirdly custom

375
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:38,547
screw because the reality is people use whatever,

376
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:39,028
right?

377
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,507
I mean, this is, so this is human nature and this, I think is something that,

378
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:45,138
that makes the design experience of products.

379
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:49,057
And this is true of any kind of product, be it software, be it a physical device,

380
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:52,848
whatever humans are notorious for doing weird stuff.

381
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,268
But I would argue this isn't weird.

382
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,187
This is I need to put a screw in this hole to hold my doorbell together.

383
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:00,442
-- I lost the custom.
-- I don't care how you define weird. It's irrelevant.

384
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,642
The point is people do things that are unexpected by

385
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:06,382
the designers of the systems and like in software,

386
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,802
we're notorious for saying, oh, we just don't do that.

387
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:10,661
And in the world of software that kind

388
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,872
of usually works in many instances because whatever,

389
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,942
but in the world of like real devices,

390
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:19,822
if doing the weird thing ruins the device or burns down your house.

391
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:22,341
Now, it's a different sort of problem.

392
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,056
Well, now you have an insurance company involved, right?

393
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:28,495
-- Yeah. Or whatever. Right. In
-- my, in my life, what I've noticed is

394
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:32,296
there's problems and then like there's the kind of problems where your accountant,

395
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:35,556
your lawyer, your insurance company is involved and those are real problems.

396
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,056
Right. Everything else is easy.

397
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:40,276
But, I mean, from our perspective, dealing with software all the time,

398
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,116
we're used to telling people just don't do that well.

399
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,495
But also we can, we can retrofit the software,

400
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,296
-- we can retroactively issue a patch to fix it
-- well.

401
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,596
And does it burn your house down

402
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,070
-- generally? No.
-- Right. Like, don't click there?

403
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:52,729
Ok.

404
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,849
-- That's all.
-- I mean, I don't know.

405
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,559
I'm kind of wondering because I also had

406
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,489
a conversation once with somebody who was saying essentially

407
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,299
that there was like some product recall where

408
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,489
if you recharge something it could catch fire.

409
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,608
And I'm like, well, that's dumb because, you know,

410
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:08,569
people plug stuff to recharge it all the time and leave it unattended.

411
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,358
-- That's literally the point of recharging.
-- Yeah.

412
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,170
You know, I don't,

413
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,810
I'm not going to like plug a battery and then sit there

414
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,118
and stare at it to make sure it doesn't catch fire.

415
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,656
And he was arguing that no,

416
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,598
like you should listen to the manufacturer and you should keep an

417
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,728
eye on it and build a safe space to recharge your batteries.

418
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,797
No, that's ridiculous. Well, yeah.

419
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,686
And I was like, that's, that's literally the most insane thing I've ever heard.

420
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,287
You're saying, I literally can't like plug a battery into a recharger.

421
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,978
Like got a Ryobi battery charger with Ryobi batteries that I bought at Home Depot.

422
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,478
So they're not from like some dodgy Amazon online.

423
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,027
Reseller that they're not actual Ryobi batteries.

424
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,767
And I'm saying like that thing

425
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:41,447
that should work without burning my house down. Seriously.

426
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:44,046
I think that is a perfectly and I mean,

427
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:47,515
so one of the things that happens in the world of law, at least in the United States,

428
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,715
I don't know how this works elsewhere,

429
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,865
but there's this concept of like a reasonable person and

430
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,086
I think it's safe to say a reasonable person would

431
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:56,556
expect you plug the battery into the charger and you

432
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,406
walk away and your house doesn't start on fire.

433
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,645
Like that is a reasonable expectation.

434
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:03,196
You know, now I'm looking at the ball in this battery to reduce the risk of injury.

435
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,485
A user must read operator's manual risk of fire and

436
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,765
burns do not open crush heat above 40 C.

437
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:08,293
Wow.

438
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:11,963
40 C, I mean, like there's places in the world where it gets above 40 C all the time.

439
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,484
So actually I looked into this because

440
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,524
I enjoy going into the sauna back when I used to go to the gym

441
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:19,524
and

442
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,463
the sauna was

443
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,713
your Apple watch. I don't have an Apple watch.

444
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:27,644
So I did this because there was a guy in the sauna using his phone

445
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:35,062
and the sauna was, I want to say probably 50 ish C maybe it, it was pretty,

446
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,881
it was pretty warm.

447
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:39,682
It was over, it was well over 100 degrees in Fahrenheit scale.

448
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:42,641
And anyway, I was curious like, when do these batteries fail.

449
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:42,781
Like,

450
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,241
do I need to sit on the other side of

451
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,322
the sauna from this person in case his phone explodes?

452
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:49,602
-- And was it like one of those nice cedar saunas?
-- It is, it's very nice,

453
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:49,781
so,

454
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:51,722
-- like, very flammable. It's
-- lovely.

455
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,562
Maybe, I don't know, whatever.

456
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,251
But the point is the actual temperature at which

457
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:00,401
these things fail is well above 100 c,

458
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,640
but they just put these warnings on, I think so, people don't find out,

459
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,959
you know, like,

460
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,920
you know what I mean?

461
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,760
Well, and that's the thing, you always want to have a safety market,

462
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,119
you need some buffer in there.

463
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,079
And so anyway, I,

464
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,719
it was obvious at that point that while I'm sure using your

465
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:17,400
phone in such a hot environment isn't the best thing for it,

466
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,969
the battery will not explode.

467
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,040
I,

468
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,599
I killed my iphone accidentally back in the day

469
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,540
or rather I killed the charging circuit on it.

470
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,473
The battery was fine, but if it was plugged in, it would go all wonky.

471
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,932
And as soon as you unplugged it, it would, it would operate fine.

472
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:29,733
And while it was charged,

473
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,453
it would reboot every five minutes by having it on clipped

474
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,993
in my car in front of the hot air vent.

475
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,912
And so over a period of about three weeks, one winter, it just,

476
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:41,152
there was enough temperature fluctuation between like being outside in minus 20

477
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,652
then being cooked in my car

478
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:44,493
that II I basically

479
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:47,993
the phone worked great unless it was plugged in and it wouldn't charge properly.

480
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:48,552
Interesting.

481
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,406
Yeah, it was kind of fascinating because it was a very odd failure.

482
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,145
I can't help but think the reason that this

483
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:55,265
is different is because insurance companies are involved,

484
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:55,625
like,

485
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,985
because houses are burning down because it's not that there's

486
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,765
not real loss in other software issues like there's been,

487
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:02,706
but there isn't.

488
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:03,465
No, no, no, no, no.

489
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,706
Like the Phoenix pay debacle here in Canada,

490
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:09,495
literally thousands of federal employees had to take out like home loans to make

491
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,556
ends meet because of this pay system that was supposed to be done by IBM

492
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,446
or you know, there's been, there's been payroll software

493
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,790
incidents that have really cost time and money

494
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,229
and had provable losses, but they're kind of, they're at that business level.

495
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:23,349
I'm,

496
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,510
this is interesting to me because this is a consumer level device

497
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,000
where you have the insurance companies going to bat for you.

498
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,640
And I can't think of anything else like that's not going to happen with your,

499
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,989
I guess maybe those, oh, you know what,

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,020
those Amazon essentials or basics or whatever cables that

501
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,300
caught fire and like we're burning people's houses down.

502
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,229
-- Yeah,
-- same thing because you burned the house down. So I there is a presentation

503
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,349
that I will put a link to in the show notes from

504
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,060
there is a person Wendy Knox Everett who I follow on Twitter.

505
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:53,709
She is a lawyer who does cybersecurity work and she's phenomenal.

506
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,890
I'll obviously link to her profile as well and I listened to

507
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,229
-- her talk about like a 100 years
-- in the before time.

508
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,900
But anyway, the thing, I didn't totally understand that, that she clarified,

509
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,040
I think marvelously

510
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:09,599
and I've since discussed this with many lawyers is

511
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,869
when you're dealing with liability,

512
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:18,910
it comes down to proving you actually lost basically money or life in some way.

513
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,810
And the problem with like,

514
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,729
let's say someone hacks Facebook and steals all your information.

515
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,530
Can you prove you lost money? No, you cannot, can you prove you lost life?

516
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,810
No, you cannot so that you have no standing in those kind of cases.

517
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:32,459
And whereas like if you buy a ring doorbell and it burns your house down,

518
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:33,369
did you lose money?

519
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,806
Well, yes, your house burnt down. Did you lose life? I mean, let's hope not.

520
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:37,956
But you know, you know what I mean?

521
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:41,595
You can connect that event to something bad happening.

522
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:42,026
And I mean,

523
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:46,145
this is where our legal system is unable to deal with

524
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:49,296
the current environment of just like technology and the internet.

525
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:52,345
And this is, it is a very difficult problem and things like, you know,

526
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:53,235
as bad as they are,

527
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,145
but the GDPR privacy law and like what California is doing

528
00:21:57,156 --> 00:22:01,026
while flawed are the first step in this journey for sure.

529
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:04,245
Well, I mean, pretty much you look at any regulation or law,

530
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,651
it was written back in the day and a lot of

531
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:08,881
-- them are just comically terrible now
-- and that's how it is.

532
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,001
But now at the same time,

533
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:13,212
I will say what you pointed out what Tim Berners Lee started

534
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:16,802
a company trying to control your data or something like that.

535
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:20,852
And I'm going to tell you, we cannot solve this problem with technology.

536
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:24,462
This is a legal problem that has to be solved with laws.

537
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:27,281
I was looking at his product and it's like, well,

538
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,802
how many websites have you run into where it's

539
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:33,281
basically we want some information on you or something

540
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,849
or you need to use your email address and we need to

541
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,910
send an email and confirm it before we'll let you in.

542
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,790
Otherwise you just don't get to use it.

543
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:45,380
And I'm thinking, like, do I want to deal with that type of question constantly

544
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,630
throughout the day?

545
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,060
As you know,

546
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,949
all these organizations need to use my pi I legitimately

547
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,849
you're already clicking OK for cookies on every site.

548
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,420
Like, why

549
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:54,489
not?

550
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,530
Yeah, if there's one,

551
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,239
I was actually trying to figure that out the other day is how many

552
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,489
humans has GD are killed through the collective loss of time of clicking cookies.

553
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,939
You can't prove it.

554
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:07,599
-- So, the answer
-- is, well, what I'm saying is statistically right, like,

555
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,319
if everybody spends a minute a day clicking cookies away, you know,

556
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:11,489
we're killing basically a,

557
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:15,260
probably a Titanic's worth of people every 15 minutes or something stupid.

558
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,699
-- How many
-- coal fired power plants is GDPR supporting. Right.

559
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,209
Yeah. How many is that in, you know, banana slip incidents?

560
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,739
Watching techs design these things and build these things and especially, yeah,

561
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,010
this intersection of the real world, like,

562
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,530
like a perfect example here that I don't get is why have they issued a recall notice

563
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,719
and asking people to check the numbers when to install a ring product and use it?

564
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:40,469
You have to have an account and that account has to be hooked up to an email address.

565
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,189
Not only could they reach out to you via email or probably

566
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:44,462
phone number which is registered,

567
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:49,161
they could overlay something on the display saying this ring device, blah, blah,

568
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:49,552
blah,

569
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:50,791
I'm not a lawyer,

570
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,521
but I may have a reason for that is so over the

571
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:56,462
course of I talk to lawyers more often than I would like.

572
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,222
I love you all.

573
00:23:57,232 --> 00:24:02,182
But what what can happen in situations like this is you want to do the absolute

574
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,322
minimum whereas you want to push as much

575
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,881
responsibility onto the other party as you can.

576
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:09,473
Because what happens is let's say you display a

577
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:13,514
warning on devices and let's say someone's house burns down

578
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:17,034
and you're like we put a warning on your device and they say I didn't see a warning.

579
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:20,663
No, you didn't. Did they see a warning? Did your system fail? You know what I mean?

580
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:23,734
And so you can actually increase your liability by doing something like that.

581
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:26,014
So that is my suspicion again.

582
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,093
I don't know for sure,

583
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:31,453
but I've encountered situations very similar to that where in my professional life

584
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,666
we had to not do the right thing

585
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,306
because the lawyers said it could get us in trouble,

586
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:39,625
which of course is sad and annoying, but it is what it is.

587
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,786
One thing I'm beginning to wonder is, you know, Apple, for example,

588
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,956
a bunch of Apple phones were stolen in some protests or something.

589
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,225
And they literally sent text messages to all the phones saying, you know,

590
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,845
these phones are stolen, we're going to remote brick them, please return them.

591
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,586
Don't be a jerk. You know, that's possible with essentially every IOT device.

592
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,586
When you buy a firestick from Amazon, you turn it on

593
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:56,618
says like, are you Kurt

594
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,037
Seri? And I'm like, whoa, how did it know that?

595
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:00,197
And then I'm like, oh wait, of course, I'm like, of course,

596
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,797
it knows because I bought it.

597
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:04,858
It's on my account. It knows the serial number of the fire stick. It sent me.

598
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,738
So when I plug it in and turn it on, it's like this serial number reached out to us.

599
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:10,478
Let's see whose account that was bought through are you Kirk or you know,

600
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:11,917
did Kirk give this away as a gift?

601
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,758
And I'm kind of wondering at what point do we get to this remote bricking?

602
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:19,728
See most devices don't have the ability to tell you they're sick. Like my light bulb,

603
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,780
I guess it could start flashing. Maybe that would work.

604
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,630
But, you know what I'm saying? Right.

605
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,209
Like, unless it has a screen, maybe something audible.

606
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:31,650
-- You know, how's it going to communicate? To me?
-- We've never had to do this in the past.

607
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,260
I mean,

608
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:36,439
you could, you could maybe make the argument that, like, a circuit breaker

609
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:37,640
in your basement

610
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,349
is similar to this where, when, when something bad starts to happen, it just like,

611
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,689
and especially if it keeps popping, then you're like, oh, maybe, you know, we,

612
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,130
-- yes,
-- something is wrong. Exactly. And you could potentially argue that.

613
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,140
But I think fundamentally the vast majority of products we've ever

614
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,859
had to deal with have been a get product use,

615
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:56,550
product,

616
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:57,400
eventually,

617
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,619
product breaks and things now like devices like what we

618
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,329
talked about last week where these devices are basically,

619
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:06,069
there's nothing technically wrong with them.

620
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,170
They just don't work anymore because some outside force has caused it to be. So,

621
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,219
-- yeah, with the Android phones and the certificates.
-- Right.

622
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,130
Well, and it's not even that they failed, fail.

623
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,459
It's just you can't use it to surf most of the web.

624
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,060
Yeah, that's true. And I would argue that that basically renders it unusable.

625
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,459
-- I mean,
-- I agree, but it is definitely a different sort of problem for

626
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:25,939
sure.

627
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:27,619
It would be like having a skateboard that you

628
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,699
can only write on 10% of the city streets.

629
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,619
-- That's how most city streets are these, well,
-- you

630
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,069
know what I'm

631
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:32,359
saying?

632
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:36,040
Yeah. Well, yeah, where I live it, between the snow and the cracks.

633
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,310
It's so much respect for those, especially the people who bicycle here in winter.

634
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,229
I'm just in awe of them.

635
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,839
I, I have looked into biking in the winter and let's say it is

636
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:48,739
not a pleasant experience and I'm too lazy to do it.

637
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,229
And more importantly is everyone you talk to, keeps telling you, oh,

638
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,380
you're going to fall a lot.

639
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,109
And I'm thinking,

640
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:59,869
I don't like falling and I'm old. So that's dangerous and bad.

641
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:02,520
Not counting the $400 bike tires.

642
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,739
I have to buy,

643
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,420
I also just keep coming and I can't help but think it's not about just showing loss,

644
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,920
but it's about showing loss and then having a large

645
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,439
company insurance company to go to bad for you.

646
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,819
I feel like that's a critical component here because otherwise

647
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:16,599
it's just going to be one person.

648
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:20,170
Like I've had to return my nest smoke alarms twice and get new ones

649
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,560
because they malfunctioned in a weird way.

650
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,829
And luckily Nest just swapped them out. But I'm,

651
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,300
I was beginning to kind of like,

652
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,760
do I trust these things?

653
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:30,430
Right.

654
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:33,079
Because if they keep malfunctioning to this degree and I would actually test them,

655
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:33,250
like,

656
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,579
I'd take a candle to light it on fire and blow it out

657
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:37,619
under the smoke alarm to make sure it detected smoke and like,

658
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,520
freaked out, you know, at some point,

659
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,579
I'm not beginning to trust these devices as much and

660
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,369
I'm not beginning to trust this company as much.

661
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,420
Right, based on my experience,

662
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,260
and there was an incident of Mercedes cars

663
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,260
just randomly catching fire here in Canada.

664
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,900
And of course Mercedes at first was like, oh, you're, you're,

665
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,744
you're parking it wrong or, you know, it's,

666
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,785
it's not us or squirrels

667
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:55,685
or whatever.

668
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,415
And it, and so somebody started a website and because the thing is transport,

669
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,125
Canada wasn't really tracking this in a spreadsheet or something anywhere.

670
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,685
And then it turns out when they figured out there's like, been like,

671
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:07,204
tens of these fires, it's kind of like, ok, well, that's not normal, you know,

672
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,155
one or two Mercedes just randomly catching fire.

673
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,964
Sure, whatever, it, strange things happen.

674
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:13,114
But, you know, when it's tens of Mercedes,

675
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,380
it's like, oh, maybe there is an electrical fault and that's the other thing is,

676
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,310
you know, how do we spot this trend? Right.

677
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:22,630
Because, like, one house burns down and it's related to the ring doorbell.

678
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,609
You know, they do a fire investigation. Ok. Like me, you know what I mean?

679
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,229
Like, maybe it's a problem. Maybe it's not. But, you know, once you get 10 or 20

680
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,209
I think that's the other aspect here is how do we,

681
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:35,770
how do we track this stuff so that we can know when there is a problem?

682
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,420
We don't, I mean, so what happens is,

683
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,244
I think it's up to the manufacture to keep track of things like this.

684
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:41,734
-- Well,
-- but

685
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:44,594
I mean, the manufacturer would have to find out like, you know, like,

686
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:47,275
for example, is there some national database of, you know,

687
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:48,464
when they investigate a fire,

688
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,314
they write down the cause of it and put it into this

689
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:52,984
national database so that people can see a correlation of like,

690
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:54,275
oh, you know, oh perfect example.

691
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:57,314
I remember this guy was talking about these shop vacs, this one brand of shop vac.

692
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:01,025
And I'm talking like a big shop vac for like a permanently installed sawdust system.

693
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,834
And it turns out these things will catch fire when they're turned off.

694
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:04,364
It seems,

695
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,974
and I'm like, that's really not

696
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,130
to

697
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,739
happen to an electrical device.

698
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,880
There's like a fault in it where like some oil and

699
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,780
some stuff builds up in a part that gets hot,

700
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:15,699
you know, and, and well, oil flammable heat,

701
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:16,540
that's a fire.

702
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,849
And so it would smolder and then they would catch fire like,

703
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,060
at some wee hour of the morning.

704
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:23,079
I mean, I guess if someone out there knows the answer to this, like,

705
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,369
is there some sort of like, like, how does, how does this kind of stuff get tracked?

706
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,369
-- Did the insurance companies do it? Did the fire departments do it?
-- Yeah.

707
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,189
-- Does, I, I don't think it gets tracked.
-- I don't, I don't know.

708
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:33,074
I have no idea.

709
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:38,114
My suspicion is, it doesn't, but let's hope I'm wrong because I enjoy being wrong.

710
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:42,165
Uh, I don't know. I don't know, man, I guess we're, we're pretty much out of time.

711
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:44,025
Why don't I'll give you the last word on this one.

712
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:44,145
I don't,

713
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:47,165
I don't have super strong thoughts because you're the one with the ring doorbell.

714
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:47,474
Uh,

715
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:47,594
oh,

716
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:52,165
we, we solved it back in the 19 fifties. LP Z LP zero on fire.

717
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:52,614
That's

718
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:57,265
on fire. Just bring that code back. We're, we've solved the problem.

719
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,420
A job well done.

720
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,329
Anyway. Anyway, it's so funny enough.

721
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,510
I'll rally up before we go is if only we

722
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,689
had a centralized place to store security details from software,

723
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:14,530
-- for example,
-- so some sort of vulnerability database or incident database maybe

724
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:15,089
if

725
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,010
that existed

726
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,790
anyway. All right.

727
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,469
