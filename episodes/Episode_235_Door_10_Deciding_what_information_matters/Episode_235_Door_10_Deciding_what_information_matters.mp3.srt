0
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,190
-- It's December 10th. Everybody. Happy December 10th. Yeah,
-- so my

1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,720
systems IP address is 182.168 0.86 dot something.

2
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,869
I'm actually just trying to pull it up but Josh wouldn't let me,

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,590
you knew this was coming.

4
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:17,129
So you use 192168.86.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,239
Yeah, Google Google Wifi. 0.49. 0, I like 0.49 because that's seven squared.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,000
That's a good number

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:27,209
and seven is the best prime as we've already covered.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,280
It is

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,000
so

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,930
12.168 0.86 0.49 is my systems IP address.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,080
So

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,200
-- now I'm
-- hacked. Oh no, you've leaked sensitive information on the internet.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,669
Yeah, so the deal was

14
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:45,259
Apple's internal IP S leaked by its search bot

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,000
and guess what? Apple's internal IP addresses are

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,500
-- one
-- 92.168 0.1 dot ted,

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,270
-- the other
-- one,

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,919
the class A 10 dot

19
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,139
Or, you know, I would have also accepted. What is it? One

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,689
72.16.

21
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,540
-- That's the
-- worst, don't we already,

22
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,540
I've complained about this on too many occasions.

23
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,059
-- You
-- know
-- what I like that? One because nobody knows

24
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,169
-- the
-- worst one. It's the, everyone screws it up. Don't get me started anyways.

25
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,250
But, yeah, I'm like, oh, Apple's internal IP S and I'm like, oh,

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,279
what these are public?

27
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:17,589
No, it's 10, do whatever. I'm like, well,

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,239
yeah, those are,

29
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,919
every large company on the planet uses

30
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,290
-- 10.0 no, no,
-- no. Even better.

31
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:27,809
We were hosting a couple of servers out at, um,

32
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,550
a provider in Vancouver that was hooked up to tell us

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,370
and I did a trace route

34
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,970
and the trace route normally gets like two real

35
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,449
IP S like local switch then gateway and then like

36
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,699
it disappears into tell us' cloud

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,010
and then it like pops out into real IP space except

38
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,569
this time I did a trace route and it was like,

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,550
it was like, you know, 17 dot blah, blah, blah 17 dot blah, blah, blah 10 dot blah,

40
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,720
blah, blah 10 dot blah, blah blah.

41
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,580
I'm like, wait, what

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,800
that happens all the time. Yeah, exactly.

43
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:59,129
And they were routing the 10 dot So tell us used to use 10 dot star

44
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,569
for their

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,919
routing cloud and it just made me laugh because I'm like, well, who cares?

46
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,788
Like here's the thing if you know the IP address of a system and that is what

47
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,720
allows you to hack it.

48
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:15,229
-- They have no security.
-- Yeah, you suck. I agree completely.

49
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,910
You know, I'm not going to tell people where I live in the real world.

50
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,770
Because they're going to like order pizzas to my house.

51
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,740
Hey, if someone's willing to order me pizza, I'll tell you where I live.

52
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,509
I'm just saying,

53
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,839
-- but you're also expected to pay for it.
-- Well, no, no, you need to pay for it.

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,279
-- Send it to me for free. Oh, yeah,
-- in that case,

55
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,399
right. Can I put my address here?

56
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,240
-- Because I love
-- pizza.

57
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,600
We'll put Kurt's address in the

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
-- show notes.
-- Exactly.

59
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:39,759
So, like I love, you know, like, because I have like a gigabit feed so like

60
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,369
you could toss the bejesus out of my IP and it's probably fine. But, uh,

61
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,160
yeah, like these people were making all this kerfuffle about, oh,

62
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,740
Apple's internal web crawling bot leaked an internal IP address

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,880
but it's like a 10 dot whatever IP address.

64
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,809
Like, how does that help?

65
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,820
I, you know what, you know what it is though, I think there is a certain mindset

66
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,970
that is of, you should never give out any information of any sort about anything.

67
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,410
And I mean, I'm not going to say it's wrong,

68
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,940
but I think you also need to understand that there's certain things.

69
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,570
If it leaks out, it's really irrelevant and it's

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,800
who cares. And like internal IP S are one of those.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,649
So I, I would agree and I,

72
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,020
I've dealt with ex-military people in a

73
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:24,720
previous job in the military information leakage

74
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,330
literally can kill.

75
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:27,509
And I'll be blunt,

76
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:28,804
a

77
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:34,195
-- web crawler search engine. Generally speaking, nobody's going to die.
-- I agree.

78
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,764
I think making a big deal about internal IP addresses doesn't matter.

79
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:42,524
I think leaking. For example, the operating system you're running is irrelevant.

80
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:45,604
There's, there's so many details that I, I will say.

81
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:49,164
-- Oh, Josh,
-- did you know I'm running Windows 10 on my desktop.

82
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,475
-- Yeah,
-- we talk about that a lot.

83
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,979
Right.

84
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,630
Right. But it, it doesn't matter. Right.

85
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,990
And now not giving, I wouldn't write it down on a list and say, oh,

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,679
here's everything I'm running in the IP addresses by any means.

87
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,080
But if it does get out, it doesn't really matter.

88
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,160
And I think insecurity, we're notorious for

89
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,960
trying, we, we basically treat everything equally when they're not.

90
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,589
And so we end up creating unnecessary emergencies.

91
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,428
Yes and no. Uh we do create everything equally and sometimes that is right.

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,540
So I've just been watching recently, a local lawyer who's doing

93
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,799
a series on police interrogations

94
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,380
and he points out that like

95
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,690
most people

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,540
can't decide or properly choose what is and is not safe to talk. Shut up, Siri.

97
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,940
Um Sorry, you better keep that

98
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:37,890
anyways.

99
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,549
Seriously.

100
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,850
My freaking watch is like I understand

101
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,100
Siri, stop.

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,089
So the point is this lawyer pointed out people during a police interrogation

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,250
cannot decide what is and is not important to talk about.

104
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,170
So you say on the advice of my counsel, I decline to answer that question

105
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,329
and that is the only safe answer,

106
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,239
right? You do not get to choose.

107
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,859
Oh, you're asking about the, the temperature today or what time it is?

108
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:07,369
Like, no, you're a squishy meat bag. Shut up.

109
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,420
Wait for your lawyer to show up and that's it.
