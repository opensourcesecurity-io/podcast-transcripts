Hello and welcome to episode 92 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,250
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Presser.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,340
Hey, Kurt. And today we have a guest, we have Rami

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,819
Sas with us from White Source. Say hello, Rami.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,190
-- Hey
-- guys, nice to be

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,629
here.

6
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,120
Awesome. Thanks man.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,079
And so I, I guess why don't you tell us a little bit about white source

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,069
-- and, and what you're up to and how it applies to security?
-- Sure.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,810
So we at White Source provide a service that lets software

10
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:38,270
engineering teams keep track on their consumption of open source components

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,150
and then provides them with various insights on

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,139
the open source components that they use.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,560
Uh the main driver for these teams to be using white source. Today's security.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,630
We very accurately and very consistently

15
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:57,110
provide them with information about vulnerabilities

16
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,180
that are reported on

17
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,299
open source components. But that's not the only reason

18
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:07,650
uh other reasons include license tracking and the various different metadata

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,900
that you want to know about the open source that you

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,949
take on.

21
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,629
Uh But generally speaking,

22
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:18,010
the main focus today in the entire industry is

23
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,610
to make sure that the open source you take

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,080
is secure enough and when you put it into your software,

25
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,129
that's not going to get you into too much trouble.

26
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,470
Yeah. Then that's fantastic.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,930
And I think that's a huge topic today as more and more people are recognizing that.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,250
Just grabbing random open source they find,

29
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,819
isn't it? It,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,129
it solves problems but you have to take care of it. Right.

31
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,410
It's kind of like having a pet. you need some care and feeding.

32
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:44,519
It's not just something you

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,830
you get for free and then never worry about again.

34
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:47,410
Right?

35
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:50,769
That, that's very accurate because you know, very generally speaking,

36
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:57,269
open source is great and many open source projects do a great job maintaining their

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,029
uh components and taking care of their users. But one that's not always the case

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,830
and two sometimes

39
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:10,154
some sort of disconnect between all of that great work done by

40
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:16,195
the community and what the end users of those components end up knowing about.

41
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:22,514
So we help the two sides of that equation sort of stay in touch, not by directionally,

42
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:25,514
but primarily by informing the users of the

43
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:29,634
open source about various issues that are found

44
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:35,035
and normally are even disclosed by the maintainers of the open source,

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,130
but that they don't have a proper way of tracking and knowing about

46
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,979
you, you talk about

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,309
tracking open source projects

48
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:45,259
and

49
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,500
that sounds like a good idea.

50
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:51,779
But I I know for a fact many projects and

51
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:55,059
or many products will say that that organizations are shipping,

52
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,979
contain hundreds to thousands of open source dependencies.

53
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,889
-- And I think expecting humans to, to track. That is crazy.
-- Right.

54
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,330
Right. Exactly. So, uh

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,660
we have actually a long experience with coming into our customers environments

56
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,119
and then comparing what they think they have versus what we can very easily,

57
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,589
automatically detect

58
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,429
that they are in fact using in their environments.

59
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,339
Uh Our

60
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:28,000
non scientific sort of research that we've done on this a while back

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,800
shows that normally we find three times as many

62
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,119
components as what the engineers think they are using.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,220
And these are the teams that actually take the

64
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:41,759
time to track the components that they download and,

65
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,460
and bring in.

66
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,100
Oh OK. I need to ask about that. That's three times. That's an insane number.

67
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,479
Is that because there are like dependencies of dependencies or is

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,520
that because people are just legitimately yanking in, you know,

69
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,919
stuff and forgetting about it?

70
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,580
So it's, it's a combination.

71
00:03:56,589 --> 00:04:02,759
So depending on the programming language, some are more prone to have a very broad

72
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:05,600
three of transitive dependencies

73
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,669
that get pulled in with, you know, a,

74
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:08,779
a

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,660
sort of benign looking

76
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,339
uh initial direct

77
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,980
open source component that you bring in.

78
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:20,928
Uh But it's also sometimes a result.

79
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,649
And again,

80
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,089
I'm talking about places that are mindful of this

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,450
issue and do try to track it manually,

82
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,750
not even discussing

83
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,929
uh teams that don't make an effort to track

84
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:37,029
the use of open source. Uh in those cases, what normally happens is that you

85
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,890
sometimes even need to get the approval

86
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,730
to use a certain component

87
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,899
and uh you do that,

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,399
but then when you up

89
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,619
create a version, you don't go and ask for another approval.

90
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,790
And then normally what happens is the newer version

91
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,730
has different transitive dependencies or

92
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,859
different versions of transitive dependencies

93
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:02,899
and that impacts the status of, of your overall inventory as well.

94
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,700
Uh And then sometimes you just forget to ask

95
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,149
or things get slipped through the system in

96
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,500
various ways. Yeah.

97
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,410
Well, I've definitely seen that where, you know, projects

98
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,019
that you're importing

99
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,690
all of a sudden they're pulling in a whole pile of other dependencies with.

100
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,489
Well, oftentimes I have no idea why, you know,

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,540
and I'll try and track it down and sometimes it's a, oh, they added spell check,

102
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:24,890
right?

103
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,829
OK. Cool. But

104
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,850
yeah, I find a lot of these projects, you know, they,

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,970
they care a lot about adding features and the easiest

106
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
way to do that nowadays is to import food,

107
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:38,049
right? So look, open source is just as much software as the

108
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,529
propriety

109
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,880
software is.

110
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,019
And

111
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,500
in the same way that you would want to rely on open source components

112
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,899
to avoid reinventing the wheel.

113
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,390
Uh The same sort

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,450
of thought process goes on with the people who develop the

115
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,420
open source projects and they rely on other open source projects

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,529
so that they don't have to re invent the wheel when they want to add some new feature,

117
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,049
turtles all the way down.

118
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,820
-- Right. Right.
-- Definitely.

119
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,049
I'm curious. Are you also tracking the health of some of these projects?

120
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,799
Because, um, I'm just trying to find the link but there was recently a,

121
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,959
uh, it was one of those f,

122
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,089
what was it? It was one of those headless web

123
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:19,570
client things that, you know, suddenly shut down and, like, froze their github

124
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,239
accounts.

125
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,320
We discussed it a few weeks ago,

126
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,410
right. I don't know exactly what you're referring to, but we do uh

127
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:30,200
in some cases, not all cases, we do

128
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:38,260
uh try to connect to uh the online back tracking systems of uh these projects

129
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,829
and also to the general repository

130
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,109
gab or otherwise

131
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:50,290
and get some sort of a, we call it the quality metrics or operational metrics

132
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,070
or what you call health status

133
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,649
by looking at reported bugs and how quickly they get resolved and how many

134
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,815
meets, how often you get to see comms.

135
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:06,274
And we also compare different versions of the same project

136
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,565
based on

137
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,545
uh coms

138
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,304
and the poor

139
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:13,084
requests and stars and so on and

140
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:17,464
the bugs that were reported and they resolved in each of the versions

141
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,964
and sort of provide an overall quality

142
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:20,954
score

143
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:23,165
uh for these components.

144
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:25,434
That's a fantastic idea.

145
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,325
I know that's something Kurt and I have talked about more than once is the fact that

146
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:33,170
if you have a bit of open source, it hasn't received, you know, a commit in,

147
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,000
say three years like that, that's not a healthy project, right?

148
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,429
But, but if, what you're talking about, that's,

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,070
that's a really cool idea. So, I guess let's, let's explore that a bit.

150
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,980
Then I'm curious,

151
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,459
you assign something a score and what does that mean for someone using your product?

152
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,179
Does it mean

153
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,059
they can say I'm only willing to accept software that's

154
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,239
above some level or is it just kind of like,

155
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,260
hey guys, be careful or, or what, what does that mean?

156
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,700
So again, we provide both alerts or

157
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:05,540
at least some sort of visibility into that information

158
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,850
as well as let you set policies based on that.

159
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,700
So we have a relatively advanced policy system

160
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:16,130
that lets you set your tolerance level on

161
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,269
various different matrices of the open source components.

162
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,089
So you can set policies based on

163
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,570
security vulnerabilities and their severity based on the

164
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,529
kinds of licenses that you are willing to accept and the ones you want to reject

165
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,119
and the quality score that we talked about,

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,330
and then we can enforce these policies for you back in the development environment.

167
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,239
So again, depending on how strict you want to be,

168
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:42,457
you can

169
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:44,838
construct the policy failure

170
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:51,768
to either just uh raise an alert and send you an email or completely block the bill.

171
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,359
So you can fail a bid if a developer is trying

172
00:08:55,369 --> 00:09:00,299
to add a component that doesn't comply with your organizational policy.

173
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:03,609
So the best example again would be around security policy,

174
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,098
uh security vulnerabilities.

175
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:10,510
If someone is now trying to add a new component that has a known vulnerability

176
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,419
and you have set a policy to block that,

177
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,530
then that person would simply not be able to complete their bill,

178
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,090
their bill will fail and they will get a full report telling them what happened,

179
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:26,260
what the policy violation was in which component and what the policy says.

180
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,869
And they would simply have to go and replace it.

181
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,440
A sort of middle ground here is that we also

182
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,780
allow you to kick start some kind of a workflow

183
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,619
either internally in our system or by connecting it

184
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,979
with Jira or with the visual studio work items.

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,260
That's really cool. So I'm gonna,

186
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm gonna make a statement that that could be controversial to some but

187
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,599
with a system like this

188
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,520
and the visibility open source creates

189
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,070
it with kind of just the universe in general.

190
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,429
If, if you're using

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,030
something similar to what white source offers you,

192
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,200
I would dare say open source is probably more secure

193
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,440
to use than, than a closed source.

194
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,530
Because when it's closed source,

195
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,549
you don't necessarily have any insight into what's happening,

196
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,549
right?

197
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,830
Depending upon what the vendor is saying, this is, this is crazy.

198
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,099
So

199
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,309
I won't let you pull me into giving you a definity.

200
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,830
No, no, no, I don't expect you to. It's fine. You can just tell me I'm a crazy person.

201
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:26,859
I'm

202
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,179
just

203
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,590
thinking out loud here.

204
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,469
Yeah.

205
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,400
You know,

206
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,030
I've heard these statements before but

207
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,549
I found that the people on both sides

208
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:37,960
of these arguments

209
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,030
feel very strongly about their opinion and I don't feel that strongly about mine,

210
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,840
so I'd rather not go there.

211
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,760
Uh, I,

212
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,789
I don't think there is a real way to determine

213
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,010
if open source is more secure than closed source.

214
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,280
Uh, what I do think is that security in these two cases behaves differently.

215
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,119
Yes.

216
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,479
And, and that's what I guess that's my point.

217
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:04,969
I think you said it better is I'm not

218
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,700
suggesting the open source is more secure necessarily.

219
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,940
I'm suggesting that

220
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:13,510
due to the openness and now things like white source existing

221
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,880
using an open source dependency can be more secure if you're doing it correctly.

222
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,440
Whereas with closed source, you're completely beholden to your vendor.

223
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,799
-- I
-- think part of it is the maturity model, right?

224
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,380
The the maturity models for open source and closed source are very similar but

225
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,619
slightly different in that. I think being open source forces you

226
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,140
to really avoid certain practices because, you know, you,

227
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,119
you can't be swearing in your bugzilla or, you know,

228
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,190
um it's just being open forces certain behaviors a

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,219
lot sooner than maybe in a proprietary company,

230
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:44,580
right?

231
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:46,130
And um

232
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,520
one thing I've noticed like there are well in the open source world,

233
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,309
there's vendors all the way like I've had, I had one project

234
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,250
argue they wanted more CV.

235
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,179
S like they wanted to break down their security

236
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,679
flaw into like very discreet chunks and CV.

237
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,929
All of them. And I'm like, no, that's,

238
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,419
there's like a root cause you just give that one root cause the CV.

239
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,309
And we're done and they're like, no,

240
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,669
we want to break it up more and be really clear and you know,

241
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,400
all the way to other open source projects where

242
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:10,690
they don't know what security is or it's literally,

243
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,080
you know, one guy working on it on his weekends,

244
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,919
you know, and then the same thing for proprietary software,

245
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:19,010
right? You've got all the vendors all the way from like, hey,

246
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,190
we'll pay you 200 grand for a flaw. Like Microsoft is a great example, right?

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,429
They went from being not very fun to report security flaws to,

248
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:27,900
to now like

249
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,359
being quite friendly about it and having bug bounties and then, you know,

250
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:33,549
you've still got the old timey vendors where it's like,

251
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,900
oh, we're going to sue

252
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:35,780
you, you know,

253
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,440
and, and everything in between, of course. Right.

254
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:38,969
So I think,

255
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,500
I think the open source model simply just

256
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,510
forces different behaviors sooner in the maturity process,

257
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,179
maybe

258
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,460
and maybe give you a different perspective on that.

259
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,950
Uh and elaborate a little bit about the differences in what I

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,750
mean by uh how security behaves differently in proprietary and open source.

261
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,989
Is that on the one hand,

262
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,179
uh

263
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,440
open source communities are relatively better let's call it at

264
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,349
identifying vulnerabilities faster and then patching them faster and push,

265
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,210
pushing those patches out uh

266
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,109
to the users.

267
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,400
But the flip side is

268
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:29,049
that these vulnerabilities get much more exposure and are very public

269
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:32,140
versus proprietary vulnerabilities

270
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,979
that don't get disclosed.

271
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,789
And that means that the Attackers and hackers

272
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:41,010
are usually much more aware

273
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,169
of a open source vulnerabilities and know how to look for them

274
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,609
and exploit them.

275
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,700
Uh

276
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,080
much more so than they are to close those vulnerabilities.

277
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:59,109
So that, that's the kind of the way I see it on the two sides of why

278
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,099
uh they are,

279
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,559
you know, there are different sort of security concerns

280
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:06,239
when you look at open source.

281
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,190
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely fair now,

282
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,760
I guess kind of elaborating on that then is,

283
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,479
does your product detect any

284
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:17,479
uh I guess closed source third parties?

285
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,789
-- Do you have any partners in that regard or is it strictly open source?
-- Right.

286
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,049
So we don't do that ourselves.

287
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:23,419
Uh

288
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:29,049
You know, we are much more focused on the open source side of the road.

289
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:34,179
We have partnered with some other vendors who do that much better than we

290
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,890
do and have been around for a long time and have proven technologies.

291
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,140
Uh Checkmarks is one and IBM app

292
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,440
scan is the other.

293
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,729
Uh these are good partners of ours and

294
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:50,500
they have very robust offerings around application,

295
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,580
security testing,

296
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:54,099
both static and dynamic.

297
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,359
Oh, very cool.

298
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,619
So I want to also talk about

299
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:05,119
licenses for a little while because I know you guys detect open source licenses and I

300
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:10,109
know it's not exactly security, but it's definitely it falls in the risk bucket.

301
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,239
Would, can you kind of explain

302
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,510
-- what, what detecting licenses means for, for people using open source?
-- Sure.

303
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,400
So maybe just spend a minute first on just

304
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,070
talking about what an open source license is.

305
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,309
I would even dare say philosophically

306
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,429
open source from a legal perspective is

307
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,650
treated just like any other literary creation

308
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:38,109
and it comes with a copyright

309
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,419
by default.

310
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,960
So when you create some poem

311
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,820
or a short story,

312
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,460
even if you publish it online,

313
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,960
you still retain the copyrights without doing anything special,

314
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,580
people cannot copy your poem and then even slightly modify it and sell it

315
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,700
as their own.

316
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,900
That's illegal.

317
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,099
And the same principle applies to

318
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:04,940
code to source code.

319
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,539
So if you want to publish

320
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,409
some source code,

321
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:17,059
in order for it to be open source, you must attach some kind of a legal document to it

322
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,869
that waves your copyright

323
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,929
of that source code.

324
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,549
So that's a really important point I think.

325
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,609
And it's something that I know for a long time.

326
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,840
For example, when you created a repo in github,

327
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,489
there was no license associated with it, meaning

328
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,070
it was basically illegal for anyone to use that source code.

329
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,570
And and thank goodness they've solved that problem. But

330
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:43,919
-- yes, this is, this is a marvelous clarification. Thank you please go on.
-- Sure.

331
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,099
Uh

332
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:50,890
So now that people do want to publish their creation as open source,

333
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,679
they would normally uh attach some license

334
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,609
to it.

335
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,919
Uh And there's a very broad range

336
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,150
but we know over 500 different licenses.

337
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,489
But most projects end up choosing from,

338
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,660
uh I would say 5 to 10 of the most popular

339
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,079
licenses.

340
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,229
Uh

341
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:19,010
The names you probably heard about uh Apache,

342
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,989
the Apache public license and the family of licenses that

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
falls under the category that's called the GP L.

344
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:29,030
That's the new public license that have

345
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,670
different versions with slight variations on, on

346
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:35,030
what they allow and what they don't allow.

347
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:35,989
Uh

348
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,989
And these are all there

349
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,910
uh primarily to

350
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,869
sort of take care of the copyright part of

351
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,030
the engagement.

352
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,109
But since they are there, the creators also added some additional provisions

353
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,699
uh in the more permissive licenses,

354
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,790
they at least want to protect themselves from being sued

355
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,839
uh by the end users for providing faulty

356
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,280
programs.

357
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,670
So if I want to publish some piece of open source,

358
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,119
and I don't have that many resources because I'm doing it for free,

359
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:25,699
I don't do very heavy quality checks and I may end up publishing a project that

360
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,560
uh could do you some damage,

361
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,339
you know, potentially,

362
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
but I don't do it on purpose.

363
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,739
I still don't want to find myself in a situation

364
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,280
when you come back and sue me for that damage.

365
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,660
So even the most permissive licenses have some kind of provision that prevents you

366
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,729
from,

367
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,589
uh, coming back and, you know,

368
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,800
ta taking some legal action against me for doing something,

369
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,939
uh, in, in the open source that I published,

370
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,250
uh, the more restrictive licenses, take it a few steps further

371
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,160
and sort of the, the most restrictive ones usually are considered

372
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,060
to have what's called the copy left

373
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,229
clause,

374
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:13,209
which is a variance of, of the copyright

375
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,400
that says, OK, we publish this project for free.

376
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,920
You can use it, you can modify it, you can do whatever you want.

377
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,189
But in return your own code also needs to be open sourced

378
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,530
and then

379
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,040
that those kinds of copy

380
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,569
left

381
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:36,199
licenses. Uh What I mentioned earlier is the GP L family, not all of it, but most of it

382
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,170
-- and,
-- and they're,

383
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,780
they're often viral with respect that if you use that source code in your project,

384
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,219
your project must be GP L license depends

385
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,609
how you're using it.

386
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:47,670
OK?

387
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:54,800
By the way, not necessarily GP L, it can be under a different license,

388
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,420
but it needs to be open source.

389
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,900
It's sort of soft viral. It's not

390
00:19:59,089 --> 00:19:59,130
hard.

391
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,619
That explanation was marvelous and I thank you for that. But now now explain to me

392
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:09,979
why people should care, right? Why is this something

393
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,979
a security scanning company essentially cares about? Right?

394
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:16,489
Why should someone care about these licenses?

395
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,829
Right. Look so commercial endeavors

396
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,680
don't normally want to publish their proprietary code as open source.

397
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:30,239
So at the very least they want to make sure

398
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,000
that they are not bringing in any what you called viral

399
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,410
licensed

400
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,229
uh components that would then compel them

401
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,339
to release their code.

402
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:43,650
And there have been several legal precedence is

403
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,459
set on this where courts have enforced these clauses

404
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:53,160
and sometimes forced companies to either publish their code or reach some sort

405
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,420
of a commercial agreement with the original author of the open source.

406
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,130
That's the more extreme case,

407
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:07,270
the lighter cases uh is even if, if the license is not viral and not copy left,

408
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,170
there are normally some other provisions, especially around attribution

409
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,319
that compel you to give some credit

410
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:21,640
or mention the original author in some way when you distribute your software

411
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,150
and these are things that are normally easy to do.

412
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,869
You just add some clothes to your end user license agreement or publish

413
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,520
a list of the libraries that you're using online,

414
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,260
but you just have to do it,

415
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,640
you know, you can get into trouble for not doing it even if it's easy.

416
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,530
And it would be a shame, you know, just, just, uh not to, to let that slip by you.

417
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,030
Well, and now it,

418
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,900
it's also worth noting that some of these licenses

419
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,069
are incompatible with each other where you can't legally combine

420
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,390
cer certain licenses. Right.

421
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,400
Right. Yeah, it's, it's more nuanced than that.

422
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,839
So there are specific clauses in certain licenses that they

423
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:10,540
kind of collide with other specific clauses in other licenses.

424
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,949
And again, I think it, I'm not a legal expert so I,

425
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,010
I don't know how to give legal advice on that.

426
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,430
Uh, no, we, right.

427
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,660
Anyone looking here for legal advice,

428
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,439
like you're in way bigger trouble than the advice you're gonna get from

429
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:24,869
us.

430
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,550
I would say go find a phone book,

431
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,510
but I don't think those exist anymore but go find an IP lawyer.

432
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah. But those do exist. They are very

433
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,189
rare but

434
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,469
they're

435
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:33,770
out there.

436
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,030
So I was just, it's funny because I was just thinking back to that,

437
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,030
remember that guy that um basically contacted Mercedes and

438
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,459
you know, said, like, look, my car says it has open source, send me the CD

439
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,060
with it

440
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,349
and he got that Josh, remember from a few months ago,

441
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:48,770
I

442
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,560
just,

443
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,969
here's the best thing ever. Uh Google Mercedes open source

444
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:57,739
and you get open source license agreement, please enter VIN number, show license.

445
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:02,189
So if somebody I'm gonna try and find a Mercedes VIN number. But I'm thinking,

446
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,500
for example,

447
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,130
does your product allow people to create like manifest or inventories of sort of?

448
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,959
Well, I'm assuming it creates manifests and inventories of all the software and

449
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,079
inside and imported.

450
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:15,699
Uh does it also, for example, generate like manifests of the licenses?

451
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,250
Yes. So yeah, that's, that's like a like a very core feature for us is that we let you

452
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,260
produce reports that they list all of the different licenses and then help you

453
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,219
uh automatically generate some of the collateral

454
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,630
that you are required to generate and then

455
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,510
attach it to your own agreement or post it online.

456
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:41,229
So we try to make that sort of administrative part easier

457
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,510
and as automated as we can.

458
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,430
That's fantastic.

459
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:48,310
This is, you know, it's funny, I,

460
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,829
I love having these conversations and looking at what,

461
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,550
where the industry is heading because

462
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,790
Kurt and I've been doing this forever

463
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:55,800
and

464
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:02,010
we both got our start manually going through software and looking at

465
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,589
dependencies and looking at license files and looking for security flaws.

466
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,040
And

467
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,660
I mean,

468
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,560
I remember gripping source code for patterns because you

469
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:13,479
wanted to make sure nothing else contained some terrible bug

470
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,839
and it was terrible. It was so terrible to do

471
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,829
and, and the things out there now are, this is,

472
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,750
this is fantastic

473
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,670
and

474
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,979
it's also,

475
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:30,030
I beat my head against the wall because there are so many people in so many projects

476
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:35,505
that still don't understand this. And it's, I think we have a long way to go, I guess.

477
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,375
Let, let, let me ask you this. Maybe, you know,

478
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:41,814
do you have any research with respect to what percentage of, I guess,

479
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:44,175
either projects or products or whatever you want to call it?

480
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:49,305
Kind of realize this is a problem they have to deal with versus the ones that are just,

481
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:49,655
you know,

482
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,494
they have no idea yet.

483
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:53,535
Are you referring to open

484
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,824
source projects? Or to commercial development.

485
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,160
Uh anything really?

486
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,359
Right, because it, it, it affects everybody, I mean,

487
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:03,729
not just commercial vendors and not just open source projects.

488
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:04,130
Right.

489
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:12,859
Right. So our best estimate is that we are now at around the 10% line

490
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,119
of, of awareness or more than aware. So people who actually take action

491
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:22,920
to try and, and automate

492
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,030
uh these activities around open source.

493
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,819
So we are talking about

494
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,189
the what's called the early adopters,

495
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,479
right? Yeah, the entire market is still in the early adoption phase.

496
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:36,670
Although it's coming up on the end of

497
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,510
the early adopters and we'll probably start hitting

498
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,349
early mainstream

499
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:43,270
within a year or so.

500
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,109
-- Oh,
-- wow, that fast.

501
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,349
It's not that fast. We've been around for six years. But,

502
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,900
ok.

503
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,969
Well, and just for reference, I plugged in a 2014 sedan VIN number

504
00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:56,400
uh and Mercedes for their C class.

505
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,750
It, it's a 1450 page PDF with all the licenses

506
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,819
and contents

507
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,609
-- like
-- it's totally reasonable.

508
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,359
It's got about 40 or 50 licenses in here. It's

509
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:12,319
uh

510
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,239
and

511
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,630
the thing that makes it so long is it's got a list of all the copyright holders

512
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,359
for every single thing,

513
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:25,839
right. So, I, I totally hope that they have some kind of an automated tool to do that,

514
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:26,119
but

515
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,150
there wasn't some cool engineer sitting, you know, hours before the G A day

516
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:37,069
sweating these licenses and putting them together.

517
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:38,229
Yeah.

518
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,989
But I mean, yeah, that's, that's, that's just thinking of that,

519
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,819
like generating a list of every single copyright holder for every

520
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:46,609
piece of software and use in a major project would be,

521
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,180
no, I would not do that. I would, would have to be automated

522
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,229
clearly.

523
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,390
Yeah, that's, that's not a good use of engineering time.

524
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,869
You know,

525
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,589
you're much better off developing new code

526
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,449
than doing these mundane administrative tasks.

527
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:02,359
Yeah.

528
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,939
So I'm, I'm curious because it, it seems, I mean,

529
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,160
this is something I've been wanting for a

530
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,430
long time because there's a ton of manufacturers.

531
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,250
For example, Linux is a real thing where

532
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,869
a lot of manufacturers grab a copy of like Linux and Busy Box and put out a product.

533
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,060
You know, for example, those uh I hate to say, but pretty much every low end video

534
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,030
security camera that's IP you know, enabled on the on the market is pretty much

535
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,449
they're pretty much all running Linux.

536
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:34,209
And so these guys, do you find that they're starting to be aware of this or they,

537
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,290
they just don't care

538
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:35,890
like is,

539
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,780
is there a chunk of the market that fundamentally doesn't care about this problem?

540
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,849
I I think there still is but they think it's

541
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:47,579
going away uh definitely see the bigger manufacturers taking note

542
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,729
uh even in, in the devices industry,

543
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,880
uh they care because they are, their exposure is much broader

544
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:01,900
then uh someone developing enterprise software

545
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,969
that ends up distributing the software

546
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,640
if they are very lucky to 1000 or 2000 different locations.

547
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,640
When you manufacture devices, you distribute them by the millions.

548
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,520
And then every single such distribution

549
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:22,760
could constitute a problem. It's also much harder to upgrade

550
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,390
a software version

551
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,750
on a camera

552
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,310
than it is with an enterprise software customer.

553
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:33,069
-- I
-- think by much harder, you mean they never update the

554
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,469
camera pretty much.

555
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:38,180
So, if you got some kind of vulnerability distributed,

556
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,829
it's pretty horrible to try and update software on, you know,

557
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,030
millions of devices that you already sold.

558
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,910
Right. Right. Well, what was the band that took down Krebs's website?

559
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:49,689
M Ira? I,

560
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,979
yeah. Right. Right.

561
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:51,839
And, you know, I

562
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:53,079
have a feeling that,

563
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,280
yeah, they're still around, I'm sure. Right.

564
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,650
Like none of those devices have been taken offline.

565
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,790
Well, I mean, the biggest thing is a lot of them hopefully have put,

566
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,989
been put behind firewalls.

567
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,550
Like we just recently had the thing with the MM

568
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,589
CD. Right. Where MM

569
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:04,739
Cash

570
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,099
D was amplifying attacks

571
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:10,469
and they managed to get most of them taken offline so that it's much less of a problem.

572
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,069
But, yeah, I mean,

573
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,339
when your solution has to be update software, especially in these low end, I mean,

574
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,479
I've seen IP

575
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,229
enabled cameras that cost 20 bucks now,

576
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,829
you know, I was at the store, you remember a few months ago and they had, uh,

577
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,130
they had wi fi routers for, uh, what was it, like, $16 or something,

578
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,449
you know?

579
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:31,180
It just blows like I just, I'm astounded, you know,

580
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,619
that you can even get that thing shipped here for that little money.

581
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,630
-- So, yeah, I don't know.
-- It's

582
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,660
my, my fear is that those are going to be the laggards

583
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,160
in the adoption curve.

584
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,469
And if we're only in, still in the early adopter stage, we have,

585
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,079
it's gonna be a long road until we get there.

586
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:55,859
I have to tell you, I, I, I'm seeing more and more of the larger manufacturers,

587
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:58,459
at least paying attention to these issues.

588
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:01,030
Smaller ones will take longer to get there.

589
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,500
But I think the, the awareness is already there.

590
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,270
That's,

591
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,069
that's fantastic. I think I'm, I'm glad to hear that just because

592
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,329
this is,

593
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,689
this is one of those problems that, that

594
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:16,670
I, I think a couple of years ago felt like it was never going to be better.

595
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,109
And now hearing you say that that makes me think,

596
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,569
maybe just maybe there's hope and once they have hope,

597
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,750
-- but I'm thinking maybe it's there so it's
-- definitely there.

598
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,900
I don't want to name names of specific companies that we talk to, but,

599
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,329
but some of them are very large device manufacturers.

600
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,739
Well, I, I think of this problem is a lot like food safety, right? Like

601
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:41,140
uh as much as people hate on, you know, fast food chains,

602
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,099
the majority of fast food chains now have very good food safety.

603
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,930
You know, they have the procedures,

604
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,729
they have the rules they have the implementation.

605
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:49,099
Right.

606
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:50,239
Um,

607
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:50,920
because, uh,

608
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,729
just so like I know a health inspector and some of the stories she tells us are,

609
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:55,900
are quite horrifying

610
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,560
and so I suspect it's a bit like that. Right.

611
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:03,000
It's, it's, it goes to maturity and also having the funding to, you know, to do this.

612
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,380
Right.

613
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,359
I guess part of it is maybe hopefully the market will speak at some point and,

614
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,280
and only buy

615
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,599
the good devices.

616
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,030
The challenge being is, you know, how do I know what those good devices are?

617
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,060
So, I'm curious, one thing, do any of your customers sort of

618
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,719
advertise or trumpet that they use

619
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:19,869
your software?

620
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,050
Because that's one thing I've kind of looked

621
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,530
around when I'm trying to look for software,

622
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:22,880
you know, uh

623
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,930
especially on the proprietary side, like, do they

624
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:29,329
like, how good is this proprietary software for security? Right. Do they,

625
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,859
for example, have a security contact email address, you know, do they

626
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,280
trump it any secure development practices or using vendors such as yourself?

627
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,510
Like, do you find anybody's using that as marketing or advertising yet?

628
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,680
Uh Not really,

629
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:46,010
but I don't really see many people advertising that they

630
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,239
have strong firewalls or that they do periodical penetration tests.

631
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,390
I don't see that becoming a marketing to.

632
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh, my goodness. I hope not. That would be a train wreck, I think.

633
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,069
Well, you know, I think about cars, right?

634
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,140
Like for example, Volvo, their big thing is safety right,

635
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,300
three point seat belt and all that, you know, anti lock brakes, airbags,

636
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,750
which are now standard across the industry.

637
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,260
Yeah.

638
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,040
But that's, that's something, you know,

639
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,660
everyone can understand when you're talking to non

640
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:16,109
software development professionals.

641
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,680
What would they know about open source security

642
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,160
or even other kinds of software security?

643
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,920
Oh, I agree.

644
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,420
But, I mean, simple things even just ask your manufacturer,

645
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,560
do they know what's in this thing?

646
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:27,000
Right.

647
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,260
I've had to ask that before and they don't have an answer or can't give an answer.

648
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,640
So it's clear that they don't know.

649
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:36,750
Yeah. Right. But look, the, the day this becomes a marketing

650
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,500
feature is the day that your mother will start asking these questions. Right?

651
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,010
Yeah.

652
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,459
So never.

653
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:50,890
Oh man, I love it. All right, cool. So we're, we're about out of time, Rami.

654
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,310
I want to thank you so much for spending some time with us.

655
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,579
I think we had a great conversation. I really liked it.

656
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:59,180
I think we talked about all the important parts. So, you

657
00:32:59,329 --> 00:32:59,469
know,

658
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:00,449
thank you.

659
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,540
-- Yeah,
-- come back soon and let us know how things are going.

660
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,689
Yeah, definitely. Great.

661
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,670
Wonderful. So thank you, Rami. Thank you.
