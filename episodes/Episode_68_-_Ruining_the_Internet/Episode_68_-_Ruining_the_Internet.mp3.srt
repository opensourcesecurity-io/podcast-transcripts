Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 68 with myself,

1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,569
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,239
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:13,850
I feel like

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:16,209
we don't even have anything to talk about this week.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,389
-- Nothing lit on fire that I
-- know

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:18,729
of.

7
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,040
Nothing technical lit on

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,229
fire.

9
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:21,440
Just

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:22,049
ignore

11
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,340
the real

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,750
world. Right. We can, we can pretend

13
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,889
everything is fine.

14
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,729
Everything is fine

15
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:29,889
as it is.

16
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,159
Yeah,

17
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:33,958
nobody's gone to jail yet.

18
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,299
Not yet. Give it to him.

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:38,810
Oh, man.

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,720
Right.

21
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:41,689
Anyway, so what's new with you?

22
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,400
-- Uh,
-- I got a raspberry pi behaving nicely.

23
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,200
-- The poor little thing is very high system load, but it works,
-- man.

24
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,080
I love those little things. They're,

25
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,599
you know what I always think of is

26
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,540
a raspberry pie. Is, is what are they? Like? 30 bucks? They're super cheap

27
00:00:58,419 --> 00:00:58,990
and

28
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,700
it is magnitudes more powerful than the first

29
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,699
computer I ever bought for myself some,

30
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,980
you know, 20 years ago.

31
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:06,809
And,

32
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,209
yeah, it's crazy, man.

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,489
And,

34
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,830
and they're super cool and they're fun to use and they're easy

35
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,970
and they're cheap and I don't feel bad if I break it.

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,489
So

37
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,150
I love it.

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,550
Yeah,

39
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:17,139
I was just buying new batteries today for my UPSS.

40
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:17,550
Uh,

41
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,000
because, you know, you got to change

42
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,510
-- every 34 years, probably
-- buy new UPS.

43
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,169
You know, there's like, stuff inside of them that doesn't go bad.

44
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,279
Yeah, I had one

45
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:25,889
actually

46
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:26,660
not

47
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:26,819
just

48
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:27,069
that

49
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,930
they will still run

50
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,519
but the, the things that, that trip and prevent the,

51
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,370
doesn't matter,

52
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,629
jolts

53
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,720
electricity.

54
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:35,319
Um,

55
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,599
yeah, that's fair. Then. Why didnt have a UPS?

56
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:38,629
Well, it's,

57
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,680
it's mostly just so the internet doesn't cut out if

58
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,599
there is a little glitch for like one second.

59
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:42,879
There

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,120
you go.

61
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,059
Right.

62
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:44,930
Because like, literally,

63
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,379
I've got this huge honk and ABC 1200 Ups running two raspberry pies,

64
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,739
a cable modem,

65
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,889
-- uh DS L modem and uh a little um Intel Atom Firewall.
-- That's great.

66
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,250
So

67
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,129
they run for like two weeks.

68
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,569
Yeah, I mean, I think the whole setup is drawing something like 20 or 30 watts.

69
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,730
So it's not even an old timey light bulb.

70
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,160
No, no. Let me ask you this though. Is,

71
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:14,220
are your raspberry pies running straight off DC? Are you using AC to DC?

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,149
So, really, you've got AC or rather you got DC batteries converting to AC,

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,580
converting back to DC.

74
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,490
And then actually there's an instruct

75
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,669
I found once that shows you, you can put uh USB ports

76
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,910
on the

77
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,490
UPSS that way you don't have to worry about converting back and forth.

78
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,550
-- Yeah, that
-- would work

79
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,630
if I

80
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:33,910
walk

81
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,669
in.

82
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:35,899
And

83
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,770
anyway,

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:37,990
I

85
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,270
know.

86
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,559
Well, and here's the other thing.

87
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,039
Right is I used to worry about, like,

88
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,449
say lightning hitting and zapping all my equipment

89
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,610
and, and that would suck.

90
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:48,369
-- But, like, it would cost me less than 10 grand to replace
-- every,

91
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,679
it's gonna cost you like, 50 bucks.

92
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:51,259
I

93
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,649
mean,

94
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:52,460
so I have some,

95
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,690
I have a real nice monitor that I love

96
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,649
that.

97
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,490
I would cry if that got fried.

98
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,449
Well, no, I wouldn't because I'd just claim the insurance. Get a new one.

99
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,039
There you go.

100
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,089
And it would be better.

101
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:09,850
So, yeah. So, yeah. No, it's, the world has not really been too utterly terrible.

102
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,250
Um,

103
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,169
so I was thinking, why don't we talk about some sort of existential,

104
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,210
not really existential but some sort of looming long term

105
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,330
type threats.

106
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,089
Like, like robots taking over and killing us all or

107
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,130
even better. One of my favorites is we're running out of sand.

108
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,130
Yeah.

109
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,250
Yeah. Well, we're running out of a good kind of sand.

110
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,820
-- Is there
-- bad sand? I don't know. Yeah.

111
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,910
So there's like, there's lots of, it's like any kind of rock.

112
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,339
There's lots of different kinds of sand

113
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,610
and the kind of sand we want and like is the kind from the ocean

114
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,360
where it's been sitting there for, you know,

115
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,910
tens of thousands or millions or whatever years, uh,

116
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:48,570
rubbing up against other bits of sand and it's nicely rounded sand and it's,

117
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,550
you know, nice, it's not porous,

118
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,449
you know, it's, it's really awesome for building

119
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,399
cement,

120
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,520
you know, concrete buildings rather.

121
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,690
So

122
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,259
did you know,

123
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,559
I, I love watching documentaries

124
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:06,160
and I learned that white sand, beaches, white sand is uh, parrot fish poop.

125
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,250
They eat coral and then they poop. White sand.

126
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,309
So, yeah,

127
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,820
that's fun. Fact. Everybody,

128
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,710
white sand, beach fish poop.

129
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,928
All the phosphorus mines in the world that are basically economic. Are bat poop?

130
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,238
Are they still, I know they used to be,

131
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,359
uh, well, generally speaking, the ones that are, like,

132
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,730
really economically viable are still that.

133
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:27,190
But, yeah,

134
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,339
actually, do you know, I, I learned that because I was at, uh, in the US,

135
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,239
we have this cave called Mammoth Cave, which is named, such because it is huge and,

136
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,480
and it was when I went there.

137
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,940
But, yeah, I, I learned that actually they, they found the cave

138
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,779
and then it was converted into, yeah,

139
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,700
phosphorus mine was kind of its first lease in life when they

140
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,130
ran out of phosphorus and it turned into a tourist trap.

141
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,220
-- So, yeah, there like bat poop. Right. It's crazy,
-- man.

142
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:53,309
Yeah.

143
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:57,649
Well, you know, it's like any, technically these are renewable resources,

144
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,890
just sort of on human time scale.

145
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,670
That's non renewable, right? Like renewable is something like a tree

146
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:04,269
maybe,

147
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,670
right? Or, or the sun, the sun comes out every day for now.

148
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,410
And so life is good.

149
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,480
Yeah, much like the helium thing.

150
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,950
Everybody's like, yeah, there'll be more helium generated by uranium decay, but

151
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,100
-- it'll take a few million years.
-- I hear we can just steal it from the moon.

152
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:20,839
Right.

153
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,440
That's

154
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,899
three.

155
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,029
And, uh, one of my favorite science fiction writers,

156
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,589
Charles Strauss has written extensively.

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,130
Why? That's

158
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,859
an incredibly stupid idea.

159
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,500
That's fair. Everything is stupid.

160
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,850
Well, more of the point we can just, if you can build a working

161
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,049
fusion reactor,

162
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,269
chances are,

163
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,040
you can build something that'll run on something other than helium three.

164
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,619
There's, there's a whole bunch of different fuel sources just

165
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,200
as I understand it, helium three is sort of, in theory the easiest one to get to fuse,

166
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,540
right? And we're, you know,

167
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,510
sort of still at the banging rock stage of fusion

168
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,720
as it were still only like five years away.

169
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,089
I will admit I have no idea.

170
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:00,959
So I'll take your word for that one.

171
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:01,540
Yeah.

172
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:02,290
So,

173
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,869
and then here's my absolute all

174
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,970
time favorite one

175
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:05,690
is um

176
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,000
the cameras that are everywhere now

177
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,839
and doing facial recognition

178
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:11,230
or

179
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:15,320
they're not doing facial recognition and they're also not doing face blurring.

180
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,100
Yeah.

181
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:22,299
You know, I this is one of those things I think about a lot and, and it's not even just

182
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,679
the cameras everywhere. It's also,

183
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,779
there's all this like social media

184
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,739
and, and there's pictures of people everywhere and, and,

185
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,660
and like a great example is if you search Google for either of us,

186
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,250
it's like a cornucopia

187
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,440
of just pictures, right?

188
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,209
And, and

189
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,130
this is kind of the new normal and I wonder sometimes what, what is,

190
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,769
what is the eventual outcome here?

191
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,630
Because I know

192
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:50,209
there's places like the European Union that's trying to kind of

193
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,790
rein some of this in with like GDPR which is coming

194
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,649
and,

195
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,489
and to a degree, I think that's noble.

196
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:00,290
But at the same time I feel like it's completely impractical

197
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,859
and I don't know what the end game is.

198
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,619
I don't know what really interests me and

199
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,089
I'm not sophisticated enough yet to have one,

200
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,380
but apparently there's a lot of cameras, uh, now that take 360 pictures,

201
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,769
like 360 degree

202
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,579
pictures. So using some sort of a

203
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,730
combination, I guess of some fish eye lensing and of course,

204
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,980
like when you take a panorama shot, you just basically turn around and it

205
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,890
computer magics the picture together to make it look nice,

206
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,250
you know.

207
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,570
And so, for example, Google is letting people take these pictures because, uh,

208
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,910
well, if you do, uh, Google, you know, if you go to Google Maps and look up a business,

209
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,559
a lot of businesses now will

210
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,559
take 360 view pictures of their

211
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,970
business and put them, you know, online, right?

212
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,070
So that you can see what the business looks like inside, you know,

213
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,480
which is really good if it's like a,

214
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:52,269
there's this one chain of, uh, it's like a place for kids to play, right?

215
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,390
And you can see how cool it looks.

216
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,309
Um,

217
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,880
but, uh, the Google specifically points out that

218
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,359
So street view that, which is where Google takes the pictures,

219
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,630
they have software to blur out the faces and everything.

220
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,049
-- Yeah. But
-- here's the thing,

221
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,929
-- the 360 view stuff
-- doesn't,

222
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,839
-- people are uploading.
-- Ignoring that though is

223
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,670
even though Google might blur the pictures we look

224
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,230
at like I guarantee they have the originals.

225
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:22,119
Yeah. No true. But also I'm, I'm more likely to notice a Google street car.

226
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,480
I've actually seen them locally,

227
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,040
uh, that I am some, just some random, taking a picture that, you know,

228
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,950
also happens to be uploading it to Facebook or Google.

229
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,640
And, yeah, I was wondering about this and some things that really come to mind are,

230
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,869
you know, going back to those people on Facebook that, you know,

231
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,308
due to search algorithms were kind of being outed as, you know, whatever,

232
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,030
um, sex workers and stuff.

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,200
But one thing that I was kind of thinking about was, you know, undercover policemen,

234
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,469
right?

235
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:45,909
Because

236
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,109
how are you going to find people

237
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,320
that you can put through police training

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,270
-- that don't have a ton of pictures of themselves online?
-- That's a really good point.

239
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,380
And actually I could see a whole, like, criminal economy erupting

240
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,619
that that's essentially doing like background checks to prove this person

241
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,739
isn't a cop and they are actually a fellow criminal.

242
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,739
So

243
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:12,700
the good news is, most criminals aren't nearly that sophisticated.

244
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:14,380
But, um,

245
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,650
I mean, it, it really does. Yeah, I mean, you, you just can't hide your past. I mean,

246
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,510
uh, I was watching some fail videos and no doubt at some point, you know,

247
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:29,299
somebody's gonna be trying to get a job or, you know, maybe trying to get insurance

248
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,429
and that video of them,

249
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,700
like lighting themselves on fire while on a skateboard is gonna come up.

250
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,780
And quite frankly, if I have like five people

251
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,349
and four of them did,

252
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:42,309
were smart enough not to light themselves on fire

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,270
on a skateboard and put it on youtube.

254
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,619
And one of them wasn't smart enough to, you know, figure that out.

255
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,909
Chances are I'm gonna hire one of the four.

256
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,229
I don't know, man. That sounds like a cool story.

257
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,700
Yeah. But like what if he does it in the office?

258
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,059
What's the saying? Poor choices, make good stories.

259
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,969
No, I totally get this. In fact, I remember this when I graduated from college.

260
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,260
This was kind of the birth of people putting pictures on the internet.

261
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,289
And

262
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,840
I remember like many of us who graduated and we told, you know, our friends, like,

263
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,859
get those pictures off the internet, right?

264
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,580
Like I do not want these showing up when people search for my name on Google.

265
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,469
Well,

266
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,020
that's one thing I ran into is is I have a Facebook

267
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,599
account so that when people do tag me in their photos,

268
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,479
I'm notified otherwise they would just take me

269
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:30,789
in their photos and I would never know.

270
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,229
Yeah, that's true. That's a good point.

271
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:36,130
-- Right. And it drives me nuts because there's nothing I can really do about this.
-- No,

272
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,130
no, there isn't.

273
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,489
You're stuck with it.

274
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,210
But at the same time, so

275
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,780
I know people who will,

276
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:46,830
like, anytime you tag them they will go in and un tag themselves and they,

277
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,780
they do all this stuff and they talk about, oh, you know,

278
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,619
I don't want Facebook spying on me and it's like

279
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,260
you've already lost this battle,

280
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,270
right? Like, they're

281
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,710
totally

282
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:54,950
taking

283
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:59,099
the computers can figure it out pretty quick now,

284
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,070
right? Yeah,

285
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,349
that's always terrifying too.

286
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,559
And Facebook is like, I think this is so and so in your picture. And it's like,

287
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,409
yes,

288
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,159
yes, it is

289
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,429
really great Reddit posting about this.

290
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
Some guy lost enough weight that Facebook didn't recognize him

291
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,960
and he was like, so proud of himself. And I'm like, legit, that's

292
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,530
except Facebook, of course, you know, five minutes later figured it out.

293
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,719
Thanks to Reddit and came over, dude.

294
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,359
I actually, you know, what else this reminds me of is I,

295
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:27,090
I don't remember if it was Reddit or somewhere

296
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,500
else I saw but there was someone showing off.

297
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,380
They, they don't have a cat

298
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,570
and they kind of took a video and they took their cell

299
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,690
phone and they talked about cat food for a whole day.

300
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:37,989
And

301
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:42,080
what do you know, Facebook is showing cat food ads like the next day

302
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,109
and it's like,

303
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,820
Facebook says they're not listening to your microphone. Uh That's probably a lie.

304
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,710
It's looking like

305
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,229
-- I
-- was thinking what was actually more interesting about that.

306
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:56,030
Uh So Facebook is or maybe is not listening in

307
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,469
on your microphone and suddenly you targeted advertising on that.

308
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,840
That's regardless

309
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,349
what's really fascinating to me about this

310
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,690
is that I can't

311
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,440
prove it one way or the other

312
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:10,690
because part of it is if I have like the Facebook app on my phone,

313
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,000
it's sending so much encrypted data to and from Facebook,

314
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,340
how would I know?

315
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,359
So, actually I'm going to give Google a plus one here is on my Nexus phone.

316
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:25,830
I can, I went in and I turned off the microphone for the Facebook app.

317
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,559
So

318
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,609
in theory, Facebook is,

319
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,150
although the other thing I was thinking about this is what if Google

320
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,289
is spying on the microphone and then selling the ad data to Facebook,

321
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,859
which totally could be the case.

322
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,440
But what's fascinating to me about this is that we,

323
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,289
our cell phones are sending and receiving so much data on a daily basis.

324
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,760
Now, it's not like, like in the olden days,

325
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,130
it was really easy to see what an application did because you'd basically turn it on,

326
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,969
on your computer,

327
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,570
you know, turn on TCP dump

328
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,200
and wait for it to call home,

329
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:58,469
right? Like it was really simple and easy because they basically wouldn't,

330
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,799
like applications didn't really need to talk to the network unless you told it to,

331
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:03,640
right?

332
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,549
But now, applications like say Facebook, you know, they, they

333
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,039
must talk to the Facebook mothership to be of any use

334
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,809
so you can't block it,

335
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:17,580
you can't filter it because it's all SSL and TLS encrypted.

336
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,570
And it's typically, you know, those guys are pretty paranoid about it.

337
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,669
So they're, they're having their applications set to be, you know, not like, oh,

338
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,869
hey, the certificate whose name is a little wonky.

339
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,380
But sure, go ahead Anyways,

340
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,760
you know,

341
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,619
actually you bring that up and I just read

342
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,119
that Google Chrome is going to remove certificate pinning

343
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,559
mostly because it's a giant pain in the ass. It doesn't really help.

344
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:40,679
I know.

345
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,080
I mean, honestly, I looked into it and I was just, basically,

346
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,750
there was about a nine in 10 chance.

347
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,669
I would lock everybody out of our website

348
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,330
and about a one in 10 chance. I wouldn't.

349
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,070
Kurt, there was a 10 in 10 chance you were gonna have people out of your website,

350
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,750
let's face it,

351
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,070
you know. So, yeah. No, I absolutely not.

352
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,630
And well,

353
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,450
and then the other thing with the key pinning is how does that

354
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,190
work with things like lets encrypt or cloud flare all those other,

355
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,070
you know, uh services that do relatively short list certificate.

356
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:07,840
It

357
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,750
work for those at all.

358
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,440
And I would argue, you know,

359
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,169
the world would be much better off if like

360
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,559
everybody had like 30 days certificates instead of like

361
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,700
two years or I think I can actually buy. Uh,

362
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,169
what is the

363
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,429
longest sort of cheapest

364
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,880
SSL certificate I can buy? I wonder.

365
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,440
Well, ok, but you're only half right. I think,

366
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,119
I think for, for a normal website, yes,

367
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:40,059
many short lived certificates are superior to one pinned certificate.

368
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,419
But I think if you look at something like Google, for example,

369
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,049
I can understand why they want Chrome to pin their search because there are,

370
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,940
there are literally hostile organizations

371
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,549
that attack people connecting to Google.

372
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,369
Well, the thing is there, it's, it's,

373
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,960
you don't need to pin the actual Google certificate,

374
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,030
you just need to pin which C A is allowed to issue,

375
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,169
right?

376
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,659
And that solves 99% of your problem, right?

377
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,010
Because there's,

378
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,020
there's a current kerfuffle uh today or yesterday about the uh there's a,

379
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,549
a Dutch certificate authority like it's,

380
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,080
it's their National Dutch certificate authority, whatever.

381
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,330
Uh that's been in

382
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,119
browsers, like probably basically forever

383
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,200
uh except Holland

384
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,390
or sorry. Is

385
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,750
-- it the Netherlands is the correct name
-- of the country?

386
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:28,429
The Netherlands

387
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:29,840
Holland is the province,

388
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,150
the Netherlands is the country. Yeah. NL Netherlands.

389
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,840
So the Netherlands has passed some new legislation

390
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,739
that comes into effect on January 1st 2018.

391
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,719
So

392
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,640
couple months

393
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,520
basically saying that the security services are allowed to use

394
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,200
like fake keys to intercept data and you know,

395
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,960
do surveillance on people which

396
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,780
well,

397
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:55,659
yeah, probably means that that local C A is going to be strong armed or paid or

398
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,429
whatever

399
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,119
do you

400
00:15:57,229 --> 00:16:02,919
know? Is this C A, like a Star Wild Card or is it only for the.nl?

401
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:03,489
-- No, no, no,
-- it's

402
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,539
everything, everything. All right. So, yeah, like,

403
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:08,000
are there any C A that are actually locked

404
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,909
down to like a.nl or.jp or anything like that?

405
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,789
-- I don't really think there are, you
-- know, I, I don't know the answer to that.

406
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,690
And,

407
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,989
I mean, this is a great example of

408
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,570
the, the law enforcement organizations. Well, I'm sure they have good intent

409
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,710
in doing this. They're, they're,

410
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,210
if they're allowed to do it,

411
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,059
which I'm sure they won't be because I imagine that cer it's going to get yanked.

412
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,190
But if they do it, they, they make us all less secure. Right.

413
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,890
This isn't like, oh, we're doing this for the good of humanity.

414
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,010
It's like, no, you're ruining the internet

415
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,530
pretty much.

416
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:39,929
Uh,

417
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,669
oh, by the way I can buy easily up to three year certificates.

418
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,489
And how much is a three year cert,

419
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,460
$14.97?

420
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:47,650
It

421
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,969
-- sounds
-- crazy.

422
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:50,080
Oh,

423
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,520
my.

424
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,520
I remember when certificates were hundreds of dollars and it was like,

425
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,609
really hard to get them and you had to fill out like,

426
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,580
real paperwork and fax it somewhere.

427
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,020
Oh,

428
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,570
-- dear.
-- But, yeah, no. So back to that. I mean, that's,

429
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,930
uh, yeah, the certificate pinning. I, it doesn't really matter.

430
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,989
Especially my understanding is Google is now ac A and I think they've

431
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,300
issued, their C A has issued their own certificates. Have they? Not,

432
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,020
I have no idea.

433
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,839
But like when you, when you own a web browser, you can just become ac a, right.

434
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:21,420
It's fine.

435
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,069
But, uh, yeah, so basically, I mean,

436
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,619
what, what we really need is ideally is that DNS pinning of, you know,

437
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,589
which certificate, authority or authorities

438
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:34,119
are allowed to issue certificates for your domain and

439
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,079
subdomains because that's kind of really what matters.

440
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,699
Right? Because typically people have,

441
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,900
uh, you know, a reasonably long term

442
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,680
relationship with their certificate authority.

443
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,920
You know, if nothing else you fall into a rut and just kind of stay with the guy,

444
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,430
you know,

445
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,640
even if they're terrible because

446
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,550
actually there's, I know there's many large organizations that

447
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:57,750
they, they purposely use one certificate authority for all of their certs.

448
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,829
And the reason being

449
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,939
when they scan their infrastructure, if they see a cert that isn't from that C A,

450
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,949
like they know there are shenanigans be it.

451
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,880
Generally speaking, it's just someone like

452
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,910
a let's and crypt cert and they're doing something dumb. But, but

453
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:15,520
there's also the possibility that you have like a rogue actor in play here and,

454
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:15,989
and that

455
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,109
should not be there.

456
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,260
Yeah.

457
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,510
So I think the pinning certificates to ac A

458
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,310
to which C A or C A is plural that you use

459
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,189
makes a lot more sense than pinning the actual certificate because,

460
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:29,390
yeah,

461
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,550
if you ever have to roll that certificate over which you will have to do at some point.

462
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,170
I mean, it's just, it's a disaster.

463
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,770
Yeah.

464
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,630
Yeah, hopefully we'll see more of that.

465
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,000
So,

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,939
-- um,
-- well,

467
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:47,790
did you want to quickly discuss the 152 different things

468
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,689
-- that you can do to keep yourself safe
-- online?

469
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:50,380
That

470
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,180
crazy thing.

471
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,609
It's not.

472
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,530
Well, ok, so here's what happened.

473
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,930
Google did a survey of security pros and I don't remember being asked. Were you?

474
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,630
Goodness. No,

475
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,589
I think calling us professionals is a stretch,

476
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:05,209
right?

477
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,979
Anyway, so they did a security survey of about 231 infosec pros worldwide,

478
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:13,989
basically asking them, you know, kind of what,

479
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,920
what can you do or what should you do to be safe?

480
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,329
Um And some things

481
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,640
came up commonly.

482
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,359
So for example, patch your systems and software, 90 people mentioned that,

483
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:27,989
you know, on that or for example, use unique passwords, use strong passwords,

484
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,180
right?

485
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,369
Some very

486
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,010
generically good advice.

487
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,130
Um I'm gonna disagree but

488
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:34,569
go

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,969
on well. Ok. But what was interesting to me

490
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,439
was that basically the majority of the stuff is very difficult to do

491
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,400
remotely well and reliably let alone get it. Perfect.

492
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,790
So for example, like telling a human being to use unique and strong passwords

493
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,439
is impossible because they,

494
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:53,900
they're gonna have like 100 passwords and they

495
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,989
just physically can't remember that many different things,

496
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,339
right.

497
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,439
So, you know, what they probably should do is

498
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,270
use a password manager. What a great idea.

499
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,680
And you know, and I'm kind of looking at this and I'm thinking like, oh,

500
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:08,349
here's a great example, browsing habits use http S well,

501
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,040
I don't really get to use it either it's there or it's not

502
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,650
right. Like it's not really up to me.

503
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,040
Um, I don't get much say in the matter

504
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,719
-- and then my favorite was be careful slash think before you click.
-- Oh,

505
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:22,400
my goodness.

506
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,260
What does that mean?

507
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:24,660
No,

508
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,949
that is.

509
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,810
I want to scream when,

510
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,689
when people talk about that where you hear people say things like, oh,

511
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,739
-- look at the link before you click out
-- every

512
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,520
single link on Twitter is T dot

513
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:34,959
-- C.
-- Yes,

514
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,560
I know exactly like that. That's ridiculous advice.

515
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,630
And not only that

516
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:43,530
we need to be able to trust our web browsers. Right?

517
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,930
And, and we have to find a way to make it.

518
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:49,709
So these web browsers aren't serving malware and we aren't.

519
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,930
So you, you,

520
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,709
you should be able to open up any web page

521
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,430
and any email

522
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,270
and not have it on your computer.

523
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,030
Just that's it. That's all I have to say.

524
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,589
Because if, if, if that's not possible, we're up the creek.

525
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,069
That's a reasonable requirement I would say.

526
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:09,750
And the only exception I would say is for some reason if you've given that web page,

527
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,569
I don't know.

528
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,250
I actually know. I can't think of any exceptions.

529
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,430
The only exception I can really think is

530
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,400
if you download an executable from that page,

531
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,729
then run it locally then, you know, that's not your browser's,

532
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,589
that's,

533
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:20,469
that's fair.

534
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:21,130
Yeah.

535
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:24,209
But fundamentally anything my web browser or email

536
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:26,170
client suck down from the internet and,

537
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,430
like, try to display to me should not result in my system getting hosed

538
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,709
completely. Even with an ad blocker and a bunch of other stuff, running

539
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,319
my web browser and email client by definition have to

540
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:41,599
like, go grab all sorts of weird wonky stuff and there's no way

541
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,650
it can be ever safe because I mean, a great example that, you know,

542
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,560
the front page of cnn.com is over a megabyte.

543
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:46,920
Now

544
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,040
there's like how many elements in it?

545
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,250
I I don't know several 100

546
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:53,689
you know,

547
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,819
um or for example, you pull in something like Google ads and all of a sudden boom,

548
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,900
you're pulling in like 20 or 30 different things,

549
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:00,560
you know.

550
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:05,359
So yeah, no, that whole click uh think before you click or whatever. No, no, just,

551
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,319
I mean, think before you put your user name and password into something.

552
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,170
-- Yeah,
-- probably, maybe again, this is where a password manager kind of helps you.

553
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:12,329
Well,

554
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,310
-- actually
-- this is where two factor authentication with something like a

555
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,609
key comes in because

556
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,910
the host name is part of the authentication request.

557
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,790
So even if somebody manages to man in the it,

558
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,209
you, it's no good,

559
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:22,890
right?

560
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,060
And,

561
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:28,540
and so here's my take on this and you showed me this and my first reaction was like WTF

562
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,930
and then I read it and my reaction was wtf and,

563
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:36,099
and the reason though my reasoning changed at first I thought 100 and 52 things.

564
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,959
That's insane that anyone would be expected to know them.

565
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,420
And then I read it and I'm like, oh, ok.

566
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:43,739
So it's not that any one person is expected to know 100 and 52 things.

567
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,989
It's that our industry is so disorganized that you ask

568
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,199
a bunch of people and you end up with a

569
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,270
list of 100 and 52 instead of a list that

570
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,869
is six things because everyone is telling the same thing,

571
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,609
right? Like

572
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,229
this is crazy.

573
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,170
Well, more to the point, we don't

574
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:02,500
really have anything truly useful to tell people by and large because for example,

575
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,229
Josh, how do I use a web browser securely?

576
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,530
Right? And the only answer I can think of that makes any sense is like

577
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,329
use Chrome,

578
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:15,170
maybe Firefox

579
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,479
just like

580
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,869
IIII I curl up in the corner and cry

581
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,579
and that's,

582
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,189
that's the best advice I got.

583
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:27,189
-- And like
-- the only advice I would have for email security is use the uh don't use

584
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,640
like don't use an email,

585
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,229
-- like
-- use gmail. Look, that's the end of the story. All right.

586
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,630
I know there's people who think, oh no,

587
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,069
you can't use Google because they're evil and even through evil,

588
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,750
like they're doing a better job than you are.

589
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,349
And, and

590
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,130
I've given up Google one Google. You can have my email, right?

591
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,829
Like evil or not, you win,

592
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,579
-- you
-- know. And so,

593
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,030
yeah, you know, I just fundamentally and some of the advice here, like,

594
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,319
don't use or don't trust open networks.

595
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:58,439
-- Great. So, like, how do I get internet access again? If I'm not at my house?
-- You don't,

596
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:02,069
again, um, curl up in the corner, rock back and forth. Maybe

597
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:03,359
that's fine. That's fine.

598
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,839
Right. And the thing I keep thinking of here is

599
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,579
if, if you and I went to mechanics

600
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,719
in our respective locales

601
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,119
and as

602
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,280
the

603
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:16,969
mechanics, like,

604
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,650
what are the top three things we can do for the maintenance of our car?

605
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,770
I bet we get back the same list

606
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,239
because it's probably stuff like,

607
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:25,040
change your

608
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,410
oil

609
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:25,640
filter.

610
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:26,619
Right.

611
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:27,319
Exactly.

612
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,290
I don't know if that counts as one thing or two,

613
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,319
-- whatever.
-- It doesn't matter.

614
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:30,719
You know what I

615
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,219
mean? Like,

616
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,280
and make sure your tires are

617
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:37,569
-- inflated.
-- There are certain things because in a part of this mind you is

618
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,849
this is a very mature industry

619
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,410
and we are not.

620
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,630
But I think also,

621
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,270
uh, if you change your oil

622
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,569
or rather, I should say if you don't change your oil, like,

623
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,569
and obviously bad thing happens. Right. Like

624
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,089
we know what happens

625
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,589
if I don't use a password manager. Does a bad thing happen to me?

626
00:24:58,449 --> 00:24:59,020
Maybe.

627
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,319
No, no, we can't say yes because the answer isn't. Yes. The answer is maybe. Right.

628
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,420
And that's one of the challenges

629
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,869
there's a statistical likelihood that something may or may not happen,

630
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,849
which is basically useless.

631
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,530
You know, it's like trying to convince Children not to smoke.

632
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,569
Well, will this kill me?

633
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:15,959
Well,

634
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:18,989
there's a statistical increase in the chance that you will

635
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,079
develop something that may or may not kill you.

636
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,300
So I just lie to my kids and say smoking kills you.

637
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,359
And although I think history has shown us that,

638
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,540
that lying in such a way has backfired.

639
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,270
But, you know, for now, like with simple things, like,

640
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,560
you know, we look both ways before we cross the street so we can get smushed by a car.

641
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,479
That is good advice

642
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:46,270
or, or if you're in the Netherlands, you look both ways so you don't get hit by a bike,

643
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:46,670
right?

644
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:47,640
Same thing.

645
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,420
But yeah, just looking at this list of 100 and 52 things,

646
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,900
the only things I can see that are maybe actually somewhat helpful is

647
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,930
to just, um,

648
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,079
if it's too good to be true, it probably is.

649
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:05,239
And there was actually a really good article on CBC market watch.

650
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,479
It's uh our marketplace, it's our national news, their little thing where,

651
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:10,920
you know, people get ripped off and stuff

652
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,719
and people signing up for free trials online

653
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:15,839
of like skincare cream and stuff.

654
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
And there's like some fine print somewhere that says basically by signing

655
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,319
up for this free trial and paying the $5 shipping handling,

656
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,310
you agree to pay like $89.95

657
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,260
a month for continuing shipments unless you cancel in the next 74 seconds.

658
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,119
You know, and you can only cancel through registered mail to like Zimbabwe,

659
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,500
of course

660
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,109
or whatever.

661
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,010
And so, you know, all these people, of course,

662
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,469
sign up for a free trial and they're like, oh, it sucks.

663
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,500
I don't like it, whatever.

664
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,719
Throw in the garbage and then, you know,

665
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,810
a month later they get this huge credit card bill

666
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:47,020
and the beauty is apparently the credit card companies are like, well, yeah,

667
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,050
you signed up for that,

668
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:49,239
sorry.

669
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:51,260
You know.

670
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,670
And so they were looking through these sites trying

671
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,290
to find the fine print that actually covers this

672
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,569
and in some of them it just flat out

673
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,069
wasn't possible unless you went like 23 clicks deep,

674
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:00,810
you know, and, and what,

675
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,250
what offends me more about that is not that they're ripping off people.

676
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,250
I mean, that is offensive

677
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,010
but that the credit card companies are letting them get away with this.

678
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,050
That's interesting. I, I wonder if you actually,

679
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:12,589
like,

680
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,020
called your credit card company and put up a fight if they wouldn't cave quickly

681
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:16,270
and

682
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,459
the argument from the supplier would be, is that, yeah, you know,

683
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:21,530
they signed up for this and we ship them the product

684
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,739
right there was,

685
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,540
you can't do a chargeback dispute easily in that case.

686
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,420
I mean, if they don't send you something or,

687
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,439
or flat out like you know,

688
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:32,920
it's just straight up.

689
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,209
I've gotten chargebacks put in place for less.

690
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:42,000
-- So I wonder,
-- well, I'm guessing these guys have also figured out how to shen

691
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,880
the system,

692
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,750
by definition, they figured it out.

693
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,180
Otherwise people would be calling the credit

694
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,790
card companies and reversing the charges,

695
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,150
like,

696
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,270
pretty quick.

697
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,979
Um, part of it, as I know is that the company is like, oh, you know,

698
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,130
you can totally reverse the charge. That's totally legit.

699
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,650
We need you to send back the product,

700
00:27:59,479 --> 00:27:59,709
right?

701
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,729
And of course, sending back the product costs like, you know,

702
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:03,030
some obscene amount of money

703
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,270
because it's going to Zimbabwe.

704
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,239
-- Yeah, or
-- whatever, you know, it's got to be registered and blah, blah, blah, blah,

705
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,569
blah.

706
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:10,709
You know, this is,

707
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:13,930
this is honestly the reason why I won't sell anything on ebay because

708
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,920
it's just such a hassle.

709
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,390
Like if the person I send it to decides to rip me off as a seller, like,

710
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,319
how do I prove that I sent this thing to them

711
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,170
-- registered
-- man.

712
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,400
I've read tons of horror stories about dealing with like,

713
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,800
like essentially malicious buyers on

714
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,280
ebay

715
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,140
and they generally side with the buyer in almost every instance.

716
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:42,020
And so, I mean, yeah, like selling things on ebay is a terrible idea, in my opinion.

717
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,709
I mean, that's another story,

718
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:46,619
although I also know people who are very successful doing this.

719
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,900
So my suspicion is

720
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,140
if you know what you're doing,

721
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,699
you can probably protect yourself but if you're like us,

722
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,099
yeah, you have no chance. Well, I guess it's kind of like security. Right?

723
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,500
Like, if you're an expert, you're fine.

724
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:03,780
If you're a seller of a lot of stuff and you have like a 1% failure rate. Cool.

725
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,310
You can probably eat that loss. Right.

726
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,199
But if you're like us and you sell one thing every couple of months,

727
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,719
if it fails, it becomes a huge pain in the butt.

728
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,030
You know, that's, that's kind of how identity theft is.

729
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,729
You know, because like, out of a million people, identity theft, me, whatever.

730
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,790
But for that one lady who's had her identity stolen, what, 15 times now, since,

731
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,479
since the Equifax breach,

732
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:24,949
you know, her life sucks.

733
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,010
That's true.

734
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,250
You know, and I mean,

735
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,910
I know it's going to be very hard for her to

736
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,489
prove some loss and get some money out of them,

737
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:32,800
but

738
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,790
I'm just thinking maybe we should come up with like, ok, you know, here for,

739
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,310
let's say,

740
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,459
maybe minimum wage, right?

741
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:45,130
For every, you know, you keep a log of the hours you spend dealing with this, uh,

742
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,270
with the, uh, the identity theft issue and we at least pay,

743
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,760
make the person breached your information, pay you minimum wage.

744
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't know, super lucrative business and scamming those people.

745
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,119
Well, you know, something because, I mean, you know,

746
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,739
what incentive does Equifax have?

747
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,819
The last time this happened,

748
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:10,660
they changed their name to Equifax and kind of got rid of their bad history,

749
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,989
like, straight up.

750
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I mean, it's farcical because you and I both know nothing will change.

751
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:19,380
Probably all of our listeners are like, Equifax, grumble, grumble grumble. But

752
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,199
I think in their hearts they know nothing will change.

753
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:23,219
No, nothing

754
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:24,079
out of

755
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:24,930
Equifax.

756
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,859
The best we can do is freeze our credit report

757
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,479
and then unfreeze it and freeze it and unfreeze it and freeze it

758
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:31,660
is,

759
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,619
that's probably the best thing without question.

760
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,170
It's,

761
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:36,880
well, I haven't looked at the

762
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,500
Equifax stock in a while,

763
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,780
but my suspicion is it's probably going to recover fairly soon if it hasn't already,

764
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,949
which is generally, you know, I'll never forget that. It was

765
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:48,810
right.

766
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,489
So

767
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,489
I remember

768
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,050
it was one of the Yahoo breaches,

769
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,569
um, some years back

770
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,689
and I was, I was talking to a friend

771
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,810
and he was, he was saying, oh, you know, it was one of the,

772
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,900
there was the big Yahoo breach story came out, the stock kind of went down and then a

773
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:10,280
couple of months later there was like, oh, yeah, we increased the number again,

774
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:10,410
right?

775
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,969
Because they increased it like 10 times

776
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,849
and they increase the number again.

777
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,040
I was talking to someone and they're saying, oh man, did, like, did you hear the news?

778
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,839
Like, like Yahoo? They're totally screwed. And I looked at him and I said,

779
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,680
what do you think their stock is doing right now? He's like, oh, it's tanking.

780
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,900
I said it's like it's up two points, you know.

781
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:25,859
Nobody care.

782
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:26,209
Sorry,

783
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,369
I lied. Uh, the

784
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,479
Equifax stock was hovering around

785
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,890
115, 120 back in January 2017.

786
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,239
Uh, then it was

787
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,030
going generally up and it hit, uh, about 100 and 45 100 and 40 over the summer.

788
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:43,619
And then, yeah,

789
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,150
the breach happened and it went as low as 93 and then now it's back up to about 110.

790
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,989
So essentially, if you look at it on a one year basis,

791
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,160
it had a bit of a bull run up over the year and then, you know, kind of tanked a bunch,

792
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,780
but it's essentially maybe 5 10% lower than it was at the beginning of the year.

793
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,119
Um,

794
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,040
you know, I should start with fund that buys companies when they get hacked

795
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,060
and then sells in six months.

796
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:11,819
I

797
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,849
recover it.

798
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,959
And then the other thing too is who cares about the stock price?

799
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,930
Like the CEO of Equifax took a, what was it?

800
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:21,250
$18 million golden parachute and left and left.

801
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,819
Yeah, we'll put that in quotes, but it wasn't his fault.

802
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:26,760
I was told it was one guy's fault. You didn't patch

803
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:27,640
his server.

804
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,099
Yeah.

805
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,839
Uh, no, apparently it wasn't that he, it's not that he didn't patch there.

806
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,020
It's like that he didn't

807
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,109
look at the issue and decide whether or not to patch or something

808
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,239
he had to tell someone else to patch it, that's what it was.

809
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:40,290
Right.

810
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,459
Right. Right.

811
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,189
Anyway,

812
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,680
so, yeah, I mean,

813
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,089
yeah, but fundamentally we can't opt out, we're not their product.

814
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,849
We, we can't sue them.

815
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,859
Uh, I am really curious to see where those class action lawsuits go.

816
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:57,670
I assume there's going to be something like $10 off your next identity

817
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,839
theft monitoring service from them

818
00:32:59,939 --> 00:32:59,959
or

819
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,160
something.

820
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,069
Exactly.

821
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:04,500
And, and the lawyers are going to settle for a small fortune.

822
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,650
I mean, and that's how they all work.

823
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,339
It's,

824
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:08,670
yeah, whatever.

825
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:14,030
But, but again, I mean, I think this, like, personifies our problem

826
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:14,979
is

827
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,420
we can't even decide

828
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,750
what the problem is and,

829
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,180
and obviously security pros came up with a list of 100 and 52 things.

830
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:25,660
I mean, it, it is madness.

831
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:26,859
What is going on.

832
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:27,500
Right.

833
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,589
Yeah.

834
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:30,920
Yeah. No, it's,

835
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:35,920
yeah, I'm just looking at all of these and, like, honestly, um,

836
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,060
yeah, I, I don't know what to say or do,

837
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,770
like, you know, and I'm beginning to wonder because my kids are getting to the age,

838
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,959
like, well, how do I get them computing safely and not,

839
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,800
like giving out their name online or, or, you know,

840
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,319
going through my wallet to get a credit card because, hey,

841
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,660
this website says it'll give me a free

842
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,119
whats it if you put in your

843
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,819
credit card.

844
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,079
Ok, seriously, man.

845
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:00,560
The way you talk, it sounds like your Children are like deviant criminals.

846
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,010
The one guy is like, he's really good at shoulder surfing.

847
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,849
So, here's the deal, I guess.

848
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:10,879
And this is something I think about a lot because my kids are

849
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,708
in a similar situation.

850
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,570
And obviously you and I grew up in a time when, like, there just wasn't internet.

851
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,840
-- So we didn't have to
-- wait. I didn't have a computer until I was 16.

852
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,800
I was slightly younger than you. But it doesn't matter.

853
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,560
So, here's, here's the point though

854
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,280
is

855
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:28,739
everyone is going to have pictures on the internet,

856
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:31,579
everyone is going to have their names on the internet.

857
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,018
And so

858
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:36,259
I, I think what, what we consider normal

859
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:38,339
is going to change drastically

860
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,217
by the time, you know, let's say in 10 years or 20 years or whatever.

861
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,810
And the question that kind of becomes,

862
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,969
what does that mean?

863
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,100
Right. Are, are we going to have governments protecting the data?

864
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,320
And like Europe is trying to do this and,

865
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,639
well, no, no, no Europe is trying to pass laws to make companies protect the data.

866
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:58,479
Right. Yes.

867
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,080
Right. Right.

868
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:02,320
And it's going to be like the companies, we hope that they're honest.

869
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:03,159
Uh

870
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:03,919
Yes.

871
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:08,080
And, and II, I have no idea how this is going to turn out. My suspicion is

872
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:11,370
the devil's in the details and it's gonna fail miserably.

873
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:14,449
I mean, like a great example is a European cookie thing, right?

874
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,280
Like now when you're in Europe and you visit a web page, it kindly instructs you,

875
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,260
it's collecting your cookie, you're setting cookies for you and it's, like,

876
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,399
stop telling me this.

877
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:25,409
Everyone's doing this. I'm sick of clicking. Ok. Right.

878
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,280
Yeah. Its

879
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,129
me nuts because,

880
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,889
and, and has that made anything better? My assumption is the intent

881
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,199
was to make websites stop using cookies.

882
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,250
And

883
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,429
it almost certainly,

884
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,810
I thought the intent was more the third party cookies because let's face it.

885
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,939
The problem is not usually the cookies with the website you're actually visiting.

886
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:45,889
It's the Facebook, Google

887
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,929
17 other domains with cookies,

888
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,110
-- but they're tracking you around the entire
-- web. It still happens

889
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,689
and

890
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,290
they didn't fix it. And my guess is GDPR will be very similar. And so that kind of

891
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,729
this is where the great question lies, especially around privacy is

892
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:06,669
where do we end up? And, and I don't know the answer.

893
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,219
My guess though is, well,

894
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,300
if we kind of put this in some context is

895
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,280
I bet when things like credit monitoring became a thing,

896
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,800
there were people having very similar discussions about how it was going

897
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,629
to be the end of the world and now there's a company

898
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,239
collecting all the information on all the people and they can know

899
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,540
what's going on and the government's gonna take it and they're gonna,

900
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:23,979
you know,

901
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,469
they're going to sell us to space aliens or, or make something, right?

902
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:27,830
You know what I mean?

903
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,760
There is some, I mean, there, there is some generally creepy stuff going on

904
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:33,760
around

905
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,800
like the one of the biggest things that really frustrates me and it worries me

906
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,139
is for example,

907
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:43,639
your credit score is not just now a thing about whether or not you get a loan,

908
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:45,959
but it also determines the rate that you pay.

909
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,060
And so for people that have bad credit scores,

910
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:53,560
it's getting really hard to get out of that hole because once you're labeled,

911
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:56,489
yeah, you know

912
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,620
what, how do you get out of that hole?

913
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,659
Um and then taking it to its somewhat logical extreme is, you know, China with their,

914
00:37:02,669 --> 00:37:04,489
their social score for people.

915
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,850
You know, and if you kind of do descent online,

916
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,139
you get a lower score and good luck renting an apartment or getting a job.

917
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,050
-- It's like
-- a black mirror episode.

918
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:15,044
-- Yeah.
-- Well, but the reality is we already do. This is North America, right?

919
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:18,935
How many jobs now request your social insurance number and your credit score?

920
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:22,225
And they don't want to hire anybody with terrible credit because, you know, the,

921
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,114
the fear is that, oh, this person's bad with money,

922
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,635
they're going to steal from us or do something stupid or whatever.

923
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:29,175
But again, it boils down to that once you get a bad credit score.

924
00:37:29,185 --> 00:37:30,205
How do you get out of that?

925
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:33,685
Yeah. Actually I don't think I've ever had to do that.

926
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,939
You didn't have to give them your credit score per se.

927
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,159
That is true. They could have looked it up.

928
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,419
No, no, they couldn't have because

929
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,850
the last couple of jobs I've gotten.

930
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,030
No, you can only do a soft check with the social security number though. Right.

931
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,449
-- Which they would have for tax purposes only
-- after I was hired.

932
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,949
So, so, like, in, in, in this particular case, when I,

933
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,820
because obviously I just got hired at Elastic, you know, a couple of months ago

934
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,239
I did not give them any sort of information they

935
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,010
could have used in that way prior to being hired.

936
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,399
Now, granted, they could have pulled my credit after I filled out like my new hire,

937
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:09,000
you know, information and,

938
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,020
but

939
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,350
in all seriousness, I, I'm fairly certain they don't.

940
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,530
-- But, yeah, I guarantee there's places that, well, here's,
-- uh,

941
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,679
according to the surveys I'm seeing here it's, uh, well, in 2012 it was 47%

942
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,560
of employers.

943
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:22,000
Ouch.

944
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,379
Yeah.

945
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,929
Crazy man.

946
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,760
Yeah.

947
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,439
And, uh, oh, also good news. It's growing in Canada.

948
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:34,750
We're lagging a little bit behind you. But, you know, we're, we're doing our best.

949
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:37,659
-- You'll catch up one of these days,
-- right?

950
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,750
For sure.

951
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:43,689
-- Uh,
-- oh, and TD. So this happened with, um,

952
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:44,969
with TD.

953
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,899
So this man spoke to the Huffington Post candidate after

954
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,929
he was given a conditional offer from TD insurance,

955
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:50,090
Milo

956
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:50,780
Monex.

957
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,219
Uh, so that's like T DS.

958
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,169
They, anyways basically bought an insurance company,

959
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:01,199
um, blah, blah, blah, to start a job as an insurance advisor, blah, blah, blah.

960
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:04,889
And then basically they did a credit check on him and rescinded. The offer

961
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,090
and TD is

962
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,560
really unashamedly. Uh, what's the thing

963
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,370
essentially that, uh, you know, they want the best candidate possible? Too bad.

964
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,429
Right. And it's not illegal to do this.

965
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,879
It's not illegal to discriminate based on a credit score. It's not like a protected.

966
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:20,659
Right.

967
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,600
So, yeah,

968
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,520
you know,

969
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,760
and that's what kind of gets me about these things. Like,

970
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:28,840
you know, what happens when somebody actually gets that image

971
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,250
recognition thing going and like, you know,

972
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,090
people who did stupid things on skateboards are being, you know,

973
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,360
discriminated against

974
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,330
because you know what, it's going to cost us law

975
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,520
insurance claims later down the road because there are, you know,

976
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,790
arms and elbows or whatever, all messed up or, you know, whatever, right?

977
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,060
Like

978
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,860
-- we laugh now
-- but

979
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,709
I, I don't know, man, I mean, I, I guess we could.

980
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:50,989
So, so this, this is interesting because

981
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,439
I, I I'm putting my security hat on while I'm thinking about this. And

982
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:59,389
if we look at the problems in the security universe,

983
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,850
which I don't think are necessarily drastically different in many ways,

984
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,850
we have been completely unable to solve these problems.

985
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,780
But you look at something like the insurance

986
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,489
industry or the banking industry and they are,

987
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:13,229
they're quite willing to be just ruthless,

988
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,229
they don't necessarily solve the problem, but they price the market accordingly.

989
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:17,899
It's like

990
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,719
you can,

991
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,389
that's solving the problem though,

992
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:21,939
right?

993
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,090
It's, it's basically, but they're in the position of

994
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,820
um in the classic where we can,

995
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,399
when you have a risk, you can

996
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:34,310
minimize the risk. So you can do things to limit the risk, right?

997
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,639
Get a seatbelt and an airbag in your car, right?

998
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:39,030
These minimize the risk of you getting all smashed up.

999
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,600
You can choose to not accept the risk.

1000
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,179
So for example, you could choose not to get in a car.

1001
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,459
However, the majority of us don't have the ability to make those choices.

1002
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,199
But when you're, for example, selling insurance,

1003
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,520
you can very easily, not sell to somebody

1004
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:54,770
that is

1005
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,560
not service that market. And that's the problem, right? Is,

1006
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,320
is I, you know,

1007
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,360
it's like all those people that are like, oh, you know,

1008
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,600
you can reduce your risk of like online fraud and theft

1009
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,370
and stuff by like not using your credit card online.

1010
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:09,239
I'm like, awesome. So like, how do I buy stuff again or ever take a trip?

1011
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:10,179
Ok.

1012
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,780
I think you're on to something here though. Is you talk about

1013
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,330
kind of insurance pricing people out of the

1014
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,199
market because they don't want to help them.

1015
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:21,159
We don't do that in security or,

1016
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:23,949
-- or in it in general like they
-- are because they're gonna

1017
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:26,270
go do it anyways whether if we say yes or no,

1018
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:28,649
a

1019
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,110
business

1020
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,290
case

1021
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:30,350
to go do the dangerous

1022
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:30,639
thing.

1023
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,439
Ok. So that is yes.

1024
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,159
And that's a topic I think for another day and, and we can talk about it. But

1025
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,060
the point is even ignoring the fact that security and it don't

1026
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,780
necessarily get along or see eye to eye in many instances.

1027
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,969
I think there are,

1028
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,010
it's weird to me that security and it are two different things.

1029
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,290
Yeah. That is weird.

1030
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,360
And actually I just gave a talk about that today and we'll, we'll cover that another,

1031
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,000
another day

1032
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,510
because

1033
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,790
they shouldn't be different.

1034
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,729
But that's another story. But anyway, the point being

1035
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,340
that,

1036
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,409
uh, let's ignore

1037
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,169
security and our, it, let's just say it

1038
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,820
right.

1039
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:07,360
We all have vendors who are

1040
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,370
terrible,

1041
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,750
like unreasonably terrible.

1042
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,159
-- At some point, I have to buy a wifi access point from somebody ignoring
-- that.

1043
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:15,929
Even, right.

1044
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,939
Many of us will stick with crappy vendors

1045
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:24,030
and, and, and we won't walk and say no, this isn't worth it.

1046
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,469
And, and there's a variety of reasons for that, but I think,

1047
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:29,239
I think we struggle and, and this is again,

1048
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,250
like security is part of the overall quality discussion.

1049
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,449
But I think there's certain quality discussions where like

1050
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,550
there are a lot of organizations running incredibly low quality software.

1051
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,949
And in reality,

1052
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:43,800
like if we were looking at it from kind of a capitalistic marketplace perspective,

1053
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,899
we should be walking away from these and saying like your stuff is crap,

1054
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,260
but we, we really don't very often

1055
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:49,860
well.

1056
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,919
But part of the problem is so a great example being Equifax, right,

1057
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:55,689
they ran a whole bunch of software, they didn't update it, they got nailed.

1058
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,010
I mean, they've got to attend some annoying congressional hearings

1059
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,850
and the CEO had to step down and take $18 million with,

1060
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:04,530
ok,

1061
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,330
chances are he probably could have made a lot

1062
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,100
more money if he'd stayed over the next 5,

1063
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,270
1020 years, whatever.

1064
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,719
But

1065
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:10,810
like,

1066
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,810
I'm sorry, but if you say like, Kurt,

1067
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,070
the downside of your failure is $18 million I'm going to be like,

1068
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,129
awesome.

1069
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,969
Like, can I fail tomorrow and be out of here?

1070
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,100
You know. And so that's part of the problem, right? Is

1071
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,040
I, well, data breaches as an example. Has any company ever been

1072
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,959
killed or

1073
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:36,629
severely censured so much so that it

1074
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:38,389
like probably mattered.

1075
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,260
The only one I know of is what's it, Diginotar,

1076
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,699
which was the, the

1077
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,479
C A that was not a data breach. That was ac A that was so grossly incompetent that

1078
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,280
they had to be put down because it was just like,

1079
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,689
you know, if the browsers didn't do that then any like you and I would be CAS.

1080
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:58,199
That's true.

1081
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,020
I have always wanted to be ac A

1082
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:02,360
Yeah. You know,

1083
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,260
um,

1084
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,649
like Target, certainly, I mean, I still shop at Home Depot,

1085
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,350
you know, Target.

1086
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,699
Well, Target failed in Canada but for a whole pile of different reasons,

1087
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:15,399
actually, quite a brutal case study. If you read it, just Google it, it's,

1088
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,159
it's basically everything they could have done wrong.

1089
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,560
-- They gleefully did
-- and, and the weather helped too.

1090
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:22,090
Right?

1091
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:22,449
A

1092
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,010
little bit, but mostly it was things like not, you know,

1093
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,070
having enough shelf space or logistics or

1094
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,840
people or transport

1095
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,959
or a plan.

1096
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,479
Yeah, exactly.

1097
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,850
Oh, my favorite is the case,

1098
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,659
the case studies of why Walmart failed in Germany. Now, there's a good one.

1099
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:41,290
-- I can only imagine what that looks
-- like.

1100
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:44,780
-- They also tried to make the Germans sing in the morning.
-- I

1101
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,860
would love to see that

1102
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:48,389
because

1103
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,949
it did not go over well anyway.

1104
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:54,770
But, uh, yeah, so, I mean, that's the biggest thing I'm seeing with security is like,

1105
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,530
we can't,

1106
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,080
like, I can't walk away from products, especially when I've inherit, you know,

1107
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,179
companies that inherit this technical debt.

1108
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:06,719
You can't like a great example, like every I airline it system ever,

1109
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,399
right. Like Westjet just had a meltdown over the weekend and

1110
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,199
had a whole pile of delays on Saturday because their, it system cratered out. Right.

1111
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:18,320
You can't just go buy a new airline it system.

1112
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,129
Uh, no,

1113
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,080
no, you can't. And, and in many cases, yeah, you're, you're, you're trapped.

1114
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:24,770
It is.

1115
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:25,979
I don't know.

1116
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:27,409
I don't,

1117
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,429
maybe we just need 100 and 53 items on our list now. Right.

1118
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,360
Yeah,

1119
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,409
I, I honestly think part of it is

1120
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:38,379
where possible outsourcing to trust your providers.

1121
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:41,639
And, I mean, people give the cloud so much grief about this, like, oh,

1122
00:45:41,649 --> 00:45:42,610
you're outsourcing, you know,

1123
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,989
core competencies to some third party who's basically going, like, screw you over.

1124
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:47,479
Yeah. Yeah.

1125
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:48,770
That might happen.

1126
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,959
And on the flip side though, you know.

1127
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,679
Yeah, Microsoft Amazon and Google will

1128
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:56,520
screw up.

1129
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,360
Not Mike, but they will screw up at some point, you know, like office 364 being the,

1130
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,679
the good one, you know, where they,

1131
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,520
the, they didn't take, uh, like, leap years into account for their certificate,

1132
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,669
renewal practices.

1133
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,409
Um, but

1134
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:11,129
are they gonna screw up

1135
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,370
more often and more terribly than me? Yeah. Probably not.

1136
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:16,949
Right. Right.

1137
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:21,090
Well, not only that, this is, I just had the discussion a little while ago. In fact is

1138
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,250
if you look at like the cloud

1139
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:26,229
and, and I'm going to pick on elastic in

1140
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:28,570
this case because we have something called elastic cloud.

1141
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,820
And the idea is right.

1142
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:31,820
Very clever.

1143
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:33,350
It's,

1144
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,439
it's essentially a managed elastic search instance that kind of we take care of.

1145
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,439
And if you run this stuff yourself, you have to take care of the system,

1146
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,479
you have to keep the system updated, you have to keep elastic search updated.

1147
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:48,320
You have to keep, like it can figure correctly. There's like a million, right?

1148
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,439
Backups. There's a million things you have to worry about

1149
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,120
or

1150
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:57,040
you can just pay elastic some money and elastic does all of that stuff for you,

1151
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,800
but not just not just that they do it.

1152
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,689
We also have the people who built it.

1153
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:05,489
So like we have a level of expertise that

1154
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,870
you just cannot have ever under any circumstance,

1155
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,750
ignoring economics. Kurt, like the fact is

1156
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:19,169
nobody working for anyone who isn't elastic is building elastic, right?

1157
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:20,770
Like that's just the reality of it.

1158
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:22,649
And so you just by definition,

1159
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,370
you will never have the core developers on your team,

1160
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:28,399
meaning you will never have that level of talent,

1161
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,479
right? And, and this is true of nearly every cloud provider

1162
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,389
where if you're working with this cloud

1163
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:35,560
provider and they're providing you a service,

1164
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,399
they,

1165
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:38,719
they almost certainly by definition have like the

1166
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:41,280
best of the best for that particular service

1167
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,280
right there, right? Like literally right there waiting to help.

1168
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,830
Well, I mean, that's the beauty of the whole open

1169
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:47,540
source model, right?

1170
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,010
Is we have these open like Kubernetes is a great thing,

1171
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,939
a great example of this because it just in the last like two weeks,

1172
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,770
it's basically come out as the winner, right?

1173
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,040
Even Docker movies with up

1174
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,330
on the

1175
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:56,840
street,

1176
00:47:57,469 --> 00:48:01,409
you know, like I saw Swarm and I'm like, oh, that's pretty sweet. Like, you know,

1177
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,350
a year or two ago, it was pretty cool,

1178
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,169
but

1179
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,050
the only people working on Docker Swarm were Docker,

1180
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:08,209
right?

1181
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:08,959
And

1182
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,820
that's not even the bad part.

1183
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,679
The really bad part is when somebody comes up with a really cool feature.

1184
00:48:15,939 --> 00:48:19,479
And in a traditional open source project, it's very much a meritocracy,

1185
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:20,030
right?

1186
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,989
Even though you have large companies involved like Kubernetes is a great example,

1187
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,030
right?

1188
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,919
You got Red Hat, you got Microsoft, you got

1189
00:48:25,179 --> 00:48:26,719
Google, you know, some

1190
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:27,439
big players.

1191
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:28,719
Yeah.

1192
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:31,060
So even though there are these huge companies involved,

1193
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,840
they kind of balance each other out.

1194
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,750
Right. So, you know, for example, if Microsoft had some crazy agenda,

1195
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:41,570
the others would be, you know, call them on their BS and conversely, you know,

1196
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,370
Microsoft isn't,

1197
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:46,850
or Red Hat isn't big enough to block any one person with a really clearly good idea.

1198
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:49,360
And that's the biggest thing I find with these open source things, right?

1199
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,010
Is that somebody with a clearly good idea, especially if they have working code,

1200
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,489
right? OK. We're gonna go do that

1201
00:48:55,689 --> 00:48:59,050
right. We're going to merge or commit and boom, cut a release, you know,

1202
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:00,270
and

1203
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:04,530
yeah, outside the open source world, you can't do that or they won't do it. And

1204
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:08,570
yeah, we have these clear cloud winners where it's just, yeah, like

1205
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:09,050
Kubernetes.

1206
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,409
Yeah, I'm sorry, it won,

1207
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,290
you know, things like elastic search, right? Like uh

1208
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:14,149
I

1209
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,889
honestly, when most of these open source things,

1210
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:18,770
I can't even be bothered to look for

1211
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,399
commercial alternatives now because the open source thing is

1212
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,969
like more than

1213
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:24,639
OK enough or good enough.

1214
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,290
It's literally not even worth the time,

1215
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,870
but on the off chance there's some like

1216
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:32,219
specialized company somewhere that made something awesome.

1217
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,260
It did and it never happens.

1218
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,399
No, I agree.

1219
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:38,739
I agree, man.

1220
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:41,389
So in, I guess in summary, uh

1221
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,580
everything's broken still,

1222
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,860
I think we're beginning to learn why it's broken.

1223
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:48,820
I

1224
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,659
maybe, you know, we're kind of, I would say we're at the 19 forties

1225
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:54,750
stage of

1226
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,750
uh automotive stuff right now, we're,

1227
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,989
we're starting to industrialize and we're starting to,

1228
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,580
to sort of do

1229
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:03,310
mass production.

1230
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,959
So instead of handcrafting everything,

1231
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,510
we're actually building assembly lines that build the widgets,

1232
00:50:08,649 --> 00:50:10,959
I, I think that's fair. I think, I

1233
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,040
-- think we can
-- say that and once we do that,

1234
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,669
then you can actually apply safety to it because

1235
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,139
the problem is right now with handcrafted stuff,

1236
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,439
you apply safety to it.

1237
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,469
And that one handcrafted thing is safe,

1238
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:23,860
but all the other handcrafted things are a flaming pile of

1239
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,479
garbage.

1240
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:26,429
And

1241
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,020
so

1242
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:29,889
the armed security paper right arm came

1243
00:50:29,899 --> 00:50:31,370
up with a security paper basically pointing out

1244
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:34,419
that they're going to do a bias and part of an Os or a Full Os

1245
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,830
wasn't 100% clear

1246
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,840
because basically if they don't,

1247
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,310
all their vendors will

1248
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:42,080
and you'll have like 300 flaming piles of garbage.

1249
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:43,959
Now, we just have one flaming pile of

1250
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:44,179
garbage

1251
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,699
which will get fixed

1252
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,919
now, whether or not those vendors allow updates.

1253
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,280
But hey, we're still

1254
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:53,040
ahead of where we were before. You know, at least there's a chance now.

1255
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:54,010
Yes.

1256
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,389
And I, I know,

1257
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:55,830
you know,

1258
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,850
it's like Android versus like all can you imagine if Verizon tried to write a phone SS

1259
00:51:01,919 --> 00:51:02,939
II,

1260
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,439
I bet they did.

1261
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,739
And it was so bad. It never made it out the door.

1262
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1263
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:11,500
Yep. Anyway.

1264
00:51:11,729 --> 00:51:15,830
-- All right, man, I I think we should call it. Any, any parting
-- advice, drink water.

1265
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:16,750
It's good for you.

1266
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:17,790
Right, man.

1267
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,479
That'll do. Thank you. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everybody for listening.
