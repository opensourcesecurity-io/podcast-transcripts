Hello and welcome to the open source security

1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,050
podcast episode 35 and three quarters with myself,

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,239
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,090
You know, I figured you'd pick on me for that.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,430
So the reason it's 35 and three quarters is we

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,170
tried to record this a couple of days ago and

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,350
due to,

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:24,610
ok, fine.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,450
So I screwed up and I, I messed up the recording and we have to rerecord this show,

9
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,290
which I think is actually a gift because there

10
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:35,209
have been a handful of new bits of information

11
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:39,220
about the sha one attack and the cloud bleed or whatever is,

12
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,279
are we officially calling it?

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,819
Well, that's what everybody else

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:42,830
clouded.

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,599
You know, I guess, ironically, we don't have AC B ID for this, do we? We have to say

16
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:54,020
-- we can't because CV doesn't cover services yet.
-- Right. So, wow, interesting.

17
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:54,659
Without clouded,

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,430
we'd have to call it that cloud flare issue, which could actually mean last

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,900
week,

20
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,500
last week, which in,

21
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,809
in a couple of weeks won't be last week and it will also potentially

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,510
not be the cloud flare issue anymore because there could certainly be another one

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,449
so interesting.

24
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:11,129
Yeah.

25
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:11,370
Well,

26
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,580
considering it was just literally equals equals versus what was it equals more than

27
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,730
it was? Well, I mean,

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,779
it wasn't,

29
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,139
it was

30
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:21,720
a,

31
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,760
well, they were using, um, like, what was it? It was generated code.

32
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,160
Well,

33
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,220
let's back it up a bit maybe and explain to people

34
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,970
because here's the point we've already talked about this one.

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,550
So, in our minds it's all fresh and in your minds you're like,

36
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,099
what the hell are these people talking about?

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,330
Crazy people.

38
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,900
Although if you haven't read the news in the last week and this is new to you.

39
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,629
Um, wow, you might want to go change some passwords. Uh Yeah.

40
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:42,610
Yeah,

41
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,750
you might,

42
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,730
maybe we don't know which ones. So

43
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,519
good luck changing them all.

44
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:53,139
You know, just a tangent and I don't want to do a commercial plug, but this,

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,279
this one password manager, I'm looking at, uh, for a variety of sites and stuff.

46
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,040
It understands.

47
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,949
You can actually just hit a button in the password app saying

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,470
-- change my password
-- and it will do it magically for you.

49
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,879
That is amazing. Can I ask which one that is? Because

50
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,008
last pass does that? I will.

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,610
That might sell me on this because,

52
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,050
well, I don't, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I,

53
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,889
I use something called PW safe on

54
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,690
and

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,369
it's very manual. And so the passwords I have to change.

56
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,220
I'm dreading because it's going to literally take me hours of my

57
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,369
life to go through a bunch of sites and change them.

58
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,509
So last passing, I,

59
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:31,559
it might, I don't know, the, the cost of changing might outweigh

60
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,600
the cost of changing all my passwords.

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,360
If it has a magic button.

62
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,729
I

63
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,490
just, to me there's, you know, there's the passwords I really care about.

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,860
Like, say my icloud password and my Google password.

65
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,740
Uh, and funnily enough.

66
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,320
I would then put my banking in the second tier of passwords because, I mean,

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,350
it's important, it's my money but it's not as important as,

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,020
like my entire online identity and all my files.

69
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,440
Well, right. And not only that the bank, there are certain legal obligations.

70
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,080
Like, if someone steals all my money, they have to give it back to me

71
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,220
if someone steals my Twitter account, like it's gone.

72
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,759
Yeah,

73
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,570
there's a well understood legal framework

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,529
for dealing with shenanigans around that.

75
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,149
Whereas with icloud it's, I don't even want to think about that. So,

76
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:14,389
and, um, you know, and then there's like the third tier stuff which is like, you know,

77
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:17,820
um, just all those websites that made me make an account

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,759
-- and
-- all

79
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,429
those are the dangerous ones because, you know, their security is terrible

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,410
and most people will just use the same

81
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,669
-- password for those they
-- use

82
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:26,830
what

83
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:27,899
they have. Right. I mean,

84
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,110
I have over 1000 passwords at this point.

85
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:33,139
I don't, I think last time I looked, I have 300

86
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,759
I bet I could get rid of 20 or 30 of those

87
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,380
because they're just like old crap accounts I never use anymore.

88
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,929
But I'm too lazy to prune my password database.

89
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,179
Well, speaking of passwords, uh, sha one had a bit of a rough week. Last week.

90
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,539
-- It
-- did sha one. Well, ok.

91
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,779
So it, it didn't, I don't, how do we want to see this? This is,

92
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,880
-- we've known
-- Shaman

93
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,449
Falls downstairs.

94
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:59,990
That might be the most accurate headline for the sha one thing ever.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,020
So, ok, let, let's back it up, I guess. Is

96
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,050
there is an attack called Shattered

97
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,130
that

98
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,250
the, the website leads off with. We have broken Sha One in practice.

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,009
And the importance of that is we've known Sha One

100
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,170
has certain weaknesses for

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,970
like, almost, I think 10 years now. I mean, this is not new.

102
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,730
We knew someday someone was going to break Sha

103
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:25,089
one and I won't say it's totally broken yet,

104
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,640
but like,

105
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,720
it's falling down the stairs right now,

106
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,850
you know, that's

107
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,910
that where we're standing at the bottom and, and we're, you know, it's that

108
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:38,279
bizarrely horrific slow motion, you know, trip down the stairs, you've fallen.

109
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,309
And that's what sha one is doing right now where

110
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:46,709
it's, I wouldn't say these attacks are in the realm of practical for,

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,869
we'll say non state actors, but it is

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,390
unquestionably

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,190
stop using Sha One. Right.

114
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,170
Well, we'll get to that later.

115
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:59,470
But I, I do think there are a couple of potential real world attacks where

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,540
it, it would

117
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:04,500
within, you know, generally speaking, it actually wouldn't be a,

118
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,609
-- probably a super successful attack, but it would be one hell of a huge mess
-- maybe.

119
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,500
I mean, so actually let's start

120
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,989
even farther back than that is. So

121
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,540
there are

122
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,769
what we talked about kind of three types of attacks, three types of collisions, ok.

123
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:19,290
And

124
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:20,820
-- the first type
-- is

125
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,299
stages of collision attacks

126
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:23,140
from

127
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,279
bad to worse to like, oh dear, this is terrible.

128
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:26,690
And,

129
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,670
and what's happened here is essentially researchers

130
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,640
with a massive amount of compute resources

131
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,089
generated two PDF S

132
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,119
that have the same sha

133
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,709
check

134
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:39,570
and they generate

135
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:40,029
or sea

136
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,420
one. Sorry. Yes,

137
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:43,579
they generated them at the same time.

138
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,470
And the importance of that is

139
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,230
when you're the way this attack, the current known attack works is

140
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,720
you basically can, can start figuring out

141
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,989
the internal state of the sha

142
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,399
hatching algorithm. And by

143
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,850
basically generating two files at the same time, it makes it easier.

144
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,000
And when I say easier,

145
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,299
I'm talking about

146
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,760
these guys use the amount of compute power and energy for that matter

147
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,760
that it basically takes to generate a Bitcoin block right now.

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,250
And so that's a crazy amount of power to say the least

149
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,070
six. It was over 6000 years of GP U time and something like about.

150
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,660
Well, if you bought it on the spot market,

151
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,500
it would be just over $100,000 us at current Amazon rates.

152
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
And that's so, it's, it's, that's a real world cost on this attack.

153
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,480
You're looking at 100 grand for now.

154
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,779
And obviously, and not only that,

155
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,320
this isn't a super useful attack because generating two files at the same time,

156
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,799
obviously isn't super useful. The attack that people are actually going to want

157
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,989
is when you have one file that has a certain checksum

158
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,869
and you can generate a separate file with the same checksum,

159
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,760
right? And that's dangerous.

160
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,350
Yeah,

161
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,040
that's where you get things like I signed a

162
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,750
contract and now that contract says something different,

163
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,570
right? Or in the context of things like certificates, right?

164
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,559
I mean, and now on that note though,

165
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,170
all of the browsers at this point should be banning sha one

166
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,440
uh well, sort of, they're in the process of banning Shaw.

167
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,119
And I mean, that's, that's what I, that's what I love about this attack, right?

168
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,230
Is like, like literally literally Microsoft's blog from last week was like,

169
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,220
yeah, sha one is like falling down the stairs. This is bad.

170
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,950
Um But we've already like us with our long term plans, you know, we're, we're,

171
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,380
we started phasing Sha one out in the end of January 2017,

172
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,100
you know,

173
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:36,630
so it's um they're slowly phasing shaw one out for certificates and right now it's um

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,359
uh you can't have it for uh what is it? You cannot have it for root certificates.

175
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,579
But you can have it for intermediate certificates

176
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,790
or manually installed root certificates on a system. Right.

177
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:51,040
Because there's still a lot of technologies and people like interception

178
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,559
proxies and stuff like that that you sha one certificates.

179
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,459
Um, but even, and that stuff too has been,

180
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,390
it's been planned to phase that out over the next like two or

181
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,839
three years and it looks like that will be sped up now,

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,320
whatever, you know, a bunch of these security products,

183
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,260
we're going to put the word security in air quotes here

184
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,769
that a bunch of these security products are probably still using MD five

185
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,059
in, in terms of their, their certificate signing for these middle,

186
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,160
in the middle things they do.

187
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,500
It's

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,769
I, I expect those to lag horribly behind and, and this is actually a place where

189
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,220
if we had an easy way to assign CV I DS for things like this,

190
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,700
I could maybe poke them in the eye a little bit and, and get things moving faster.

191
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,169
Well, that's something I've actually been working on is,

192
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,390
is so with classic security vulnerabilities, like say something resulting in,

193
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,280
you know, code execution clearly, that's a vulnerability with crypto.

194
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,599
It's a little harder because the, the bar keeps moving, you know, for example,

195
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,369
this attack today in real world terms costs about $100,000 in compute time,

196
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,090
10 years from now. It'll,

197
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,090
I don't know, take what, half an hour on your cell phone, right? I mean,

198
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,099
you know, so at some point it moves from being like, yeah, this is a problem to like,

199
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:56,690
no, this is a real problem too.

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,400
This is an actual security vulnerability because it's so easy to break.

201
00:08:59,409 --> 00:08:59,929
Kind of like um

202
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,880
uh WP a encryption on wireless.

203
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,400
Sorry.

204
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:07,460
Wep, the even older one web,

205
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:08,039
you know,

206
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:12,599
we got to the point where you could break it literally in real time on a laptop.

207
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:17,599
So OK, clearly, if anybody, you know, is using web, that's just you can't, it,

208
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:22,710
it provides no protection anymore, you know, it's like des 5650 my laptop

209
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:23,679
will do that

210
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,719
in like minutes, single digit minutes,

211
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,150
you know.

212
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,380
Um

213
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,830
And so, yeah, at what point do these sort of, especially with hashing,

214
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,380
it's a little bit more subtle because the attacks aren't as like direct,

215
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:40,109
you know, even if I can create a hash collision.

216
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,900
Well, I still have to kind of do something with that,

217
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,409
you know, it's not like that directly gets me code execution

218
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,940
except in the case of things like say, you know, update systems,

219
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,289
right? But, you know,

220
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:52,549
anyways.

221
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,460
But um so I've been pushing for that for a

222
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,570
while for us to actually start defining in cryptographic terms,

223
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,760
both for hashing

224
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:00,700
and encryption functions.

225
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,429
Sort of, where's that line like today? OK.

226
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,890
Des, clearly not acceptable MD five, not acceptable generally

227
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,880
sha one where does that fall now?

228
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,330
Is it not acceptable anymore or do we start moving because it's the use cases too,

229
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,260
like root certificates.

230
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,989
Sha One would clearly be a problem

231
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,710
whereas, like using sha one in say, well,

232
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,960
great real world example being git git still uses sha One

233
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,469
uses it in a way that's

234
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,549
-- not as easily attacked.
-- Well,

235
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,549
-- that's actually kind of complicated.
-- It's,

236
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:28,849
yeah,

237
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:33,190
-- it's not a good answer. As Doom
-- does root certificates using Sha one.

238
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,630
Right.

239
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,270
It is not.

240
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,780
And in many cases they're using it as an integrity check.

241
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:41,330
Not a security check, except for the places they're using it as a security check.

242
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,210
I was gonna say, yeah.

243
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,909
And so, and that's the problem is, you know, defining these, where these bars is,

244
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,770
is a, is a lot harder with encryption and, you know, hashing and, you know,

245
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,090
it's something I want to get because, yeah, we do need at some point, like,

246
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,820
I don't want to buy stuff or have companies buying stuff that,

247
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,710
like uses this sha one or MD five or whatever in a vulnerable manner.

248
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:01,989
And, and

249
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,150
I,

250
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,590
so here's the way I always look at this is even if they're

251
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,820
not using it in what we would call a vulnerable manner today,

252
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,750
they should still stop because someday someone's gonna get a good idea

253
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,780
and they're gonna be like, oh, look, it already does sha one. I'll just use that

254
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,299
and then all of a sudden now you have a problem.

255
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,739
Yeah. And I would be even more concerned.

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,190
My biggest concern would be, is like,

257
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,570
what's their software update process look like?

258
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:27,780
Right.

259
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:32,260
Like how, because if they're using sha one, they're clearly not staying up to date

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,179
with stuff

261
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,479
or if they're using MD five, you know,

262
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,580
updates were signed with their MD five.

263
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,090
so I almost for fun.

264
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,640
Bought a, uh, they had, um, at Staples, they had, um, like no name, a

265
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,289
bunch of no name, products like pens and pencils and, you know,

266
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,130
and $20 wireless routers.

267
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:49,679
Oh,

268
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,799
man,

269
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,500
-- I almost
-- bought

270
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,820
one

271
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,380
but my girlfriend was like, no, you don't need that.

272
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,729
And I'm like, I know I don't need it, but I want to play with it and she's like, no,

273
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,229
put it, put it back.

274
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,679
You know, it's the same discussion I had with my kids and candy.

275
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,200
It's like I want this, it's not good for you.

276
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,739
It's, you, you will regret this purchase.

277
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:09,640
I know.

278
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,820
You know, I know this is a terrible thing but,

279
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,179
and,

280
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,260
and I literally wanted to buy it just to see what the update software stuff was like.

281
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:16,659
Oh,

282
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,130
yeah. You know,

283
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,530
you know, it's terrible.

284
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,059
I couldn't, you know, here's the best part.

285
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,880
I couldn't even find the model number online.

286
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,700
I have no doubt.

287
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,489
-- I have no doubt. It's, I want, oh man, part of me wants this now just to like
-- start

288
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:29,809
key

289
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,309
Kee Wi

290
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,700
fi.com is the maker and it was like the, what was it? Wr 1014 or something like that.

291
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,739
It's at staples and, and yeah, it's a $20 router but,

292
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:43,640
you know, going back to the sort of CV E for crypto stuff. I, at

293
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,630
this point,

294
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,039
I kind of want like health food labels, you know,

295
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,729
where it gives you like the calorie count and the ingredient list.

296
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,609
And I would love to see like

297
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,330
an ingredient list for software saying like,

298
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,599
you know, this product uses Linux kernel version X last updated,

299
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,890
you know, at this date,

300
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:01,840
you know,

301
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,619
because maybe it's an old version that they back port

302
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,719
fixes to or maybe it's just an old version,

303
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:06,119
right?

304
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,969
Those are two very different things,

305
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,789
you know,

306
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,440
um, what's, you know, what ciphers and, you know, does it support WP A two,

307
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,700
does it support, you know, TLS version 1.3?

308
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,559
I guarantee you almost no products on the

309
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,719
market right now. Support TLS version 1.3

310
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:23,969
-- in the
-- hardware space

311
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,719
in their defense. It's still not out of the standards committee.

312
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,239
But yes, I understand what you're saying.

313
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,659
Well, it's, it's darn close. I mean,

314
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,789
-- supports,
-- it

315
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,450
is special.

316
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:35,750
-- Well, except for
-- that

317
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,630
because they want to get it adopted and moving

318
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,479
and this is the chicken and egg problem.

319
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:39,630
Yeah.

320
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
Well, and from their perspective,

321
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:44,849
you figure TLS 13 is going to save them buckets of transfer

322
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,429
data more to the point it's going to save people time.

323
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:48,770
Yeah, that's true.

324
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,690
You know, that, those,

325
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,890
those when you think about how many round trips are made for TLS,

326
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,049
every day on the planet.

327
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,010
That's going to be an absurdly huge number.

328
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,880
It probably is. And that, that's actually one of the, we, we, we'll get to that.

329
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:01,599
Yeah.

330
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,200
Well, and the other thing too is you can, you can provide TLS version 1.3

331
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,369
and clients that don't support it. That's cool. Right.

332
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,890
-- They just talk TLS 1.1 or 1.0 or whatever, stop using
-- TLS one point. Oh,

333
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,559
they, they should be talking about 12 or whatever.

334
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,159
And, well, you know,

335
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:23,530
that's actually related to this conversation about sha one is that I think we

336
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,169
need to get better about just drawing a line in the sand and saying

337
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,489
that's enough.

338
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,849
This doesn't, it's not supported, it doesn't work.

339
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:32,929
And the browser makers are basically going to do this

340
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:33,690
where

341
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,210
they're just gonna say, screw it. No way.

342
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,640
Instead of sort of supporting something for like 20

343
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,690
plus years and you get yourself into trouble.

344
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,590
Yeah.

345
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,929
No, we need to start killing these things otherwise they just linger on for

346
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:47,219
and they're

347
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,969
dangerous, right. How many attacks are we starting to see because of this stuff?

348
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,489
Yeah,

349
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,789
I think in general and, and this is one of the things where I think CV can help a lot is

350
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,210
if we assign CV S to these issues.

351
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:02,710
And, you know, like, for example, product uses MD five blah, blah, blah, blah blah,

352
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,109
then most organizations, if a product has a CV E,

353
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:10,039
they have to deal with it in some way and, and that way can be, you know, replacing it,

354
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:10,890
updating it, whatever.

355
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,940
But it can also be, we accept the risk and we accept that we cannot fix this but,

356
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,229
you know, due to business needs or whatever,

357
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,270
you know, at this time,

358
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,190
we don't have the money to replace it and we'll just eat the risk.

359
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,909
But at least then they are aware of

360
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,469
the risk and they're making a somewhat informed decision

361
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,969
rather than just, oh, we have a bunch of stuff sitting in a closet doing stuff.

362
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:29,849
I'm sure it's fine.

363
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,570
No, absolutely. That's absolutely correct.

364
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,530
And that's what II I like.

365
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,330
It kind of goes back again to this, you know, product labeling of like,

366
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,450
what is in this product?

367
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,409
How updated is it, you know, does this,

368
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,450
does this manufacturer still even exist or are they still in business?

369
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,289
No? Seriously. Like,

370
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,119
you know, some of these Chinese makers,

371
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,130
it's not that they go out of business but they, like, kill off a product line.

372
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,900
Oh, right. Well, everyone kills off product lines.

373
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,849
You can't support a product forever. That's just the reality of it.

374
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,690
Yeah, exactly. So,

375
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,929
you know, again, I want to make, you know, this is, I hate to say it.

376
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,520
This is one of, this is one of the core reasons I buy

377
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,299
Apple phones because I know for a fact, based on historical precedent,

378
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:13,679
I will get 3 to 4 years of support from Apple on software updates.

379
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:14,409
That

380
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,219
is,

381
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,880
is,

382
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,270
you know, with an Android phone, I'm up, I'm at the mercy of a random carrier.

383
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,039
Typically, unless I get an unlocked phone, which

384
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,229
in Canada is very difficult to get a hold of.

385
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,380
I run a Nexus phone from Google and I would,

386
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,409
I would not buy anything else. I would buy an iphone if I didn't have a Nexus.

387
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,239
And due to a variety of reasons, I sort of wish I had an iphone today but that's,

388
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,890
it's

389
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:37,330
us,

390
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,940
whatever man. It's

391
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,130
you, you and your cult.

392
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:41,869
Yeah.

393
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:42,820
Yeah, just like

394
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,349
Costco,

395
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,289
you know, actually I went to Costco the other day just to go in to look around.

396
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,849
It was

397
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,849
less impressive than you make it out to be, but very nice.

398
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,049
Did you try the hot dog?

399
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,409
I did not have a hot dog.

400
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:54,359
Should have a hot

401
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,739
dog

402
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,169
anyway.

403
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,320
Moving on.

404
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:57,940
So actually I,

405
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,539
I have one other really interesting thing about the Shah attack

406
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,310
that I found is so uh the Z cash guys,

407
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,540
which is Z cash is a digital currency,

408
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,339
which is supposed to be more exciting and interesting than Bitcoin.

409
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,300
But they kind of document

410
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:17,540
a whole bunch of things around attacks on secure hash functions. And one of the

411
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,500
results if you read this

412
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,699
is that

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,979
the current hashes that are being developed today are being designed

414
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:29,650
in a way to specifically be resistant to collision attacks.

415
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,739
And so it is conceivable at some point in the future,

416
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:38,040
the concept of basically like attacking a hash function in a manner looking

417
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,180
for collisions will not be practical and you would have to rely on

418
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:45,609
something very brute force oriented, which is not reasonable to do.

419
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,319
Yeah, I mean, I think the, the reality is as sort of so the,

420
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,739
the those talking about those three stages of attacks, you know,

421
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,939
where you can create two files with the same hash, you can create eight, a new file

422
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,050
with the same hash as an existing file.

423
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,880
And then the third step which is given a hash, here's a file that matches it.

424
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,119
That first attack is actually quite

425
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,979
potentially bad with some cryptocurrencies because for example,

426
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,449
you get into areas of double spend.

427
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:15,869
Uh yeah, that, that's probably fair, you know, and, and these are like,

428
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,270
this is literally if I can,

429
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,170
you can basically fake currency

430
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,930
and, and that's a real world problem for a currency,

431
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,410
you know, having fake currency running around, you know,

432
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,060
with these consensus protocols and stuff like it would,

433
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:32,930
it would probably not be a very great attack, but it would be one huge headache,

434
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,640
you know, to deal with it.

435
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:38,770
And what really gets me about this attack is that everybody, I mean, Shaw is,

436
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,719
you know, it's a pretty good hash, 1 60 100 and 60 bits.

437
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:45,410
So two to the 160th, which is a very large number with a lot of zeros, I'm sure.

438
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:46,569
And um,

439
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,939
but fundamentally what's, what's amusing to me is

440
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,069
some software that relies on sha one hashes to uh for the lack of a better term,

441
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,050
identify an object or a file

442
00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:00,339
made the assumption that there will never be a collision, not even accidental.

443
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,839
And so, uh you remember the, the web KT thing, right?

444
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:04,739
So

445
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,819
there's subversion repo.

446
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,119
Yeah. So web kit has a Subversion repository

447
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:13,660
and they have a get to subversion sort of gateway.

448
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,699
And so some bright spark checked both these PDF files into the G

449
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,300
you know, totally reasonable, right?

450
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,410
Like I should be able to safely check in some files to get, you know,

451
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,069
as an example of the sha one attack, right?

452
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:31,040
And then when it went through their get to SVN uh gateway and into the SVNSVN just

453
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,520
apparently just barfed itself horribly horribly and like and

454
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,589
destroyed its internal database because of these matching sha

455
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,040
one hashes.

456
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:39,989
I

457
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:43,800
I've yet to properly understand that problem

458
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,739
because it,

459
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,040
I don't know, part of me gets it. And it's funny.

460
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:48,930
But another part of me,

461
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:53,170
like we check in files with the same check on all the time because, well,

462
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,479
granted they're the same file usually, you know what I mean?

463
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,439
I don't know, something crazy is going on obviously.

464
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,589
But I think fundamentally this points out a really good security

465
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,020
concept of you have to design with failure in mind.

466
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,439
And I'm guessing almost no software that uses shaw one to,

467
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,119
for example, identify objects

468
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,150
actually does. So

469
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,750
-- with, you know, this like actual,
-- why wouldn't

470
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,030
the

471
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:15,869
different objects,

472
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,280
the whole point of using sha one is you don't have to worry about collisions.

473
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,619
-- Well,
-- you know,

474
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:22,589
until now.

475
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,359
Yeah,

476
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,079
exactly.

477
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,099
Um, you know, it's just,

478
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,849
I feel like it's one of those design choices that if you design around that.

479
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,069
It also, then, you know,

480
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,050
you're buying yourself also some breathing room for

481
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,819
when the inevitable does happen or you know,

482
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,790
some crazy cosmic accident,

483
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:36,530
crazy

484
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,489
accidents. Those are the best kind.

485
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:39,479
Yeah,

486
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,439
so yeah.

487
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,680
No, this, I think the the good news,

488
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,619
like you said with Shaw one is the browsers are killing

489
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,459
it and hopefully more on the back end will kill it.

490
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:49,180
And then ideally, you know, we'll get CV S assigned to the stuff.

491
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:52,000
So people will know and be able to make an informed decision and, you know,

492
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,780
hopefully on the next equipment refresh,

493
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:54,599
I,

494
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,640
I blame MD five for making this a lot easier because I mean,

495
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,569
I remember when MD five finally died is

496
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,760
we knew it was bad and we're like,

497
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,400
it's not that bad and then the flame malware came out, it was like, yeah,

498
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,420
it's worse than we thought.

499
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,170
And so I think people understand

500
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,849
that is going to happen here eventually.

501
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:14,410
So,

502
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,089
so just to convert the flame hour, that was the one where it

503
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:22,140
was creating like hostile binaries with the same MD five or that was

504
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,650
the sign.

505
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,829
I think it was

506
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:24,260
doing something.

507
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:25,280
-- Right. It
-- was the sign.

508
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,750
Right. It's, yes, I remember this now. Yeah.

509
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,810
And that one was even really interesting because that was

510
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:34,630
a completely unknown attack prior to the malware being found,

511
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,609
which is obviously,

512
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:36,660
that's terrifying.

513
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,500
And that's also another thing to think about is just because there's no

514
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,339
public research around the sha one attacks

515
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:44,689
doesn't mean it doesn't exist somewhere.

516
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:48,489
Well, something to keep in mind. I mean, this Shatter attack was done by, what was it?

517
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,680
Two guys at Google

518
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,859
and three guys at a university.

519
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:55,579
And they, but they also, I mean, they stood on research that came before them.

520
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,130
But the point is you, you think some government doesn't have five smart guys?

521
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,660
They have more than five.

522
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:05,130
Yeah, exactly.

523
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,170
You know, so the reality is this is, you know, like,

524
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,680
that's what always gets me is a lot of these attacks they come out

525
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,189
and it's,

526
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:14,670
it's not like the Manhattan project where you had thousands of people involved.

527
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,069
It's like five guys.

528
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,199
I, I know what you mean.

529
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:20,949
Well, not only that the, the fewer people you have working on something like this,

530
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,339
the easier it is to keep secret,

531
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:23,219
which is

532
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,250
in hindsight.

533
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,530
Like it's a,

534
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,760
can you imagine if something like the Manhattan

535
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,500
project was done today with social media?

536
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,939
Like, no, like I give it two hours

537
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,699
before it's leaked.

538
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,339
Right. Like someone taking a selfie next to the reactor and

539
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,189
it would be the

540
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,030
horrifying man. I mean,

541
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,369
look at what's going on now.

542
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,010
Like there's,

543
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,560
there's all these crackdowns and all these governments where they're

544
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,250
trying to keep information locked up and it's like guys,

545
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,800
you can't win this unless you lock these people

546
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,380
in vaults with no electronics of any sort.

547
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,650
You, you're going to fail.

548
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,290
Well, and they've done that like, uh what was it that one piece of legislation,

549
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,849
the TT P or whatever,

550
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,540
or the TPP, the Trans Pacific Partnership.

551
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,739
If memory serves the uh the European members of parliament, we're trying to like,

552
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,089
read it and the process to read it

553
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,030
is you have to give up all your electronic devices, go into a locked room,

554
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,069
you're not allowed to even bring paper and pen with you

555
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,160
and you're allowed to like spend half an hour reading this document,

556
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,489
then you have to leave the room and it's like, wow, that's,

557
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,130
yeah.

558
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,739
Right.

559
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,729
I mean, apart from the,

560
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,369
like you guys are clearly trying to hide something aspect of that is like,

561
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,609
people can still remember and they can sum it up later.

562
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,640
Like people are the problem, right? That, that's

563
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,959
-- pretty much how
-- we,

564
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,329
you know, and I think this,

565
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,020
this talking about the small security team

566
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,770
and small security research thing really brings up

567
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,890
our next topic quite nicely. I mean,

568
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,839
because now we're talking about a guy Tavis

569
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:42,609
Ormandy.

570
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,949
Yeah, granted he is a very smart man. Very, very smart at security

571
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,910
but, you know, yeah, on his own, he um basically discovered that like,

572
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,020
what is it about 130 of the internet is um

573
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,010
vulnerable to leaked passwords, session data,

574
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:57,599
you know,

575
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,199
if it's that high. But why don't,

576
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:02,300
does about 30% of the website?

577
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:07,619
But it's not every site they've got to have some Janky html to really

578
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,300
-- trigger it. But
-- no

579
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:11,650
uh no, no, no, no,

580
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,359
no, no,

581
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:12,599
no.

582
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,189
Ok.

583
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:18,104
A bunch of enhancements. So for example, I can have cloud

584
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,744
floor automatically rewrite all requests to http S

585
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:22,275
have cloud

586
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,535
-- ate email addresses, right?
-- The,

587
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:24,734
the

588
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,224
the problem is more nuanced than this. It's the,

589
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:33,665
your data could be snarfed out from a request to a Janky site is what the problem is

590
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,079
and that's the real issue. And so why don't, do you want to explain this one?

591
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,729
Let's, let's let's start at the beginning

592
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,369
-- for people who might not
-- Cloud

593
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,790
Flare is a content delivery network service,

594
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,349
maybe not that far in the beginning.

595
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,979
-- So basically everyone
-- knows who cloud flare is, man. Come on.

596
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,489
But so they actually terminate the TLS and SSL connection

597
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,109
on their end and then send a further request to your server,

598
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,420
either encrypted or non encrypted depending on what you configured

599
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,479
to actually get the content and serve it up.

600
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,300
So that means the Cloud flare servers actually have

601
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,540
you know, the unencrypted raw

602
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:09,599
actual contents of the request because they also then are able to do things like

603
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:13,189
say email obfuscation where they like replace email addresses in the web page with,

604
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,839
uh I think it's like a picture or something so that, you know,

605
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,560
it can't be scraped as easily

606
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,650
or they do things like, um

607
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:23,089
you can um insert content or remove content, whatever, you know,

608
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,170
you can do some real cool stuff.

609
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:29,449
And the problem is they had like a little tiny, like literally a one character flaw

610
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,579
that meant that memory segments weren't aligned correctly in the application.

611
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:35,420
It was written in C

612
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,619
and so when it was

613
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,390
doing certain things, it could essentially insert data from

614
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:44,209
random parts of other memory on that server

615
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:46,030
and send that

616
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,089
in the request, you know, response.

617
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:51,780
And the problem is that those bits of data could be things like,

618
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:57,069
uh, cookie or a password or the actual web page itself

619
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,150
and it's sent to some random third party

620
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,729
and

621
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,040
ok, you know, that's bad.

622
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,729
But whatever, but the real problem becomes is now that, um, a lot of web caches

623
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,469
like

624
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,790
Google Bing Yahoo, you know, the big web crawler guys

625
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:12,869
have this content in the web pages, they have indexed and cached,

626
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,430
but that they also make available, right?

627
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,750
Like archived pages.

628
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,560
So,

629
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,040
and that's one thing Tavis had to work on is

630
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,479
he apparently had to write like a cleaner to like,

631
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:24,410
you know, the go through all of Google's data and like

632
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,819
basically clean the stuff out as best they could.

633
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,760
Um But we're talking like, what is it?

634
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,199
4.3 million domains are served through cloud flare, some of them pretty big.

635
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:38,439
And so this data is scattered all over, you know, God's green earth,

636
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,810
literally, who knows where and, and the real problem is we can't, you know,

637
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,109
I can't say with certainty that you're affected or not because

638
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:47,550
a couple of things had to happen. One, you know,

639
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:48,300
you,

640
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,229
you had to have your sensitive data in the cloud flare servers memory

641
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,949
while some other person made a request to a site with this,

642
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,349
you know,

643
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,369
um

644
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,229
flaw to be triggered and then randomly grab a chunk

645
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,260
of your memory that gets sent to an attacker.

646
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,449
Then the attacker would actually have to look at it and

647
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,359
process it and figure out what the heck this is for,

648
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,260
you know, like given just a cookie like, well, which website is this for which,

649
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,510
you know, is this an account?

650
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,750
Is this a session like,

651
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,449
you know?

652
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,900
And so that's the real problem is we're now at this place where like um well,

653
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,099
we think sort of like most of the internet is affected, but we don't really know

654
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,819
right, that

655
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,939
the unknown is the problem. And I remember it was very similar with heart bleed,

656
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,540
which is a very similar issue

657
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:31,540
and

658
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,469
it's just that unknown of did something bad happen, did something bad not happen.

659
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,819
We don't exactly know. And so from the security perspective,

660
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,880
-- it's always best to err on the side of caution. Well,
-- but there's a cost with that.

661
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,050
Like,

662
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,010
are you gonna reset every single password

663
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,219
with every single cloud flare served website?

664
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:49,530
I,

665
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,969
-- do you even know which
-- one? I have no idea.

666
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,380
-- And
-- you're not gonna,

667
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,729
you're not gonna go through your password manager and, like,

668
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,900
compare it to that list of 4.3 million domains.

669
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,300
And then

670
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,150
there is

671
00:27:59,369 --> 00:27:59,380
a

672
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,540
lot,

673
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,229
I'll put it in the show notes

674
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,150
impressively large to say the least.

675
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,189
Yeah.

676
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,589
So, well, part of it is like for example,

677
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,319
wordpress.com and a bunch of other sites like that have like

678
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:14,140
an automatic kind of ability for you to use Cloudflare,

679
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,800
you like hit a button and boom, you're using cloud flare,

680
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,969
you know, things like that.

681
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:21,109
There's a lot of applications now that like have a button to use cloud flare.

682
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,175
But yeah, so this basically it comes back to this uncertainty of like, well,

683
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,714
are we affected or are we not affected?

684
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:25,964
And

685
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,834
you know, even some sites that use cloud flare for serving stuff like for example,

686
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:33,474
-- explicitly did not use cloud flare for like their authentication stuff,
-- right?

687
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,055
So they're not affected probably,

688
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,944
well, it's complicated because

689
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:40,885
just because you off against the site doesn't

690
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:44,704
mean there aren't cookies and various other authentication tokens

691
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:46,474
traveling between the cloud

692
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:49,464
servers and the resources you're trying to access. Right.

693
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,094
Exactly. So,

694
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,239
you know, that's really where it boils down to and more to the point. There's no,

695
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,619
well, there's very, uh,

696
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,489
the sort of the evidence and the artifacts of this problem that we do have, like,

697
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,560
stuff in, say Google's cash or Bing's cash,

698
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,089
you know,

699
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,880
going through and processing that to figure out

700
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,680
who actually got vulnerable and who didn't,

701
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:08,869
would just, it would be a,

702
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:11,680
you know, an expensive herculean task. But,

703
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,380
you know, they're not going to do probably, it's just too much of a pain in the butt

704
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,619
and on cloud flare side, you know, they don't,

705
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,359
I'm guessing, don't dump the contents of server memory every five seconds.

706
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:23,819
They, they couldn't,

707
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,280
they couldn't, they just, they, they process too much data and, and zeroing out.

708
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,839
Well, let's face it in a properly functioning system.

709
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:33,339
You don't need to zero out the memory because

710
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,819
the way you use it

711
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,380
does it correctly and takes care of that.

712
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,579
It's,

713
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,430
it's an unfortunate bug. Well, it's not so. Ok. C sucks. All right.

714
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:47,380
I love c more than, more than anything in the world, but I feel like it's,

715
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,510
it's that drug addict child you have that you love but you just, you know, you know,

716
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,300
you, you can't keep enabling them

717
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,770
to live that this lifestyle they have.

718
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,780
So, but the problem is

719
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,290
I, it wasn't really C's fault.

720
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,609
They had a parser generating C code and they had

721
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:06,709
basically made a mistake in their parser and the parser,

722
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,569
I guess, was dumb enough to generate

723
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:12,540
bad sea which then created this issue. And ironically,

724
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:16,569
the problem from what I've gathered is the bug had been there for years.

725
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:21,369
It was just when they made some recent change, it became easier to trigger.

726
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,510
Yeah.

727
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:24,510
Essentially my understanding is Tavis made some

728
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,900
requests and noticed this wonky garbage data,

729
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,599
looked at the wonky garbage data

730
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,380
and, you know, found out whoops,

731
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,680
right?

732
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,660
But even then I've,

733
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,760
I've read a handful of people who are criticizing

734
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,579
Tavis for kind of the project Zero response,

735
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,140
which is very aggressive compared to many.

736
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:48,260
But I will say that having been on both sides of this more times than I can count,

737
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,859
I think these guys did it right? I think being aggressive and honest is

738
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,780
the Google Project zero guys,

739
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:56,359
right?

740
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,859
Well, and especially since this is a real world attack that is,

741
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:00,619
you know,

742
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,920
-- it had a significant impact and
-- even the Clown

743
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:06,979
Flare guys though they published a great blog.

744
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:10,900
-- Well, they did downplay the severity of it.
-- They, they did a bit and

745
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,290
I'm sensitive to that because when you're the one getting kicked,

746
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,160
it's

747
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,199
it's difficult to be brutally honest. But I think,

748
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,959
I think for the most part they did what was right? And I think Tavis did what was right?

749
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:28,339
And so I think anyone criticizing either side is

750
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:32,959
kind of a fool. I've seen issues go way worse than this.

751
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:33,660
-- Right.
-- Yeah.

752
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I do have one concern and that is, you know,

753
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,160
cloud flare runs apparently a bug bounty program.

754
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,199
But, like, even for an epically terrible problem, like this,

755
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,199
the best Tavis could do is a T shirt.

756
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:44,979
And so there were some comments that,

757
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:46,640
yeah,

758
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,589
and apparently there were some people commenting that

759
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,589
people are withholding flaws from cloud flare because of

760
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,089
the lack of reward. And

761
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,680
I part of me,

762
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,109
you know, I'm of two minds of that.

763
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,619
On the one hand,

764
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,709
I think that these companies should maybe spend a little bit on bug bounties and,

765
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,380
you know, provide that incentive for researchers.

766
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,030
But at the same time, I think like, like generally speaking,

767
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,469
white hat researchers in my opinion, should try to do the right thing

768
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,989
regardless of reward. You know, it's,

769
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,869
if I,

770
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,650
you know,

771
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,390
if I,

772
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,130
if I'm working in public health and I discover some new strain of super gonorrhea,

773
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:19,880
you know, I shouldn't report that to the government because I get a reward.

774
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,300
I should report to the government because I don't want

775
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,280
to live in a world full of super gonorrhea.

776
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,280
-- I understand what you're saying and I struggle with
-- this

777
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:28,949
issue.

778
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,189
It, it, it doesn't have an easy answer and

779
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:37,989
we could argue about this for hours in, in either direction.

780
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,270
And I think

781
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,270
at the end of the day,

782
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:44,390
the current socially acceptable,

783
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,310
I guess solution

784
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,589
is the bug bounty system and is as flawed as it is and

785
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,569
it certainly is flawed,

786
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:56,290
but it is kind of the way it works now and

787
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,430
whether you like it or not,

788
00:32:58,689 --> 00:32:59,709
that is

789
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:01,430
the way it is.

790
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,050
And I think, rather than argue about the phys

791
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,390
philosophical

792
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,589
or technical merits of it, it's just

793
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:12,040
if you're not running a bug bounty, you're probably behind the times.

794
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,900
It's just the unfortunate reality.

795
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,010
It reminds me a lot of like democracy.

796
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,959
You know, it's not pretty, it doesn't always work well,

797
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:21,290
but of all the systems we've tried so far, it's the least worst

798
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,650
or it used to be at least words.

799
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,489
Yeah.

800
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,520
But um, no, I mean, that's what, what really gets me is um

801
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,180
just, you know, yeah, companies need to at a minimum, make it,

802
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:34,520
make it easy to report stuff.

803
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,469
And number two for the really bad stuff,

804
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,989
you actually have to do something in a

805
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,300
reasonably timely manner like this whole thing,

806
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,569
you know, vendors used to sit on stuff like this for years,

807
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:43,910
literally,

808
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,250
you know, there's disclosure timelines from back in the, you know,

809
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,479
uh I hate to say this, the odds,

810
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:52,400
you know, the 2000 through 2010

811
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,770
or nine, whatever, whatever the odds were,

812
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,530
you know,

813
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,489
there's stuff that like you look at the disclosure

814
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,650
timeline and it's like two or three years.

815
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:03,359
Yeah, I, I remember those days, man, I remember

816
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,209
trying to do disclosure with certain organizations and

817
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,208
it was a total nightmare and they would,

818
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,168
they would bully you

819
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,438
because

820
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,560
they figured, well, we'll threaten to sue or we'll say this or that or another.

821
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,219
And so,

822
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,879
I mean,

823
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,719
it was, it was terrible. I'm not gonna lie. It was not good.

824
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,399
And this is where

825
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,020
I, I feel like the bug bounty programs,

826
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,800
they, they kind of have two effects is, first of all,

827
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,879
they give researchers a certain incentive,

828
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,918
ok? Which is

829
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,060
right or wrong. It exists, ok?

830
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,360
But it also on the company side or the organization side, I won't say company.

831
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,139
It,

832
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:46,219
it makes you put certain things in place for dealing with this stuff because I mean,

833
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,500
well, you remember, it's still, actually, it's not even remember.

834
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,458
It's still a problem. I mean,

835
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,489
there are organizations that if you had to report a security flaw to,

836
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,020
you couldn't

837
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:56,100
because,

838
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:56,879
you know,

839
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,179
you go to their website and you look for security stuff and there's nothing there.

840
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,639
I mean, that's a huge problem.

841
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:05,340
I remember horror stories of people like, you know, contacting organizations,

842
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,110
software or service providers and like trying to work their way

843
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,330
through sport and the ever classic one with the banks,

844
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,699
you know,

845
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,699
do you have an account with us? No click.

846
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah. Right.

847
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,300
You know, it's like I'm trying to help you guys, like,

848
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,760
I keep reaching out to this one bank and they're like on Twitter and I'm like, hey,

849
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,510
I just got, you know, because I keep getting text messages for like,

850
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,949
a couple of Canadian banks that I don't have account that saying, you know,

851
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,040
go to like Banken

852
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,669
online.com or whatever to like, you know,

853
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,780
reset your password or

854
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,409
those

855
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:37,699
messages and not like spammers trying to steal account information from you.

856
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:40,139
Well, that's exactly what they are. Right. They're spammers, right?

857
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,419
And so II I then, you know, take a screenshot and like, tweet it at,

858
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:48,010
uh, you know, at bank security or at bank or whatever.

859
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,300
And they're always like, oh, can you please report it through this, blah, blah,

860
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,429
blah.

861
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,449
And I'm like, no, no, I'm not,

862
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm not jumping through hoops to report something to you. I,

863
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,629
I sent you a screenshot on Twitter with a domain.

864
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:01,090
You, you need to deal with this now and route it internally.

865
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,330
I'm not going to do that for you.

866
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,290
Yeah.

867
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,360
You know, and that's the thing, right? It's,

868
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:08,050
you know, all those times like somebody, you know,

869
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,010
when you don't make it hard for people to speak up

870
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,260
that drives me nuts. You know, I, I agree completely.

871
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,810
I was at the library and I saw somebody browsing porn.

872
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,810
So I went up to the library and I'm like, oh, hey, uh, you know, the guy in station nine,

873
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,909
he's, uh, browsing pornography.

874
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,820
She's like, oh, ok. Thank you. We'll deal with it

875
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,060
done.

876
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,610
You know, they, they're not gonna make me fill out a form and trip it or whatever.

877
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,429
-- I'm
-- sure there's organizations and libraries that would,

878
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,010
nothing would surprise me.

879
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,739
And that's, you know, and that's the thing,

880
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,290
that's the biggest signal to me with a bug

881
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,540
bounty is chances are you're not gonna sue me

882
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,379
and chances are you're gonna have a point of contact I can talk to that won't be like,

883
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,219
have you tried turning it off and on?

884
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,209
Yeah, I'm, oh, man, I know what you mean.

885
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:53,129
Sometimes when you try to deal with nonsecurity people,

886
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,000
they don't quite understand what's going on.

887
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,510
You know, I'll never forget is this is, I love this story. So I was,

888
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,500
but a we lay

889
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:03,010
out fresh out of college and I was working for an organization

890
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,050
that was

891
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,570
in the process of cloud washing their product.

892
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,469
And

893
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,370
all right,

894
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:11,489
I remember they had one point where there was like the login user name,

895
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,209
password and they had a sequel injection on the login.

896
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,239
And

897
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:19,260
of course, you know, I'm like, look here, we, we can have to fix this because if,

898
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,590
you know, if I type in this look, I can, you know, show the, the total layout

899
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,580
of the database, right? No, I did not drop the tables.

900
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,899
But anyway, and I remember the, the developer looked at me, he's like,

901
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:28,979
why would anyone do that?

902
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:32,709
And I said I just did that, you know, come on and it,

903
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,030
they did not understand what was going on and

904
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,060
they just kept saying nobody's gonna do that.

905
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,320
And I remember

906
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:39,689
with

907
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:40,479
SS

908
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:44,010
Exactly they, but I mean, I get that right.

909
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,899
And this is unfortunately what can happen is if you have a security guy try

910
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,030
to report a security flaw and someone doesn't quite understand the nuance of it.

911
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,739
And let's face it, like, in this case with cloud flare, this was fairly nuanced.

912
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,439
I think

913
00:37:55,649 --> 00:38:01,250
it would be easy for a, a very, we'll say, um, I, I hesitate to say uninformed but,

914
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,379
you know,

915
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:04,669
someone who maybe isn't hip with security to understand exactly

916
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,870
what is happening here and why it is so serious.

917
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,040
Yeah.

918
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:09,689
Oh man, it's

919
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,659
remember when things were easy, Kurt.

920
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:13,479
Yeah.

921
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,040
Well, so I have some good news for you.

922
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,760
Um This just came into my mailbox. Uh The CV newsletter from Miter just popped in

923
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,399
feature story CV E 2005 4900 is sha one collision attack shattered.

924
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:33,750
-- Uh from 2005,
-- this vulnerability in sha one was assigned CV ID 2005 4900 in 2016.

925
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,350
Uh They don't say why they use 2005, but

926
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:41,070
I think it's probably because this attack was first posited in 2005.

927
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,699
Probably when the research came out

928
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,669
for this. I know it was a long time ago.

929
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,860
-- Yeah.
-- And now it's, this is the actual proof of concept part, right?

930
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,070
Because we do that all the time, right? Like

931
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,429
somebody will come up with a Linux kernel flaw and it's

932
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:54,120
not for like a year or two until somebody bothers,

933
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:54,969
try and exploit for it.

934
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,209
-- You know,
-- actually you say that this is even

935
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,429
look at physics.

936
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,770
How long was the Higgs

937
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,199
boson a thing?

938
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:01,649
And in fact,

939
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:05,000
actually the Higgs boson is a great analogy here because you think about it,

940
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,919
the Higgs

941
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,540
boson.

942
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,310
So Higgs is the name of the,

943
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,100
the physicist who kind of predicted the existence of the boson.

944
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:16,989
And then he was widely ridiculed for a long time as being a crazy person

945
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,629
and then they build the large Hadron Collider and it's like, oh, yeah, look,

946
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,919
we found it and it took, you know, like 30 years to go from essentially research

947
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,600
and, and theory to ridicule

948
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:29,389
to,

949
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:29,669
oh,

950
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:29,879
yeah,

951
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:30,340
it's,

952
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,459
uh, I

953
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,449
don't think anyone criticized Einstein.

954
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,600
-- Well, they kind of did
-- for me,

955
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:39,165
it was not well accepted because, you know, God does not play dice with the universe,

956
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:39,504
I think.

957
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:40,495
Well, that was his quote.

958
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:41,425
Right. But, I

959
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:42,665
mean, you know,

960
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:44,284
anytime people have come up with new

961
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:47,054
theories that fundamentally view the world differently,

962
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:47,794
that's true.

963
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:48,294
I mean, that's,

964
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:49,205
that's

965
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:49,625
not

966
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:50,814
the

967
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:51,074
thing to

968
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,395
do and then eventually

969
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,050
it's proven

970
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:56,370
and, and I guess that that's part of this and this is true.

971
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:59,080
Security is there's always someone who will deny this is

972
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,120
a problem until it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

973
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:05,600
At which point. It's like, oh, crap. Now, I've got to get on this bus

974
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,409
and,

975
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,320
yeah, that's, that's really interesting. And I guess ironically as well is

976
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:15,250
the trick for like the Higgs boson is we had to wait for technology

977
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,729
and someone to build a giant machine capable of actually doing this work,

978
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:22,030
which is not unlike the shaw problem is we had to wait for

979
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,159
a massive cloud infrastructure to exist.

980
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,550
So we,

981
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,290
right. So we could do it.

982
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:27,959
It's, oh,

983
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,810
wow. I need to, I need to do some research on this.

984
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,729
This could be a really fun topic to, to compare

985
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,530
the I guess world of,

986
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,169
of science and physics to the world of security going from theory to practice.

987
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:44,879
And I guess more importantly though is once we've proven something in practice,

988
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:48,510
how does it change the work that happens after that point?

989
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:54,439
Because obviously for, for, I mean relativity is a great example is once Einstein,

990
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,110
you know, came up with the theory of relativity,

991
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,290
it kind of went through its peer review and was accepted,

992
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,550
it dramatically changed

993
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:03,939
literally all of science for forever

994
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,620
because

995
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,469
I mean

996
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,739
concrete level a member of the RS A show

997
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,860
there was a quantum level random number generator.

998
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,320
Oh yeah, that's uh Richard Mold

999
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,459
and the white wood encryption guys. They, they're super

1000
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,729
cool dudes and

1001
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:21,929
I love talking to them because my joke is always, you know, there, there's all this,

1002
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,879
all these people talk about randomness and whatnot.

1003
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:24,320
And I'm like,

1004
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,239
and I, I told Richard this and I said,

1005
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,959
you're one of like the five people in the

1006
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,919
world that's actually qualified to talk about randomness.

1007
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:31,709
You know, it's,

1008
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,120
it's one of those things everyone thinks they can talk about.

1009
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:34,709
I mean, heck, we've done

1010
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:36,875
more than once. Like, we're totally unqualified.

1011
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,754
We don't really know what we're talking about.

1012
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,645
Yeah. I just remember the look on the astrophysicist face there.

1013
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:44,195
She was so excited when she realized because I was wearing my suit. Right.

1014
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:46,915
And I think everybody assumes I'm a market droid when I'm in my suit

1015
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,354
and then she realized I was technical and just the look on her face was just such a joy.

1016
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:52,955
There you go.

1017
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,659
You know. But uh yeah. No, it's, it's, you're right like this,

1018
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,600
you know, the sha one is a great example.

1019
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,850
Are we gonna like all the world stop using

1020
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,060
sha one tomorrow and start transitioning off of it?

1021
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:03,550
Oh, no,

1022
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:04,479
sadly not.

1023
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:05,840
But

1024
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,270
yeah, I, I sha

1025
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:09,629
three is gonna be a ways away.

1026
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,280
Uh

1027
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,939
Yeah, probably.

1028
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:15,600
Which is sad. But, oh, well, it is what it is.

1029
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,540
There's not a lot we can do about it.

1030
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,000
Well, you know, it reminds me a lot of the I PV four I PV six network thing

1031
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,100
in the, I

1032
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,489
don't think I'll ever have a native I PV

1033
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,949
six network experience until my kids have like grandkids.

1034
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:30,370
I,

1035
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,129
yes,

1036
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:33,169
I know.

1037
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:37,500
I'm still terrified of the security flaws. We are going to discover

1038
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,050
I PV six.

1039
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:41,409
-- Well, you think about it? I mean,
-- it's already been horrifying.

1040
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,530
It hasn't been that bad. Honestly, I, I've

1041
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,219
advertisement stuff has been pretty bad because most

1042
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,389
people just pretended like it wasn't a problem.

1043
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,250
-- Implementation.
-- Explain

1044
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,590
the problem for the listeners who don't know what you're talking about.

1045
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,129
-- So,
-- one of the, one of the,

1046
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:01,229
one of the things with I PV six is that, you know, let's make configuration easier. So

1047
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:05,629
you don't necessarily need to run like a DH CP server to hand out addresses and stuff.

1048
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,550
You can just, for example, here's your prefix staple on your MAC address. Boom.

1049
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,429
Done, right?

1050
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,020
Uh So things like that and then there's this idea of like a route advertisement,

1051
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,800
Damon where a machine can basically advertise like, hey, I'm a route for X, right?

1052
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,790
So that stuff, routing and whatnot just sort of magically happens.

1053
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,969
Well, the problem is anybody can advertise that crap on the network.

1054
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,850
So if you have a network with a malicious computer, it can advertise, hey,

1055
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,850
I'm the default route.

1056
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,050
And then of course, it actually,

1057
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:29,629
you know,

1058
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,429
becomes a default route for everything

1059
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:35,639
and then sends the traffic on through the actual default route.

1060
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,350
And man in the middle is everything,

1061
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:40,320
you know, things like that. So uh a quick search for um

1062
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,050
the CV database shows 263 CV entries that match the term I PV six.

1063
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,580
How many match I PV for

1064
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,169
uh a lot.

1065
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,070
Uh It is

1066
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:52,459
0 100 and 55

1067
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,310
it.

1068
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,770
Well,

1069
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,199
there's probably more than that because I'm

1070
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,820
sure a lot of things aren't specifically denoted

1071
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,149
as IP four and I'm sure a lot of these problems happened before CV.

1072
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,360
E was really even a thing

1073
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,949
CV, started in 1999. So, yes, I PV

1074
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:07,159
T

1075
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,189
four has been around forever.

1076
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:10,239
Forever.

1077
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:14,409
Yeah. But fundamentally like it's, I PV six is going to have to go, like,

1078
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,189
-- the sad reality is we don't seem to learn the lessons of the past.
-- We never will.

1079
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:22,669
And, well, not only that, the bigger problem I see with I PV six is

1080
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,030
if you, if you think about the level of complexity,

1081
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,000
I PV six is like magnitudes more complex than I PV four.

1082
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:32,000
I

1083
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,179
try to read the specs to fully understand it and I gave up.

1084
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:35,979
It's,

1085
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:38,719
and that's gonna be the problem and that's what's gonna be the challenge

1086
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:43,419
for security is there's the issues of being complete according to standards which

1087
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:45,659
no one will be because they're too complicated.

1088
00:44:45,669 --> 00:44:48,020
There's gonna be issues of implementing

1089
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,620
the standards because they're incomplete and

1090
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:54,489
it's just crazy complex. So there's going to be mistakes because

1091
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:54,860
there's

1092
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,149
different

1093
00:44:57,229 --> 00:45:00,530
and that, that will probably happen also where one person will do it one way,

1094
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,360
the other person will do it the other way and

1095
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,010
who knows what that's going to result in.

1096
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,600
And so I imagine once I PV SIX becomes

1097
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:13,250
way more widely used than it is today and it's actually it's getting there.

1098
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,629
But I suspect

1099
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:17,510
once the researchers start hitting it hard

1100
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,989
we're gonna find a lot of crazy problems.

1101
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:20,189
Oh,

1102
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:22,520
yeah. Yeah. No, that's a given, um,

1103
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:23,739
for us.

1104
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,629
Yeah. So,

1105
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,379
anyway,

1106
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,629
I guess encrypt everything just and make sure you don't use sha one.

1107
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:32,489
Yes.

1108
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,340
That will fix everything.

1109
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,419
Indeed. Oh, man, it's,

1110
00:45:38,709 --> 00:45:42,250
I love it. Welcome to the internet. It's complicated and hard and weird

1111
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,570
and we don't know what to do.

1112
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,649
Oh, well, such is life

1113
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:48,919
but it works pretty well. It, it does.

1114
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:50,270
Yeah,

1115
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,199
it's been, oh, man. Let's hope.

1116
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,399
Let's hope this week isn't anything like last week because, well,

1117
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:56,830
there was also that Linux kernel root privilege escalation

1118
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,729
issue that we totally didn't talk about at all,

1119
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,290
which ironically would have been exciting news.

1120
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,010
Had Sean not been broken and Claude Flair kind of had their issue.

1121
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,469
Well, and the thing, it kind of reminds me of like, like bank security that, you know,

1122
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,870
I hate to say this but like

1123
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,469
local privilege escalation in the Linux kernel are bad, but

1124
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,229
-- this isn't our first rodeo.
-- It isn't.

1125
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,010
We basically know what to do at this point.

1126
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,469
Well, not only that, I think at this point if you have a system

1127
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:31,379
that isn't doing some sort of sand boxing and you are allowing multiple users on it,

1128
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,899
you're doing something wrong.

1129
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,159
Well, just from a, I

1130
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:37,030
mean, who the heck runs on bear hardware anymore?

1131
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,780
Like V MS are way easier to manage and provision.

1132
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:40,679
Yes. And

1133
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:43,060
I mean, it's just, we're at that point where it's like,

1134
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,260
it's, you know,

1135
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,689
it's like all the people that I remember back in the day people didn't use DH P,

1136
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:49,189
they would manually configure everything.

1137
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,899
And I discovered DH P and I'm like, oh, my sweet goodness.

1138
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:53,899
Wow.

1139
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:54,419
I just, I,

1140
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:57,280
I do one config file on one server and bam everything

1141
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,199
-- you turn it on and it works in their
-- defense.

1142
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,540
I don't know if you've ever set up I PV or not. IP A DH CP.

1143
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,060
Way back in the day. It was a nightmare to get working correctly.

1144
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:09,610
This is actually,

1145
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,560
this is where Microsoft as much as I complained about them back in the 2000, early,

1146
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,360
two thousands,

1147
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,659
they got a lot of this stuff, right? Because they made it very pointy, clicky.

1148
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:21,120
Anyone can figure this out and, and if you're on using a UNIX system

1149
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,600
and trying to configure your network,

1150
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:25,689
you had to be some sort of insane wizard to make it work.

1151
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:28,530
And you remember all the books, like, remember the o'reilly books?

1152
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,860
They were all like phone books,

1153
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,300
all of them,

1154
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:34,129
right? I, oh man, I, I still have them. They're in my basement and I keep thinking,

1155
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,830
I don't want to throw them out, but they have no value.

1156
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:37,919
I do want to throw them out.

1157
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,689
I actually, my accountant asked me, I remember one year he's like, do you,

1158
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:44,050
do you really have to spend this much on computer books.

1159
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,449
And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, you realize you spent, like,

1160
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:48,800
$5000 on computer books.

1161
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,409
And I'm like, uh,

1162
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,939
I believe that I, well, and they were expensive, man.

1163
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:55,959
Like, the good books were 100 bucks.

1164
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,689
Some of them were more than that.

1165
00:47:57,939 --> 00:48:01,260
Well, I remember buying, uh, not that this isn't really related but it's, uh,

1166
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,949
Knuth's the art of computer programming.

1167
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,770
It was like 300 bucks for that.

1168
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,840
There were, what, four books back then, or three books.

1169
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,100
I, for, I forget the name of it is, it is very nice.

1170
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,790
There's a new book now though and I don't have it and

1171
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,280
part of me wants it and part of me is like,

1172
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,989
uh, I don't know.

1173
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,060
So we'll see, maybe I'll break down some day and get it.

1174
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,649
I decided not to buy physical books anymore. I just,

1175
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,590
-- I don't space constraints.
-- I agree with that. I don't care for real books.

1176
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,580
Real books are big and they take up a lot of space and

1177
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:30,989
I love the fact that I get on an airplane now

1178
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:32,310
and I have

1179
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:34,379
hundreds of books in my bag.

1180
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,469
And I remember traveling where,

1181
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,989
where occasionally you'd be almost done with one book and she'd

1182
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,229
bring two books and it took an insane amount of room.

1183
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,120
So,

1184
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,870
yeah, I'm quite happy. That's not a problem.

1185
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:44,330
Yeah.

1186
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,030
No, I, I think I only buy about 10 or 20 physical books a year now,

1187
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,399
which is down from like, hundreds.

1188
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,620
I don't even know. Well, I, if you count my kids, my kids like physical books.

1189
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:56,550
So we use them there. But, yeah, I don't think I've bought a real book in forever.

1190
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:58,090
I can't even remember the last one.

1191
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,959
-- Which is good. That's good. I'm happy.
-- So, you heard it here?

1192
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,909
First folks, books are dead

1193
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:03,330
on

1194

the

1195
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:03,770
internet.

1196
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,040
Yeah.

1197
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,810
Right. Anyway,

1198
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,550
we'll say dead trees are dead,

1199
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,149
right.

1200
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:09,959
Dead trees are dead.

1201
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:10,949
That's what we'll say.

1202
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:12,860
Books are awesome.

1203
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:14,030
All right.

1204
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:18,979
They, they are the best thing. I agree. I do love books anyway. All right. All right.

1205
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:19,780

That's it. Just thanks. Usually you say something ridiculous.

1217
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,129
Well, it's, it's that whole pause where II,

1218
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:52,520
I feel like you were staring at me over the internet.

1219
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,189
I am staring at you over the internet.
