Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,949
Kurt Siefried and my partner and not discussing all the truly

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,720
terrible things that we know are happening in the world.

3
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:15,470
But you can get your coverage for that elsewhere.

4
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,379
Like say the Australian surveillance bill that got

5
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,059
shoved through in less than 24 hours.

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:23,069
Uh We're gonna kind of keep it light and happy and talk about all the bad stuff in

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,780
infosec. That's right. I will, I have a personal complaint.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,180
I will, I will put out there for all.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,168
So I get up every morning and I take a bike ride, right?

10
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:33,179
And

11
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:35,098
I always get on to the,

12
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,659
I guess in the world and I figure out which direction is

13
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:42,339
the wind blowing because I like to bike into the wind.

14
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:46,438
So my way home is generally the easier like of the world

15
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:47,979
float down.

16
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,898
That's right.

17
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:51,019
So I bike into the wind

18
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:53,289
for about half an hour.

19
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,488
I turn around

20
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:55,208
and

21
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,048
no law.

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,609
Yes, it literally changed 100 and 80 degrees. And I'm like, how did this happen? Like

23
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,639
I felt like I was in a video game and someone was like, ha ha.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,730
And they, like, turn the knob and it's like, oh, my goodness.

25
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,980
And that is basically summed up my day so far

26
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:17,519
anyway.

27
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:20,720
-- Yeah. Sorry. I don't mean to laugh at your plight but
-- it's ok.

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,199
It's, it,

29
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,800
it is something you can laugh at and I will take no offense because it's a bike ride.

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,239
My legs are slightly more tired than normal

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,000
and it was probably good for me.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,169
Yeah.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,900
Yeah, I gotta start doing more cardio.

34
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,169
Actually, I have one other funny story. I'll tell you about my bike ride. So. Right.

35
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,099
We got

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,970
an enormous amount of rain, like a ridiculous amount of rain.

37
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,690
And there's this trail near the river,

38
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,860
I like to bike on that is probably lower than it should be, we'll say.

39
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:50,150
And there's this one spot that often will get a little bit of water on it. Right.

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,629
So I ride my bike up to it and it's

41
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,620
usually a little bit of water a couple centimeters max.

42
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:56,099
Right.

43
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:56,279
I,

44
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:02,379
I pull up and the water is extremely dirty because obviously it was very heavy rain.

45
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,470
So a lot of dirt in the water.

46
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,345
And I'm like, oh, look at that and I start biking through it. It was

47
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,633
enough water that my, like,

48
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:14,095
bike was significantly submerged as I was riding through.

49
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,554
And by the time I made it there, it's like, well, I'm halfway in,

50
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,225
I'm just going to keep going.

51
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:18,794
I was

52
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,764
very muddy and wet.

53
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:22,059
OK.

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,259
I, I'm going to say this for everybody.

55
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:29,270
If you cannot see the bottom of the water don't go in. It's

56
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,570
no straight up because I've seen, I've seen far too well. And

57
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,820
the other thing to remember is I think it's four inches

58
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,039
of fast moving water can basically take a concrete mixer.

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:39,850
Yes.

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,020
Now, I,

61
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:45,039
I want to clarify one important point of this particular poor decision on my part

62
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,850
is

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,869
the water where I was at was completely still. And it was like a

64
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,970
weird big puddle thing.

65
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:54,800
There was no way

66
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,119
that there could be current to carry me off.

67
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,910
-- But yes, never, ever, ever cross moving water.
-- And you're not in like a mud

68
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,720
bog situation.

69
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:04,160
But I've also seen those mud bog videos where, you know,

70
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,570
somebody steps into what they think is a puddle and just,

71
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,830
-- it's,
-- you know,

72
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,559
this is, this is a paved trail. I had asphalt beneath me

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,440
and I knew where it was. I've ridden this a million times.

74
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,240
I did not exit the asphalt at any time.

75
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,479
This is a

76
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,830
perfect infosec

77
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,580
allegory because yes, it was a paved trail.

78
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,960
But if there's moving water under that trail,

79
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,500
like in a culvert or something that doesn't work quite right

80
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,350
all of a sudden.

81
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:33,839
But there wasn't,

82
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,250
I

83
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:36,630
-- know, but I'm just saying
-- I assessed my risks

84
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,710
and while I won't say I made the right decision necessarily, I will say it was,

85
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,830
I did, I lived to tell the tale

86
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,649
anyway. Anyway,

87
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,330
we

88
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,570
survivor bias. So it must be safe to do that again. It's

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,309
-- not
-- making me look like an idiot.

90
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,490
Well, I mean, speaking of looking like an idiot,

91
00:03:55,559 --> 00:04:00,229
I kind of liked clipping in the sense of like clipping was a horrible idea.

92
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,399
Wait a minute. How does that relate to being an idiot?

93
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,365
-- Is clipping an idiot or are you idiot for liking clipping or I'm getting
-- there?

94
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:09,044
So I like the idea of clipping in that

95
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,445
Microsoft was,

96
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,875
remember there was that phase of trying to personalize

97
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:16,295
and humanize and make computing less scary like Microsoft,

98
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,445
Bob and Microsoft clipping and those things, right?

99
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:22,605
Those things failed miserably because I think a lot of it is uncanny valley related.

100
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,804
But anyways, but now we've got

101
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:25,470
github

102
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,489
Copilot,

103
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,019
which is one of those things where

104
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,089
I heard about it. And I'm like,

105
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:31,670
OK,

106
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:36,350
so basically they're automating the whole search stack overflow for code snippets

107
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,079
and cut and paste it into your code to make stuff work.

108
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,470
That's, that's basically what Copilot is,

109
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:41,809
right?

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,359
It's, it's a,

111
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,220
it's an A IML engine that learns about code and

112
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,190
then when you're typing code it's auto suggest blah,

113
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,630
blah blah,

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,880
right? There's a reason

115
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,100
coding is seen as hard.

116
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,160
Uh And that's because it is

117
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,179
right. You're, you're trying to describe

118
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,700
a problem

119
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:02,619
at such a fundamentally low

120
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,619
deconstructed level that something as stupid as a computer can then execute it and,

121
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,510
and do it correctly.

122
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,209
Are you comparing

123
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,190
copilot to clip?

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,720
Well, it's the same idea. Fundamentally.

125
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,820
Hi. I see. You're trying to write a resume.

126
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,980
Would you like to put that in Comic Sans to make it more cheerful?

127
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,049
-- Yes,
-- everything should be in comic sense

128
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:25,980
the best.

129
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,000
So

130
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,649
the, the problem is,

131
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,799
well, I think we should build tools that make it easier to do stuff.

132
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm not sure that this is the right kind of tool to be building.

133
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,609
Because for example, there's a big difference between having a nice sharp chisel

134
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
and having a supposed tool that will recommend

135
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,920
on how to actually build a table correctly.

136
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,480
That requires a lot of mastery and expertise

137
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:57,059
and it requires the system to really kind of understand what your actual goal is.

138
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,730
I I think you've put the cart before the horse a little bit here.

139
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:03,010
So let's, let's back it up. There was a report that came out

140
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,135
-- sometime before now,
-- not a report, an academic paper.

141
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,894
OK, an academic paper, whatever report in my mind, that's all reports.

142
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,695
But this is based on evidence, not anecdotal

143
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,135
that does have evidence. That's true.

144
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:13,934
It's not made of crap,

145
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:16,234
which is why I do love academic papers because

146
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:18,714
nothing angers me more than made up crap.

147
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,334
Anyway,

148
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:20,934
this paper comes out

149
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:24,934
and these researchers basically took copilot

150
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:25,915
and they

151
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,535
put it in some will say precarious situations.

152
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:32,375
They purposely tried to make it, help them write code

153
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,100
that they knew

154
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,700
was going to be likely to,

155
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:41,500
we'll say, trigger security vulnerabilities and it did 40% of the time. Yeah.

156
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,299
Well, and, and

157
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,209
you don't have to try real hard to make something

158
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,119
precarious from a security point of view.

159
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,649
Anytime there's say logic flow about whether or not something is allowed to happen.

160
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,179
Right.

161
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,619
Any time there's a network operation. Right. There's, there's a million

162
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,420
things in code that if they're a little bit wrong

163
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,260
all of a sudden are a security issue.

164
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:08,380
Now, now here's what I took away from this and this. I did not see this in the paper.

165
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:13,420
I admit I did not read it as closely as I would like due to time constraints.

166
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,079
But

167
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,519
my takeaway from this is 40% of the code in use

168
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,799
has we'll say horrible security problems of of I should say

169
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,359
potentially security sensitive code because

170
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:29,920
they also purposely created an environment

171
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,920
where it was more likely to have to make hard decisions,

172
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:33,320
right?

173
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:39,040
Because it should be noted. Copilot is not smart is doing basic pattern matching

174
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:43,480
and saying I've seen similar code to this before. Here's what someone else did.

175
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,299
Let me shove it in place here.

176
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,359
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, it is straight up

177
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,070
essentially automating the task of searching stack

178
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,820
overflow for code snippets that work.

179
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,000
Um to the point of remember there was also the licensing issues where

180
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,019
it was grabbing code that was licensed in a way where you,

181
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:00,940
you're not supposed to just grab the code and say not include

182
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,519
-- the license or whatever
-- or it was funny when it was adding

183
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,809
credentials like tokens from other projects,

184
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,540
which was awesome.

185
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,179
Yeah,

186
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,540
I guess ironically as well explains why the new github

187
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,459
token format is so obviously a token,

188
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:20,220
that way they can't accidentally include them.

189
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,760
We're going to go there because that's something I've

190
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,589
been thinking about because I've actually been dealing with this

191
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,859
a bit because remember I used to have to deal

192
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,950
with it when I was putting emails into github.

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,329
And these token scanners were true

194
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,950
on the message I DS because it was like a long random string of text and realistically

195
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,419
the a string of text past a certain point of entropy

196
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,330
probably should not be code unless it's like pearl.

197
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,419
It's, you know, if, if a string of text has that much entropy, it,

198
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,929
it probably is an access token or a password or some sort of secret.

199
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,260
And so

200
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,780
there was a really good thread about these

201
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,380
API tokens and, and

202
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,309
revocation of them because apparently there's some projects, you know,

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,070
like Amazon and github

204
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,020
where they're scanning github now and

205
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:03,049
automatically revoking,

206
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,650
say Amazon web services tokens in seconds of showing up because

207
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,609
people use those tokens to go grab a whole bunch of computer resources and do stuff.

208
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,690
And somebody in hacker news pointed out

209
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,909
rather, I think intelligently

210
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,090
tokens should be self

211
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,710
-- revoking.
-- What do you, what do you mean by self provoking.

212
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:23,150
-- So
-- the idea is why can't tokens be something like

213
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,219
revoked.sendgrid.com/token and literally by going to that end point,

214
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,179
that revokes the token.

215
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,590
So if somebody sees that token,

216
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,729
instead of me having to figure out how to report it and go oh my God,

217
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,070
somebody's token got exposed.

218
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,070
I literally can just

219
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,890
fire that token off as a your request and poof,

220
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,799
it's no longer available because anybody

221
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:41,270
fly

222
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,030
well.

223
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,909
But the thing is anybody who legitimately has that token won't do that.

224
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,219
And I personally would love that because it

225
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,020
would make revoking tokens super quick and easy

226
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,659
and rotating them actually a bit simpler.

227
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,520
Um And I, I suspect that that is where we're headed is,

228
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,299
is these kind of big tokens like Amazon or, you know,

229
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,349
I don't think we're headed there at all. Look, here's, here's how this works.

230
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,890
They're already sticking identifiers on it.

231
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,260
-- Yeah,
-- they're sticking identifiers on it and they should,

232
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,739
and I agree with that because that's what github

233
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,770
is doing, but they're never going to be self revoking because what happens is

234
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,159
there's so much automated

235
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,549
stuff in our environments now that follows URL S

236
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,989
and looks at things that you're just going to

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,369
have some system accidentally revoking all of your tokens

238
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,450
and then it's going to take some poor schmuck,

239
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:24,940
you know,

240
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,275
six days to regenerate the 4000 tokens you're running in your environment.

241
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:32,544
It's just that, that, that, that wouldn't work.

242
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:35,705
Well, that's why you don't put like http or whatever in, in the token,

243
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,354
you just have a string of text,

244
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,655
-- whatever this is never gonna happen. I don't want to talk
-- about it.

245
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,864
I'm not sure it will happen. But the point is,

246
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:42,784
I think it's,

247
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:43,614
I,

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,500
I think it's this kind of thinking that actually

249
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,979
might make things

250
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,030
different

251
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,659
-- better.
-- Here's what I want to stop you at right now.

252
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:58,080
Insecurity. We have a terrible track record of thinking something makes sense

253
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,299
and then pretending it does without doing any

254
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,309
research saying whether it does or doesn't,

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,039
I will agree with you when you show me a paper that says this is a good idea.

256
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,929
Until then I'm going to say no.

257
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,020
So here's the problem. You

258
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:15,979
have gone to the end though of saying if you do this, here's what will happen,

259
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,719
an automated system will do this.

260
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,219
-- So by definition you're making,
-- that was my mistake.

261
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,979
OK? I scratched that from the record. Show me any research

262
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,239
that says this is true.

263
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,020
Well, but the same thing with Copilot, right is where I,

264
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,000
I understand that they're trying to build a system that quote unquote,

265
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,340
makes it easier to code.

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,719
And again, I, I am for that, like I, I just put in a new outlet on the side of my house

267
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,979
and because I have access to power tools, it did not take long, right?

268
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,909
Because I had to cut through some pretty thick wood, you know,

269
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,799
and doing it by hand with a chisel or whatever would have taken forever.

270
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,590
But with a power drill and a Sawzall,

271
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:48,969
I

272
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,979
basically made a rectangle hole in the side of my house in like five minutes.

273
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:52,580
Right.

274
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,760
You know, it was lovely and it was the right size and I, you know,

275
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,429
I had to use a chisel for a bit of it and basically

276
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,299
the chisel removed 5% of the material and took half an hour,

277
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:05,820
you know, to get it nice and clean. But the point is I, I'm for tools

278
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,000
that

279
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,960
help people.

280
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,950
But the problem is we're now getting into that a IML space of,

281
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,739
you know, rather than like lane assist where, oh you,

282
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,460
you seem to be drifting outside your lane.

283
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,659
You know, I'm gonna beep at you.

284
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,650
It's like, no, no, you can just fall asleep. I'm gonna keep the road.

285
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,619
Uh I'm gonna keep on the road until we get to Calgary and it'll be fine, take a nap.

286
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,549
And, and that's kind of my fear where Copilot is.

287
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,700
I thought about this actually.

288
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,460
And, and I, I don't, I think you're wrong

289
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,390
and

290
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,520
here's what I was, I was thinking about this exact thing actually, not,

291
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,750
not two hours ago while I was reading some, some documentation on this.

292
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:46,049
And I think here's the trick is,

293
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,950
let's say I wrote a tool that could

294
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,450
identify security vulnerabilities while you are typing,

295
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,630
right? While developers are developing,

296
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,229
is that valuable?

297
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,359
I don't know it, it it is

298
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,460
but not, not super valuable.

299
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,429
But now I build the tool that I can say your developers can

300
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
write three times as much code in the same amount of time.

301
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,169
Is that valuable? Yes, hugely valuable. So if you look at the economics of this

302
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,440
writing a tool that does secure stuff at the moment

303
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,979
is less valuable than writing a tool that

304
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:22,039
appears to increase productivity by several magnitudes.

305
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:22,900
One comment,

306
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,900
I love that appears to increase productivity because

307
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,159
here's my other thought is I'm not,

308
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:27,429
no,

309
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,859
no, exactly I'm saying appears to increase because you know,

310
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,559
you get more lines of code out of your developers.

311
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,590
That's progress, right? But here's my concern with copilot is

312
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,979
that people are having codes suggested to them,

313
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:41,280
how many of them actually will take the time to

314
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,080
truly understand the code that is being suggested to them?

315
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,979
I I would assume not very many.

316
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:50,599
And in all seriousness, I think with a tool like this, the expectation should exist

317
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,960
of, I don't need to pay attention. The tool should do the right thing.

318
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,190
-- It doesn't, but it should
-- spell check is a perfect example of this.

319
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,080
How many people use spell check but get which, which is which incorrect.

320
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,289
-- It
-- doesn't matter. We figure

321
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,830
out

322
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,010
there's my favorite. Yeah, I

323
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:06,880
mean

324
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,299
like that's a great example though. OK. So let's let's look at spell check, right?

325
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,520
When we were young,

326
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:16,590
we would use Microsoft Word on our computers and we had like six floppy disks because

327
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:20,419
-- you had to keep lots of backups because there was no version anything in these
-- files.

328
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,549
If you turn your computer off, that file was gone,

329
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:23,349
-- it was
-- gone

330
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,049
and we had a spell checker and it was dumb and it screwed up a lot.

331
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:27,500
But whatever,

332
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,820
it was still better than whatever the nonsensical

333
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,890
English that comes out of my fingers was.

334
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,119
Now, if we look at something like Google Docs today,

335
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,020
Google Docs now has a suggester that looks at the grammar you're using

336
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:41,320
and you can catch things like the wrong there.

337
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,320
And I think this is kind of a similar thing is it is a

338
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,479
the first step in a long road of progress that,

339
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,479
that I think will get us there eventually.

340
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,880
But this is where we have to start.

341
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,369
For example,

342
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,190
I've started using grammarly and while it is

343
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,479
significantly better than say Google's or Microsoft's stuff,

344
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,880
I mean, I would hope so.

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,479
It's still kind of

346
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,280
comically, some bad English is coming out of it.

347
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,979
Like some of the suggestions it's making are I'm looking at this and

348
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:11,349
I'm not sure I'm pretty sure that's not correct.

349
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,340
But the difference being and you know, I tweeted about this,

350
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,880
humans are fantastically fuzzy.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,830
Can parse English wrong order of Jedi,

352
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,909
Jedi,

353
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,780
nonsensical santa words and still sense to understand

354
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,280
what I was trying to get across,

355
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:26,679
right?

356
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,510
That like that pile of word soup is understandable to people.

357
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,289
Whereas if you type that into your code editor,

358
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,630
your compiler is going to barf on it or you miss a

359
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,982
or a semicolon or an equal sign.

360
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:40,752
So I think fundamentally the auto suggesting code, see,

361
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:43,903
here's the thing that kind of drives me nuts is we actually have a well

362
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:47,723
established way of suggesting people use code and

363
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,583
don't write it themselves and it's libraries.

364
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,783
-- No, that's not comparable. No, no,
-- no.

365
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,732
The majority of programming nowadays is basically

366
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,622
gluing a bunch of stuff together for most

367
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,736
us, a lot of it is. I agree.

368
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:03,195
Well, and look, the end state of this is going to be where I say hello, computer.

369
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:06,216
I need an application that lets someone type in their personal

370
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:09,755
information and then stores it inside of a SQL database.

371
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,075
So that's already happening.

372
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,435
It's getting, I know,

373
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,156
I know there's certain things that do it and we're not talking about that today.

374
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,596
But like that's obviously the end state of this

375
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:18,960
because

376
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,909
I don't think copilot to the best of my knowledge understands intent yet.

377
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:29,229
-- But it is no doubt on that path. Again,
-- we're there's natural language to contract

378
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,710
software for smart contracts where you literally can express

379
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,140
a contract in Natural English and then it converts it into

380
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,169
chain code.

381
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,590
-- Yeah, but that's like that's like asking a genie for a wish, right. Pretty
-- much.

382
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,039
Yeah.

383
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,400
And, and ironically,

384
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,409
it's actually a slightly more constrained problem space than other types of code.

385
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,969
But

386
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,080
I

387
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,909
think my concern is, is I keep coming back to sort of the self driving car issue of

388
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:56,190
if you're in a partly self driving car

389
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,469
and something starts to go wrong.

390
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:02,150
Number one, you have to realize something starts to go wrong and then deal with it.

391
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,589
But because you're in a partly self driving car, you're, you're,

392
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,239
you're reading a book or something,

393
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,829
not paying attention to the fact that you're about to slam into

394
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,530
a bridge abutment or the back of a stopped fire truck.

395
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,910
And I can't help but feel that that's going

396
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,848
to be sort of the similar dynamic with this github

397
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,699
copilot of these people are going to kind of get used to it, like spell check

398
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,780
and they're going to be using correctly spelled words,

399
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,130
but the wrong words

400
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,810
maybe, I mean, look, and here is part of the difficulty in that argument is

401
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,979
a lot of people are going to write the code

402
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,969
and they're never going to touch it again because they

403
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:38,349
get a new job or they're a contractor or whatever.

404
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,790
-- You don't
-- have to leave a place to never touch your code again.

405
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,930
Uh Sometimes, you know what I mean?

406
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,390
Like, so there's an aspect of that, but here's the thing, even if you

407
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,680
are in the same job for five years,

408
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,890
you might write something and never touch it again.

409
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,109
No one might ever touch it again. You know, because you just might not find bugs in it.

410
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,359
It depends who's looking and where it is and, and how it works. And

411
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,060
so, like,

412
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,560
that's going to be one of the challenges is

413
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:05,719
even if it's output gar like is generated code

414
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:09,640
that works but is crap and is full of security issues,

415
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,770
but no one knows it's there and no one finds it

416
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,420
is, you know, that, that this is the typical if a tree falls in the forest question,

417
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,859
right.

418
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,770
I fundamentally I I want them to make the effort to build these tools,

419
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,810
but I do wonder that we're sort of

420
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,619
letting people use these tools with a false,

421
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,300
like there's no disclaimer on this tool

422
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,699
saying, you know,

423
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,800
this tool has the following side effects, you know, may cause dizziness, nausea,

424
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,219
heartburn, indigestion.

425
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,939
Well, that's because nobody dies if so, who cares?

426
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,780
So maybe that's what we need is warning labels on technology

427
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,790
to actually describe accurately what the technology is capable of.

428
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,550
But I don't care if it doesn't kill me, do I care?

429
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,349
I mean, that's how, that's how it works.

430
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,140
-- I
-- mean, people are going to use this to crank out way more lines of code faster. And

431
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:59,140
yeah, that's for a lot of people that's kind of their metric.

432
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,709
-- Right. Right. Exactly.
-- Churning out stuff

433
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:07,239
and finding security vulnerabilities. Like like now I will say there is a lot of

434
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,560
interesting happenings in the space of standard code analysis,

435
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:15,400
composition analysis library use copy and paste all of that stuff.

436
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,479
So

437
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,219
I think this all goes hand in hand.

438
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,119
But then you also need some sort of checker to make

439
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,630
sure that copilot and the human aren't going off the rails,

440
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,949
but we're not quite there.

441
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:29,709
-- Everything is too new to be working together in tandem correctly.
-- What did I find?

442
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,890
Really fascinating is

443
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,930
how much software do you think

444
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,719
is essentially being

445
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,109
written as a result of not invented here syndrome?

446
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,689
Like essentially how much software is being written

447
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:46,650
for which there is a perfectly good, probably even open source free

448
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,050
solution that

449
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,810
will get you 90% or even 100% of the way there.

450
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,040
See, this is what I always wonder about is I see, like

451
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,510
I looked at the skater industry a while ago,

452
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,469
I was trying to figure out how big is the skate industry.

453
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,760
And as far as I can tell,

454
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,989
there's over 1000 companies globally writing skater products

455
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:07,140
and the pattern seems to be is a company will start out small,

456
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,089
have one or two big customers that kind of keep

457
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:13,089
them afloat and they'll grow to a couple 100 people.

458
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,109
And then, you know,

459
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,300
essentially move from sort of a consulting to the more software side of things

460
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,910
and boom, there's, you know,

461
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,439
a big pile of software running a couple of

462
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:24,010
oil refineries or beer breweries or factories or whatever.

463
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:27,449
And then typically, once they get big enough, they get acquired by a,

464
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,130
like a Honeywell because,

465
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,709
well, how else is Honeywell going to grow their customer base? Right?

466
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,609
Like SK a software, you know, is a lead time of a decade.

467
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,920
You know, you don't just decide, hey,

468
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,650
we're going to upgrade our oil refinery software because you just don't,

469
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,729
that's not how that works.

470
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,619
-- Just do it on Saturday.
-- It'll be fine. Yeah,

471
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,010
just when nobody's in

472
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,880
and like,

473
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,040
while I do want millions of people to

474
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,219
be programming and coding and having cool ideas,

475
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:51,439
right?

476
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:54,400
Like we come from the open source world, that's how this happened.

477
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,989
You know, let 1000 flowers bloom.

478
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,719
I do wonder though sometimes how much of this stuff is just being

479
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,599
reinvented and rewritten poorly.

480
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,560
Well, some of it, I mean, look, you can look at like N PM, right?

481
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,760
There's what 18 million N PM modules. Now,

482
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,319
how many of those are duplicates? I bet a lot of them are.

483
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:18,089
And does it matter? I mean, I don't know, I, I wonder this a lot because

484
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:22,329
you can make the argument that everyone should be trying to reuse everything

485
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,910
and I

486
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:28,869
think that's reasonable in a lot of ways. But then you also get the argument of OK.

487
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,859
So I'm using this left shift library from N PM and then the

488
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,619
developer got mad and deleted it and now everything I have broke,

489
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,420
you know what I mean?

490
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,199
Yeah.

491
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,060
Well, and in theory,

492
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:43,079
you should be using tools and build systems that are OK with say something

493
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,680
disappearing for whatever reason.

494
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:48,300
That's another story. Like we talked about that with Dan

495
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:51,989
-- last week. Was it last week? I feel like it was two years ago
-- but

496
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,839
the perception of time

497
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,359
is,

498
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:54,540
oh, I

499
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,599
know, I know.

500
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,640
But, but right, I mean, these are, these are,

501
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,989
I feel like so here's kind of how I will bring us home on this one is

502
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,863
I think all of these things we keep talking but all of the open source supply chain,

503
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:08,483
all of the dependency stuff, all of the autopilot stuff,

504
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,233
all of the code scanning everything.

505
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:15,142
I feel like we are approaching this nexus point where we're starting to recognize

506
00:22:15,243 --> 00:22:18,692
these are all the same problem. They just don't look like it.

507
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:18,812
This,

508
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:23,192
this feels like in in physics how when Einstein managed to like

509
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:27,103
bring all of physics together into one coherent thing and everyone's like,

510
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,233
oh I get it now.

511
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,512
They're all the same. Like I feel like

512
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,975
software development is is doing this

513
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,265
where everything is, is starting to come together.

514
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,786
I don't know where it's going to end,

515
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,245
but I feel like it's coming,

516
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:42,345
I keep coming back to all these economic incentives where when I,

517
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,845
when I look at stuff through the lens of what are the incentives.

518
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:45,196
It's like, oh,

519
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,566
this suddenly makes sense and all the

520
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:49,416
human behavior is explicable and predictable,

521
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:49,566
right?

522
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,026
And see that's the thing I love about science.

523
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,265
Not only do I explain what's currently going on.

524
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:57,066
I can then make predictions about the future and see if they're correct or not

525
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,000
and then adjust right,

526
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,800
and being able to make predictions about the future kind of a useful thing.

527
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:03,250
So

528
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:04,800
I, I feel like

529
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,619
the reality is

530
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,020
everything is software.

531
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,829
That's it. Right. That, that's a done deal.

532
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:14,650
And so that means we need to write lots and lots of software.

533
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,180
What does that look like? How does that happen?

534
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:21,780
And, and I think that's where like right now there's tons of companies reproducing

535
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,420
things poorly

536
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,619
and

537
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,119
well, the, the market is big enough to absorb that right now.

538
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,760
But I just,

539
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,229
I sometimes wonder what things would look like if there was a more

540
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:36,229
open source usage and acceptance rather than writing all this junk internally.

541
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:40,239
Everyone's using open source for like everything.

542
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,635
I don't know, open source usage and acceptance could be any higher than it is today,

543
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:47,824
but there's still a lot of not invented here syndrome.

544
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:48,535
Right.

545
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:53,505
That's never going to go away. I mean, I've known people acting like that.

546
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,824
Well, exactly. And, and so my question is why,

547
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,415
well, because of humans, man, I mean,

548
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:01,574
I know people that have acted like that in literally every industry,

549
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:02,824
every place I've ever been,

550
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,170
every club, everyone

551
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,689
where there are people who just have this attitude of,

552
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,790
there's no way someone else could do this as good as me.

553
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,869
And that's what it really comes down to I mean,

554
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
I remember suffering from this greatly when I was young,

555
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,750
that perception of control.

556
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,900
-- Well,
-- I don't even think that man, I mean,

557
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,310
I remember being surrounded by people that were like, oh, we're smarter than them.

558
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,060
Let's do it

559
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:25,892
the right way.

560
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:28,902
And in hindsight, it's like no, like by definition,

561
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,963
if you say that you've proven you're not,

562
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,083
but when you're young, you're like, yeah,

563
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:36,012
I can do this better and the reality was

564
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,802
-- no, he couldn't.
-- Well, that speaks to Dunning Kruger, right?

565
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:42,522
That generally speaking, the smarter and more people actually know about a topic.

566
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,483
The more that they say, I don't know

567
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,032
everything about this topic because they

568
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:51,456
-- understand how big the topic is.
-- My, my other favorite one is where it's like, oh,

569
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:54,605
I can write that software and I'll make it better.

570
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:57,755
Ignoring the fact that these people spent five years working on features

571
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,936
and bugs and I'm going to do it in two weeks.

572
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,296
No, I'm not.

573
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,776
I've always loved the people who are like, I can,

574
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,875
I can rewrite that entire thing in a weekend

575
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:09,245
-- and get the basics up and running. And it's like, no,
-- you can't.

576
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:13,215
I mean, I used to think like that. I remember when I was young.

577
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:14,936
I would be like, oh, I can do this in a week

578
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:16,339
and it's like, no,

579
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,300
you can't.

580
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,609
But do we need a university level course on this?

581
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,910
Similar to how, for example,

582
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,890
geologists have a course that teaches them how to

583
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,689
think about time in geological time scales which,

584
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:29,680
like I've looked at that and I, I,

585
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,229
I fundamentally get that. I don't get it.

586
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,369
Like I cannot think in terms of millions or billions of years and what that means.

587
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:37,050
Right.

588
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:40,489
Whereas geologists have to learn that as part of their thing and

589
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,650
maybe that's something we need to start teaching

590
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,750
people is the scale of software because again,

591
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,050
the scale is a big thing too, right?

592
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,920
How many people,

593
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,290
you know, you can write a very simplistic web server and oh, what was that?

594
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:53,339
The person was going?

595
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:56,880
Oh, it only, oh, it was the DNS resolver in, I think Alpine Linux, whatever.

596
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,689
It only supports

597
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:02,680
uh UDP, not TCP. So it can't handle large responses that have to be sent as TCP.

598
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:03,770
And it's kind of like,

599
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,380
yeah, I mean, if I could write a DNS resolver that doesn't do TCP/IP.

600
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,500
Yeah, I could probably crank one out relatively quickly.

601
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,430
But, oh, you want me to support all the bits of DNS,

602
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,859
including DNS sec.

603
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,939
I know enough about this to know that the answer is no, Kurt can't do that.

604
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:22,170
Well, in, in DNS is probably what, like 30 RFC S you have to read. At

605
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:23,930
least

606
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,430
I think it's around 100 now.

607
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,380
-- That could
-- be all right.

608
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,390
So you mentioned a university course and there's a good comparison to this I think.

609
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,939
And I would say it's uh physics versus engineering

610
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:34,939
where

611
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,939
physicists deal with, we'll say the, the theory and concepts of the universe,

612
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:42,180
engineers have to actually deal with the

613
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:44,540
constraints and realities of the universe.

614
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,619
It's like spherical cows and the old jokes, right? And

615
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,810
I think computer science is kind of similar where

616
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,569
if you go to college for computer science,

617
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:54,130
you, you don't learn how to build software,

618
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:58,699
you learn about like the weird fundamentals of things like algorithm design.

619
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:02,180
I mean, I remember taking computer science courses when I was at university and

620
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:06,670
I'm like, I don't care about big O notation. Like, I, it doesn't matter. Right.

621
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,199
And the professor of course, would get very upset.

622
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:12,119
But it's like in my world it didn't matter because I just

623
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,790
used a library that had a short function built into it.

624
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,229
Right.

625
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:19,469
But when you're a computer scientist, that's a great thing to think about and solve.

626
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,910
Well, I think it's one of those things where it doesn't matter until it does matter.

627
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,750
But

628
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:23,969
the

629
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,670
people. Exactly. And that's the,

630
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,670
that's smart,

631
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,260
you know, and it's like my car,

632
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,500
my car has a whole bunch of parts in it that I can't even begin to understand.

633
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:34,290
Cool.

634
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,260
I just order them online and, you know, the mechanic shoves them in when they break.

635
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,589
Right. Pretty much. I don't know.

636
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,550
I think definitely people having maybe an

637
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,119
appreciation for the complexity and difficulty and

638
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,290
the design trade offs and decisions that

639
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,750
were made and maybe making those more public

640
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:50,589
might help.

641
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:54,030
Well, I think a lot of software, especially in open source, you can,

642
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,500
you can make these as you can figure this out by

643
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,859
looking at commit history and bugs and things like that.

644
00:27:58,869 --> 00:27:59,270
I mean,

645
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,180
I think what you just said though, applies to a copilot is, it's a magic box.

646
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:06,739
Like here's something in that in the paper that will obviously be in the show notes.

647
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,390
So

648
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,869
they basically tried to get whole pilot to complete a function,

649
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:14,449
then they waited a little while and they did it again and

650
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,979
the code was different and they gave it the same inputs,

651
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:17,530
which I mean,

652
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,729
this is how A I and ML work for anyone who understands how models grow and evolve.

653
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:25,020
-- But like think about
-- that well and also as systems get updated,

654
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:28,579
right? Because it's updating itself on new code and everything.

655
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:34,540
-- But
-- the point is this is a magic black box that I have no idea what's going on.

656
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,339
Well, but I would also point out if it spat out the same code consistently,

657
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,400
then that means the system is not improving or evolving because

658
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,010
it's definitely not got the right answer the first time around.

659
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,599
I'm not saying there's a problem with it, spitting out different code.

660
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:50,630
I'm going to hope the second code was better than the first.

661
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,689
I, I don't know because I haven't tried this particular experiment.

662
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,609
But the point is though

663
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,069
it's completely magic and why did it change? Is it better?

664
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,400
Is it work like, you know what I mean?

665
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,010
This is what makes a system like this just so terrifying

666
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,709
is the fact that we have no idea what's going on.

667
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,329
I mean, here,

668
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,270
here's a thought experiment that's completely not out

669
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,650
of the question is what if a company

670
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:17,160
that has a, a solution that has say a free library that you can then

671
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,290
pay to upgrade

672
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,089
into some commercial features

673
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:21,310
and they go to github

674
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:23,160
and they're like, here's a couple of million bucks.

675
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,790
We want you to make sure you suggest our library

676
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,520
when people try to solve this problem.

677
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:27,810
Well,

678
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,420
I'm assuming that there's going to be organic se search engine optimization

679
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,160
style attempts at this kind of thing because there's money there,

680
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,699
honestly.

681
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:37,400
Yes, I hadn't even thought of that. But yes, absolutely.

682
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,520
Well, there's money there. So there's an incentive for people to do this.

683
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,760
So I'm going to make a prediction that when

684
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,640
you incentivize people to do stuff with money,

685
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:45,930
they go and do it.

686
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,540
-- That's not a prediction. That's reality. Well,
-- and yet we have so many

687
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,540
things where people are like, why do people do that?

688
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,859
It's like because they get paid to

689
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,739
like all that Russian trolling online. Why? Well, because

690
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,260
the government pays those people to troll us and

691
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,699
you know, take sheep de

692
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:02,300
wormer.

693
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,900
Yeah, I hadn't even thought of that, but you're right there, there,

694
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,839
there are going to be ways

695
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,640
to trick. I don't know if trick is the right word, but we'll say coerce

696
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,954
A to like autopilot. I mean, it is a black box. We have no idea how it works.

697
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:16,314
But I mean, think about Google, right.

698
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:18,655
We technically don't know how their algorithm works yet.

699
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:22,214
There's an awful lot of seo companies that seem to do pretty good, you know,

700
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,175
you can do black box testing, right?

701
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:27,685
And the beauty is with something like the Google search engine optimization.

702
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:32,915
You have very clear output metrics of more or less search results.

703
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,724
You know what I mean? You, you find out pretty quickly if it works or not.

704
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:38,064
And so you just, yeah, you just plug away at it and, and

705
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:39,194
keep trying

706
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,390
totally.

707
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,109
I, I think these are, I, I like the idea of technology moving forwards,

708
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,719
but I think for me,

709
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:49,790
the biggest thing is I come back to this kind of auto uh self driving car concept of

710
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:50,829
it

711
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:54,439
needs to maybe be very explicit and clear of what it is

712
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:57,489
and is not capable of so that people use it correctly.

713
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,670
And the reality is having said that I know that 99% of people

714
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,829
don't read the ingredients list on the food they eat.

715
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,630
Of course not. Why would I So,

716
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:05,319
yeah.

717
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,650
Anyway.

718
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,140
All right. II, I feel like once again

719
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,260
I know less than I did

720
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,530
before we started this conversation.

721
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,079
Oh, I guess we'll, we'll have to wait and see. All right, I'm calling it.
