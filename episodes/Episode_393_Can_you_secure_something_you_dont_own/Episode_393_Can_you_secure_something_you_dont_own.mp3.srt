Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,560
and my partner in Hating but loving printers. Josh

2
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,010
-- Reser,
-- nobody loves printers. Kurt. Literally nobody.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,370
Well, this is true, but we do love printed material. No,

4
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,309
no, I don't. Ebooks, ebooks all the way.

5
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,760
-- I hate paper.
-- So

6
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,590
I, I tried going paperless

7
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,940
and I have a Kindle and all those things.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,580
And for example, I just took out the New York Times recipe book from the library and a

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,029
day after having taken out from the library ordered a copy on Amazon.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,549
Um, it's exactly 1000 pages long

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,700
and it's a lovely thick book with tons of recipes in history and it's

12
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,750
a wonderful read and I want to be able to write in it.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,220
And that's fair

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:46,889
and see.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,770
And that's the use case I keep coming back to is so I have had an ipad Pro, an ipad

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,360
A

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,139
uh I have a Microsoft Surface Pro, beautiful touchscreen and pen, by the way,

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,439
like amazing hardware.

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,819
I have a remarkable, I

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:00:59,599
do

21
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:00,880
-- have a
-- remarkable,

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,709
wonderful hardware.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,120
Most God, awful, terrible software.

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,879
I found I don't enjoy writing like with a pen on any device ever.

25
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:13,440
-- It just, it, it doesn't
-- remarkable is about the closest it's the,

26
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,279
the feel the texture is

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:15,589
damn

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:15,879
pretty

29
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:16,440
paper.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:16,769
But

31
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:17,089
I

32
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:17,569
still

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,199
don't like it.

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,480
It's,

35
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:22,029
it's as close as you're going to get to using a good roller ball on 20 pound paper.

36
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,169
That's

37
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:23,430
right.

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:23,809
You

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,099
know,

40
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,239
and I've tried all of these things with the correct software

41
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,339
to read and annotate and make notes on PDF S and,

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,970
well, as you can see, there's,

43
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,610
there's a bunch of printed material behind me and some red pens.

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,330
-- Can
-- I see printed material

45
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,900
-- and those in the boxes,
-- which way does my finger move?

46
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,650
There we go.

47
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,459
-- Sorry. The whole mirror thing is very confusing.
-- It is, it's lovely because

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:45,739
it's me

49
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:45,919
and

50
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:49,000
-- oh, it's me.
-- Everyone can see what you're doing. It's fine.

51
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,870
-- Yeah. So,
-- but that's the thing, right? Like people like

52
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,489
coloring pages,

53
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,970
like you want a coloring page for a little kid to color in it. Just papers

54
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,089
that's a valid use of paper. But from my personal perspective,

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,400
I have done everything I can to rid my life of paper.

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
Now. Now, actually I have a project I'm working on.

57
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,550
I'm doing some cowboy engineering and we'll talk

58
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,720
about it at some point in the future.

59
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:12,910
Engineering. Yeah.

60
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,149
It's where you just go off and do something on your own without

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,279
telling anyone and then you show up one day and you're like,

62
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,910
didn't I do a good job, everyone

63
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,850
I wasn't sure if it was like a cowboy

64
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,399
related.

65
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:21,800
It's

66
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,970
not a

67
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,660
cowboy. I don't like cowboys either. But that's another story. Anyway.

68
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,309
I actually took out paper

69
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:30,296
at one point because I was trying to figure out some,

70
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,035
I was wiring some things up and I needed a schematic

71
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:34,735
and I took out a sheet of paper

72
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:36,615
and I wrote it down

73
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,686
and it ii, I could have done it on a computer,

74
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:43,016
but I'm completely confident I cut my time in half by using a sheet of paper

75
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,535
because I could look at it and touch it and poke at it with a pen.

76
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:48,895
So it has value. But from my perspective, I detest paper

77
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,531
and I do whatever I can to rid myself of it.

78
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,582
I bought a ton of devices. I bought software.

79
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,932
I forced myself to use them and yet here I am.

80
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,352
And now the good news is

81
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:58,852
there are still,

82
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,212
you know what, this totally reminds me of is the whole,

83
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,792
whenever people start discussing TV.

84
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:02,942
S

85
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,442
and what is the solution to TV.

86
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,692
S nowadays, the solution is you buy the dumbest TV,

87
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,492
you can and don't plug it into the network.

88
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:08,811
Yeah.

89
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,832
-- That's right.
-- Right. And,

90
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:14,421
and if you want like, fancy stuff, you plug an Apple TV into it, which is

91
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,492
the, it's

92
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,022
the least worst

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,380
experience.

94
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,500
It's a pretty good experience. I'm happy with my decision to do that.

95
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,580
I have an LG TV.

96
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:28,330
And it's funny because I bought the LG TV and they had like, the LG operating system,

97
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,050
whatever they web OS or whatever they call it.

98
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,820
And I was like, I'm gonna give this a go

99
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,660
and I made it less than one day.

100
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,809
Well, my favorite thing is I have, I actually,

101
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
oh, it's high sense. I bought it from Costco.

102
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,899
The Apple TV. Turns on the TV.

103
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,740
That's normal.

104
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,869
-- Now, that's called CE C and
-- then, so the TV pops up the Roku interface saying,

105
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:50,500
oh,

106
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,899
I can't see anything input wise. You should try out the Roku experience

107
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,179
and then wait, forces me to wait like five seconds and it's like, oh,

108
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,740
I can see the apple TV.

109
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,470
Let me

110
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,860
go to that.

111
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,220
That's miserable.

112
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,279
And I'm like, so every time I turn on the TV, through the apple TV, I'm just like,

113
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:07,699
I hate you.

114
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,309
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. OK? And I, and

115
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,139
like,

116
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,800
I just wish I could disable that and just be like,

117
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,570
just be a dumb TV with an HDM I input and

118
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,760
a audio out to the sound bar. That's all I want.

119
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,440
I'm pretty sure this is a glitch,

120
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,779
you know what I mean? Making air quotes and, but that's how I feel about printers now.

121
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,700
So like with printers, my rules are OK.

122
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,100
It has to support printing from the network,

123
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:33,679
especially wireless because I want my mobile devices to be able to print to it,

124
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:34,709
right?

125
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,279
Uh number two. It has to do duplex both sides.

126
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,200
I do like that feature because you waste a lot less paper. Uh

127
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah.

128
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:44,440
Uh number three and this is an absolute deal breaker.

129
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,850
-- Laser jet or GTFO,
-- I agree with that. I will never buy ink jet.

130
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,399
-- Well,
-- and see what I love about inkjet is there's three use cases for inkjets.

131
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,079
You either print a lot in which case you're paying a horrific per page

132
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,019
cost and you should buy a

133
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,559
laser jet, right?

134
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,989
You print a medium amount, in which case you pay a horrific amount

135
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,690
and you should buy a laser jet.

136
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,899
And then my favorite use case is you print very little.

137
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,230
So the ink cartridges dry up and you have to throw them out and buy new ones

138
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,559
every 12 months. That's

139
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,339
right. Exactly. In which case, you should buy a laser jet

140
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,660
like. And the upfront cost of a laser jet is horrifying, especially for color.

141
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,260
It is, it's terrible. Even buying toner is terrible. It's very expensive.

142
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:28,859
The toner won't dry out well. Right. I know that,

143
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,579
you know, it's the, it's the Terry Pratchett boot story, right.

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,160
Where

145
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,100
if you can buy the expensive boots,

146
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:38,790
they last for 10 years and the cheap boots only last for one year.

147
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,850
So you have to buy 10 pairs over 10 years

148
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,609
or you buy the expensive boots that also fall apart.

149
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:44,470
That's how the

150
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:48,010
pictures work now anyway. Ok. So the, the actual topic

151
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,890
that we've not even touched on yet is the question of, can you own

152
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:54,506
anything anymore?

153
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,895
And I think printers are a good way to frame

154
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,376
this because it's clear none of us own our printers

155
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:00,635
and also our TV. S

156
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:03,656
because the TV is such a horrific experience.

157
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:06,545
We all hate it and yet we have to deal with

158
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:08,776
it because I don't have the option to disable this.

159
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,466
I don't have control of my TV.

160
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:14,671
I, I was, I forget what I was on something, maybe, maybe le me or something.

161
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,532
But anyway,

162
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:19,622
there is a display type. I think they're called commercial displays.

163
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:25,402
That's just a T VA dumb TV, basically. But they're, they're like four times the price

164
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:28,082
they are made to be on for like 24 7,

165
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:31,101
which I do feel like is a use case my Children have given the TV,

166
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:32,721
by just never turned it off.

167
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,231
But

168
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,101
so, but this, this actually is the same thing. It's

169
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,361
do I actually

170
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,799
own my printer? Well, my printer, I have to plug into the network.

171
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,970
Although to be fair, I've actually, I

172
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,760
don't think I've actually ever upgraded the firmware on that thing

173
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,420
in the probably half decade I've owned it.

174
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,000
So, could somebody break into it? Well, if they get through my

175
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,839
-- nap device? Sure. Probably.
-- I think my printer auto updated itself.

176
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,750
But I'm certain it hasn't, it's been EOL for like,

177
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,980
literally five or more years at this point.

178
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:03,519
So,

179
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,190
yeah. Anyway,

180
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,309
but look, it's not just printers, right? You've got like TV. S are a good example.

181
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,029
My phone is one of my favorites.

182
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,390
Like, do I own my, my phone or does Apple technically own my phone?

183
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,739
I think Apple probably owns it.

184
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,570
Well, you legally own your phone but Apple has control of it. That's true. They do.

185
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,910
And I think that's an important distinction. Is this the legal distinction of

186
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,790
ownership versus control. Like and

187
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,730
traditionally, that line has been very clear like I am renting a car.

188
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,410
So or a better example, I am renting an apartment.

189
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,079
So I do not own the apartment.

190
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,119
But legally,

191
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,000
I have rights like you can't just come in as

192
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,320
a landlord with unless it's an emergency or something.

193
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:53,149
But there's been traditionally very clear lines between ownership and control,

194
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,420
right? Rental cars, apartments, all these things.

195
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:59,079
But now those lines are completely gone with things like your printer, your phone,

196
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,160
your like I have a dumb washer dryer behind me here.

197
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,279
So I own them

198
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,239
straight up. But there's no questions because there's no networking.

199
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,869
There's no like the the software on that thing is very rudimentary.

200
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,750
You know, it just plays a little tune when it's finished,

201
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,709
which I managed to finally disable.

202
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,750
It was like,

203
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,040
and I'm like, oh my God, I hate this.

204
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:19,500
But now a modern washer dryer are going to be like, hey,

205
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,049
I need to access the Wi Fi so I can get like software updates and,

206
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,299
and show you how close your laundry is being done to,

207
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,220
you know, on your phone, on the app. That's terrible.

208
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,049
Right. So, you want to know? It's funny when I bought my last washer and dryer,

209
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,140
the brand in all the laundromats is called Speed Queen.

210
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:42,890
And it's, it's very high end machinery. It's, it's like double the price of normal.

211
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,489
-- It's industrial commercial. But
-- they, yeah, but they last, like, forever.

212
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,690
And there's basically like zero computers in this thing. It's lovely.

213
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:53,599
This is an interesting example of the difference between commercial grade,

214
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,359
industrial grade versus consumer grade, which is commercial,

215
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,539
industrial grade equipment typically makes money.

216
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,729
Like a laundromat dryer is making money.

217
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,757
My dryer is just drying my clothes,

218
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,536
-- not making me money.
-- Well, it's sitting unused most of the time.

219
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,437
But so the interesting is because the commercial

220
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,937
stuff and industrial stuff is making money.

221
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,117
It has a higher duty cycle obviously

222
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,697
because like if a machine can literally print money for you, then

223
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,007
you want to run it 24 7, right?

224
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,697
Without interruption and without, and so if it breaks,

225
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,656
you want to be able to fix it very quickly and

226
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:26,734
easily.

227
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:30,213
And again, that's a major difference between a lot of commercial grade equipment

228
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:33,484
and consumer grade equipment. Consumer grade equipment is glued together

229
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,143
with like those plastic catches and everything. And

230
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,523
commercial grade equipment. You got a bunch of torque bolts,

231
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,133
torques,

232
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:44,424
bolts that like pop out in like 30 seconds and the whole thing just blows apart.

233
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,343
Well, and not only that,

234
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,473
so this is an interesting point you bring up and

235
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,283
this kind of comes to what I'm thinking about,

236
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:49,854
like, can you see

237
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,310
or something you don't own

238
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,231
in the commercial space? And even to, I'm sorry, in the, in the

239
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,440
not commercial, in the, what is the non commercial residential?

240
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,231
Would that be the right word? Consumer? Space,

241
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,551
consumer? Ok. Consumer.

242
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,210
-- Because
-- you're just consuming it and it's a dead end like it just, that's fair.

243
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,140
That's true.

244
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,911
It's very much. I feel like a race to the bottom, right?

245
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:13,991
Where price is often the driver behind all of this

246
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:18,000
and you look at commercial and there's return on investment is what's looked at.

247
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,590
Right? So when you're talking about

248
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,010
racing to the bottom,

249
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,549
it's all about how do we make it as cheap

250
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,890
as possible and somehow make money on it later.

251
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,770
-- And this is where like ads and TV s and all that kind of crap comes up. That's where
-- TV.

252
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,750
S make their money.

253
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,390
Like TV. S are a solved problem.

254
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,010
If you build TV, S

255
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,710
and screens and software,

256
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,390
you have 1020 50 competitors

257
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,469
and it's the margins are like 1 to 3%.

258
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:45,760
So the only way to make any extra money is to like load bloatware on it. Right.

259
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,549
-- Same thing with Android phones.
-- Oh, my goodness, you're right. It's bloatware.

260
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,159
I never even thought of it. Like that. But you're right. It's bloatware.

261
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,729
Yes. What else is it?

262
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:53,690
I don't know.

263
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,179
It's bloatware that somebody somewhere hopes that some

264
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,289
schmuck is gonna accidentally subscribe and forget to unsubscribe

265
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:03,049
-- and pay 20 bucks a month. I mean,
-- you're right. That's,

266
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,489
I mean, remember when all the computers, when you buy a computer in, like the 2000

267
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,534
and it would just come with the dumbest stuff on it, like, obnoxious, horrible,

268
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:12,525
ridiculous things.

269
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,424
That's a TV now. Oh, my goodness.

270
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,544
I ran NT four on my desktop and it was glorious

271
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:20,205
because it came on a bunch of floppy or a CD

272
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:23,744
3.51. But I would install NT four and be like,

273
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:24,625
ok.

274
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,700
Yeah, I remember that.

275
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,799
I, I did the same thing because it, it was, well, it was for businesses. Right.

276
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,099
So it was more expensive. Why did I even have a, I

277
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,659
don't remember how I got a copy. I had a legal copy of NT four. I know that I remember.

278
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:42,820
I acquired it somewhere but, and I got it really cheap. But anyway, anyway. Ok. Ok.

279
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,900
So that's, oh, man, this is a good point.

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Oh, you know what?

281
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,539
I, sorry, I was just digging through my print interface.

282
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,219
It's been updating itself because it's running firmware from, uh,

283
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,179
two months ago.

284
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,150
Oh, that's pretty good. I know.

285
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,799
Mine, mine,

286
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,070
-- mine had auto updates on and I know they haven't been updated in forever
-- and the

287
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,010
thing is I did a ton of research and I bought an HP Laser Jet,

288
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:00,820
but

289
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:04,450
I don't need to run software on my devices to print to

290
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,690
because I am not installing that 400 megabyte monstrosity of crap.

291
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,159
I did the same thing because my printer has it,

292
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,770
it literally runs cups in the background

293
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,830
and so I can just connect to the IP P port

294
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,729
and send it PDF S and it just prints stuff.

295
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:25,349
And so I either I either have the postscript or the PDF driver on all my gear

296
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,570
and it just works

297
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,419
and this is why I will probably never upgrade this printer either.

298
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,799
And I'm sure it's very secure.

299
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:35,340
And that leads me to the second thing, which is this printer, the toner cartridge,

300
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,260
the chip is really easy to get out and put into a new one.

301
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,159
So the toner cartridge with the chip is like 100 and 50 bucks and without it,

302
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,320
it's like 70 bucks.

303
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,520
And so I, I've got a permanent low toner warning now because it's printed

304
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:51,750
-- three toner cartridges worth
-- of 7000 pages of toner,

305
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:55,880
like more like 20. And that's the other thing is, is the consumables, right?

306
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,479
Commercial grade stuff.

307
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:00,130
They understand that they have to sell the consumables at a

308
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,840
fair price because they're gonna consume a lot of them.

309
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,280
Right. Like, if you, yeah, that's probably true.

310
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,450
As a, as a, as a consumer.

311
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,940
I, I'm, I'm dumb and I can't, I don't do a spreadsheet to compare

312
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,500
all of these things, but businesses absolutely do. That's true.

313
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,559
They know what's up. Right.

314
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,059
A business is not going to be like, well, they might be dumb enough to be like, oh, hey,

315
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,179
this printer is really cheap.

316
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,590
Yeah. Sure.

317
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,969
We'll buy that one and then, you know, they get stiffed on the,

318
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:26,070
on the consumable cost.

319
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,679
Right. Because, like,

320
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,020
I actually almost bought one of those wax printers. Have you seen those?

321
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,669
I'm, we, I'm familiar with them.

322
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,469
We had one of those when I, one of the companies I worked for,

323
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,669
basically, it would be hideously expensive upfront,

324
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,250
but

325
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,820
it would be a beautiful color printer that would do like commercial grade stuff.

326
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,789
And I would literally buy it once.

327
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,719
Oh, yeah. The images are amazing.

328
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,559
I would buy it once and I might buy some new wax in like 30 years

329
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:51,989
and that would be it.

330
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,179
I don't know if the wax goes bad. I actually, I don't remember.

331
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,500
So, the funny thing was the company I worked for,

332
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,239
they had like an ink service for the printer where we got a new box of wax,

333
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,150
like once a month.

334
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:04,969
And so they would, at one point they were like,

335
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,380
we have like 10 boxes of wax in the closet.

336
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,849
Like, if anyone needs to print a lot of something, go for it.

337
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,669
And I remember I was getting married at the time.

338
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,429
I was like, oh, I had some things I could print.

339
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,229
So

340
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,419
I, I took advantage of that.

341
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,099
But man, that was a long time ago anyway. Ok.

342
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,960
So here's the question I would like to ask.

343
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,380
Let's put this in the context of

344
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:32,739
let's pick on Windows, Microsoft Windows or let's say Mac Os, either one

345
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,780
if you do you own your computer, running Mac Os or Windows.

346
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:42,859
And I think the question is, do you, so legal ownership? Sure.

347
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,539
But do I want and have control?

348
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,359
And I would also extend this, not just to Mac Os and Windows,

349
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,679
but what about Ubuntu or Debian or Red Hat?

350
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,020
Linux?

351
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,239
How are they any different?

352
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,450
-- They're open source,
-- but they're probably not different.

353
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,179
I, I don't think you're wrong there.

354
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,099
Like I run FG

355
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,539
update and kind of hope for the best. Like, I don't

356
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:05,840
-- examine what's happening. I just,
-- so it's funny, I upgraded my computer

357
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:11,169
that I run Fedora on the machine I record on and, and, well, I didn't edit on all, all,

358
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,159
all podcast stuff.

359
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,260
So, you're on 39 now,

360
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,900
-- I guess I don't
-- even know what version it is and I don't care anymore.

361
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,039
I just upgraded constantly. I literally ran DNF dash Y upgrade.

362
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,760
Walked away to get a cup of coffee, came back,

363
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,039
rebooted and then we started recording this podcast.

364
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:26,919
So, like,

365
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:27,840
yeah,

366
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,960
a decade ago that would have been a bold move.

367
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,200
But now, like, it just works and yeah, I, I couldn't tell you what's been upgraded.

368
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,960
I have no idea.

369
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,109
No idea.

370
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,030
I didn't even look at the list of stuff

371
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,429
-- like
-- I have to upgrade a couple of V MS from open

372
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,309
to LTs to whatever 23 or something the current one is.

373
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,929
And I'm like, I have no idea what the difference is.

374
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,869
The only thing I care about is I need a newer version of PDF to text.

375
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,280
That's why I'm doing this. Sure, sure. I need some updated stuff like that. And so

376
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,479
I guess the question is, do I have control of these devices?

377
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,390
And the answer is like, no, like, uh

378
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,479
I just noticed on my phone a few weeks ago

379
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,820
that there's a new button in the control panel,

380
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,099
do like locally generated subtitles.

381
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,229
Beta, turn it on or off

382
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,700
on your phone.

383
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,219
Yeah,

384
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,960
that's a new feature in Mac Os.

385
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,020
Yeah. And you wait, I OS, you mean on phone?

386
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:16,979
-- Yeah,
-- on your Yeah, dude. Right.

387
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:21,469
But the point is like, I don't even have a clue about all these cool new features.

388
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,179
-- That's how out of control it is.
-- That's true.

389
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,179
That's a good point.

390
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,619
Here we go. And I guess then that, so here's, here's the next question that I have is so

391
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,619
if we obviously, ok, we'll, we'll ignore ownership maybe control.

392
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,739
-- I mean, I'm pretty technical too and I'm
-- like, yeah. Oh, no, no, I get that.

393
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,659
-- But how can we possibly even pretend we're securing any of this stuff?
-- Well,

394
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:44,140
I think it's a bit like

395
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,969
food safety in that.

396
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:49,340
I don't necessarily understand why I'm applying all these rules.

397
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:53,179
Like some, I do like washing my hands. I get why I wash my hands. Right. Right.

398
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,190
And I understand, for example, certain internal food temperatures. Ok.

399
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,510
Like pork to, what is it, 165 or 15 or whatever

400
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:03,135
-- temps for various foods.
-- It's on the magnet on my fridge

401
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,375
and I've double checked what's interesting.

402
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:06,954
Internal,

403
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:07,765
um,

404
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:10,114
internal meat temperatures are one of the few

405
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,515
things that multiple governments actually agree upon.

406
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,074
If you check the FDA

407
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,714
and the Canada Food Health Agency and Europe and a bunch of others,

408
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:20,795
-- they all agree. Which I find kind of interesting,
-- interesting.

409
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:25,074
-- I wonder if they have like good research behind that because
-- science,

410
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,734
because science, because there's certain parasites and bacterium and that's it.

411
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:29,425
They,

412
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,439
it's one of the few things where it's actually consistent globally.

413
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,780
Let's hope it's because of science because that's not always the case.

414
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,300
-- Like,
-- true.

415
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,160
It might just be like somebody wrote this down and, hey, that's a good number.

416
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,089
Let's use that number.

417
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,550
Then that does happen. Sometimes

418
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,290
I would say though it has to be

419
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,859
reasonably accurate because otherwise you'd hear way

420
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,410
more about outbreaks of terrible disease.

421
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:54,599
Right.

422
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,569
Well, it's, it's rare enough that they,

423
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,209
like locally right now we have a massive outbreak

424
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,969
of a really nasty strain of E coli that hit apparently a, a series of daycares

425
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,489
had a central food facility.

426
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,290
So they're pretty sure that's what did it,

427
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,930
because it's like 10 different daycares that are part of a chain

428
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,089
and there's like, over 100 kids sick, you know, over 20 in the hospital.

429
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,660
Like, it's a, it's bad and it's rare enough that it, like,

430
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,979
made the news and more importantly, like, we don't have good systems to deal with it.

431
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:21,290
Like, there's still parents who are like, oh, I,

432
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,390
I hadn't like my kid got sick and I didn't know that this was going on and

433
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,760
in my mind, I'm kind of like,

434
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,560
I feel like they should have phoned everybody,

435
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:28,199
like,

436
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,130
as a public health agency.

437
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,609
Yes. Like

438
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,290
you shouldn't do this for everything.

439
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,880
But once in a while you, you gotta work the phones and just call everybody.

440
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,589
-- I
-- mean, I don't know how that works. I,

441
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,650
-- I feel like
-- you get a list of people from the daycare and

442
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,800
you call all of them and you say if your kid is sick,

443
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,630
take him to the hospital.

444
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,219
-- No, no.
-- That, that part I get,

445
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,560
I'm trying to think if anything like that's ever. No.

446
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,660
You know what I know that like the school has called me

447
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,750
when there was a head lice outbreak when my

448
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:53,979
old

449
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:54,739
head lice,

450
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,310
I love that. They have to call for head lice but not for like an infectious disease.

451
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,079
Right?

452
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,930
There's old laws. No, because there's old laws. It's the same problem here.

453
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,979
I see, there's old laws that say you ha, like you have to call for head lice because

454
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,640
it used to be a really endemic nasty problem and funnily enough.

455
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,689
The shampoos used to work and they don't anymore.

456
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,530
-- Well, yeah, the current strain of head lice. I don't
-- know.

457
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,000
But thank goodness I escaped head lice.

458
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,410
No, the current strain of head lice that's

459
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,890
popular is, it just doesn't care about the, the shampoos anymore.

460
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,290
-- It, it out evolved it, I
-- mean that happens.

461
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:26,750
Yeah.

462
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,525
Better shampoos now.

463
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,775
Anyway. Ok. Ok. So,

464
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,015
oh man.

465
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,094
So how do we, how do we? Ok. But back to my question, how do we secure something?

466
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:38,305
-- We
-- don't, there's compensating controls there.

467
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:39,464
Hold on, hold on first.

468
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:40,775
I want to clarify that the,

469
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:43,165
the title of this episode is going to be something about

470
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,094
you can't secure what you don't own or something like that

471
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,214
or do we own anything? I don't know yet. I'll figure that out,

472
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,949
but

473
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,170
I think ownership is no longer the important point

474
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,930
about anything, right? Because I think the definition of ownership is so fuzzy now

475
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,209
that it, it muddles the conversation.

476
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,380
Yeah, we'll let, we'll let Cory doctorow answer this question.

477
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,400
But I think from our perspective it's really about,

478
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,760
can you secure a device

479
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,300
-- you don't control?
-- Yeah.

480
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,709
-- And I would say maybe even active control,
-- whatever I'm not worried about,

481
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,800
but like I don't control my operating system at the end of the day. Right.

482
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,270
I'm getting updates from Fedora. Fedora is driving the bus.

483
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,160
Ok?

484
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,689
So let me give an ex like I think this active versus passive

485
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:26,250
control might be more important than we think it is because for example,

486
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,420
I have locks on my doors

487
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,420
and I very explicitly have a biometric lock on my front door.

488
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,609
Not because I want to keep people out of my house,

489
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,589
but because I want to make sure I can let people in

490
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:40,079
and it can get over the air updates that I have to trigger. But

491
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,880
I don't know that that's the case. Like it might phone home once a month,

492
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,890
right? Versus the mechanical lock on the back door that I

493
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,329
control passively and actively,

494
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:53,089
I just can't go out and decide to do stuff the front door,

495
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,890
I am led to believe through the interface that only

496
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,229
I can trigger it to get a firmware update.

497
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,010
But for all I know it

498
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:03,880
like my HP printer here that I completely forgot was automatically uploaded,

499
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,540
-- right? Like,
-- yeah,

500
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,939
so no, I I think, I think what you're defining as active and passive,

501
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,939
I would just define as control or not control.

502
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:16,459
I would say you control the back door, you don't necessarily control the front door.

503
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:16,670
Well,

504
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,800
it's more that I have to take active measures to ensure

505
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,040
I continue to sort of control or do stuff with the device

506
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,060
because

507
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,599
like my front door lock, I have to check in, I have to update it.

508
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,969
-- I have to, I
-- assume it has a battery. Right.

509
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,130
Has batteries that have to be replaced every once in a while. Yeah.

510
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,650
But what I'm getting at basically is like,

511
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,630
there are certain things I can sort of ignore and certain

512
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,810
things where I have to actively stay up to date.

513
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,510
-- Like my phone. I, this is
-- needlessly pedantic.

514
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,560
Well, but there's like new zero days running around so I have to update my phone

515
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,189
or else I might get popped.

516
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,199
Right. Like there's that whole new pile of zero days in I OS.

517
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:56,219
And that leads to a second part of it where I have control,

518
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,439
but I have to do certain things in certain ways.

519
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:01,130
-- Or else I let's
-- rewind this whole conversation

520
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,760
because I think it's gone off the rails.

521
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,260
Here's the way I want you to think about this.

522
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,900
And here's a question I have for you ignoring that whole,

523
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,369
like there's IO a zero days or whatever,

524
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,579
you're running a computer sitting on a network

525
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,454
on that network or other devices that you have.

526
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:18,895
Absolutely no say over what they are doing,

527
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,875
your computer is running an operating system you've acquired from

528
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,895
somewhere and it's running software you've also acquired from somewhere.

529
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,324
How do we reasonably say we are

530
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:32,295
securing that computer against adversaries when we basically

531
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:38,055
have zero control over the software or the hardware that is sitting on a network,

532
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,494
we also have no control over.

533
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,349
So I think that comes to the best practices that we generally have that work,

534
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,170
which are things like doing software updates, reducing exposure where possible.

535
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,420
So for example, having firewalls or network address translation devices so that,

536
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,300
you know, I'm not like my desktop is not

537
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,155
on the internet. It is

538
00:22:58,515 --> 00:22:58,555
that

539
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,625
-- 1 92.68 dot blah, blah, blah.
-- Oh

540
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:02,395
no.

541
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:05,035
-- Now we know Kurt's IP address but for
-- example,

542
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:07,375
like like this Google home device here,

543
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,675
they have actually changed the fundamental operating system.

544
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:10,795
I remember, didn't they go from Fuchsia

545
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,165
to Android or Android to Fuchsia?

546
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:13,194
I forget which

547
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:14,334
I

548
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,104
have no say in that or I,

549
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:18,994
I don't even know what type of operating system this thing is running.

550
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,739
And so for example, this device here, it just sits there and I hope it updates.

551
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,520
-- That's it. That's all I can do
-- to.

552
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:29,390
-- Yeah, for sure.
-- My windows machine, I very religiously keep up to date.

553
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,219
And like, actually this morning,

554
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm annoyed because I had to log back in

555
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,520
and restart everything because it updated overnight and rebooted.

556
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,329
That's the right way to do it, you know.

557
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,989
And so fundamentally it just, it's kind of like having a house.

558
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,140
There's certain best practices like put locks on your doors

559
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,900
even though somebody can kick them in pretty easily.

560
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:44,959
You know,

561
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:49,060
I was just watching some Halligan Bar videos with my son last night

562
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,250
and you know, firemen take,

563
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,000
it's on average a minute seven to a minute and

564
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,300
30 seconds to get through a good dead bolt,

565
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,099
you know, on a commercial steel door.

566
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,420
No,

567
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,619
I was gonna say commercial doors. Right.

568
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,930
Whereas, like, on my door it's like they're, they're not even,

569
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,160
I don't think they're even gonna bother getting the Helian Bar out.

570
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,339
They're just gonna kick it hard.

571
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah, for sure.

572
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,709
You know, and I have like, the cameras and some lights and, you know,

573
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,900
motion sensors and crap.

574
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,010
But right

575
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,569
part of it is like your risk profile.

576
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,569
Like there's a big difference between a bank and me or

577
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:22,920
uh let's say a hypothetical casino that owns a resort

578
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,739
and, you know,

579
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,420
it has all sorts of things like room access controls

580
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,650
and like ATM S and like feeding thousands of people,

581
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:31,500
you know, in theory,

582
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,290
they would have a much better level of cybersecurity than myself.

583
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,050
Well, they might, I mean, it turns out they probably don't

584
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:42,560
for those of you not. It's still, what is it? MGM Grand got like, just completely

585
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,119
gutted,

586
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,030
like

587
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,000
-- everything broke.
-- They even had to turn the slot machines off. I, I read,

588
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:51,040
yeah, you know, it's bad when they turn off a revenue generating

589
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:51,839
device

590
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,479
-- and that's the Colonial pipeline.
-- It's amazing to me

591
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,239
the colonial pipelines hack.

592
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,880
They turned off the pipeline because they couldn't effectively bill,

593
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,579
they couldn't track what was being shipped and

594
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,510
produced and sold well and given away basically.

595
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,420
And so they turned off the pipeline. It wasn't a technical

596
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:10,099
issue. It was with

597
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:11,380
money

598
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,300
and I imagine is probably similar with the casinos because all the,

599
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,839
all that stuff is network now.

600
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,099
It's all magic.

601
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,770
Oh, yeah.

602
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,239
Wild.

603
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:21,449
And there again, like,

604
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,119
you don't, you don't own it.

605
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,680
-- Ok. Ok.
-- So,

606
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,439
and that's a perfect example. MGM Casino, you think?

607
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:27,969
Number one,

608
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:33,439
they've clearly spent a lot of money on this stuff and even they got totally pantsed,

609
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:37,709
like, not just like the slot machines got shut down or the door access got shut down,

610
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,270
but like the whole thing got messed up.

611
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,239
Yeah, like people can't even check into the rooms. It's, it's bad.

612
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,260
So, ok,

613
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,219
so,

614
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,439
I mean, that's probably an example of

615
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,310
you've, they've had to

616
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,939
basically outsource trust and I think that's the whole story here

617
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:59,199
is in the modern society just given the way everything works.

618
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:03,040
We have to outsource our trust to a degree we've never had to do before.

619
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,469
Right? Because like you put a lock on your door

620
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,369
and yeah, you can buy the expensive lock,

621
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,819
you can buy the cheap lock and there's definitely some things to talk about there.

622
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:14,560
But fundamentally now, like if you have a computer running an operating system,

623
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:18,719
you have to say, like, I basically have to trust Microsoft 100%

624
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,795
because I have absolutely no choice.

625
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:25,074
Well, and so this goes back to that control versus ownership of perfect example,

626
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,834
I'm going to go get my winter tires put on my car in a week or two

627
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:29,665
because at some point it's going to snow and

628
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,535
my summer tires on snow are comically slippery.

629
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:34,494
Like we're talking Bambi on ice.

630
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:37,015
Yeah, because you live in Canada

631
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:37,795
in the US,

632
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,685
we don't have winter tires because we have all

633
00:26:39,694 --> 00:26:41,775
season radios and they suck in the winter.

634
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:43,925
I look,

635
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:46,015
here's, but here's the thing. Right.

636
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,685
Tires are a great example.

637
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,520
Imagine if you put tires on your car

638
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:54,800
and they were like, now you have to pay us $15 a month to use these tires.

639
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,390
And I think that's what some of this feels like sometimes.

640
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400
And then you end up like you, you have no, you have, there's no concept of control

641
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,000
and if you don't feel like you're in control,

642
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,680
there's no concept of security either.

643
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:08,770
Oh, man, this is so messed up.

644
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,589
It's hard to secure something you don't control for sure.

645
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,180
I think it's impossible to secure something you don't control.

646
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:18,660
I think a lot of, a lot of what we call security

647
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,790
is definitely smoke and mirrors in that regard.

648
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,430
-- It's
-- like a great example is people who talk about putting the best lock on their door

649
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,339
and I'm like, ok, go on youtube and search fireman breach wall.

650
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,939
It's basically a two minute job.

651
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:34,829
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

652
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,560
-- Like that's it, it's a two minute job to get through any wall and,
-- and I mean,

653
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:39,390
that's part of it.

654
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,250
Right. Right.

655
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,420
The,

656
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,500
the quality of your lock is generally

657
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,479
inconsequential for someone trying to enter your

658
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,300
-- home
-- when the side of your house is three eights plywood with

659
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:49,233
aluminum or plastic siding.

660
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:53,703
Well, even, even without that, there's watch a lock picking lawyer, there's,

661
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,883
these locks are all terrible.

662
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:59,123
Or get a 20 pound sledge hammer at Home Depot. Seriously.

663
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,142
A 20 pound sledge hammer and a couple of good whack.

664
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:03,062
Yeah. Right. Well, and that's just it,

665
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,412
or get a, get a hali

666
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,052
-- bar because they're pretty
-- sweet. No, don't do that. We're, we're,

667
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,873
that's enabling, that's enabling the bad guys.

668
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:12,873
Oh, no, we've, we've told them how to break into a house.

669
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:15,572
Uh The fdny forced entry guide,

670
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:16,276
I'll put it in the show

671
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:17,076
-- notes.
-- Ok?

672
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:20,245
I wanna, I wanna clean this one up and I guess here's, here's the where I'm,

673
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,855
I'm sitting at in my brain right now.

674
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:26,855
All of this like securing what we don't control ends up coming down to like,

675
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:32,156
we have to make trust decisions and we have to draw lines. And this is an example of

676
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:35,696
I'm gonna say I trust Microsoft and I trust Fedora.

677
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:39,505
And so I'm going to draw a line on the, like, like the,

678
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:41,635
the chart of things under my control.

679
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:44,056
Like the hardware is beneath Fedora as well

680
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:46,770
and everything above this line,

681
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,069
I feel like I can affect, this is things like installing updates,

682
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,699
setting the firewall, right?

683
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,010
Like making sure it's not plugged into the internet.

684
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,290
Those are things I have control over and everything below my line.

685
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,050
I can't pretend I have any sort of control over what's going on there.

686
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:03,449
Well, and here's a question

687
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:03,930
why

688
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:04,785
you trust them.

689
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,734
And the answer is actually really simple.

690
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,185
-- I
-- have to, I don't have a choice because

691
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:11,214
your incentives align.

692
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,015
Well, and that's true too.

693
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:14,935
And a perfect example of that is why the Apple

694
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:18,425
TV is such a better experience than the Amazon firestick.

695
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,614
Because Apple's incentives are to keep me as a consumer in their lifestyle cult

696
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:27,734
and keep paying them a couple like 1 to $2000 a year in

697
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,214
to buy new hardware.

698
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,359
And I'm happy and they're happy versus the Amazon.

699
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:39,119
And Amazon is a, their DNA culture is uh being a marketplace.

700
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,599
-- They're, they're basically a market maker, buy a
-- bunch of crap you don't need.

701
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,560
And so their culture is to,

702
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,680
is to flog my

703
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,300
attention to advertisers.

704
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,819
And so I remember when the fire stick, I,

705
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:54,180
I literally ran an update and then the content

706
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,199
that it shows me actually went from like this to

707
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:58,780
and it got squished like a 29.

708
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,459
And, and that was literally a day where I was like,

709
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,959
I literally went online and bought two Apple TV. S

710
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,369
-- and I was like, I'm done here.
-- I, I didn't do that.

711
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,290
I literally, when they, when my fire TV S updated,

712
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,660
I drove to Costco that day and bought two Apple TV.

713
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,280
-- S
-- Exactly.

714
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,079
And we're privileged and we can do this,

715
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,219
you know,

716
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,949
not everybody can just go for a couple of

717
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,680
100 bucks because they're annoyed by the advertising.

718
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:24,099
Ok. Ok. Now I wanna, I wanna bring this one home. No.

719
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:28,579
So, printers back to printers, we're gonna go back to printers as the end.

720
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:30,630
When you have a printer.

721
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:33,020
Do you know what's above the line on your printer?

722
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,910
Nothing. Exactly.

723
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,300
Basically. Nothing.

724
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,040
And I think that's one of the challenges and that's what,

725
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,400
-- yeah,
-- because it has to be plugged into the print network.

726
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,599
It, it, and, and it's, yeah, you basically have no control.

727
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,199
You can think you do but you really don't.

728
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,260
-- And I think there are devices
-- build a print server,

729
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,489
plugged into the print server and have like a

730
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,280
Linux print server running to media access and stuff.

731
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:58,079
-- But nobody does that.
-- That's a different use case, I think. No, well, not anymore.

732
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,880
You could with the Raspberry Pi or whatever.

733
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,050
I

734
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,150
think the point is

735
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,579
that when we talk about can you secure things you don't own?

736
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,260
It's not really that it's really about that like line of control.

737
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:14,020
And in the case of certain things like a printer or a fire TV stick or whatever,

738
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,060
like there's nothing above the line,

739
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,189
there's nothing you can secure, there's nothing you can do.

740
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:23,369
And so you basically have to just say either I trust completely

741
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,660
the manufacture of this device.

742
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,609
In which case everything's fine

743
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:31,569
or I don't trust them at all. In which case, you probably shouldn't be using it.

744
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:34,099
I think that's right. But there's a subtle twist to it, which is

745
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,930
you can reasonably secure up to the line that they provide you.

746
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,819
And this is goes to something I've been calling shared capabilities.

747
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:43,530
So we have an idea of shared responsibilities and cloud security

748
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,989
and I've been thinking that we need to expand

749
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,675
that to be shared capabilities because for example,

750
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:51,185
Amazon, like, I, I can't monitor the network.

751
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,435
It's their network unless they give me that capability,

752
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,255
which they do with certain VPC products.

753
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:57,255
So I think it's even more. So is

754
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:57,954
the,

755
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,675
the provider has a line and you can sort of

756
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,375
conventionally secure up to that line using their stuff,

757
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:04,795
their updates, their config

758
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,994
options, whatever. But anything above that line

759
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:12,474
now means you need to go do some weird compensating control which

760
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,640
may or may not be possible.

761
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,089
Like for a printer, for example, I can't not plug my printer to the network because

762
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,150
how am I going to print to it? It has to be plugged into the network.

763
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,530
Like that's not an option.

764
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,069
And,

765
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,400
and I think that's one of the fundamental problems for almost everything nowadays

766
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,250
is that

767
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,290
it's basically useless unless it's plugged into a network. For sure.

768
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,050
Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Yes.

769
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,969
And I think that's part of the problem is for things to be useful in the modern world.

770
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:38,010
They have to be connected to the network. That's true.

771
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,689
That's true. All right, I'm gonna,

772
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:43,209
I've got one thing I want to say before we close this one out.

773
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,989
So there is, I'll put a link in the show notes.

774
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,650
There is a,

775
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,810
a government request for information in the United States from the White House.

776
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,109
They're asking for best practices for securing open source.

777
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:54,910
It's actually the,

778
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,989
the title is technically request for information on

779
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,689
open source security areas of long term focus.

780
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,300
And I want to call this out because anyone listening, like go go submit

781
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,030
uh

782
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,209
uh

783
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,680
RF I response, I don't know what they're called.

784
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,479
It probably is some fancy name in the government. RF I response.

785
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,160
But anyway, I was reminded that we should, we should plug this

786
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:15,920
because I was in a meeting with uh Alan Friedman who's like the, the,

787
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,930
the godfather of SBA

788
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,969
and, and I know he listened to the show every now and then.

789
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,390
And so Alan was like, you should, you should tell people to do this.

790
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,319
And I was like, you know what? We should, it's a good idea.

791
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,609
So anyway, that's how I'm ending it. All right. Thank you, Kurt.
