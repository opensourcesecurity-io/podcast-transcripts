Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,310
Kurt Siefried and my partner in possible copyright infringement.

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,109
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,310
are we infringing on anyone's copyright? I said possibly

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,379
that's fair.

5
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,239
I know actually the music, the intro,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,290
music I made very certain to acquire a public noma

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,040
song that also the recording had no copy claims against it.

8
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:29,889
But what if, for example, we have, what is it?

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,040
-- Four minutes and some number of seconds of silence? Is
-- that? Oh, that's true.

10
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,650
That's true. I would never do that to anybody because that sounds terrible.

11
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,270
So there's a podcast that it hasn't come out in over a year now.

12
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,639
I think it's called Hello Internet.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,700
And one of the favorites the editor would do C GP Gray edits it.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,290
He would have like a minute of silence

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,119
in and then like a little little outro snippet y thing

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,720
that they'd leave in.

17
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,959
And it used to drive me insane because I don't have skip silence enabled on

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,799
my podcast player because I feel like when there is silence in a podcast,

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,388
it's meant to be there for whatever the artistic purpose is from the host.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,529
-- But like this frigging podcast would have like, like dang
-- it.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,879
That actually sounds annoying.

22
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,050
-- It was
-- very annoying. I did not care for that.

23
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:16,059
Yeah, this was a reference to 433 which is a three movement

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,319
composition

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,970
of just silence

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,190
-- and it's apparently copyrighted.
-- You can copyright anything.

27
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,209
Anyway, today is the day

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,739
that Kurt and I talk about open source,

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,980
the licensing of it, everything because it's just been a huge topic in the news for

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,029
months now and probably years.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,669
Well,

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,360
I think it's finally come to the point where we can no longer ignore the problems.

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,239
I, I would agree with that. Now, I'm going to

34
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,639
preface all this

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,519
with,

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,720
I work for elastic and the elastic search license has been a huge topic in the news,

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,959
-- didn't you guys just use the Mongo DB
-- thing?

38
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:57,239
We did, we moved it to SSPL

39
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,519
which is service side public license and

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,330
I do not speak for elastic.

41
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:02,819
So,

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,279
anything I might say does not reflect on the company Elastic has

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,919
done an enormous amount of public comments and discussions on this topic.

44
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,000
-- Go read what they said. I'm not elastic.
-- Yeah.

45
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,940
And obviously, you know, Josh and I have been in this for a long time.

46
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,039
We're not lawyers and this is not legal advice.

47
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,149
Yeah. If

48
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,190
you're coming to us for legal advice,

49
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,130
you have way bigger problems than a lawyer can solve.

50
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,770
-- I suspect
-- I would expand that to more generically

51
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:31,350
if you're coming to us for advice at all.

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,029
That's true

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,270
outside of like,

54
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,759
maybe waterless toilets and a few other domain specific knowledge pieces.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,250
-- Right. Yeah.
-- Sorry.

56
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,809
-- No,
-- that I could just pull a Fox news and say, oh, we're just entertainment.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,490
We're not news, we can say whatever we want. I'd forgotten about that. Right.

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,270
It's America. It's great. Yeah.

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,669
-- Anyway,
-- so, yeah, open source licensing,

60
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:53,934
I think what's interesting for me is it works really well for

61
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,475
-- a while and now it's clearly not working so well
-- and I,

62
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,115
I mean, I kind of agree with that.

63
00:02:59,125 --> 00:02:59,735
So

64
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:04,514
it kind of the set some of the thinking curt and I KT and I have done a bunch of research.

65
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:08,205
We've done a bunch of discussions obviously off podcast about this.

66
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:12,884
And the thing I keep coming back to is there's two angles is number one,

67
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,404
the current open source definition published by the O SI,

68
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,854
the open source institute.

69
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,595
It's an institute. I think it's Institute,

70
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,020
the O SI was published in 2007. What did the world look like in 2007?

71
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,919
Well, and it came out of the whole, it really came out from the decade before it,

72
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,119
-- yeah, I mean, the, the late nineties,
-- like, it's not like it just popped out

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,669
in 2007 and they spent a week writing this up,

74
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,690
you know.

75
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,729
-- Right.
-- Right. The point is, it's decades old. Right.

76
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,440
-- Well,
-- it's literally from a different time

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,089
there was no cloud computing.

78
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:47,500
There was barely smartphones had just come out right.

79
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,089
-- There was no concept of an app store. There was no
-- IOT.

80
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,050
Well, there was, it just wasn't actually hooked up to the internet. Thank God.

81
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:56,770
That's right. That's right.

82
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,539
And so kind of that, that's aspect.

83
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,240
Number one and aspect number two is the current

84
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,320
definition of open source is controlled by the OSI.

85
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,490
And the O SI is a foundation and I am not a fan of

86
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,119
many foundations because I think they become

87
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,559
this sort of weird self serving tautology.

88
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,140
They become a bureaucracy that

89
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,570
exists for the purpose of existing as opposed to its original mandate, which is,

90
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,799
that's a well documented

91
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,266
of these things.

92
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:28,006
Look at the Linux foundation sponsors, look at the O SI sponsors,

93
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,747
look at like any of these foundation sponsors and it's,

94
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:32,786
it's all the big companies you can imagine.

95
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:35,826
Well, it kind of boils down to number one

96
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,457
who actually benefits from open source and ends

97
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,087
up capturing value in the form of money.

98
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:41,946
Amazon.

99
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:44,627
Yeah. And then who then is willing?

100
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:44,877
You know,

101
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,546
it always reminds me of like zoning and

102
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:50,266
building codes and real estate related stuff where

103
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,664
I wish I could have a bit more of a say in that, but I don't have the time for it.

104
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:57,493
Whereas a real estate developer can cheerfully spend $10,000 lobbying or hiring

105
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,533
-- a lawyer or whatever
-- and they've got skin in that game too.

106
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:04,794
-- In ways you don't.
-- Well, the thing is they've got a way to capture value from changing

107
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,414
-- the bylaws or changing the requirement
-- right now.

108
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:13,074
I also want to say that there's going to be people who comment.

109
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,773
Well, if you don't want your software being used in a way you don't like,

110
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,800
you shouldn't make it and source that is a ridiculous argument.

111
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,441
That is the, don't be poor

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,311
-- of talking about poverty.
-- It's funny.

113
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,830
Well, actually this will be linked in the show notes, but the Bruce parents,

114
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,390
his new kind of concept where he talks about

115
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,381
this about how these people want to kind of right social wrongs.

116
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,230
But they're typically, as he put it like a, you know,

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,531
world court level of types of things,

118
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,670
you know, typically these people aren't saying like I don't want people to,

119
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,080
you know, use the software while they're eating mayonnaise.

120
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,750
It's more things like

121
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,299
you, you can't use the software for evil. Well, who defines evil?

122
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,549
I think we should create the mayonnaise public license now,

123
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,739
I'm just saying,

124
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,540
but Right. Right. And, and

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,269
what Bruce is talking about is, is something that I think we'll,

126
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,660
we'll just weave it into the show

127
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,385
and kind of to set the stage and we'll put some links in the show notes

128
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:09,385
to a document and a talk Bruce Perens gave and Bruce goes back to like,

129
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:12,864
he's one of the people who defined what open source is.

130
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,515
And

131
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,404
-- I think that's kind of his claim to fame.
-- He helped Chisel the tablets,

132
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:18,065
right?

133
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,029
So where he came from is,

134
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,790
is actually the Debian project was a huge part of everything he did is so Ian

135
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:29,619
Murdock created Debian Bruce Perens made it real is how I would always think of this.

136
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,380
You keep talking about open source success.

137
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,190
And I was just thinking about that and I was about to say that

138
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,579
Debian was like one of the first really

139
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:40,140
successful open source distributions because of Bruce.

140
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:40,540
But

141
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:41,346
it's interesting,

142
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,276
there were actually there and there still are other like slackware,

143
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:47,376
very successful open source distributions in terms of people using them.

144
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:51,555
But I wouldn't say necessarily successful, maybe in terms of community, right?

145
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:51,835
Like

146
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,635
slackware is infamous for being a guy who like, well, when he got sick,

147
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,786
there was no slackware for a while whereas Debian has built community and,

148
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:03,316
and I think that's one of the challenges is this whole, what does success and win

149
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:04,122
and

150
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:07,721
you know, having a healthy ecosystem look like for open source.

151
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:10,721
And I think part of the, and I hate to give this answer, but I think

152
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,962
-- the answer for that is it depends, there is no one answer.
-- Well. Right. Absolutely.

153
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:20,212
But I will say that I think the vast majority of us who are involved in open

154
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:24,082
source and especially those of us who got involved in open source a long time ago,

155
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,881
it was all about the community.

156
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,929
It was all about. I'm part of something bigger than my,

157
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,739
for me, it was literally just,

158
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,489
I needed software that didn't cost an arm and

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,149
-- a leg and require signing agreements and worked
-- well.

160
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,809
I mean, that's part of it too. Obviously. I, I couldn't afford a Sun workstation.

161
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,700
-- No, like
-- I, I unapologetically

162
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:42,790
just

163
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,339
needed software.

164
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,450
Like, and I, you know, Windows didn't have a web server or a web client.

165
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,600
OS two was nice and all. But compared to Linux and the tooling I had in Linux,

166
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,799
-- it was flaming garbage.
-- That's fair.

167
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:58,869
And I will say that's how I got started because I got all this.

168
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,760
Like I wanted a development environment and ac compiler was expensive.

169
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,600
And so Linux had a free C compiler. So I was like, well, I'll just do that.

170
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,070
So eventually I realized like there's so much more

171
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,529
going on here than just a development environment.

172
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,714
And I think that's where like whole community aspect became a huge deal.

173
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,904
And that's what

174
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,105
I still, I wrote a blog post about this, like in my opinion,

175
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:23,125
and this is just me talking like, I don't view open source as some licenses.

176
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,304
-- I view it as the people I interact with.
-- It's a culture

177
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:26,934
like

178
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,484
and what I love too is it's a

179
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:31,674
loosely coupled culture potentially or tightly coupled.

180
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,575
-- It's
-- a mess. It's lovely.

181
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,304
Well, I, I was running,

182
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,183
I was connected to the internet and I realized

183
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,715
I could connect out to everything on the internet,

184
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,594
doesn't that mean everything on the internet can connect to me?

185
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,109
So I started looking for security documentation and there wasn't any.

186
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,979
So I wrote some and at one point, my,

187
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:51,398
my website was getting over 100,000 visits a month which back in the, you know,

188
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,638
99 2 thousands for a private website.

189
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,198
That's a lot. That's awesome.

190
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:55,718
Right.

191
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,028
There's other projects obviously where it's much more tightly coupled, like say,

192
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,619
you know, the Linux kernel where you know,

193
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,309
if you want to start mucking around with some subsystem,

194
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,359
you probably need to actually coordinate a bit.

195
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,039
You can't just,

196
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,689
you know, just do what exactly whatever you want.

197
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,758
There's coding styles issues and whatnot but, but even then

198
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,400
I keep coming back to meet what open source is all about

199
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:18,760
is I don't have to ask for permission,

200
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,210
ignoring the monetary aspect, which is a form of permission, right?

201
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:23,849
You need to pay me $5 to use this.

202
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,289
You need to sign this legal document to use this. No, it's just

203
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,679
you can download it and assuming you're not

204
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,539
going to do something really troll with it,

205
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:30,960
like

206
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,429
redistribute it and not

207
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,719
abide by the license.

208
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:34,900
Yeah, go

209
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,070
go nuts.

210
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,559
You know, I was looking at the um the open source initiative,

211
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,989
open source definition, right?

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,969
And um I mean,

213
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,969
really pretty much every point boils down to so you can include

214
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,969
it and ship it without having to pay or sign agreements.

215
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,049
Right. Right.

216
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:50,799
Now, now, the one thing I always ask and this isn't something we have to answer here.

217
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,575
It's just kind of a thought exercise for the reader is if you look

218
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:58,275
at the O SI today and you read their writings and everything going on,

219
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,474
do you think

220
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:04,655
-- they would approve the GP L today?
-- Uh GP L original GP LV, two or three

221
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:05,344
of them?

222
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,224
Tough to say.

223
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,825
I, I, we don't have to answer it and I don't think we should,

224
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:13,255
-- but I just think about that
-- and one thing to keep in mind is GP L

225
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:18,195
and V two and V three are quite different. Like they share, they share that in GP L.

226
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,094
But if you actually look at them, it's like, whoa, there's,

227
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,940
there's some big differences which I,

228
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,549
I think is sort of speaks to the challenge of this stuff is evolving.

229
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,919
I think it's very presumptuous to define something back in 2007.

230
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,719
Well, and even earlier,

231
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,070
because obviously it didn't just come into being overnight,

232
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,570
but to define something 14 years ago in a, in a

233
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,190
environment that moves as much and as weirdly as the open source world moves and to be

234
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,369
essentially,

235
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,750
yeah. No, this is good.

236
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:45,669
We're done.

237
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:46,219
Right.

238
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:49,750
-- Right. Exactly. And
-- like, I feel like this needs an update.

239
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,429
I agree.

240
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,869
I think it all does. And now the idea Bruce Perens has that I do kind of agree with.

241
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,950
Is he thinks that the current definition of open source

242
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,750
is should be set in stone and not changed.

243
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,429
And in fact, in his world,

244
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,469
the definition of open source should really be three licenses, which is Apache two,

245
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,020
the

246
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,369
L GP and the

247
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:10,070
GPL and like that's it.

248
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,030
And

249
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,650
I would say the vast majority of open source licenses fall

250
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,299
under one of those three umbrellas in some meaningful way.

251
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,770
And there's some weird ones, but I think generally speaking,

252
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,619
those are the three ideas, right?

253
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,840
Where Apache two is essentially do whatever you want. L

254
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,890
GPL is, you can do whatever you want with this, but you have to share it. And a

255
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,039
GPL is basically, if you use this,

256
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:36,169
you're going to end up open sourcing pretty much everything you've got

257
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,679
it is I always did find it odd that there are so many

258
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,690
actual open source licenses, you know, like a, like the MIT one or whatever.

259
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,690
And I just, I kind of always wondered why are there so many, but then, you know,

260
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,450
the open source world, we have how many implementations of whatever thing,

261
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,289
you know, it's, this is just normal.

262
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,650
-- Well, in
-- everything, I mean, back in the day, it was hip to have your own license,

263
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,650
even if it was virtually identical to something else.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,450
And there'd be one little pet thing you wanted to add in. And

265
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,669
I mean, things like the MIT license and the BSD license, those predate open source

266
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,880
by probably decades and

267
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,359
obviously in their intent,

268
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,750
it was just a matter of like we're pushing this out the door, don't ask any questions,

269
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,440
sort of thing.

270
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,659
-- Well,
-- and, you know, the lawyer said we had to put something on paper. Right.

271
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:20,900
Right.

272
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,950
Well, and because at, and T sued them, but

273
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,440
that's another story.

274
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,840
But. Right. Right. And so anyway, what, what Bruce is kind of talking about?

275
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,840
So open source is cast in stone, we're not going to change open source.

276
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,380
And part of me agrees with that because I think

277
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,080
what we call open source is well understood today.

278
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,140
But then he's saying the world has changed and we need something new

279
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,280
to kind of replace this

280
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,770
and accommodate developers and the universe

281
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,059
in the world we live in.

282
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,940
What's interesting to me is he really comes at it from this thing,

283
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,294
sort of the two big takeaways for me from his talk where

284
00:12:55,484 --> 00:13:00,635
number one, we need a copyright and patent free or not free unencumbered space

285
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:01,364
where it's

286
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,684
where the software is sort of known to be safe.

287
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:07,674
There's not my favorite all time example is Rambus. Remember Rambus.

288
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,315
So like they worked on this memory standard and this company called

289
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,145
Rambus basically held patents on stuff that they shoved into the standard.

290
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:19,655
And so the standard was approved and Rambus is like, ha ha pay us, right.

291
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:23,234
And so there's a reason you haven't heard of Rambus is because it died.

292
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:27,080
Turns out these manufacturers didn't want to pay Ram bus, you know, and,

293
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,789
and that's a real problem in the wireless space.

294
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,500
For example, you know,

295
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,070
there's major chip manufacturers that hold all these patents and there's,

296
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,969
there is literally no way

297
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,650
for

298
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,625
-- an independent entity realistically to go get good wireless patents.
-- Right.

299
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,044
-- Right.
-- It's just not possible.

300
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,284
Well, that's like, you know, you know what that reminds me of is I remember,

301
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:47,835
do you remember the MPEG Consortium from back in the day

302
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:52,174
with like MPEG two and MP3 S and all these compression algorithms?

303
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,844
And I'll never forget. So there was

304
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:53,984
a,

305
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,190
a guy used to be at redhead, his name is Tom Calloway.

306
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,479
We call him Spot and he gave a bunch of talks and like the legality of these patents

307
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,179
and like the M PEG Foundation would say, oh, you have to pay us if you want to use these.

308
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,140
And I remember one day

309
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,500
spot said he asked them, he's like, well, what are the patents discovered? Then?

310
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,260
They said all of them, he was like, what?

311
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,390
And I mean, you know what that, you know what that really means?

312
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
We don't know, they don't know, but they just want your shake no money.

313
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,150
And it's like, that's nuts. Right.

314
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,460
And

315
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,104
fortunately though they probably have lawyers and, well,

316
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,765
-- do you want to spend 50 grand or 100 grand fighting them or
-- you

317
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:28,364
pay them like five grand and you get their license and whatever you're done.

318
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,054
You know,

319
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:34,934
-- it's a no brainer from just a risk versus reward perspective.
-- Well, as long as

320
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:35,554
in

321
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:36,984
that classic terms, you know,

322
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:39,044
as long as you only actually have to pay them once and they don't

323
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:42,104
keep coming back or threatening you for more like the patent trolls do.

324
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,864
And then the second sort of tenant that he keeps coming back to

325
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:46,760
in his new thing is about

326
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,520
the developers, like right now basically have to go beg for a job or funding.

327
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,200
I just literally saw one where it's this app,

328
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,219
it's a mail app that supposedly allows you to handle

329
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,789
high volumes of mail gracefully on your Android device.

330
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:05,580
And the, the guy is basically trying to fund, you know, €52,000 a year for it.

331
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,049
And I'm like, I'm sorry, but good luck buddy.

332
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:13,229
But at the same time, are there people using his software getting tens,

333
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:16,169
if not hundreds of, you know, dollars of value out of it?

334
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,059
Absolutely.

335
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,520
Probably. I mean, how much would it cost to build a library like that?

336
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,849
That actually works. It'd be very expensive.

337
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,500
Well, it's not a library. It's, it's an actual male client on, on Android.

338
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,289
Like it's a full fledged app.

339
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:30,440
And

340
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:33,229
so, I mean, that it's not one of those like hidden libraries.

341
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,919
-- It's an actual, you go to the App store, download it, start using it.
-- I got you.

342
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:40,780
-- Why doesn't he charge for it then?
-- Because nobody would pay well,

343
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:41,359
that's fair.

344
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,599
How many people spend literally as much time

345
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:48,159
fetching about a $5 app as they would about buying a house,

346
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,130
right? Like humans don't

347
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,219
the way humans make decisions about

348
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,820
yesterday, I bought a used car. I

349
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,960
had spent like two or three hours looking online

350
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:59,770
at various types of cars kind of learning,

351
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,940
you know, a bit about what was available and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

352
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,799
And then I found what looked like a decent, you know, like a little four door sedan

353
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,270
and I basically went and test drove it and the guy brought

354
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,650
out his magic foursquare paper and started trying to do the financing.

355
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,809
I'm like, no, it's a cash sale.

356
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,140
They wouldn't let me put on my credit card

357
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,820
because I wanted to do that because the points,

358
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,580
but also

359
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,559
I suspect they wouldn't let me put on my credit

360
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,859
card because then if there's a problem with it,

361
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:24,140
the credit card company would get involved on my behalf.

362
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,739
That's true. Right. So back to our house insurance, fire argument. But

363
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,479
anyways

364
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,599
with this is, you know, these developers either have to get like a,

365
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:36,539
a job at some company that directly supports open source or get a job at a company

366
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,659
where the company will graciously allow them to work

367
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:42,489
-- on open source or
-- try to acquire funding.

368
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,372
Like, like for example, Linus Torvalds

369
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,622
is paid by the Linux Foundation.

370
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:49,742
The thing is though it's not like, say academia where yes,

371
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,422
you have to acquire funding and spend, you know,

372
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,273
half your time doing grant proposals.

373
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,622
The thing is in academia, there are well understood and

374
00:16:56,783 --> 00:17:00,062
there's actually money flows in the open source world.

375
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:05,642
-- There are money flows. Good luck trying to find them and acquire them.
-- I mean. Right.

376
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,301
And, and this is where

377
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:11,105
I feel like we, we're going to run into the people who say, oh, then don't,

378
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:15,326
don't publish your software, which I think is a little bit silly.

379
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,505
-- Yeah. If you use a computer, you probably shouldn't say that. I
-- mean, I kind of agree.

380
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,066
I feel like that's a cop out.

381
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:25,505
Every computer on the planet has, if it doesn't ship open source,

382
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,425
open source was used to help build it.

383
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:31,066
-- Right.
-- Right. Full stop that there's just, there's no alternative.

384
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,105
Absolutely.

385
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,209
And, and I don't, I don't like that because I feel like this is an example of you.

386
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,530
I mean, open source, develop just developers in general are

387
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,170
they're artists creating art, you know, think of it that way.

388
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,479
And these are people who

389
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:48,930
are they, they want to create art and send it into the world.

390
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,319
It doesn't matter if they get paid or not necessarily.

391
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,050
But I think they're like, there's,

392
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,505
I have a bunch of crap github that is basically just junk.

393
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:58,084
I do. And I don't care who uses it.

394
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,734
I usually stick an Apache two license on it because I don't care like, whatever.

395
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:05,025
I'm just gifting it into the world and it's never going to be big enough that,

396
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:08,305
that I would expect it to, to pay for anything for me.

397
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:15,704
Right. Ever, ever. Now, if I wrote a library and it was used by all of the Fortune 500

398
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,140
that's when I feel like we start getting into this situation of like, hold on.

399
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,339
You're telling me this person wrote something that's running the world

400
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,819
-- and they're doing it for free. That seems
-- broken.

401
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:31,619
Perfect example of this is insulin, right? What was it?

402
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,959
Frederick Banting discovered insulin in 1923.

403
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:35,239
He refused to put his name on the patent.

404
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,859
He felt it was unethical for a doctor to

405
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,729
profit from a discovery that would save lives.

406
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:41,170
The co inventors sold the insulin patent to the University

407
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,300
of Toronto for a mere $1 and you know,

408
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,790
the idea being that we're just going to mass

409
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,380
produce the heck out of this and save people,

410
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,349
I assume they also

411
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,390
had employment probably for life after, after that discovery.

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Well, sort of, but anyways,

413
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,750
but it boils down to these companies with software, you don't really have to

414
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,349
spend money or effort making sure it's healthy because

415
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,719
if it does what you needed it to do, who kind of honestly,

416
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,229
unless it has some horrendously exploitable, remote security flaw,

417
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,520
kind of who cares

418
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,750
-- about updates or changes,
-- that's how we exist today.

419
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,790
And I mean, I do think that's wrong, but that's another

420
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:26,949
-- thing,
-- but it works economically and it does, it's, how do you tell a company?

421
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,069
Well, if you do this thing,

422
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,920
give a little money to this guy or to this foundation or to whatever

423
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,160
it'll, things will be better and the company is going to go.

424
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,390
Well, how do you mean better?

425
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,099
Well, and that's it. I, I don't, I, I can't really explain,

426
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:40,400
you know,

427
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,869
unless

428
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,709
you get to that situation where,

429
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,500
well,

430
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,040
there will be a problem someday in that software that might be

431
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,869
a Showstopper or a compatibility issue or some new standard comes out

432
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,880
and it won't work.

433
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,839
And if you had funded it, you'd be able to get an update and move along.

434
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,790
But by having this, you know, very, um,

435
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,869
I don't want to say fragile ecosystem but this ecosystem that is not

436
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,140
healthy per se, like it's not, it's not as robust and resilient as it could be.

437
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,339
I mean, and it might all fail, kind of like Texas's power grid.

438
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,510
I

439
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:12,969
know.

440
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,040
I know. But, ok, ok.

441
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,670
So the time zone guy gets sick and we spend a month mucking around with

442
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,010
who takes over the time zone file

443
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,829
in that month. You could have some real problems if you're a bank.

444
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,630
-- And,
-- and I guess here's part of what I keep thinking of too is when,

445
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,150
when, like some of this stuff was done in, say the early two thousands,

446
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,160
the world was different

447
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,270
and there weren't a lot of companies really doing anything

448
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,280
I would say from an economic perspective with open source,

449
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,479
like you kind of had Red Hat.

450
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,699
Well,

451
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,719
there was a bunch of companies like Red Hat and

452
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:50,560
there was a ton of companies using open source and,

453
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:50,790
you know,

454
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,060
gaining the benefit of hundreds of thousands of dollars

455
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:55,359
of work that they didn't have to pay for.

456
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:56,520
But yeah, there was no

457
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,760
empire built on open source like Amazon web services or,

458
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,160
-- or
-- literally every company today, every

459
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,930
company today has built everything they have on the back of open source.

460
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,130
Do you remember the time when there

461
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,380
were multiple commercial web servers available?

462
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,930
Yes. Or like Sun, Sun, right?

463
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,890
Or if you wanted a UNIX computer, you had like 10 vendors,

464
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,670
you could buy a UNIX computer from now.

465
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
If you want a UNIX computer,

466
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,650
it's running Linux just that's it.

467
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:24,920
I mean,

468
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:26,640
Linux one

469
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,520
-- for obvious reasons,
-- but open source one won well,

470
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,030
open source totally won.

471
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:32,650
But, but I mean,

472
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,369
that's the thing I keep thinking of is there's all these

473
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,430
organizations that have built these enormous empires on top of open source

474
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:44,454
and a significant number of them are just all about.

475
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:46,474
I'm going to take everything I can get

476
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,984
and some of them give back. Some of them don't.

477
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:53,145
I mean, my take on this would be then why are we focusing so much on the companies?

478
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:56,275
It sounds a lot like open sources, infrastructure like public roads

479
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,885
and for example, in general

480
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,724
with public roads, we say, look, public roads

481
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:03,449
are good, right?

482
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,920
They, they let the police and the firefighters get to your house quickly.

483
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,170
They packages get to your house or condo or apartment.

484
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,640
It allows you to go to work, it allows you to go buy food.

485
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,349
So it's, it's a public good that we will taxpayer fund.

486
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,910
Well, open source sort of sounds like that.

487
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,699
Now, I'm not saying the government should take over this.

488
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:22,109
I think that would be an absolute disaster, but I'm saying

489
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,969
this, this idea of, ok, let's try and get companies to pay for it.

490
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,290
I'm not sure that's going to work.

491
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:30,633
It's going to be tough because there's going to be a lot of free riders.

492
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,723
Whereas, you know, for example, a taxpayer funded system, well,

493
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,912
there are no free riders if you're

494
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:39,453
paying taxes and ignoring the whole corporate tax, shenanigans,

495
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:43,593
Irish Dutch sandwich, whatever the heck, those avoidance strategies are called.

496
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:44,312
But I'm, I'm,

497
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,623
I'm of the opinion that I,

498
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:49,312
I like the idea that Bruce Perens has about building this new structure that,

499
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:49,503
you know,

500
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:52,083
allows companies to more easily get sort of

501
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:54,152
open source compliance and use open source more.

502
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,056
I, but I feel like it's

503
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,336
not so much, not enough, but I feel like it's,

504
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:00,985
I think open source really is a public good

505
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:05,796
in an infrastructure issue like roads. Now, it's just that fundamental to society.

506
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:06,355
-- I
-- would

507
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:09,505
-- agree with your statement now.
-- How we execute that.

508
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:12,855
Yeah, I don't know, like no that and you know, to, you know,

509
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,735
the devil's in the details, so to speak.

510
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:18,456
-- But
-- OK, you know what you just made me realize there is,

511
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,895
I think an important connection here and

512
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,520
like let's look at

513
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,489
some of these gig economy companies and I'll pick on Uber right now.

514
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,349
There's actually a very nice thread Cory Doctorow put out,

515
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,010
I think it was today or yesterday.

516
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,119
Basically talking about the fact that like Uber is

517
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,709
literally built around exploitation of the people who work for

518
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,670
like no questions asked, right?

519
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,810
And so Uber is like this great example of there they

520
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,241
are this huge company that's exploiting humans as their natural resource.

521
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,271
And I think if you look at the history of a lot of big companies, they're all about,

522
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:55,222
I'm going to take a resource and I'm going to literally like

523
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:57,741
abuse it as long as I can.

524
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:02,682
You look at people like your Amazons and your Googles and your Facebooks,

525
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,952
they're taking like open source is just a forest,

526
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,232
they're cutting down and they don't care,

527
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:13,734
happens to it in a lot of cases, right? I mean, I think this is a similar problem.

528
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,134
I think my concern with,

529
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:18,994
with things like Amazon and Google is that they reduce the sort

530
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:22,193
of the vibrancy of the ecosystem if that makes any sense,

531
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:22,774
do they?

532
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,774
I mean, do they, I don't know this is, this is a hard question.

533
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:27,784
I remember a time when we used to have a

534
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:32,014
dozen Linux distributions companies and now there's sort of two,

535
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:36,235
I would say there's three. You've got Red Hat, obviously you've got so,

536
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,235
and you've got

537
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:40,286
-- Muntu. Right.
-- Right. I keep forgetting about them. Sorry.

538
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:44,765
But then I would say also, you look, you've got like Arch and Debian,

539
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,566
there's a handful of your community.

540
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:50,885
I think that says something when these community distributions I think are

541
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:54,885
probably healthier than any of the company distributions are today because like,

542
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:55,735
let's face it.

543
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:58,465
Linux has basically become a commodity.

544
00:24:58,656 --> 00:24:59,166
I mean,

545
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,030
a freaking IBM bought red hat. Like what the heck.

546
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,540
So my concern with these large companies is, is

547
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,599
fundamentally, they're not violating the license.

548
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:12,660
And I wouldn't, I would say they're not even violating the spirit so much.

549
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,260
But what I,

550
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,140
where I have concern is that they're

551
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,599
benefiting hugely from these open source projects.

552
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:19,520
It's the tragedy of the commons, right?

553
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,520
If everybody behaves like that, then we have a problem.

554
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,770
If only one or two people behave like that, that's OK.

555
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,079
But I guess the question then becomes if, what if one or two people behave like that?

556
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,859
But they're the size of Amazon.

557
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,040
-- No.
-- Right. That's a good question.

558
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:35,260
You know, it's one thing if I, if I graze my one cow on the commons,

559
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,599
but if I have 10,000 cattle,

560
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,449
-- yeah,
-- I mean, that's

561
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,810
an excellent question. Now, at the same time there's going to be people who argue.

562
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:41,989
Oh,

563
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,280
but Amazon funds open source developers and they hire open source

564
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,459
developers and Google has open source developers and they all this,

565
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:52,469
do they, for example, do they actually return a lot of work upstream?

566
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,099
-- Do they play well with the community? I don't actually know
-- some of them do.

567
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,550
Some of them don't. I mean,

568
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,209
it varies. Like I remember back in the day dealing with Google.

569
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:04,079
Google was notorious for being like, hey, I'm Google, I'm here to help.

570
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,209
And people were like, oh, not again.

571
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,869
And I mean, even, I mean, I remember this happening at redhead even or, you know, oh,

572
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,160
we're a red hat, we're here to help.

573
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,339
I'm like, oh go away

574
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,469
and it just varies, right?

575
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:18,209
Because there's some, some interactions are good, some interactions are bad.

576
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,599
I think you've got a wide variety of interactions.

577
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,739
But I think fundamentally, I would say what I see

578
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,180
most of these companies doing

579
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:30,750
I feel like is a net negative just from

580
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,859
the context of making the open source ecosystem better.

581
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:35,380
I don't know, I don't have the,

582
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,680
I suspect I keep coming back to part of the problem

583
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,369
is I feel like a lot of people are giving up.

584
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,770
They see Amazon and Google succeeding so heavily.

585
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,160
And I also worry that they're sort of changing the ecosystem in ways

586
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,890
that make it harder for smaller companies to get started or compete.

587
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,634
-- Oh, without question,
-- I like vibrancy and weirdness and

588
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,303
-- you know, having lots of alternatives and differences,
-- right?

589
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,583
And actually this is something,

590
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:04,034
this is a good place to kind of kind of drive this home is,

591
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:08,244
this is something Bruce talks about in his presentation is the fact that

592
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:09,973
if you look at open source today,

593
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:13,163
it's basically almost completely consumed by companies

594
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,163
where the company takes open source,

595
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:18,364
they bring it in and then they basically create a product people use.

596
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,404
And obviously one of the intentions and I think the

597
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:23,267
birth of open source was around making a thing for

598
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:26,258
people and other people would take your open source and

599
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,098
they'd combine it with this open source over here.

600
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:28,468
And then

601
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:34,468
it was a very interesting cycle where people were working with people for people.

602
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,718
And that doesn't exist.

603
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:38,537
-- Now it was
-- artisanal and then it became industrialized and

604
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:39,267
that's true.

605
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:43,027
Just like industrialization. We have ugly smokestacks belching out.

606
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,458
God knows what churning out shoes that are really cheap and you know,

607
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:47,328
fall apart in a year.

608
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,547
I mean, that's a good point that, that, that makes

609
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:52,251
to me at the same time, like one of the tenants,

610
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:55,852
Bruce Perens is trying to push is like this aspect of

611
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:58,692
it should be easier for normal people to

612
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:01,692
kind of get involved and use this technology.

613
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:04,732
I think that's easy to say. And I think that's a very altruistic vision.

614
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:08,572
I think it's going to, it's, it's hard because people aren't bad at technology.

615
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:11,041
-- I
-- would be very scared to ship an open source

616
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:13,421
product nowadays because of the patent trolls and everything.

617
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:16,921
I would much rather ship a close source product that is harder to, you know, kind,

618
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:20,046
look at it and figure out because you can easily infringe upon a

619
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,855
patent without realizing it because there's so

620
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,215
many ridiculous patents out there now.

621
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:23,635
You know,

622
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:27,225
a computer controlled system that allows you to buy a cookie online or whatever,

623
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:27,796
right?

624
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,566
You know, that whole, that whole

625
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:33,916
of business process patents where like blah, de blah, de blah on a computer

626
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:38,836
-- or mediated by a network of computers was my favorite.
-- And that's part of it too.

627
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:41,595
And this is something I feel like a Bruce Fanboy today.

628
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:44,306
But he, like, he talks about the fact that these, like all these companies

629
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:49,060
who fund all these foundations are also the largest patent holders in the world.

630
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,839
Well, I think it's not so much a causation thing.

631
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,500
It's just a correlation thing of who,

632
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,630
who has the time and effort to actually assign a person to work part time or half

633
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,739
time or even full time on just even interfacing

634
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,439
with this foundation of this open source group.

635
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:03,760
Well,

636
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,199
a large company that you've got to be making a lot

637
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,420
of extra money to pay somebody full time or something,

638
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:08,780
you know,

639
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,800
to work on this.

640
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,884
-- Yes,
-- because every now and then I think, oh,

641
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:16,293
this foundation is doing some working group that I'm interested

642
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:19,333
in every time I go to the group and it always

643
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,973
starts out with good ideas and then the huge companies

644
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,843
show up and they just drive it off the rails.

645
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,203
You know, my favorite is like, you'll say, oh, we want to work on this problem.

646
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,774
And six months later IBM has us writing a white

647
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:33,644
paper and it's like this doesn't even make sense.

648
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:36,443
-- Well,
-- and isn't what we wanted to solve at all?

649
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,963
The problem is it's,

650
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:41,267
I don't think they're even capable of doing that kind of thing anymore.

651
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:44,358
And it's definitely not in their best interest to have a free solution out there.

652
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,897
Probably that if you pay attention in the, like, working group space,

653
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:50,338
it's always like the same group of people that I think they

654
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:52,838
just work at these companies and their job is joining working group.

655
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,287
-- Well, but
-- who else has the time and effort to do this? Right. Right.

656
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:57,498
Or the knowledge of how to get involved? Right. Because there's,

657
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:02,078
-- you know, there's a knack to it, so to speak.
-- Well, no, I don't think there is.

658
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:06,027
I think there's a knack to slowing everything down and being a pest,

659
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,482
there's a huge knack to that.

660
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,011
And you figure like these people are like, oh, look at all the progress I did.

661
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,952
We wrote six white papers this year and their boss is probably like, wow, six,

662
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:18,531
that's a lot good job when the reality is like, if these didn't exist,

663
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,192
would it matter?

664
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:22,452
-- And the answer is no,
-- I think you're being a bit harsh on white papers.

665
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:25,092
Yes, I'm going to be harsh on white papers because I think

666
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:30,612
writing code and creating an open source project is way more valuable to the world.

667
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:32,812
I was about to say one of the big differences,

668
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,215
you can write a white paper and doesn't have

669
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,235
to necessarily be correct to sort of work,

670
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:37,715
people read it and whatever,

671
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:39,875
whereas software and code has to be correct.

672
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:43,416
And as we've seen, you know, from this whole work from home mediated over computers,

673
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,176
a lot of stuff fell apart because you could

674
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,755
no longer plaster over the cracks of fixing stuff,

675
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:49,556
sort of with face to face conversations.

676
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,465
You know, now it's like, no,

677
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,465
we actually need to do this work correctly the first time.

678
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:54,255
That's right. That's right. But

679
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,316
as far as this whole open source thing goes,

680
00:30:56,326 --> 00:30:58,676
I think fundamentally it needs to change.

681
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:03,339
I don't think it is sustainable the way the way things are going and

682
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,660
that's not to say it's all going to fall apart and not be available.

683
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,099
I just think it's a lot of people are going to give up.

684
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:11,380
-- And
-- I feel like from my perspective, I see,

685
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,420
I feel like I see fewer young people engaging with the open source community.

686
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,339
Why would they man,

687
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,209
you do one app on the App store and it goes

688
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:22,640
viral that there is no way to get involved with open source

689
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,150
easily that actually allows you to pay your rent and buy food

690
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,060
and people and young people sort of need to do that.

691
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:28,469
Well,

692
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,719
-- old people do too
-- well. Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:32,339
But, you know,

694
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,949
but we kind of know how to get a job where we

695
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,839
can also finagle 10 or 20% of our time writing open source.

696
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:38,430
-- Right.
-- Right.

697
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,420
So, ok,

698
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,829
so it's time to go.

699
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,500
I always love starting these conversations because you never

700
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,300
know where we're going to weave our minds.

701
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,699
But I guess here's my parting thought on all of this is that

702
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:53,099
I think what we call open source today is nearing its breaking point.

703
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,780
Something has to change.

704
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,500
And I think if we don't guide the change, it's

705
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,979
going to be like an explosive eruption is what's going to happen.

706
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:06,160
And I think it will be very difficult. I don't think anyone has any good answers here.

707
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,859
I think Bruce is doing a lot like he's doing the Lord's work on this stuff.

708
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:12,670
-- Well, he's about the only one thinking about this. Actually,
-- I know

709
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:16,579
-- writing well about it in public,
-- which is slightly terrifying to me.

710
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:19,770
That's the literal open source way. There's that one time zone guy or that,

711
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,459
you know, like it's true,

712
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:26,180
like the fact that Guido Van Rossum managed to retire from Python

713
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,250
and it, it went smooth. I was quite amazed.

714
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:34,000
That's true. The open source way is one person holding up the world on their back.

715
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,390
And Bruce, we, we need Bruce's help, I think right now. But anyway,

716
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,569
I'm going to put a link in the show notes.

717
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:45,150
Go, go look at this stuff and, and if you can, Bruce asks for help in his presentation,

718
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,290
like give it if you can because I think this is a big deal.

719
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,550
So. All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
