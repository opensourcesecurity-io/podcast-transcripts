Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 31 with myself,

1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,250
-- Do you know what is interesting about the number 31?
-- Kurt? Is it prime?

3
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:17,790
It is.

4
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:18,139
It's a merc

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,649
prime, in fact, which makes it a special prime

6
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:23,750
right now. Remind me. Well, no, don't

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,979
tell me what that is because I've completely forgotten.

8
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,010
Math is hard that no.

9
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:27,750
So

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,579
-- to do
-- with rulers, it

11
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:33,069
has nothing to do with rulers. It might, I don't know.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,189
Anyway, it's basically two to the power of N minus one.

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,009
And there are a handful of primes that

14
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:40,369
fall into that category which are known as Merce

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,430
primes and

16
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,319
in the universe of prime numbers,

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,770
they are considered special for, well, for obvious reasons, right?

18
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:49,229
Because when you're dealing with

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,020
kind of the, the magic of computers, you've got powers of two.

20
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:57,130
And so basically in the case of a 32 bit integer, true to the power of, well,

21
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,439
it's not 32 bits in this case, but you get the idea, right?

22
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,099
True to the power of whatever bits minus one would basically be

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,889
a very large prime number you could represent on certain architectures,

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,230
which is, is less important today than it used to be

25
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:08,889
long.

26
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:11,519
But regardless, prime 31 how exciting,

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,889
you know, well, what really amuses me is um on my iphone when uh I go to search,

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,050
you know,

29
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:20,569
you swipe down to search for something and it does the helpful web search when you,

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,160
when you start with the letter E it immediately,

31
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,089
you know, e the irrational number

32
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,610
it like, defines it for you and pulls it up on the screen

33
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,639
and that just amuses me every time.

34
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:34,839
That is hilarious. Why would it, do you use E a lot or

35
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:35,639
no?

36
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,120
But it's just, I guess as far as letters go, that's one of the few that has like a very,

37
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:41,129
you know, like

38
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,800
a solid search result.

39
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:42,980
I mean,

40
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,160
can you imagine how many people Google for the letter E

41
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,900
because like their math class covered it and they're lost?

42
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:48,970
Maybe, I don't know.

43
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,910
I guess I never thought about it when, when I was a, we didn't have Google. So

44
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:55,889
I had to go to the library to find information.

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,650
-- This is true.
-- Right.

46
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,449
Interesting.

47
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,000
So, speaking of mathematical constants,

48
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,410
there's been an amusing bit of news from a hotel in Austria, I believe.

49
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:09,008
How is that related to a mathematical constant?

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,449
Well, things that should behave in certain, predictable ways, but then they don't,

51
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,029
uh, you mean the door locks when everybody got locked into their rooms.

52
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,710
Well, and it's not so much that, but it's the,

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,789
apparently the reason why the door locks failed.

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,130
This is interesting to me.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,860
Apparently. Ransomware is what I'm reading in this story.

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,830
Yeah, I don't, now folks to be clear,

57
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,279
I don't know if this is fake news or not

58
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,580
because apparently it's been hard to confirm this story.

59
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,910
But fundamentally, I'm, I'm going to pause it. It's believable. Right.

60
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,210
Well, I'm going to say globally speaking,

61
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:45,220
we for sure have a lot of electronic door locks which, you know,

62
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:49,139
there's been different brands that have various terrible security flaws,

63
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:50,619
like those ones with the little hole that you stick a

64
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,600
paper clip in and you can unlock them or whatever.

65
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,029
So I'm going to posit that somewhere on the planet,

66
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,990
somebody made a door lock that does not fail open

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,250
properly when the power goes out for whatever reason.

68
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,759
Right. And I think that's a believable thing.

69
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,880
You know, I, I would love to be proven wrong.

70
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,070
I really would because I, I, you know, with fire code being what fire code is,

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,179
I love the fact that if the,

72
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:11,440
you know, the power goes out,

73
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,600
I can get out of my burning hotel room and escape.

74
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:17,240
And that's kind of the idea behind failing open, right?

75
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,960
Is, is for events such as that.

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,639
Yeah, but the challenge being,

77
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,460
see,

78
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,100
my understanding of most electromagnetic locks is that

79
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,250
they're either active in the sense of the

80
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:30,919
power needs to be on for the electromagnet to work to hold the door locked,

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,309
right? And if the power fails, the electromagnetic disengages

82
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,320
and click the door opens

83
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,360
and you can all flee in an orderly manner.

84
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,270
-- Yeah,
-- and there's a lot that do work in their distance.

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,770
So in this instance,

86
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:46,619
I doubt that's the case because hotel door locks run on a small battery,

87
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,429
right?

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,720
And so, you know, realistically, well, you want to reduce power consumption.

89
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:59,009
-- So,
-- so actually I have a story about this is I was in a hotel, this happened recently,

90
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,550
maybe in November, I think it was and

91
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,179
the hotel room,

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,490
the door lock was acting up.

93
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,199
And so I go to the front desk and I say, you know that this lock is acting funny.

94
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,380
What's the deal help me out?

95
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,470
And they sent a maintenance guy to the room and I basically hung out and watched

96
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,589
him work on it and it took aa batteries like that's what powered the door lock.

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,220
It was crazy.

98
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,799
He took the whole thing apart and he was poking around at it and looking at it and yeah,

99
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:27,899
it was, I was surprised by the simplicity of how it all worked together.

100
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:31,380
Well, realistically, it's, it shouldn't be that complicated.

101
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,200
You know, it's a door

102
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,660
with Wi Fi that talks to the network that,

103
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,570
oh wait, no, that does sound like it gets kind of complicated

104
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:37,920
name

105
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,579
his last words.

106
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:43,239
But uh no, so I'm assuming these locks, obviously, you know,

107
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,399
you don't want to drain the batteries like every day.

108
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,790
So, yeah, like I, I'm, I'm pretty certain that there is a case where, you know,

109
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,600
that these will fail closed and it brings

110
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,899
to mind some interesting thoughts because for example,

111
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,119
like

112
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,200
if you do, you have a failure scenario where let's say the door lock,

113
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,429
you know, loses, um,

114
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,600
communications with sort of the master control. Do you want it to fail open?

115
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:09,709
-- Well, probably not because you could just be having a network outage,
-- right.

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,049
Well, ok, so we should also clarify though, that there are

117
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:16,500
kind of two big ifs

118
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:19,290
that, that I would say are part of this is

119
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:23,559
if you lose power or if you lose access

120
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,880
and if

121
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:25,720
you,

122
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,920
I, I guess fail closed,

123
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:32,040
you still want people on the inside to be able to open

124
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,059
the door and it sounds like that was not the case.

125
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:35,799
Yeah.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,420
Yeah, I've seen, um, I mean, typically, you know, these hotel doors have like a knot,

127
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:43,720
a handle on the inside that you can turn and I'm assuming,

128
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:47,375
you know, that just mechanically opens the door, whether it's locked or not,

129
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:49,924
right? You know, much like a crash bar on a fire door, right?

130
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:53,434
You want to be able to mechanically like, because that's the other thought, right?

131
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,434
And I guess we should make a distinction here

132
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:58,894
losing power at the lock like the batteries run down

133
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,994
versus like you know, the hotel loses power,

134
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:04,875
but obviously the doors are running on batteries so they're fine.

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,769
And so obviously, you know, if the batteries run out, I don't want to be, like,

136
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,739
locked in my room until maintenance comes by to,

137
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,459
-- you know, change the lock.
-- Right. And

138
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,420
to my, I don't think I've seen a hotel door

139
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,859
that works in that way

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,190
in the past.

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,660
I, I believe all the ones I've ever experienced have some sort of manual override.

142
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,399
Yeah, every door I've seen, I mean, it's fire code, right.

143
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,529
The,

144
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,579
the fire code basically pretty much everywhere on the planet states

145
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:36,329
that you have to be able to open the door to egress

146
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,000
without special tools

147
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,079
or keys or anything. Right.

148
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,399
Like, so basically the idea is like,

149
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,109
anybody over the age of eight can figure this out in less than 10 seconds.

150
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:48,160
No, seriously. Right. Because, you know, the little kids

151
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,880
exist as a thing, you know,

152
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,329
and, um, you know, you don't want to have like some like mechanical puzzle lock.

153
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,230
You know, here's, here's part of this story is

154
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,869
that can be true, assuming the software is working correctly.

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,510
But I could also see an instance where you

156
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,679
could conceivably forcibly lock the door with the,

157
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:12,649
the, essentially the software and you now iot lock

158
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,839
that says

159
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,829
it's locked and you will not open no matter what anyone does.

160
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,250
True, which is why there should be a mechanical override,

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,089
right? Like when you turn the knob on the inside, it should override any

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,929
electronic system even.

163
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,019
And I've seen cases where it physically,

164
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:32,399
like, for example, there's a motor to lock the lock, which can be, you know,

165
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,320
it's not very strong.

166
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,570
So you can physically,

167
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,059
like, if it was trying to lock the lock, you could physically, unless you're like,

168
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,750
really weak, you could physically open,

169
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,929
you know, turn the knob enough to like, you know, push it and get it open.

170
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,940
And, but one thing that occurs to me is like, how do you test these things?

171
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,769
What do you mean, how do you test them? You lock it and then you open the door?

172
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,640
But how do you test highly complicated systems

173
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,079
to ensure that they always fail open?

174
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:02,220
You can't, right? You can't, you can't test every possible

175
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,500
scenario with something like this.

176
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,040
-- Now, now that said this is where
-- a mechanical override would,

177
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,769
-- right?
-- Yes, there's a mechanical,

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,540
but who's testing the mechanical override,

179
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:13,220
right?

180
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,760
This is where having labs,

181
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:19,279
independent labs that test this stuff and do the research

182
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,980
make a huge difference in my opinion because they can,

183
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,779
they can basically verify

184
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,619
that. Yes, no matter what is happening on the device, it will still open.

185
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,200
If a human being touches the inside handle and and let's face it when,

186
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,659
when you deal with some of these groups

187
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,900
like underwriters labs is a great example where

188
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,359
they literally like they do crazy things to this year to test it

189
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,280
because I, I, I've known a handful of people that,

190
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,090
that have gone to work there as they were.

191
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,919
Uh, I went to, to college not far from underwriter labs.

192
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,182
So, every now and then, and they, they'd hire somebody and, yeah, like, for example,

193
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:53,692
when they have to test a light switch,

194
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:57,492
they build a little machine that turns the light switch on and off till it breaks.

195
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:58,692
That's crazy.

196
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,893
I love IKEA has those, you know, those sitting machines

197
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:02,653
that just,

198
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,482
and they've had this, the IKEA, I go to,

199
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:06,273
they've had the same chair and the same sitting

200
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,343
machine and the counter is up until like,

201
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:09,932
well into the six digits.

202
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:10,213
Now,

203
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,745
I don't know what this is. So you must educate me.

204
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,416
It's basically, it's one of those IKEA, you know,

205
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:18,056
the Swedish chairs that have like the sweeping kind of that,

206
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:19,745
that one piece of wood on the side.

207
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,346
It's kind of like a lounger.

208
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:25,866
And anyway, so it's got these two kind of pads, one to simulate,

209
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,526
I guess your butt and one to simulate you like

210
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:29,866
your back on these pneumatic arms that basically go.

211
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,745
Like here you go.

212
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,320
And it like pushes down on the seat first and then

213
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,270
pushes down on the back of the chair and then,

214
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,460
and it releases them and pulls them back to seem like somebody

215
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:43,289
is sitting down in the chair and getting back out of it.

216
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,229
And like I said, it's been there for, like, since,

217
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:49,500
well, and the IKEA has moved three times. It started out in West Ham Mall.

218
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,359
Then it moved to near South Commons or to, um,

219
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,809
near to white mud and then now to South Commons or South of South Commons.

220
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:55,940
And

221
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:58,700
I swear to God, the same chair, the same machine.

222
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,489
And like I said, it's, it's well into the six digits now, you know, and it's,

223
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,130
and the chair hasn't failed. So, like, cool. You know,

224
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,929
I actually bought one of these chairs

225
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,359
and my five year old was able to use it as a trampoline without breaking it.

226
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,349
It's nice to know that of all the constants in the world.

227
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:15,169
The IKEA sitting machine is one of them.

228
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,890
Yeah.

229
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,849
And so, yeah. But no, I agree. And, but the problem is,

230
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,760
you know, testing costs money and

231
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,919
our, you know, I buy electronics and I'll be honest,

232
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,500
I don't think I've consciously ever checked for a UL or in Canada's case, a

233
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,880
CS, a Canada safety agency, Canada.

234
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,719
It's on the back of my phone. What does it say?

235
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,830
I never check either.

236
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,159
However, when I am replacing, say switches and outlets in my house,

237
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,159
I

238
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,969
assume

239
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,250
that the hardware store is only selling UL approved gear and I'm pretty sure

240
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,700
they do because I suspect it's illegal for them to sell anything else.

241
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,090
Right.

242
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,359
You

243
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:54,539
know,

244
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:54,799
and

245
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,940
just common casual people that don't.

246
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:58,530
Right. Right.

247
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,390
Right.

248
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:03,299
And now I did buy some Z wave gear at

249
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,320
one point to start looking into like some home automation

250
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,429
and I was very particular to make sure that was UL approved because I knew that dodgy

251
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,070
Z wave gear

252
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,229
would almost certainly burn my house down. Right.

253
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,320
I mean, like,

254
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,520
-- just
-- turn the heater off in winter.

255
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,419
-- Uh,
-- these were switches like light switches.

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,859
Right. Right. And,

257
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,049
yeah, you know how that's gonna end? Right.

258
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,349
We all know how that's gonna end,

259
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,010
like fire in the wall. That's, that's what's going to happen.

260
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,369
And see, that's what I love.

261
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:38,729
So dirty secret. I actually bought a copy of the Alberta

262
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,250
Provincial electrical code and read it from cover to

263
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,510
cover and then talked to an electrician friend about it

264
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,059
because I had to do some simple rewiring in my house

265
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,349
and I wanted to make sure I did it right.

266
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,239
And it's fascinating to read the code and to see at every stage, like, literally,

267
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,849
you can just reading between the lines,

268
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,020
somebody died and here's what we did to

269
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,559
prevent that from happening again in the future.

270
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,690
You know. So things like,

271
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,849
and like, literally if your house is co

272
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,520
is up to electrical codes,

273
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,559
you can make like five or six mistakes and wreck

274
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,260
five or six things before you actually electrocute yourself.

275
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh, yeah.

276
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,799
It's,

277
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:15,099
it's remarkably difficult to burn your house down with electricity these days.

278
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,570
It's

279
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,150
assuming it's done correctly.

280
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,419
And I would note that in many cases of electrical fires,

281
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,020
it is because somebody did something they shouldn't have done.

282
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,859
He said, well, I remember when I was a kid, like electrical fires.

283
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,539
You heard about them on the news all the time?

284
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,739
And I can't remember the last time I read about an electrical fire happening

285
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,659
anywhere near where I live.

286
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,489
Just

287
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,219
in general,

288
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,059
the majority in the western world, I should say, especially in North America.

289
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,880
The majority of what fire departments spend their

290
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,719
time doing is responding to medical calls.

291
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,760
I believe that I have no doubt,

292
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,960
you know, I, I actually know some firemen and they're like, yeah, no, the,

293
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,179
the vast majority of our calls now are medical in nature. And

294
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,239
the, like, all I know is when stuff like when health

295
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,163
and condos do burn down, it actually makes the news

296
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:02,442
and it's, you know, it's rare enough that it's like a big deal. Like there was a two

297
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:03,052
house fire.

298
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:03,953
It's,

299
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:08,523
it is not common anymore and I feel like it was very common when I was a youngster,

300
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,283
-- smoking
-- in beds had something to do with it too

301
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:13,322
seriously.

302
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:13,552
Yeah,

303
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:16,833
that's fair. The smoking rate was much higher. And additionally,

304
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,385
a significant number of products that are produced now

305
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,205
have all this crazy fire retardant built into it.

306
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,406
In fact, do you ever see the, there's like a video of, of the,

307
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,776
the terrorist trying to light a,

308
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:30,046
an eu flag on fire and he couldn't,

309
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,306
it had the fire retardant material in in it

310
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:37,026
and it was like that is, that is hilarious.

311
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,926
-- Well, it's
-- like kids pajamas. Right.

312
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,659
You know, and those, uh, those Halloween costumes remember back in the eighties?

313
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:43,219
Oh, no, maybe.

314
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:46,719
Well, for those listeners just go, we'll put maybe a link in the show notes.

315
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:49,979
But Google, you know, Halloween costume fire hazard.

316
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:53,580
And it, like, it was a big deal for a year or two. I remember this.

317
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,409
Oh, man, those masks had that terrible smell.

318
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah.

319
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,099
-- Yeah, I remember that
-- kid, kids, you don't know how good you have it.

320
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,580
And I think this is actually a great example of where the system mostly worked.

321
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,750
I mean, the reality is

322
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,909
there, the number of doors I've encountered that, like,

323
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,820
don't work as expected,

324
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,619
like, when I need to exit in an emergency is like, basically zero.

325
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:22,469
I can't say I can think of a single instance of having to exit in an emergency and

326
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,119
outside of when I was in college and,

327
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,799
and we had routine fire drills at three in the morning.

328
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,090
But other than that, I, I can't think of an instance of that.

329
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:31,609
Yeah.

330
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,520
And I mean, in fairness, if you go on, like, Reddit on our OSHA or whatever,

331
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,989
you'll see people who've, like, stacked, you know,

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
pallets in front of fire doors and like,

333
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:41,049
or chained them shut in schools to keep students from, like, coming in and out,

334
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:41,450
you know,

335
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,570
and, and that's no granted that is, you know, that's a problem, but it's not,

336
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,099
you know, an inherent problem, you know, within that specific fire door.

337
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:51,710
Right. It's some idiot parked a forklift in front of it.

338
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:52,169
Right.

339
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:52,700
Right. Right.

340
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,450
And, um,

341
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,250
that's never gonna change. Right.

342
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,640
That's just like that's human nature is we make poor decisions. That is

343
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,609
terrible at operational safety and security.

344
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,340
And this will be the beauty of

345
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,609
robots taking over is the robot

346
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,580
forklift in front of the fire door, right? They're

347
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,849
more than happy to pull it 10 ft forward more,

348
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,210
which will take three extra seconds before going on coffee break.

349
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:20,780
Yeah.

350
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,099
And so like I said though, especially, I mean, with something like a door,

351
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:26,099
it's relatively easy to determine, you know,

352
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:30,630
this door has a mechanical mechanism that allows me to override it and get out now.

353
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,099
But what happens when we're talking about something more complicated,

354
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:35,270
like say the power grid or,

355
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:39,690
you know, hospital equipment or, you know, where you have failure modes.

356
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,349
And, and one of my questions commonly for these is like, what is the fail safe mode

357
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:48,099
like? Is it to turn it all off? Well, you know, if it's a pacemaker

358
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,330
that might not be the fail safe mode,

359
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:54,109
I am completely unqualified to answer this question.

360
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:58,460
And I would bet you that there are people who sort of know the answer,

361
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,609
but we probably don't know it all today and

362
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,570
it comes back to you talking about that fire code

363
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,179
that you can kind of guess why that rule

364
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,020
was added because somebody almost certainly died from it.

365
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,179
And this is how regulation of medical devices is going

366
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,260
to work is people are going to get killed or maimed

367
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,590
by these devices.

368
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,739
And every time it happens there will be

369
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,169
an investigation and they will add another rule.

370
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,599
Yeah. Well, because I know with pacemakers there's been cases.

371
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,609
So they now have pacemakers that are sort of adaptive. Like they basically

372
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,429
essentially they can sense your physical activity and then up your heart rate for it

373
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,169
so that you can go and exercise and you know,

374
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,510
your heart will pump faster and you get more blood to your system.

375
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,109
And there's been cases where this has failed and the pacemaker essentially gone to a

376
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,429
like a safe heart rate level of say 60.

377
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,799
But when you're having to physically exert yourself,

378
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,179
that's a problem and

379
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,909
you don't die in that case, right?

380
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,520
-- That sounds like a reasonable
-- safeguard

381
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,200
because then on the flip side,

382
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,289
there's been cases where people are like sitting at their desk or

383
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,500
whatever and their heart rate jacks up to like 100 and 50

384
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
that would be bad. Clearly,

385
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,270
it probably doesn't feel great, you know, and that's the problem, right?

386
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,199
Is, is especially when you have a system where the failure,

387
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,364
like the safe failure scenario

388
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,905
is constantly changing.

389
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:12,983
Like, like that's what gets me about safe self driving cars. What is the safest

390
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:16,574
fail safe in a self driving car. Do you pull over to the side of the road and stop?

391
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,584
Do you continue at speed?

392
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:19,983
Do you?

393
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:24,375
I would assume pulling over is safer than anything else?

394
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,344
Assuming there's some level of failure

395
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,868
probably.

396
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,739
But for example, uh I had the experience once when I was younger of um,

397
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,180
I was being driven, not driving.

398
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:34,339
Thank goodness it was in Britain,

399
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,410
which I hate driving there because I always feel like we're, you know,

400
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,339
-- in the wrong lane
-- because you are in the wrong lane

401
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,859
anyways, we hit heavy, heavy fog,

402
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,290
like 100 ft visibility, fog on the,

403
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,060
-- on the motorway or whatever they call
-- the

404
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,040
-- typical British
-- weather.

405
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,829
So, the question is, do you slow down or keep speed?

406
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,810
And the problem is if not everybody makes the same decision,

407
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,239
I can tell you what most people do is they do nothing.

408
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,599
-- They drive like it's a bright sunny day. Yeah,
-- exactly.

409
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,640
And so my friend kept going at the same speed.

410
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,689
His reasoning being is that cars are better designed

411
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:12,949
to handle a frontal impact than a rear impact.

412
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,709
That sounds like the most terrifying reason

413
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,109
I've ever heard.

414
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:18,790
I mean, you're,

415
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,989
you're basically playing chicken with everyone in front of you at that point,

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,189
as opposed to everybody behind you playing chicken with.

417
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:25,449
You

418
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,079
see, that's the thing, right? There's no,

419
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,819
there's, it's like a lot of things until we agree on a behavior.

420
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,839
It, it's, it's really quite unsafe.

421
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,369
You know, this is why stop signs work so well because everybody stops.

422
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,560
-- Well, no, let me rephrase, almost everybody stops.
-- You've never been to Boston.

423
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,489
Yeah.

424
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,530
But, um,

425
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,000
you know,

426
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,270
this is why traffic generally works is because everybody

427
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,750
agrees to the same rules and the same behaviors

428
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,199
in

429
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:52,680
theory.

430
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,449
So this is where actually this is,

431
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,449
this is the argument I always come back to in self driving cars is

432
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,410
you can have

433
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:04,050
kind of the, the expected norms of self driving vehicles.

434
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,050
And if one person is able to essentially hack their car and say,

435
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,349
don't stop ever again at stop signs

436
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:14,229
and all the other cars will accommodate that road car.

437
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,719
You have a problem.

438
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,400
Right.

439
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,599
Well,

440
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,780
yes and no, in that we already have that situation with emergency vehicles, right?

441
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,000
-- They're allowed to blow, but
-- that's

442
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,800
ok because they have lights and if I put blinking lights on my car,

443
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,469
they're going to arrest me.

444
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:28,719
I mean,

445
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,680
and if you, and if you start blowing,

446
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,739
if you start,

447
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,569
see, here's the thing, we already have laws against that, like driving unsafely.

448
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,500
But how are you going to? Because

449
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,959
let's face it

450
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,319
because

451
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:39,550
the

452
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:40,359
record

453
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,400
it and send it in

454
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:42,939
maybe,

455
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,449
and that could be a plausible solution to this, which I, I assume

456
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,229
privacy

457
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
implications would prevent that though.

458
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:52,219
Well,

459
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:56,140
I think that privacy implications make an assumption that people will actually the

460
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,650
majority of people will own their self driving car versus the majority,

461
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,750
I suspect the majority of people will use a self driving car service like Uber,

462
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,790
which already exists.

463
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:05,930
I tend to agree.

464
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,599
I think that is the future because first of all,

465
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:13,170
your car sits in your garage like literally 90% of the time and is not used.

466
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,849
So that's wasted time.

467
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,530
But also, I think this instance of people messing with their cars,

468
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,010
of the firmware or whatever you wanna call,

469
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,890
it is going to be the bigger danger and there's,

470
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,530
-- it's going to be really difficult to stop people from doing.
-- We already have that.

471
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,339
There's, there's been cases, um, I'll have to look it up,

472
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:32,010
but there was essentially a case where somebody

473
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,849
was driving way too fast in a residential area and killed one or more people.

474
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,260
And I believe part of the problem was they had monkeyed with their firmware in

475
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,569
their car to make it go faster and they put bigger wheels on the car

476
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:45,560
so that they,

477
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,520
um,

478
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:47,530
you know,

479
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,650
essentially their speedometer didn't report what they were

480
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,400
actually doing because the wheels were bigger.

481
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,260
Right. So,

482
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,790
you know,

483
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,969
uh, most speedometers in modern cars are basically, um,

484
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,030
you have an output speed sensor from the engine

485
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:03,079
and you have, uh, the sensor on sort of how often the wheel is turning.

486
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,229
But I mean, that sensor doesn't know how big your tire is.

487
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,890
So if you put a bigger tire on, you're,

488
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,810
you know, you're gonna go faster if you turn the wheel the same

489
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,040
speed. Right. You know, just basic physics,

490
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,030
math,

491
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,310
um, bigger circles. That's how they work.

492
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:19,449
And so, you know, he was found guilty of a variety of things.

493
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:22,890
So, you know, laws for this, like, we already have these generic blanket laws of,

494
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,869
like, don't be a jerk in public, don't, you know, drive dangerously in public,

495
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,670
don't spit on the ground,

496
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,599
but enforcement becomes an issue.

497
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,810
But I, I suspect it won't be as much of a problem because

498
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:37,270
even if, think about this for a moment, even if 1% of cars on the road

499
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,310
were belonging to a service that sold

500
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:41,369
data,

501
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,079
uh, to insurance companies or maybe made it publicly available on youtube for,

502
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,270
you know, the best of round up fail videos

503
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,569
or flat out, sent it to the police.

504
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,160
You know, like right now you can already dial 911 to report a drunk driver. Right.

505
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:59,089
So if 1% of cars are on the road enforcing laws, essentially,

506
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,359
I suspect

507
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,479
that's enough to give us pretty much blanket enforcement.

508
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,390
-- That could be, that's a really interesting way to think of it.
-- You know,

509
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,709
when you talk about these unintended consequences, I really keep coming back to

510
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,540
if,

511
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:11,160
if

512
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,270
we'll essentially live in a ubiquitous surveillance society,

513
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,660
if like 1% or more of cars are constantly watching everything.

514
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,300
That's,

515
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,859
yeah, that's very true. That's,

516
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,400
well, I mean, I think we,

517
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,880
you could argue we already live in a surveillance society.

518
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,140
I mean, every everything that takes bad

519
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,344
today, records data in some capacity,

520
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:35,625
but there's no economic incentive in most cases to upload and analyze this data.

521
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:37,564
Now, there are, is, for example, cell phones,

522
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:40,984
your your movement data is sold quote unquote anonymized

523
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,665
-- for, you know, traffic stuff,
-- huge incentive.

524
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:46,285
Now look at all the ad companies, I mean,

525
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:51,944
you think that free app you got isn't tracking where you go at, like, all times.

526
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,185
True. But

527
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,959
there's a bit of a, I mean, even a free app is only going to get so much penetration.

528
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,449
Let's face it. Self driving, cars are going to get,

529
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,339
I'm, if I had to put money on it,

530
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:04,160
I'd say about 100% penetration within 30 years at the most.

531
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,410
You know, I bet it's less than that.

532
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:09,900
Well, and I'm guessing we'll get like, 80% adoption within

533
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,780
-- a decade
-- or it'll come fast, I think. And it'll be, I,

534
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,260
I was, I was talking to somebody about this but they were,

535
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,869
they were complaining that they like to drive and it's like, yeah,

536
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,579
and I like to ride horses.

537
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,439
Right.

538
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,260
My horse isn't allowed on the interstate for some reason. Right.

539
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:27,619
Well, I think a lot of people forget too that

540
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,300
there's a huge class or there's classes rather of people

541
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,430
who

542
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,670
can't drive or want to drive

543
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,569
shouldn't,

544
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:38,880
or shouldn't drive.

545
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,589
You know, too old, can't afford a car,

546
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,260
can't afford insurance,

547
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,260
you know. Paraplegic quadriplegic blind,

548
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,540
you know, it sucks to be a blind person to wait on the bus

549
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,209
and hopefully the bus drops you off at the right spot.

550
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:53,079
Right.

551
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,670
You know, with smartphones now it's a bit better, I'm assuming.

552
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,520
But fundamentally, you know,

553
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,910
like here in winter, every time I see somebody in a wheelchair on the sidewalk,

554
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,760
I feel bad.

555
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,260
Right. Because I feel like I should go help them.

556
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,760
But at the same time it's like, I, you know,

557
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:07,630
I can't spend all day pushing this person in a wheelchair around.

558
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,239
Like, it sucks to watch them struggle.

559
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,530
Even, you know, a three inch curb with ice is like,

560
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:15,495
it's literally insurmountable in some cases and I've had to help them over the curb.

561
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:16,576
You know?

562
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,485
So you think about that, those people, they're,

563
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:20,556
they're gonna love them some self driving cars.

564
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:22,965
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna love it. I, I hate to drive

565
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,595
or more to the point being able to send my kids somewhere without

566
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:28,475
having to worry about the cabbie or the Uber driver doing something silly.

567
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:29,776
And I don't mean like

568
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:33,395
touching my kids or keeping them because actually they're welcome to that.

569
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,352
They can keep my kids, they can't touch them.

570
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:36,352
But, you know,

571
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:38,791
just getting my kid from point A to point B with

572
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:42,631
no stress and hassle without myself being involved would be awesome.

573
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,732
-- Like sending your kids to, you know, swim class or karate.
-- Right.

574
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:46,712
Right. Right.

575
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:47,822
Yeah, exactly.

576
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:48,991
And Well, so

577
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:49,192
I,

578
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:52,432
I think about this a lot actually is my kids are reaching the

579
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:55,192
age where they can start kind of doing some things on their own

580
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,459
and I would never like,

581
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:00,930
dump them in an Uber or something like that without an adult present.

582
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,589
And it's not even that I, I miss, I mistrust the Uber drivers.

583
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,209
It's that I don't need my kids being like, hey, let's stop off at the candy store on the

584
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:08,390
way,

585
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,369
you know, like, no, just freaking bring them where they need to be

586
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,130
and

587
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,650
just because they're buying you a candy bar doesn't mean it's ok to bring them there,

588
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,770
you know, something like that.

589
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,500
Yeah.

590
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,500
No, it's, uh, I remember when we were doing uncle at large once and, uh,

591
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,170
we went to an event and

592
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:26,020
the one guy stopped to gas his car and two of the kids basically got out

593
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,640
of his car and really quickly went inside

594
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,119
the grocery store and bought monster energy drinks.

595
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,959
What is uncle's at large?

596
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,199
It's big brothers, big sisters, basically. It's a Canadian version of it.

597
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:38,719
We also have big brothers, big sisters, but we have uncles at large and aunts at large

598
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,369
anyway.

599
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,599
So, yeah, so these like eight year olds or whatever got each,

600
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,760
got themselves a can of monster energy drink.

601
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,829
Needless to say that

602
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,229
-- that was a bit of a tough day.
-- I can imagine that.

603
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,910
That is awesome.

604
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,920
Yeah,

605
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:53,300
I'm tempted to do with my guys someday.

606
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:54,810
But, um,

607
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,140
no, I, I think that with the self driving cars and with the data reporting, I mean,

608
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:01,300
I hate to say this but, you know, I'm not

609
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,359
averse to the thought of like everybody who doesn't use

610
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,510
their blinkers getting a $10 fine on the spot.

611
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,459
I would love to see those people be punished in the most gruesome

612
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,390
way possible because people who don't use

613
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,729
their blinkers are terrible humans beings.

614
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,229
Yeah.

615
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:19,910
So, or what I love especially is when they indicate one way and then go the other way.

616
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,829
That's my favorite.

617
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:21,520
Yeah.

618
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:22,469
No, I, I,

619
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,300
man,

620
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,609
people are terrible drivers.

621
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,739
-- Like that's what it comes down to
-- and people are terrible in general.

622
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,579
-- Not
-- everything, not everything. We're good at certain things. But driving

623
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:34,910
one of them,

624
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,719
I bet someone will create a robot that can tie shoes better than we can.

625
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,420
We've actually, there's a better solution.

626
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,250
There's laces now there's laces,

627
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,180
they're like elastic size and they have like a hook on the end.

628
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,869
So you just, like, pull it tight and put the, the hook on

629
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,599
-- those.
-- I, I rarely tie my shoes. Actually, this is kind of one of my secrets and

630
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,310
I just despise the action of doing it because it seems so pointless to me.

631
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:00,680
And I don't know, it's just one of those things. I don't know. I can't explain it.

632
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:01,729
And

633
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,849
I've, I've seen those. I've never tried them though. I, I should someday

634
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,170
Yeah,

635
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,890
but uh no going back to how do we test these fail safe systems,

636
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,699
especially when the failure condition.

637
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:14,500
What is safe changes constantly?

638
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,910
I think a lot of it would go to actually identifying

639
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,479
like what are the fail safe conditions like the power grid,

640
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,750
for example, is a fail safe condition, we shut it down or is a fail safe condition

641
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,790
like just keep putting energy into it.

642
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:30,229
Uh No, the the power grid, this is, this is well known is when crazy things happen,

643
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,390
it turns itself off.

644
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:32,800
And, and I mean,

645
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,869
that happened with there was a huge blackout on the

646
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,479
east coast which I think even affected parts of Canada

647
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:43,020
Toronto, my uh they were doing blackout beer because all the fridges were off.

648
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:46,380
Oh nice. But yeah. Right. And, and that makes sense because

649
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,060
if you keep adding power to the grid, very bad things can start to happen.

650
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:52,949
And anyways, but I mean,

651
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,790
and then you get into medical devices and cars and all these things.

652
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:55,939
And

653
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,900
I think part of what would help is

654
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,540
to understand

655
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,119
how do we want to use these devices?

656
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,219
Like what, what is the actual use cases we want these devices to fill

657
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:11,579
and conversely what use case like what sort of behaviors do we want to avoid?

658
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:12,800
Uh I think killing,

659
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,339
killing people is bad

660
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,989
and not killing them is good.

661
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,420
Right? I think we could probably start

662
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,839
and then everything kind of falls together.

663
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:22,829
Yeah,

664
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,729
but things like property damage would, would we, for example,

665
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,949
accept property damage to trade off?

666
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,560
Say, if, you know, just there's, there's lots of, you know,

667
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:33,739
like that whole trolley problem with self driving cars, you know, does this,

668
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,250
does the self driving car swerve into the pack

669
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,079
of school kids or the pack of old people?

670
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,560
You know, that's not a valid argument in my honest opinion.

671
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:45,280
I don't think the car is going to make the conscious decision,

672
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:46,880
who should I kill,

673
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:47,719
right.

674
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:52,050
It's going to somehow have some level of avoidance.

675
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,979
And practically speaking, I think

676
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,319
a a properly constructed self driving car is never going to have

677
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,609
that issue because it's going to detect the problem so long before

678
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:05,410
it became an issue that it's going to have dealt with it. I mean,

679
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,369
that's the thing, that's the thing people don't understand

680
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,489
when you think about cars as we think about cars with our skeleton

681
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,959
covered meat bag perspective of where it takes us seconds to process events.

682
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:21,630
Did you see the video from the Tesla car where it

683
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,180
essentially detected an accident like three seconds before it happened,

684
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:25,719
right?

685
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,515
Like that is what these computers will do is they work on a level we can't comprehend.

686
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:32,234
And so

687
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,244
our attempts at kind of using our constraints

688
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:38,045
of the world to build these scenarios is totally

689
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:41,084
inaccurate because we can't even fathom this is

690
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:44,035
like saying explain the fourth dimension to me,

691
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:44,494
right?

692
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,675
You can't do it because you don't know what it is

693
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:50,900
and we can look at what's, what's the crazy shape called

694
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,099
the, the tesseract, which I find.

695
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:54,910
No, it was a hyper cube.

696
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,199
It's also known as the tesseract which they use in, in the uh uh the Marvel World.

697
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,569
And what is it, the Avengers movie?

698
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:02,770
That's what the bad guys steal, they call the tesseract.

699
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,729
And I'm like, well, crap, we can't say that anymore.

700
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,354
But like, like, right, that's a,

701
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:11,094
a three dimensional shadow of a four dimensional object.

702
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:13,954
And our brains don't know what to do with that. Right.

703
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:16,314
And that's exactly what this is with,

704
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:21,204
like self driving cars in our brains cannot comprehend the self-driving

705
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:25,125
universe because it's going to be so fast and so accurate

706
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:25,875
that

707
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,584
we just don't even know what it is.

708
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,569
Well, I'll give you that because we,

709
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,660
we've already crossed that boundary with planes, right.

710
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,939
We've gotten to the point where,

711
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,459
um, not so much with commercial planes, but with uh fighter planes,

712
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,869
fighter planes are now designed specifically to be

713
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,079
unstable so that they can turn fast.

714
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:42,500
Right?

715
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,810
You don't want a slow and stable platform.

716
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,689
You want something that like wants to turn 180 degrees in like less than a second.

717
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,670
And the reality is humans can't fly vehicles like that.

718
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,989
They will crash and die.

719
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,300
So the computers do it and,

720
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,229
and that's been the case now for something like 20 or 30 years, at least,

721
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,150
possibly more.

722
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,109
Um, so I will give you that.

723
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:02,810
Um, yeah, I mean,

724
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,989
definitely when computers are reacting in tens of milliseconds and by reacting,

725
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,560
I mean, like,

726
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,670
actually completely processing the event and determining what should be done

727
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,109
versus like, oh,

728
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,109
car in the wrong lane, huh?

729
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,140
You know,

730
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:17,640
there's a

731
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,589
flower over there. Oh, crap. The car is still in the wrong

732
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,800
people.

733
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,949
I'm getting a text.

734
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,069
Um,

735
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,310
so I'll definitely give you that.

736
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,380
So I think, and, and this, because when I see this, you know, I also see a lot of, um,

737
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:35,780
you know, I see a lot of systems where people are like, well,

738
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,119
we've identified this part of the system as being critical but

739
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,910
this other part of the system we don't think is critical.

740
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
And then, of course, you know, when something bad happens,

741
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,250
it turns out that that other part of the system does turn out to be critical or,

742
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,900
you know, somehow involved in things

743
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,020
-- in a way
-- that

744
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,880
it's like when the bad guys come in through the H VAC system, right?

745
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,390
And then, then like, hack your entire infrastructure,

746
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,680
stuff like that

747
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,859
or coming through the door locks,

748
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,099
right?

749
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,069
Oh, man.

750
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,189
You know, there's a thought, does such a thing exist as a AA battery with

751
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
a

752
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,229
Wi Fi enabled AA battery that I can remotely turn off

753
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,900
because here's a thought I stay in a hotel, swap the batteries in the lock

754
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:21,869
and then come back, say a week or two later, turn the batteries off the lock fails open

755
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,020
-- and I ransacked the room swapped the batteries back and leave.
-- Ok.

756
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,599
Well, we should probably clarify that as well. When, when I say fail open,

757
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,550
I really mean, people inside can get out but

758
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,869
you don't want people outside to get in.

759
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,790
I think the, the fail open mode where people on the outside can get in is pretty

760
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:39,640
-- sure
-- the paramedics

761
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,380
would like to get in that room

762
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:44,930
and maybe they do. But you know what? Here's the deal though.

763
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:46,660
If a paramedic needs to get in,

764
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,180
they probably, right.

765
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:51,780
They probably have one of those rams and they're just going to knock the door down.

766
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:51,849
They

767
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,500
-- call
-- the fire

768
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,849
or right. That too. Right. Whatever or main

769
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,869
and

770
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,589
true. No, that's a good point.

771
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,709
Yes. It, it's complicated now, a, a Wi Fi enabled battery,

772
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,890
if they don't exist, they almost certainly will at some point.

773
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,459
And it sounds like the dumbest thing ever,

774
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:10,569
which means you'll totally be able to buy them in a couple of years.

775
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:17,260
Uh, for those of you that can't hear me. That was me typing and, oh, look at that. 2015,

776
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,229
they exist

777
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,270
Roost Wifi battery for smoke and seal alarms. It's a nine volt

778
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,689
battery.

779
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,069
Uh,

780
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,349
uh, what now,

781
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,089
I think the premise is that it warns you if the battery is dying.

782
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:33,380
No,

783
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,380
no, it's a smoke alarm.

784
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,390
It's not a, it's a smoke alarm,

785
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,560
not an actual battery.

786
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,030
It's, I'm so confused.

787
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,479
We'll put something in the show notes if this actually exists.

788
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,530
It's

789
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:48,569
a, oh God.

790
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,359
Yep.

791
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,469
Yep. Oh, Jesus.

792
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:56,630
-- It's a $35.09 volt battery with Wi Fi
-- I'm interested.

793
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,579
This sounds awesome. Is

794
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,780
it rechargeable at least?

795
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,839
Oh, bloody well, better

796
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,280
for $35.

797
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,570
Uh, it's got a family friendly.

798
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,560
But have you seen that they have those Wi Fi enabled SD cards? Right? I mean,

799
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,489
-- this is totally believable
-- but for like cameras and stuff that makes sense, right?

800
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,389
Because you want to, you know, get the data off the

801
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,320
being. You can like literally cram wi Fi into anything, right?

802
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,228
It's small enough, you can put it into a battery.

803
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:28,800
You

804
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:29,870
well, but

805
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,719
-- like my Nintendo wii your
-- Nintendo wii uses nine volt batteries.

806
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,958
No, no, it uses SD cards. But

807
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:37,929
you know

808
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:39,958
-- what about it? I
-- mean,

809
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,149
there's devices that you can stick an SD card in that are

810
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,938
not capable of retrofitting and cameras are a good example of that,

811
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,080
right?

812
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,199
Because people have some pretty expensive, you know,

813
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:52,080
digital DS LRS from prior to the Wi Fi and everything revolution.

814
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,330
And why do I want to put a Wi

815
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,899
Fi SD card in my

816
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,739
-- wi so
-- you can transfer the data to your laptop wirelessly while you're shooting.

817
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,229
I'm shooting my wii

818
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:01,659
or

819
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,229
no, no, no, sorry the camera when you're shooting with the cameras.

820
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,189
I understand that purpose

821
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,649
and then you mentioned the Nintendo wii and now you've confused me.

822
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,800
Sorry, I apologize.

823
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,600
It's all right.

824
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:15,229
You know, I'm not opposed to the idea of a nine volt battery being able to signal that.

825
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,570
Hey, I'm like dying,

826
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:18,229
you know, please replace me.

827
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:22,969
But, um, 35 bucks for a nine volt battery seems a bit pricey, especially, like,

828
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:23,929
as you said, you know.

829
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,379
Yeah, pretty much every smoke alarm I've ever owned.

830
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:29,850
Like, goes absolutely bonkers when the, when the battery starts to die,

831
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,389
whatever, man, $35 for an IOT battery. That sounds like awesome

832
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,169
right there.

833
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,449
Yeah.

834
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,840
Yeah. Awesome.

835
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:41,040
You should get some and then tell me how cool they are,

836
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,550
you know, you want to.

837
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,840
Oh, I, so don't,

838
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:50,540
-- I was at Best Buy the other day and looking at some of the IOT stuff and, oh,
-- man,

839
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,419
just don't look, don't look because it is nightmare fuel and we all know

840
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,459
what it actually means for humanity.

841
00:35:58,629 --> 00:35:58,969
Yeah.

842
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,820
Right. Just don't do it.

843
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,800
So, speaking of all these, uh,

844
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,469
sort of health and safety and emergency exits that work safely, you know,

845
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,820
one problem I've run into a couple of times related to this is

846
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,110
how do we handle credentials safely in a way that is sort of more fail closed so that,

847
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,030
you know, bad guys can't get a hold of them.

848
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,189
I think the answer is to not use encryption or authentication

849
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,969
and just make them wide open so anybody can connect to the device

850
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,830
and that's fine

851
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,899
that

852
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,620
-- more in the case
-- the mir about

853
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,179
it, right.

854
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, I mean more in the case of where you have um a service needs a password,

855
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,320
for example, to access a remote other service like a database.

856
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,439
So you have, you know,

857
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,409
and, and this is a common problem I'm seeing in the IOT space is that, you know,

858
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:49,159
essentially by definition, every IOT device needs to go talk to some, you know,

859
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:54,030
mothership to send data to get updates to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah things.

860
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,399
Right.

861
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,810
Um,

862
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,209
and with IOT, it's generally a bit less of a concern but, you know, with,

863
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,530
with more traditional applications where, you know, I got to talk to a database

864
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,050
and, you know, you, you don't want somebody breaking into the application,

865
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,669
stealing the password and then going and hosing

866
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,929
your database at a later date or whatever.

867
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,419
And so, yeah, how do we kind of have these systems

868
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,629
where you have the credentials available to the system?

869
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,570
But, you know, in a safe and secure manner?

870
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:20,679
Yeah, I mean, this is,

871
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:23,850
this is a really hard problem actually is I remember a long time ago,

872
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:27,010
the answer was to just hard code credentials into everything

873
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:27,649
and

874
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:30,340
that totally doesn't work. Especially not at scale.

875
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:33,439
-- Well, yeah, especially if you want to be able to change those credentials.
-- Right.

876
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,280
Right. Exactly.

877
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,770
And so there's kind of two things that I see happening around this

878
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,689
now is if you're talking about client authentication to like a mothership,

879
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:44,469
like you were saying,

880
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,909
that's where using certificates

881
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:51,989
is fantastic. And ideally, certificate pinning is the option you want to use.

882
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,300
But even just using like general TLS certificates

883
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,550
with the existing C A infrastructure is

884
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,709
that's probably good enough for most instances, right?

885
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:02,909
I mean,

886
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:04,639
you can do like some self signed certificates

887
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,270
with pinning and some other things like that,

888
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,810
but generally speaking, uh whatever you don't really need that.

889
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,090
But then there's the issue of how do you store,

890
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,169
say passwords to unlock hard drives in your data center, right?

891
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:20,300
You've got literally thousands of machines and

892
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,320
your options when it's time to reboot them

893
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:27,719
all is to pay the intern on Friday night to type password 75,000 times or

894
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,580
you come up with some way to safely store the secrets

895
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:32,659
somewhere

896
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,780
and then obviously get them back and, and that's hard to do.

897
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:38,620
That's, that's what really what this boils down to is we, we want

898
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,000
it to be automated,

899
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,500
right? So, yeah, like you said, we can reboot systems or restart them

900
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,830
without having to have somebody like physically log in and type a password in.

901
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,780
And so I, I know one thing you've advocated is you sort of split the secret,

902
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,679
right? You have say the secret and you have it encrypted

903
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:57,469
and then you have a key for that elsewhere that and you

904
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,919
just make sure you don't back them up onto the same system

905
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:03,239
or, you know, you, you essentially split it a little bit to, you know,

906
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,939
so the attacker would have to get two systems or two things now.

907
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:08,219
Right. I've, I've seen that as

908
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:09,979
the way it works.

909
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,070
I've seen instances where you just make like a,

910
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:18,570
you know, an HTTP request to some sort of secret server.

911
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:19,419
It's,

912
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,489
there's a number of solutions that exist around this or like

913
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,379
the T PM in a machine T PM consume passwords.

914
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:26,909
There's

915
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,830
many ways to do it. But the bigger problem isn't so much how you do it.

916
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,889
It's the fact that

917
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:34,360
you have to make sure this is a resilient

918
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,969
system because if you lose your secret store,

919
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:39,050
now your data center doesn't work.

920
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,560
That's a huge problem.

921
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,750
Yeah,

922
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,250
and I'm, I've, I've seen cloud,

923
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,239
this has actually become a bit less of a problem in the sense of if you sort of embrace,

924
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,080
embrace that cloud ideal of, you know, we don't reboot or restart,

925
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,679
we just deploy new infrastructure and turn the old stuff off.

926
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:57,280
You know, as part of your cloud infrastructure,

927
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,310
you have it obviously sending configuration details and you know,

928
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,979
that can include secrets like passwords and whatnot.

929
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:07,780
But ultimately, you know, then your cloud control system has to have some, you know,

930
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,040
you, you really don't want that being attacked and compromised.

931
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,270
So,

932
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,010
you know, at some point somewhere you either have to,

933
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,050
you have like the ultimate secret

934
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,649
the ultimate password that, you know, you then, you know, like,

935
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,520
like using last pass where you

936
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,810
have that ultimate password that controls everything

937
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,409
and, you know, encrypts everything within your last pass,

938
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,370
you know, and if you lose control or access to that, you are.

939
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:28,570
Yeah, totally up the creek.

940
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,360
And so I'm,

941
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,159
I'm wondering if part of me thinks that centralizing this actually

942
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:37,580
makes sense because then you only have one thing to defend.

943
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,389
I won't, I won't disagree. And not only that you can log every request.

944
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,110
And the thing is when you're dealing with something like a secret store,

945
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,649
what I think a lot of people forget is

946
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,760
the intent isn't necessarily to stop. Absolutely.

947
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,270
Every bad guy that's trying to get at this, it's to maintain control.

948
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,550
So

949
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,520
like, for example,

950
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,949
you might have a machine that goes rogue and starts requesting passwords,

951
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,449
it's not supposed to have and you will know

952
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,810
exactly what was requested and when it was requested,

953
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,020
if you have a centralized secret store,

954
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,979
whereas if you have a bunch of these passwords on disk or whatever

955
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,030
and, and even if they're confiscated on disk, for example,

956
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,389
which I know is sometimes lets you pass your controller on this

957
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,449
is

958
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:27,739
even, then you won't necessarily know who accessed what and how,

959
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,899
which is a huge problem because you ha you lack that auditability.

960
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,939
Is that a word auditability?

961
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,590
Uh Pretty sure,

962
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,030
not,

963
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:37,560
not,

964
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:40,550
that's one thing I've I've encountered now, you know, for example,

965
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,080
with using Amazon web services and enabling cloud trail, right,

966
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,330
which is their auditing service.

967
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:49,639
And now every single interaction with Amazon web services is locked

968
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,909
and even better yet,

969
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:54,909
they have a way to set the logging so that it'll show evidence of tampering, right?

970
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,030
I assume they just signed the entry.

971
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:59,540
And if you know you delete entries, then the chain of entries is broken.

972
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,959
So the beauty is even if I or one of the other super admins goes around, at

973
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:05,149
least we'll know somebody monkeyed with the log,

974
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,570
which of course would be a huge red flag, right.

975
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:08,540
Right there. Right.

976
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,270
And so, you know, I think that and, and the reality is data storage is so cheap now,

977
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,389
there's no excuse not to log everything.

978
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:15,620
I

979
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,310
agree,

980
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:16,800
you know,

981
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,090
-- inexpensive storing data is
-- now, I remember doing an article about TCB dump and,

982
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,379
and I,

983
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,909
and this was a few years ago, crunching the numbers on essentially,

984
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:29,570
what would it take to keep, like, say a 30 day buffer of gigabit of network traffic?

985
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,340
Like to literally have a system that just keeps a ring buffer of

986
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,389
the last 30 days of network traffic coming over your gigabit link.

987
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,310
And the answer is it's affordable, you know,

988
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,459
and from a security perspective, like

989
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:42,399
it's kind of useless now because everything's encrypted.

990
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,080
Right. Right. Which is

991
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,350
the beauty of it, to be honest with you, because

992
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,080
we've reached a point where you can't necessarily trust anything on your network,

993
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,870
which is at zero trust networking model.

994
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,979
But even then, you know, even if everything is still encrypted,

995
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,989
you'd still have the metadata, you know,

996
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,399
they went out to these Russian IP S at three in the morning

997
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,229
every day,

998
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,889
you know, for two weeks,

999
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:04,800
right.

1000
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,780
Um So there's still value in that.

1001
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,939
But I mean, that's,

1002
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:12,320
uh I remember when heartbleed came out and it was a big deal in Canada because the,

1003
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,899
you know, the revenue Canada had to shut down

1004
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,179
the tax filing site.

1005
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,330
And what was really amazing to me is they came out on

1006
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,050
the news and I think it was the number was 181.

1007
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:22,760
Um

1008
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,840
But basically revenue Canada was able to come out and say we shut the

1009
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,909
site down and there were 181 people affected by this and we're informing them

1010
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:33,310
and my response was what like, wait, they,

1011
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,020
so like they keep enough logs and auditing that they were able to go

1012
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,449
to everybody that had accessed their site and like mail them a thing saying,

1013
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:43,729
-- you know, you may have been affected by this
-- or did they make it up?

1014
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:50,030
I revenue Canada doesn't, they're generally very boring and they, you know, it's,

1015
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,790
yeah,

1016
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:54,719
II I generally trust them, like when they say I owe them X amount, they,

1017
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:55,879
they've never been wrong.

1018
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,239
That's fair, you know.

1019
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,959
Um but you know, when you think about it from, like,

1020
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:03,320
being the tax people that level of auditing makes sense.

1021
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,750
You know, because no doubt they're also dealing with people who are, like,

1022
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,310
doing all sorts of financial shenanigans or, or claiming, oh, you know,

1023
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,969
I logged into your website but then, like, it ain't my payment.

1024
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:12,419
I

1025
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:13,060
totally,

1026
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,370
yeah, I totally,

1027
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,750
I totally clicked that button but nothing happened,

1028
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:17,389
you know.

1029
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:22,189
So, just from that, you know, like these people have a history of, like, you know,

1030
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,439
records mean we can catch you.

1031
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,929
Yeah, that's, that is true. That's a very good,

1032
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,750
that's how they got Al Capone, right.

1033
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:30,429
They got him on tax fraud.

1034
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:34,370
Yeah. So, is he an insurance salesman or something, I think?

1035
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:36,250
Yeah. Right. So,

1036
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:36,959
exactly.

1037
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,479
Yeah. No. But, um,

1038
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:41,050
so going back to this, I mean, it's, it's,

1039
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:41,580
I,

1040
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:45,090
that's one thing I would like to see is a better, you know, because for example,

1041
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,120
I have my, um,

1042
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:48,989
the hard drives on my file server are encrypted

1043
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:50,889
and so, like, every time I reboot

1044
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,810
I,

1045
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:56,879
you know, have to log in and enter this huge long password and, like, you know,

1046
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:57,840
if I ever forget

1047
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:58,000
it

1048
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:01,800
here. So here's the question is, what is your threat model

1049
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,070
in this instance?

1050
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:07,360
My threat model is me forgetting to wipe the hard drives or

1051
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,679
the hard drives failing so much so that I cannot wipe them,

1052
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:11,959
but I

1053
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:15,540
-- have to throw them out.
-- So here's what you actually can do in that instance.

1054
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,830
And this is, you know, fun tips to Josh is

1055
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,719
you can encrypt the drive

1056
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:23,179
and then either use no password

1057
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,320
which should unlock it automatically with locks, assuming you're using Linux

1058
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:30,040
or just, you know, hard code the password into your boot options.

1059
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:34,219
And what happens then is all you have to do is wipe like the first one K of dis

1060
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,370
-- and that's where the key
-- crypto

1061
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:36,360
shredding thing

1062
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,620
you, right.

1063
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:40,280
As long as you can get rid of that first one K of disk,

1064
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,370
the rest of the disk is essentially random data at that point.

1065
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:44,979
Yeah.

1066
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:46,500
No, I've thought about that, but to be honest,

1067
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,229
I reboot my file server so rarely that it's just a non

1068
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,590
-- issue. I don't
-- even want to think about how long mine's been out.

1069
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:55,969
It's every time I reboot it, it's, it's horrible because I, I've not disabled

1070
00:45:56,709 --> 00:45:57,030
checking the

1071
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:57,860
on

1072
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,429
and I hate to say that's one of the reasons I went to um ZFS is FCK on 20 plus terabytes.

1073
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:09,860
-- I just don't, I literally don't have time for that.
-- Oh man, 535 days.

1074
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:13,139
So uh

1075
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,899
yeah. Well, hopefully there's no local Attackers executing Colonel.

1076
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,030
I had

1077
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,330
no

1078
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,449
important data on that system

1079
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:25,699
and I do that on purpose because I have a very zero trust sort of model.

1080
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,139
And so even if an attacker got in intalled all of that data, they would

1081
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,830
really, other than like kids DVD S, there's not a lot there.

1082
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,149
My concern would be more an attacker,

1083
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,790
inserting data than my other systems than process and get compromised.

1084
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,770
I'm not gonna say that's impossible.

1085
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,469
But generally speaking again, we've got watching videos which is pretty, in fact,

1086
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:52,070
we don't even do that anymore because now Netflix has so much content on it.

1087
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,149
We don't, we haven't even

1088
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,580
used my file store of DVD S and

1089
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,510
probably years I should,

1090
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,959
I should actually start logging access to those files and I bet I would.

1091
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:02,399
I

1092
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:02,560
be

1093
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:04,840
right.

1094
00:47:04,979 --> 00:47:05,169
That's

1095
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:05,459
true.

1096
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:05,719
This

1097
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:05,850
is

1098
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,030
a problem I'm having with the,

1099
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,250
this is one of the issues I'm looking at for the CV E database is we're going to allow

1100
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,270
uh more CNAs

1101
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:15,419
and, you know,

1102
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:17,320
currently the majority of CNAs are

1103
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,219
relatively high trust individuals and organizations.

1104
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:24,520
But as we expand it, you know, we, we get into the more dodgy parts of the world,

1105
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,429
which is good because we want those people to report security flaws.

1106
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,889
But you know what happened? And we have, we're going to be using a

1107
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,760
Json format and it's one of, it's funny, one of the miter guys is like, why,

1108
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,350
why did you pick

1109
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,760
JSON over XML? I'm like

1110
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,669
XML and I send him back.

1111
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,189
Well, I send him back the link, you know,

1112
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:43,604
cv.miter.org/what. Is it like search blah, blah, blah, question mark equals XML.

1113
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:44,324
And I'm like,

1114
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,864
there's just too many flaws in XML parsers for

1115
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:50,014
me to safely handle XML data for random people.

1116
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:56,064
So, regardless of the security flaws, like parsing XML is a pain in the butt. Parsing

1117
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:56,405
Json

1118
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,274
is painfully simple.

1119
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:00,764
Yeah. Well, and more to the point is human readable.

1120
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:01,344
Right.

1121
00:48:01,354 --> 00:48:04,804
Even if you don't have a processing system, a human being can sit down and, like,

1122
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:05,665
look at the data.

1123
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,409
Um, but anyways, and, you know, so that was the, the first part was just, yeah, XML.

1124
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:15,649
Very complex. Lots of security flaws just wow, you know, so much, not fun.

1125
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,729
And, but then the second thing is as well with, you know, this the CV stuff,

1126
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,010
one of my concerns is I want people to be able to provide artifacts like say,

1127
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:26,560
you know, here's a sample of the,

1128
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:26,770
the

1129
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:30,610
the affected source code or here is a test case or here is,

1130
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,459
well, for example,

1131
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:33,570
there's been kernel exploits where you need a kernel module to

1132
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,250
help make the exploit more reliable because it's a race condition,

1133
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,080
you know.

1134
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,169
So instead of it happening one in a billion times, it happens one in 100 times.

1135
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,790
Well, and then the question becomes, you know, like, well, websites go up,

1136
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,919
they go down, who knows?

1137
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:49,939
So we're, you know, I'm gonna have a way for people to embed these files within the

1138
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,560
JSON data, right?

1139
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,840
So that we don't have to worry about their websites being up or down,

1140
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,260
you know, and then it becomes like PDF S oh Lord,

1141
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,750
I hate opening PDF S from random people nowadays.

1142
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,310
You know, because

1143
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,679
seriously,

1144
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,219
you know, my my response is to open them in Google docs

1145
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,010
and have Google docs render them for me, you know, on their website back end thing,

1146
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,290
which I assume is sandboxed all the heck because you know,

1147
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,129
no doubt people are trying to attack it all the time.

1148
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,360
You would think so.

1149
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,280
And, but this raises the question of how do I safely provide data?

1150
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,260
And you know, I've had to ask questions of like back to this fail safe, fail open.

1151
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,300
Do I want to have the case where all the data can be

1152
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,959
scanned by an antivirus scanner or do we specifically want to have,

1153
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:27,719
for example,

1154
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,899
a password protected zip file with the password included in the

1155
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:31,649
JSON file

1156
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:35,860
because we'll have samples that trigger antivirus and get blocked

1157
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,360
and people need this CV data,

1158
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:40,800
you know.

1159
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:41,719
And then,

1160
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,110
so what I've decided is we're going to go with some

1161
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,459
data formats that unless you sort of explicitly process them,

1162
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,399
they, they don't get processed,

1163
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,679
right? Like it'll be a string of text in the

1164
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,320
JSON

1165
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,110
which well, I'm sure some

1166
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:55,719
Json parser can puke on that.

1167
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,149
But,

1168
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,810
you know, realistically we'll put them essentially through a transform,

1169
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,310
like say you, you encode them

1170
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:03,429
so that they should be safe

1171
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,750
and then when you explicitly start processing them, then you would have to worry,

1172
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,350
you know, it's kind of like that old thing where you would take a file, save it as word,

1173
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,679
save it into text and then save it back to word

1174
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:16,760
and you, you're for sure you've gotten rid of the virus,

1175
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:18,199
you know,

1176
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,199
but you know,

1177
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:20,919
these are questions now that we're going to be sharing

1178
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:23,860
lots more data and lots more potentially dangerous data.

1179
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,260
You know, how do we do this? Because we actually want to share unsafe data, right?

1180
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,000
That, that by its nature is what security stuff can be.

1181
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:31,850
Um You know,

1182
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,989
there's a famous case where one of the CV descriptions

1183
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,639
had the example of the regular expression code in it

1184
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:40,639
that triggered the flaw and it actually broke somebody's CV E processing system.

1185
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:40,899
I remember

1186
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,290
that we talked about that a couple

1187
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,629
of weeks ago, you know,

1188
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:44,370
um

1189
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,540
and so at that point, I mean, you know,

1190
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:51,139
-- the reality is any, any type of data will break some system somewhere,
-- no doubt,

1191
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:51,629
no doubt.

1192
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:55,750
And I guess this is why we kind of plan for failure

1193
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,030
because if you don't,

1194
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:00,429
you, you're going, I guess ironically you fail if you don't plan for failure.

1195
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,169
Yeah. Well, and there's a perfect example, I've decided for leap seconds. CV E

1196
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:08,850
like uh your system should accept leap seconds

1197
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,479
and then round them down.

1198
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,209
And so essentially, if you're taking the data in and then sending it onwards,

1199
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,560
you should get rid of leap seconds because we, we honestly, there's,

1200
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,439
we don't need luckily that level of granularity and

1201
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:26,270
accuracy in CV data, like if we're off by one or two seconds, typically,

1202
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,679
that just won't matter at all,

1203
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,669
you should just stop using seconds. Seconds are silly.

1204
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,159
And

1205
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:36,989
I've thought about that, but there are cases where we, we actually sort of need that

1206
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:39,020
uh, granularity to some degree. But

1207
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,389
I think it's safer to assume, like to essentially

1208
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:45,209
make that decision of, you know, because here's the point.

1209
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,620
If we don't accept seconds, then I can't say use

1210
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:48,139
is

1211
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,929
0 86 01 time stamps.

1212
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,649
Then we have to do, I have to define some wonky time stamp format, which

1213
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,629
I'm not qualified to do that.

1214
00:51:57,229 --> 00:51:58,340
-- Right.
-- And even if it's

1215
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,149
quote

1216
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,280
unquote as simple as just drop seconds.

1217
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,979
I know,

1218
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:02,550
I

1219
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:03,649
know, I understand.

1220
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,000
So I'd rather be as standards compliant as I can be.

1221
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,100
And with, you know, like what Google and Amazon do where they just,

1222
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,979
they, they sort of,

1223
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,139
um, I think what is it,

1224
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:15,620
Amazon does it over a period of a week where they increase

1225
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:18,370
the length of a second or decrease the length of a second by

1226
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:22,760
uh one over what 86,400? That's how many seconds are in the week

1227
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:24,379
slid the clocks,

1228
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:29,389
they skew the clock slightly. And so at most, you're only ever a half second out,

1229
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,909
which is pretty clever, in my opinion.

1230
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,110
It is. It is. And I think this is a beautiful place

1231
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:39,939
to say that these poor people listening are nearly an hour out of their lives.

1232
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,379
So why don't,

1233
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:43,979
why don't, why don't we wrap it up here

1234
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,320
and say thanks folks for listening. We certainly appreciate it.
