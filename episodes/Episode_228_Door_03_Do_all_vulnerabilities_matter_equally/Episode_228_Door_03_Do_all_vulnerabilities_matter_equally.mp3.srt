0
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,809
-- Whatever. Start the episode.
-- I'm gonna start eating popcorn again.

1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,019
-- Yeah, the
-- episode start. No, you can't eat popcorn

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:05,940
anyway.

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:07,469
I'm leaving all that.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,859
I'm leaving it all in. It's all staying

5
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:10,109
in.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,859
Welcome to December 3rd. Everybody

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,659
says podcast door. Number three.

8
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,620
-- Number three.
-- Ok.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,590
-- So,
-- actually I

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,459
felt some nightmares. This isn't an aim calendar.

11
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:26,260
I can't laugh and do this. Uh, a third of known computer security

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,729
flaws have no solution and I would argue

13
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,610
it's obviously much higher than that because

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,709
like the CV database, for example,

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,750
a lot of people think that CV S have to have

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,790
a security fix to go into the CV database and like,

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,970
no, no, they don't.

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,529
Uh, how do I put this nicely?

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,529
The vast majority of security flaws don't matter enough for

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,650
the project or vendor to actually actively go out and fix them.

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,610
Yeah, I think, I think that's the two sides of it.

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,740
Absolutely.

23
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,139
And so

24
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,159
the other thing is

25
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,659
when, uh, so known computer security flaws,

26
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:01,650
like there are lots of known computer security flaws.

27
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,689
Like perfect example, back in the day, the Linux,

28
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:09,660
the, the, whatever the cloud in it, stuff that, like, set up your cloud image.

29
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,889
Long story short

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
root had no password,

31
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,019
which was fine because you couldn't log in his route and you could su space dash.

32
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:17,233
You're rude.

33
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,892
And I remember seeing that and being like, oh, that's stupid. Whatever.

34
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:25,112
I better like either set a root password or disable pseudo blah, blah, blah.

35
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,572
And then like two years later, somebody reports it to Amazon.

36
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:31,292
Amazon reports it to Red Hat and it was an ungodly mess

37
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:32,763
because it actually mattered, right?

38
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:37,002
It was actually like a real problem for a lot of people and it got fixed.

39
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:42,096
But fundamentally, like I saw it two years earlier and was like, oh, this is stupid.

40
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:44,835
I'm just going to go set a password. I never thought to raise the alarm.

41
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:47,875
And that was actually the moment I learned the expression, if you see something,

42
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:53,015
say something, you know, like dial 911 really matters, like really super matters.

43
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:57,856
And so I suspect there's a lot of security flaws that are known to somebody,

44
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,230
but they didn't bother to file security flaw against the project.

45
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,830
There's, there's some of that I can,

46
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,879
I've got two great examples actually that just came up in recent,

47
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:09,990
recent history where so there was one node module named trim.

48
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,000
And generally speaking,

49
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,139
this is this is something that just takes whitespace out of strings

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,720
-- like it trims the whitespace is what you're saying,
-- right?

51
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:18,899
It's literally all it does.

52
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,860
And you're thinking, how does this possibly have a security issue.

53
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:23,339
Had a denial of service problem where you can give it a certain type.

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,089
They were using a regular expression that was broken. I know. I know.

55
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:29,369
Yeah, for real.

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,529
But anyway, basically what it ended up being is it was essentially in a

57
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,039
package and

58
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,119
I went to the node Upstreet or the N PM people.

59
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,440
-- Well,
-- because it's, it's a finished package in the sense of like,

60
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,369
does it trim whitespace?

61
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,279
Yes. Well, what else is it going to do? That's it, it trims whitespace.

62
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,080
-- The original
-- owner, like, didn't care.

63
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,479
And so it was like, ok,

64
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,440
we need to do something about this and eventually the NPM people took care of it,

65
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,110
but it, it definitely took some effort.

66
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,399
I mean, it was multi hours of work on part to get this sorted out,

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,229
which seems silly when you think about

68
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:58,360
it.

69
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,210
And so you've got an instance where you have

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,639
an upstream that either doesn't exist or doesn't care.

71
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:07,020
And likewise, there is also one where I submitted APR to the J Ruby folks

72
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,270
because there was, there's this thing they ship called web. It's a Ruby web server. J

73
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:16,210
Ruby contains a whole bunch of stuff from Ruby and like, they didn't even know Webre

74
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,320
had a problem

75
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,149
-- and it showed up and I'm like, you know what I'm, well, how
-- would they know?

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,460
-- Well,
-- exactly,

77
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,259
-- like, let's link to the show note on S bomb. Yeah.
-- Right.

78
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,000
And So, anyway, basically I just, I'm like, screw it.

79
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,039
I'm just going to send them a pull request because it's

80
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,699
less work than trying to even ask them if they care.

81
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,300
And,

82
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,580
and so I think,

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,410
I think it's higher than a third for sure.

84
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,820
And I think this is one of those instances where if people actually care,

85
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,570
people need to step up and do something about it.

86
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,020
Well, and no, I disagree.

87
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,139
They don't need to do something about it in the sense of they

88
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:48,190
need to fix it because that implies they're going to fix it.

89
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,860
People need to just step up and notify the project, file a bug.

90
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,240
-- Well, right. That's part of it. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
-- Well, no, no, no.

91
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,979
-- But I just say do something about it makes it sound like they need to fix it.
-- No.

92
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,660
No, not the project me, like me. I care about Webre

93
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,169
all of a sudden it is my responsibility to see that to the end.

94
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,479
-- Or I say, I don't care whatever one or the other. Yeah.
-- Exactly. Yeah.

95
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,559
Either you care enough to at least tell them

96
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,540
and, or fix it or, yeah, fundamentally you see it, you ignore it.

97
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,660
Well, there's your answer. Yeah.

98
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,130
And then this is even more difficult now because of all

99
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,720
the automated scanners are flagging this crap all over the place.

100
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:25,350
And

101
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:30,320
I would bet you 95 to 99%

102
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,204
are in the, no one really needs the care category.

103
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,725
-- I'm
-- going
-- to close the episode out with this.

104
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,964
Do you think any of those automated scanners that are finding these things?

105
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:41,225
Make sure that they told the project or vendor about it?

106
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,445
They never tell them, they never do. And it's not, they don't care.

107
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:48,065
Their job is to hand you a phone book of a report to show their value.

108
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,644
That is their value.

109
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:51,864
Well, we'll, we'll put value in quotes.

110
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,885
-- But, yeah,
-- so the moral of the story is that, uh, yeah, I mean,

111
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,285
this is normal and it's ok.

112
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:59,084
I guess we'll see you on December 4th.
