Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode

1
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:11,279
40 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:12,010
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,159
-- Kurt,
-- do you know what's special about the number 40?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,100
That's how old I turn this year. No, nothing, nothing is special about 40.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,059
That's the beauty of it. We are monkeys with 10 fingers. So we always say

6
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,340
numbers that end in zero have meaning but they don't.

7
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,090
So

8
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,030
they're also used to avoid by 10,

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,819
which is only important because we are monkeys with 10 fingers.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,419
See,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,590
-- that's right.
-- Anyway, it's awesome.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,490
Right.

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,270
Very good.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,330
So, I am going to start this show with a bit of a rant

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,270
and then I'm gonna tie it into

16
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,409
a discussion.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,939
We had a couple of days ago about security teams and not shipping software.

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,799
All right. So,

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,720
so my son comes home from school yesterday

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,459
and has an assignment from his teacher of

21
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,189
no screen time all weekend.

22
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,549
And they're supposed to be talking about, uh,

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,549
addiction or drugs and alcohol or whatever.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,559
I can kind of understand where this is gonna go because like

25
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,889
every kid is gonna fail and they had a terrible weekend,

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,400
whatever.

27
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,849
And it's like, oh, but that's how addiction works everybody.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,970
And it got me thinking

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,470
that

30
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:12,519
food addiction

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,069
uh

32
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,139
sure.

33
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,660
-- But, but here's the point
-- we all have to eat fundamentally.

34
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:17,050
We,

35
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,610
yes, that, yes, you're actually on to exactly where I'm going with. This is that

36
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,989
it's occurred to me

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,830
that asking someone to not use screens

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,459
is insane in this day and age because these have become

39
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:35,029
part of society in our lives. Like an example is

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,989
when,

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,949
when we wanted to look up some information,

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,239
how do you do that?

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,680
You grab a screen and you go to Google and now when I was a kid, if we did that,

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,919
we would go to the encyclopedia and spend, you know, like,

45
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,239
like two hours trying to maybe find something that we've never actually found.

46
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:49,339
You know what I mean?

47
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,599
Is, this is like, it, it is a part of life now that you cannot escape.

48
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,239
I would view this as telling someone you can't use electricity all weekend long.

49
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,300
We'd be like, that's dumb.

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:01,989
No.

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,690
You know, now if it was with the caveat,

52
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,720
you can't plug anything into the wall for the weekend.

53
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,619
I'd be like, ok, cool. I can live with that,

54
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,309
you know, because I can use my phone in a batter.

55
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:10,729
Yeah.

56
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:11,319
And that's

57
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,369
bills.

58
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,108
Right. Exactly. That's just it. Right.

59
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,179
In fact, I was just, I, I,

60
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:18,738
I've got to get my taxes done and I was just on my computer printing stuff off.

61
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,708
I'm like, that's how it works. Right. That is,

62
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,458
-- in fact, I was thinking this is a nuisance.
-- I

63
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:24,259
submit it electronically.

64
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:24,628
Yeah.

65
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,229
But I have to print stuff and then bring it to

66
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:28,669
the accountant and they type everything back into the computer.

67
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,589
I know this is insane.

68
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:32,108
Whatever, whatever is how it is. I don't care.

69
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,660
And, and I do miss the days when this like,

70
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:37,990
envelopes would come to me in the mail and then I would bring everything in,

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,619
in a big folder and be like, there you go.

72
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,160
And now I print everything and then put it in the big folder and whatever.

73
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,270
But anyway, so here's my point, right? Is

74
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,419
there are certain expectations that have been laid down,

75
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,960
especially around like screens and computers and,

76
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,289
and now like telling a kid no video games or TV or whatever.

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,320
OK. We can maybe work on that because that like you won't, you won't die maybe.

78
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,360
But

79
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,550
so, so here's where I want to take this though

80
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,770
is you and I were talking about the days when

81
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:10,539
a security team could stop ship software for their organization,

82
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,339
which whether that was even true back then we, we can argue one way or the other.

83
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,529
But,

84
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,279
and here's the point is

85
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:17,750
in the world today,

86
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,300
I think, expecting to stop ship something as a security team is

87
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,750
kind of absurd.

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,309
I don't think it's something that's a reasonable expectation anymore.

89
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,910
And in all seriousness, you should have been involved from the start

90
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,699
and never even find yourself in this position. But regardless the point is

91
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,449
that

92
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,089
I feel like there's a lot of people who

93
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,529
they don't realize the world has changed

94
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,449
and so their expectations and what they think is ok,

95
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,130
hasn't caught up with that.

96
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,770
And it's totally like a teacher telling kids no screen time

97
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,220
feels to me like

98
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,429
a security team today that says, oh,

99
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm gonna stop ship because you didn't fix this bug.

100
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,929
And it's like you're both living 20 years ago.

101
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,699
Well, and I think a big aspect of this is too, is like, the reality is

102
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,380
even terrible, serious bugs and flaws. Like a great example of the Samsung seven.

103
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,199
I mean, they actually, these things caught fire,

104
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,009
they

105
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,539
caught fire.

106
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,500
Well, they could have been exploding and then catching fire

107
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,225
have been slightly worse.

108
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,725
But, yeah, I mean, literally these devices catch fire.

109
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,225
If you bend them, they catch fire,

110
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:28,494
done deal. I mean, and you know, it, what they, they, they sort of quasi

111
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,825
fixed it once and found out. Oops. No, we didn't

112
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:32,744
because the fix had a flaw. And, I mean,

113
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,869
you know, that's an example of where they should have stopped shipping it,

114
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:41,200
done a recall and sorted it out. But, you know, they sort of did that but not quite.

115
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:41,720
And,

116
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,029
yeah, I mean,

117
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,019
ok, you know, the world went on.

118
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,820
Nobody really seems to have cared that much and quite honestly, what really got me is

119
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,119
I was listening to the radio in the car the other

120
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,589
day and they were actually talking up the Samsung the,

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,339
the eight,

122
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,910
what is it? The Galaxy Eight

123
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,859
comes out being like an amazing phone. It's

124
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,049
got more stuff in it and bigger screen or, I don't know, whatever. Right. And

125
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,730
so it's pretty clear that the whole Samsung Seven debacle and they even made

126
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,910
fun of the Samsung seven for catching fire and stuff and they're like,

127
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,230
this one doesn't catch fire, but

128
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,209
nobody really cares.

129
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,790
You know, it's, I don't, I, I really,

130
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,359
I don't think it's impacted or it's going to impact sales much.

131
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:21,600
I mean, look at Apple with their infamous, like you're holding it wrong phone.

132
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,459
I do remember that and,

133
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,070
you know, maybe,

134
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,450
maybe all these people who've been talking about brand for so long

135
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,799
were wrong.

136
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,799
I think part of it people will forgive quite a bit,

137
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,320
you know,

138
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,140
and more to the point like I can't. Ok. So let's say I decide to

139
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,079
be angry at Apple and ditch all their stuff

140
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,480
that's gonna cost me several $1000

141
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,679
to get rid of like to replace all my stuff, you know. So

142
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,779
yeah, unless they start like,

143
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,519
well I was gonna say eating kittens but even that, you know,

144
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,109
is it really that bad?

145
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,709
There's a lot of cats in the world, you know, overpopulation of cats.

146
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,059
-- But anyways, not that I'm advocating the eating of kittens
-- to be clear

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,549
from security teams,

148
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,750
stop shipping to eating cats.

149
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:10,760
A

150
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:11,959
level

151
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,209
of

152
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:12,510
sanity.

153
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,850
The thing is right. I mean, here's the reality

154
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,420
there.

155
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:18,739
I, I took that security economics course and they,

156
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,660
they point out bluntly there are so many things that are legitimately huge risks

157
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,850
to killing companies and to killing products or to costing lots of money.

158
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,989
But these, like, well,

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,420
it's a security flaw that maybe gets exploited and maybe something

160
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,140
bad happens and maybe it ends up in the press,

161
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:37,470
right?

162
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,230
We're talking at

163
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,970
that point, such a, a small risk. Statistically,

164
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,179
you just don't need to care

165
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,160
which the security part of me is like screaming in a padded room when he hears that.

166
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,320
But the business side of me is like, yeah, no, cool.

167
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,940
Like if we ship this, we can make money and then if we have money,

168
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,329
maybe we can go back and fix this

169
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,250
and that ties into this whole, like,

170
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,279
I love the idea of proactive security, but for example,

171
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,540
the Linux kernel has how many tens of millions of lines of code.

172
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:06,850
So we're stuck with that.

173
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,089
Um And so then it boils down to fast reactive security of like, ok, you know, like

174
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,170
how fast can you do a tire recall and swap all the tires on your car?

175
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,440
You know,

176
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,040
II I agree with you 100%

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,570
in, in all of this.

178
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,609
And you know what else it reminds me of actually, is,

179
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,600
what was it you who was telling me that in order

180
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,970
for there to be an airline disaster at this point,

181
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,829
there has to be like six things that go horribly wrong.

182
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:34,869
And if you

183
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,839
look like five happen, everything's usually ok.

184
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,690
And that's

185
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,890
kind of

186
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,470
-- something like where the pilot intentionally crashes it because they're
-- suicidal

187
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,190
ignoring that.

188
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,619
That's not an accident,

189
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,279
right?

190
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,670
Which, which kind of brings me then to

191
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,779
stuff, they fixed it.

192
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,089
A lot of airlines have a two man role and even

193
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,399
if one of the copilots or whatever has to leave,

194
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,279
they send in a stewardess or whatever.

195
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,029
-- I mean,
-- ok, that, that's fair. I suppose that's true.

196
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,220
That does mean

197
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,850
it, it's more difficult. But so. Right.

198
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:09,209
So we're, we're getting to security now and that view of the almighty security team

199
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,220
and,

200
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,260
yeah, even

201
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,089
like five or six, probably terrible things would need to happen before

202
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:18,679
that, that bug that us, you know,

203
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,100
tinfoil had security people were freaking out about

204
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,269
it becomes legitimately a problem.

205
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,350
Right. I mean,

206
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,170
-- let's
-- face it

207
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,980
when you, I mean,

208
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:30,359
the reality is there are some security flaws that do end up being used in,

209
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,580
like drive by ad download attacks and stuff and,

210
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,349
you know, there's your, uh, what is it? Your Adobe Flash, your Java.

211
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,549
What's the third one?

212
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,010
Uh, IE

213
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,140
ie more. Yeah. Well, actually, no. Yeah.

214
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,330
Sadly, yeah, older versions of IE, newer versions seem to be better,

215
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:49,780
you know,

216
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:53,770
and and so the reality is there are legitimately like attacks that are bad or,

217
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,780
um, well, I mean, slammer but, hey, you know,

218
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,760
nobody had passwords on their databases.

219
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,210
So it's,

220
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,770
it's kind of hard to get excited about that.

221
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,890
Um,

222
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:04,599
but yeah, I mean,

223
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,520
or like that struts worm that is going around

224
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,489
in struts to the Romo code execution thing,

225
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,770
right.

226
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,150
You know,

227
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,049
but that's also, it's kind of old,

228
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,890
you know, and that's the thing, right? So we're dealing with a world where? Ok.

229
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,190
Yeah, we have a really severe flaw,

230
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,520
but we also have a patch and everybody's ignoring it.

231
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:23,989
They're

232
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,369
ignoring it or if they just don't know.

233
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,380
I,

234
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,729
well, some people definitely have, like, really poor infosec

235
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,260
and are just not aware of anything going on,

236
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,440
obviously, like,

237
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,609
they're small and medium businesses and that are probably outsource this to, like,

238
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:41,940
manage service providers who

239
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,039
just don't have the expertise for this. But

240
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:48,739
the reality is too, I mean, is, do you want to take again back to this, like, ok.

241
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,090
So if we, like, upgrade the software on this thing, well,

242
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,669
the last time we did that we broke it.

243
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,739
So we just don't do that anymore unless we absolutely have to.

244
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:56,969
Versus

245
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:01,530
this. Well, they say there's this risk and if somebody, and then there's all those

246
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:04,419
fallacies that people believe, like, oh, you know,

247
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:07,909
the internet is full of so many systems nobody would ever target us directly.

248
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,979
Well, it sort of true, but also worms,

249
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,299
you know, that just touch everything.

250
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,340
Um

251
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,520
So

252
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:18,419
yeah, I mean, really what it boils down to, I guess is that risk analysis, which,

253
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,179
you know, the majority of people don't do because

254
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,510
even I, when I try to do these risk analysis

255
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,309
analyses, sorry,

256
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:26,190
um

257
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,229
What data am I basing these risk analyses off of? And the answer is,

258
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:31,010
so

259
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,820
you just, you just reminded me something

260
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:33,770
really funny.

261
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,099
So, so for those of you who don't know, I,

262
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:38,989
I've moved to from Red Hat to Elastic and I'm doing

263
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,549
various security things for them there. And

264
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,979
one of the things is,

265
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:46,960
is there's a machine learning product that's designed to do some

266
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:50,609
kind of security analysis and using like actual machine learning,

267
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,260
not just grub

268
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:56,000
and, and you know, finding threats and whatnot anyway, I'm, I'm helping one of the,

269
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,359
the marketing guys put together a demo and he said like, what am I,

270
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,469
what am I looking for?

271
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,760
Like, help me, help me look for something cool.

272
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:08,080
And I said uh why don't you look for 404 errors with no refer in the header, right?

273
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,700
So basically people do, right?

274
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,619
He did that and he's like,

275
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,039
what am I looking at? This? Looks terrible. And I'm like, that's the internet dude.

276
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,239
Like that's, that's what's happening all the time everywhere.

277
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,200
And yeah, there's like attempts for, for like PHP login weird forums and,

278
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,419
and wordpress stuff.

279
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,340
It just like all this crazy and,

280
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:31,409
and the guy was horrified. I'm like, this is, this is just what it is, man.

281
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,280
Like anywhere you are, this is what your web server is doing now because like,

282
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,380
like people are just like spamming the internet

283
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,080
with everything.

284
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,229
Yeah, it's crazy.

285
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:43,320
Even

286
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:46,789
like, you know, all my sites are behind cloud flare and they block a lot of stuff

287
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,710
but even then, you know, yeah, I was gonna do a 404 clean up.

288
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:54,070
So, yeah, went for 404 and it was like, wow, there's so much of this car,

289
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,119
like there's still people scanning for.

290
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,359
Um,

291
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,979
oh, I don't remember the name of it now. I won't, I want to say Front Page.

292
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:02,419
-- Remember Microsoft front Page
-- I have and there's

293
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,500
probably a ton of it out there still.

294
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,429
Well, the I

295
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,000
six vulnerability that has now an exploit

296
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,570
and they're not going to fix it, nor should they, in my opinion, it's out of support.

297
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,609
-- Right.
-- Quit running that. Why are you doing that? What's wrong with you?

298
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,520
Windows XP in 95 are stolen. You

299
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:17,830
know?

300
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,409
I know. I know.

301
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,289
But, you know, typically they're not hope.

302
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,619
Well, typically, hopefully they're not running internet facing servers.

303
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,599
They probably are.

304
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,630
Yeah.

305
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,719
But, yeah, I mean, so that's, that's, you know, it's how many people, like,

306
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,479
check the brakes on their car

307
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,849
periodically or

308
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,760
-- even the oil in their car.
-- I never do. In fact, I had a problem with my brakes one day.

309
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,609
Like, I, I turned on the brakes and the car pulled real hard to the right.

310
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:41,359
And I thought this is

311
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:41,640
weird.

312
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,250
So, anyway, I bring it in.

313
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,020
They're like, yeah, uh,

314
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,330
your breaks are like falling off your car because my car was kind of old.

315
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,969
I'm like, you guys just fixed the brakes a year ago.

316
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,559
The mechanic, like, uh, yeah,

317
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,719
we don't know what happened but they're falling off like we fix them, you know.

318
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,599
So, I don't know.

319
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,869
I, I must have run something over or hit a pothole or whatever, but it's like, yeah,

320
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,210
-- that's,
-- they forgot to put a screw in.

321
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:02,809
I, I don't know,

322
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,710
they didn't give me a discount,

323
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:09,369
so I'm gonna assume it wasn't them trying to pretend that everything was cool.

324
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,859
Like that's,

325
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,570
in fact, that's what I was waiting for.

326
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,289
I was waiting for them to offer some sort of discount

327
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:17,090
or free parts and I'd be like you guys screwed up.

328
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,950
But no, no, they didn't do that. So,

329
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,109
anyway, anyway, we should, we should move on to happy topics now.

330
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,260
Maybe,

331
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,739
maybe spyware.

332
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,830
Yeah,

333
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,530
I, yeah,

334
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,150
well, spyware is whatever. Spyware. Spyware.

335
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,270
But, yeah, apparently your,

336
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,549
one of your happy fun Telcos is actually forcing it on people,

337
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,219
I guess. And Verizon wants to put, uh, something called Appl

338
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,150
on Android phones,

339
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,070
which is

340
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:46,140
I,

341
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,630
-- what is that flash?
-- I, I don't know. It's something that

342
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,929
monitors your activity apparently.

343
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,989
And it, it sounds like it's one of those just spy on people and then sell

344
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,809
their browsing habits and whatnot to, to somebody for marketing data, right?

345
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,020
Whatever you wanna call that

346
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:07,349
you could call it spyware, I would call it spyware. Whatever. Here's, there's,

347
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:11,530
there's kind of three things that come to mind when I think of this immediately is,

348
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,669
uh first of all,

349
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,320
why on earth would a company think this is a good idea? This is insane

350
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,450
because 1% of the users will fall for it and it's a revenue stream,

351
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:25,390
not a 1% credit. It's going to be like 8080 80% or more, I guarantee. And that's,

352
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,119
well, well, that, that's the second point now is the fact that

353
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:29,659
I,

354
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,440
I see this story and there's all these

355
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,739
people talking about rooting their phones and selling

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,049
car.

357
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:35,150
I'm like,

358
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,559
nobody's going to do that.

359
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,409
Normal.

360
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,770
People won't even hear about this and they're just gonna go to Verizon and they're

361
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,799
gonna get the phone that's free when they sign up for a 12 year contract.

362
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:47,630
And,

363
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,580
and that's what they're gonna use.

364
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,349
And so they don't even know this is happening to them.

365
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,229
And I'm sure in that phone book they signed,

366
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,570
it has one bullet point talking about Verizon

367
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,989
stealing all of their browsing habits off their phone

368
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:03,200
-- and, and that's the thing like,
-- isn't that a moot point now with the new FCC

369
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:03,789
Rs?

370
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,789
That's another story we can.

371
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,789
But here's the deal. Right.

372
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,450
Here's the deal,

373
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,919
I guess at the end of the day is why on earth can they even do this to these phones?

374
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:17,049
You'd think that these phone manufacturers would

375
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,090
want to exert some level of control.

376
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:20,609
Like an Apple. Does this where Apple is?

377
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,130
Like, no, you're not gonna put it with a bunch of crap on our phone.

378
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,969
Like this is an iphone. We do it our way

379
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,289
-- and in all seriousness they do it.
-- Right.

380
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,969
Well, here's the thing though.

381
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,289
Apple is bargaining from a position of strength.

382
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,679
How many different Android phone makers are there?

383
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,049
There's like, I don't know.

384
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:38,750
Yeah,

385
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,700
I know. What was it? LG was talking about?

386
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,559
Android phones and the fact that they have, like, they make a penny

387
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:45,750
on them,

388
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:46,169
like,

389
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,099
legitimately, their profit margin is not, like, not a percent but a pen.

390
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,159
It's probably bigger than that. I mean,

391
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,609
there was an article about this.

392
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:55,130
It

393
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,169
was ok. That could be the end result.

394
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,109
But I bet you two, these companies like LG,

395
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,969
they make a bunch of other parts that go into it.

396
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:02,429
I bet it's like movie accounting

397
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,159
where every movie loses money.

398
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:04,669
I'm sure

399
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,049
they're, they're granted

400
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,789
they're not making tons of money on these phones.

401
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,510
It's not like the iphone is selling for 8, 900 bucks,

402
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,239
you know, 300 parts in costs.

403
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,450
Um,

404
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,840
but anyways, so that's part of the challenge. Right? Is, is,

405
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:19,219
oh, you know,

406
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:19,340
I

407
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,080
mean,

408
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,849
maybe apart from like Samsung because they're kind of

409
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:23,469
hot right now with the S eight or whatever,

410
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,309
the Samsung eight,

411
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,590
you know, like LG, like, I name an LG phone model.

412
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,039
Uh, the Nexus five X.

413
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:32,179
Ok.

414
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,789
Ok. Well, ok. Yeah, exactly. Like,

415
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,650
you know, there's, if you don't carry one brand of Android,

416
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,239
I don't think too many people are gonna, like,

417
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,869
-- walk out of the store whereas with Apple, they will,
-- I mean, that, that is fair and I,

418
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:53,719
I mean, this is why I would only buy an Android phone from Google. And even, even then

419
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:56,979
all of this madness has me seriously thinking about

420
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,590
an iphone just because there's a level of sanity

421
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:00,289
and

422
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,489
peace of mind

423
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,289
-- that will come with this
-- sort of, I mean,

424
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,180
there are problems like I recently discovered,

425
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,930
did a iphone update to 10.3 or whatever

426
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,910
and it reset the whole Hey Siri thing,

427
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,108
you know, which

428
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,550
I did like, I remember that podcast we're doing a few weeks ago where I was like blah,

429
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,390
blah, blah, blah, hey Siri.

430
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,040
And then my phone's like,

431
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:16,790
you

432
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,040
know,

433
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,959
and I'm like, damn it, I disabled that and then I did an O update. So it got Reen

434
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:21,598
and so,

435
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,000
you know, iphones aren't perfect like there are, you know,

436
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,880
now I'm kind of wondering like all the other security settings I made

437
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,859
uh the restrictions are still there. Thank goodness those stay between updates.

438
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:31,379
But

439
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:35,359
you know, the um things like Hey, Siri, you know, popped back in and it's like,

440
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,379
that's really freaking annoying.

441
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:42,458
-- I,
-- I'm sure my phone does the same things I just haven't noticed or paid it well,

442
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,519
I never use any of that stuff either.

443
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,198
I,

444
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:46,569
yeah,

445
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,469
anyway, anyway, so

446
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,939
-- it's,
-- I think a lot of it

447
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,969
again, kind of like the security thing. It really boils down to a lot of like

448
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,790
these sec, these, well, and when I say these security issues, they're,

449
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,750
they're only security issues to people that truly

450
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,420
understand them unless it's something like really egregious,

451
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,880
like,

452
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,150
you know, uh, like the, um,

453
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,099
you know, where, like, kids data is being, like,

454
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:12,550
directly leaked online in a way that's understandable.

455
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,380
Right? Because the majority of security problems are not easily understood.

456
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,670
They're kind of, you know,

457
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,369
there's nuances to them.

458
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,959
Right.

459
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:24,469
And so even, even security people don't always agree

460
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,500
on what is, or isn't a thing? It's madness.

461
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah.

462
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,709
And so with that, I mean, the reality is,

463
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:35,510
I don't think these security incidents and vulnerabilities actually

464
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,000
do much if any real damage to these brands and

465
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,300
to these products in the minds of the consumer.

466
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,540
Um,

467
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,670
you know, you,

468
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
you basically have to have something really epically

469
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,689
stupid and understandable to kill a brand.

470
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:49,410
Like, uh,

471
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,449
well, like that airline that, you know,

472
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:53,310
crashed into the swamp in Florida because

473
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,270
they were carrying oxygen containers online,

474
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,130
you know, like improper cargo or whatever.

475
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,119
Uh,

476
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,239
was it easy?

477
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Not easy? Jet.

478
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:01,790
Yeah, I know who you mean.

479
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,810
And you know that, and, but here's

480
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,689
the, or, or even better, you know, um, Malaysian Airlines, right.

481
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:11,650
They, was it, they lost two, or was it three planes in this, like,

482
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,239
not a good track record?

483
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,439
Granted they hit like the, you know, the trifecta lottery winnings.

484
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,410
Um,

485
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,359
and so technically they went out of business but

486
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:21,400
-- they just rebranded
-- and that's how it always works,

487
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:21,810
man.

488
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:23,329
I mean, everybody does that

489
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,329
you just, you rebrand

490
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,219
all done, put a

491
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,449
new coat of paint on that 747 and

492
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:28,699
was

493
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,930
to say

494
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,119
there's some consulting company I heard of that was doing

495
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,439
uh it was, it had something to do with, with one of the,

496
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:38,449
the public sector certifications

497
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:39,849
and

498
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:40,390
I was,

499
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,020
I was trying to look them up and I feel like

500
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,719
I couldn't find anything about the history of this company.

501
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,770
And so anyway, I finally talked to somebody like, oh yeah, they,

502
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,689
they used to be so and so, and they change your name.

503
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:51,410
I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, those guys were terrible,

504
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,790
but it totally works. Right. It totally works it

505
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,630
anyway.

506
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,790
And I guess in, in, in this note, we should talk about uh ISP spying,

507
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,250
which is probably less of a story than it than it really is. But

508
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:06,550
I,

509
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,380
well, no, here's, here's,

510
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,050
here's the deal. All right. Is

511
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,849
that the in the US, the,

512
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:17,560
the Congress or whatever? Some, some, one of the lawmaker groups. I forget which one

513
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:21,989
they basically rolled back some customer protections on

514
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,900
ISP selling their data to third party advertisers.

515
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,060
And, but here's the deal is

516
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:31,250
this, this rule has been in place for like four months.

517
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,229
So

518
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,569
I I'm all for customer privacy. But I think it's, it, there's probably less,

519
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,579
there should be less uproar than there is perhaps

520
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,709
because this is one of those things that,

521
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,829
that needs to be fixed.

522
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,670
Of course, it won't be because like the government is completely dysfunctional.

523
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:46,890
But

524
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,069
that's another story

525
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,439
and, and it's like,

526
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,650
it's only been there four months. I'm

527
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,280
the world didn't end before it's not gonna end again.

528
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,219
And so all these people talking about like running, you know, VPN S and,

529
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,250
and all this other crazy

530
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,589
is,

531
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,670
is probably a bit over the top and it kind of comes back to that third party firmware.

532
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,619
Bit of our last story

533
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:09,739
is normal. People aren't gonna run VPN S because they, they can't.

534
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,709
-- And could you imagine the poor V
-- P?

535
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,239
I've actually met a few normal people that do have

536
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,800
like Nord VPN or whatever installed on their machine.

537
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,859
They pay their three bucks a month. Seriously.

538
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,569
Uh, but these, yeah, I mean, it's, it's, but it's, it's the,

539
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,949
if you actually go to some of these better VPN providers,

540
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,530
it literally is like 40 bucks or 50 bucks a year.

541
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,369
And, oh, you're on a Mac click this, if you're on windows click this and it just works.

542
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,209
So, they know, because

543
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,930
they wanna sell their stuff. Right. So, they've actually gotten user friendly,

544
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,339
you know, I use, uh, Tour

545
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:42,790
Guard and, I mean,

546
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,540
um,

547
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:47,609
I use it on Linux of all things or? Sorry, I use it on free BS D actually,

548
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,229
um, because I'm a weirdo and even for them it was trivial.

549
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:54,479
They're like, oh, you're, they actually have set up scripts for free BS D,

550
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,849
you know, and I'm like, it's like download this.

551
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,260
Here's the, you know, here's the config files for like,

552
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,520
uh well, they basically have like 200 different pools of servers like globally,

553
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:05,760
right?

554
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,880
And I use the Canadian ones

555
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,459
and uh

556
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,199
you know,

557
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,069
and I just modified their script so that I

558
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,099
hard coded my password and user name into it,

559
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:13,300
right?

560
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,640
So that it just automatically starts when the machine boots.

561
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,910
So all of your traffic goes over a VPN.

562
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,369
Uh All of my traffic on my backup network link goes over

563
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,500
VPN because I, I it's sort of a quasi

564
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:26,219
anonymous slash,

565
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,640
you know, that's not K

566
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,920
-- uh thing for what I want to look at stuff, maybe whatever
-- things,

567
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,780
right? We just say look at stuff.

568
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:34,640
Yeah,

569
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,969
nothing in particular.

570
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,979
But speaking of I SPS and privacy, I mean, there was that one,

571
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,890
I have to find the link for you later, but there was that one ISP that was inserting,

572
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,089
I wanna say people's account number or MAC address.

573
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,349
Or something like that really ridiculous into outgoing http headers.

574
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,160
That would not surprise me in any, you know.

575
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,339
Um,

576
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,170
and I think part of the, the, I

577
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,209
think really what it boils down to is

578
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,569
people sort of are kind of aware that they're being tracked but

579
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,160
they don't like their face being rubbed in it.

580
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,959
So, you know, my all time favorite is everybody's like, oh, you know, blah, blah,

581
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:05,130
blah, tracking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

582
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,040
And I'm like, cool. Do you have a cell phone? They're like, of course, I do.

583
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,089
And I'm like, well, so like, yeah, you're being tracked like, uh no, I'm not. I

584
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,614
where do you think they get the traffic data from?

585
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:16,935
Like the information on how bad and messed up the roads are?

586
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:19,415
Where do you think that comes from? And they're like, uh,

587
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,694
or I'm like the, you know, Google now,

588
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:25,074
Google Maps shows approximately how busy a business is

589
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,474
like in real time. Now,

590
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,599
if you go to

591
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,810
Google.

592
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,410
Exactly. And it's because cell phones, right? And,

593
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,670
well, and technically speaking there, you know, the ISP is quasi

594
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,010
anonymize the data and send it over to Google or whoever's willing to buy it.

595
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,420
But, you know, so that, that data are, I mean,

596
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,099
the reality is these companies are gonna monetize any data they can

597
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,130
and people's

598
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,810
location and travel and habits like that,

599
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:54,859
especially, you know, aggregated in bulk is a hugely valuable thing.

600
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,449
And I, and I mean, I do love it because when I go to maps.google.com now and, like,

601
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,010
look up a business and they're like,

602
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,939
you know, they show that little graph of, like, how busy the business is,

603
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:04,880
like at various hours of the day and stuff.

604
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,369
And then they say, like, approximately how busy it is right now.

605
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,050
I mean, that is wonderful.

606
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,589
You know, that's actually really useful because I will then,

607
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,209
you know, avoid a store until it's less busy.

608
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,050
You don't have a much better experience

609
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,300
or, you know, for planning dinner reservations.

610
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,800
That actually makes life a lot easier, you know.

611
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:23,849
Right.

612
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:26,569
Like, oh, if I want to book a seven o'clock table, I'm gonna have to do it like,

613
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:27,910
it looks like about two weeks out,

614
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:29,560
you know.

615
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,290
And so, you know, when it's done

616
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,109
properly, the product is amazing.

617
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,010
And then, but the question becomes, you know, how is,

618
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,410
how are people being protected?

619
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,869
Right. It's,

620
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,229
it always reminds me of when they

621
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,109
were trying that really hyper targeted advertising,

622
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,219
you know, and they were sending out pregnancy

623
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:48,569
related stuff to, you know, people who didn't even know they were pregnant yet,

624
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:49,589
right? Because

625
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,229
they found out, for example, you know, when women get pregnant, their,

626
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,160
their choice in soaps and a bunch of other

627
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,609
stuff changes because of their sensitivity to fragrances.

628
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:57,770
Right?

629
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,400
And so, you know,

630
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,579
uh there was one case of where this like, girl, I think in Texas or something,

631
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:07,030
you know, got this, like, ad and her parents freaked out.

632
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,640
And so what they do now is they,

633
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,390
they, they mask the ads, right.

634
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,910
They put the, like, they, they basically send you like, 50 innocuous ads plus,

635
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,680
like the five that are, you know, pregnancy related or whatever.

636
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,319
So it looks less targeted and it's less obvious. And so,

637
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:21,599
you know, it's, it's,

638
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,959
that's my concern. Right? Is like, you could,

639
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,189
I'm guessing based on

640
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,530
travel data you could easily like out a whole bunch of people that are in the closet,

641
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:34,619
you know, based on what bars they go to or based on,

642
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,550
you know, whatever. Right. And,

643
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,229
and that is where things become concerned or, you know,

644
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,589
what if your insurance company buys this data and it is like, yeah,

645
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,310
we're jacking up your premiums because you spend a lot of time at the bar or whatever,

646
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,609
you know.

647
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,790
And that's one, in fact, that's one of the reasons there's the, what are the,

648
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,949
the DNA testing?

649
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:51,920
We

650
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,219
-- just got that in Canada.
-- And I'm, my wife thinks they sound neat.

651
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:57,619
I'm like, I will not do that because someday, um,

652
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,930
my insurance company is gonna get a hold of that and,

653
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:04,010
and nothing good will come of them having access to that data.

654
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,640
No, it's, and I mean, I guess what, what that comes down to is

655
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,390
when, when I think of these kind of problems,

656
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:13,280
it's really been

657
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,329
kind of regulation.

658
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,930
That's

659
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,930
been the, the lowest common denominator

660
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,219
historically speaking, because I don't think we can trust these organizations

661
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,770
to be stewards of this data.

662
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:30,010
Well, they need to monetize it. That's the thing. Their business is fundamentally

663
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,949
and that's what pisses me off about where people are.

664
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,699
Like, oh, well, the real problem is that we have these ISP monopolies.

665
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:37,619
No, because even if you had like 1000 I SPS to choose from,

666
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,000
they would all still be trying to monetize this data.

667
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,650
Yeah. Yeah, it'd be terrible, man.

668
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,770
You know, like every social network on the planet is,

669
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,719
well, not every, every single website on the planet is showing ads and these ads have

670
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,079
tracking data.

671
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,380
-- That's just
-- how

672
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,209
the internet is.

673
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,430
That's crazy, man.

674
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:59,000
All right. So what about this uh smart TV running flash?

675
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,160
Have you read that story, Kurt?

676
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,089
Yeah. So yes, I, yeah, T V's running flash.

677
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,660
Uh And I actually, I want to apologize last episode.

678
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,650
Uh You might remember, I think I mixed it up with the dishwashers running flash.

679
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,989
-- We
-- joked. No, here's the thing

680
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,939
about dishwashers running flash.

681
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:13,270
That

682
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:14,670
was

683
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,290
about it.

684
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,660
Hey, guess what? Everybody, your TV probably has flash well done.

685
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:21,150
Yeah.

686
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,319
Well, and what's even more? It's OK. Honestly, the TV has a web browser

687
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,040
and the TV has flash. I can,

688
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,810
I can sort of excuse that.

689
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:30,890
For one simple fact,

690
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,349
there's a lot of cute little old flash games online that

691
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,829
would be kind of fun to play on a big TV,

692
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:39,709
OK. Like desktop power defense or whatever, right. But having said that

693
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:42,010
the fact that you can apparently

694
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:46,260
in the TV signal, like in the broadcast TV, signal that these things process,

695
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,209
you can send stuff and it will open a URL in the web browser in the background.

696
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:53,760
Right.

697
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:54,849
Well,

698
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,079
and not only that the, the digital

699
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,560
signal, digital broadcasting signal

700
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,680
is unencrypted

701
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,949
and, and why would it be? Right. It's, it's not authenticated anyway.

702
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,390
So essentially if someone

703
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:10,300
-- management
-- that's true.

704
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:13,229
But if, if someone essentially has a transmitter

705
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,520
and you use an antenna,

706
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,459
you're probably doomed. And, and so what,

707
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,979
so you're forgetting?

708
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:20,770
Drones,

709
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,180
-- screw.
-- Look,

710
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:23,459
a

711
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:24,839
drone,

712
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,209
ignoring, drones, the, the flower van that's been outside for a week.

713
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,130
Right. Like those guys.

714
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,650
And, and here's the thing.

715
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,890
Everyone doesn't understand though either about the way a lot of these TV. S work is

716
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,560
if you have a digital TV, today,

717
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:46,939
did you ever notice you can usually push a button and it'll bring

718
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:50,380
up a little menu showing you all the shows on the various channels.

719
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,569
-- I'll take your word for it. I don't have cable TV.
-- No, no, this isn't cable.

720
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:55,729
This is broadcast.

721
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:59,140
I don't have, I don't, well, I don't do broadcast.

722
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:00,069
Well,

723
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:01,520
-- I do Netflix,
-- I

724
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,619
have a myth machine

725
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,599
which, which does my broadcast, but which, which doesn't do this.

726
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,969
And I'm going to assume isn't running flash since I didn't put it on it.

727
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:09,619
But

728
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,739
that's another story.

729
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,180
Anyway, here's the deal is most of these TV s are

730
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:18,369
listening

731
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:23,930
all the time because they're getting the updated channel info off of the channels.

732
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,430
So you can't say like,

733
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:30,650
oh my TV is off or I never turn on the digital receiver or whatever.

734
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,329
Like if you set this up

735
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,689
and, and I should say a lot of them probably just set themselves up.

736
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,890
It's going to pick up

737
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:41,619
a digital television signal coming through the air.

738
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,949
And so, like, there's basically nothing you can do here.

739
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,829
Yeah. No, I remember I had to set up a Samsung TV for somebody. Uh,

740
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,839
and then I hit that privacy notification and I was like, what? Oh, ok.

741
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,819
That's interesting. And I started scrolling through it and I'm like,

742
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,079
yeah, I'm sitting in green,

743
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,199
it was like 500 screen Fs

744
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:01,739
and,

745
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,050
yeah, I mean,

746
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:08,670
I, you know, I, I, it's funny you mentioned turning it off doesn't, actually,

747
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,969
I'm actually just sitting here trying to think of

748
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,810
what I own, but when I turn it off it actually turns off

749
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,060
off off.

750
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,150
The only thing I,

751
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,949
well, I was gonna say I have some flashlights

752
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,910
and, and I'm sure even then,

753
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,800
and that's it. Like I can't think of anything.

754
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,079
Oh, my, well, no, my alarm clock has a nine volt battery in it. That's right.

755
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,800
Uh,

756
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,109
so even my alarm clock, like a $20 alarm clock,

757
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,709
although that's hopefully safe from hacking because it's stupid.

758
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,910
That a challenge.

759
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,130
Um But yeah, no,

760
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,260
realistically, you know, it's sold, it's not, you know.

761
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,739
But, yeah, I mean, realistically I'm just thinking everything I have,

762
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:47,400
especially anything that connects to a network doesn't

763
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,479
have a concept of like actual off,

764
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:50,170
off.

765
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,660
No, nothing does anymore.

766
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,260
Nothing turns off because it always does magic in the background.

767
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,369
Yeah. And I mean,

768
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:04,900
-- yeah, so,
-- so anyway, here's the deal though. Ok, here's the deal is number one,

769
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,050
don't put freaking flash on your smart TV because flash is a huge problem.

770
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,819
Let's face it. You look at like flash running in something like chrome,

771
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:16,489
they sandbox this thing to death. Do you think these smart TV S have sandboxes?

772
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,030
-- You know, they don't
-- uh

773
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,229
don't a bunch of smart TV S run.

774
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,890
Maybe

775
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,000
they're probably running Android having

776
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,010
-- said that
-- right?

777
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,910
I mean, just,

778
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:33,050
you know, they're not running a latest version of Android.

779
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:34,719
Oh OK.

780
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:40,140
Um And well, the thing is I know for flash, I think it broke 1000 CV S some time ago.

781
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,339
-- 1207 1200
-- you said?

782
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:47,040
Uh Yeah, I just, well, and that's on the search term,

783
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,510
Adobe flash player like that's pretty,

784
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,300
not a lot of false positives.

785
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,339
Wow,

786
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,479
-- that's,
-- you know,

787
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:57,739
-- that does not surprise me. Hey, at
-- least they're fixing flaws.

788
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,089
But again, it goes back to that technical debt issue of like,

789
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,219
you know, at this point, you obviously can't, well,

790
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:08,060
unless you rewrite flash from scratch in a memory safe language.

791
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:10,140
-- No,
-- that's, that's never gonna happen. Dude.

792
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,619
Like actually I just read a tweet earlier today about this that

793
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:18,780
someone pointed out that saying use a memory safe language is the equivalent

794
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,979
of telling people just stop being poor as the solution to their problem.

795
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,949
I just added this to the show notes, but there's that announcement from the Tor

796
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:27,920
project

797
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:31,780
talking about just that choosing a memory safe language to rewrite torn.

798
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,660
And then they went with Rust cause Rust apparently has good sea binding.

799
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,119
So they can sort of like transition over.

800
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,160
And I would say so for

801
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,089
a very teeny tiny eensy

802
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:42,599
weensy

803
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,640
percentage of software projects where security actually matters and tor

804
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,280
being like one of the three,

805
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,910
then it is an actual answer.

806
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,770
But yeah, for the rest of the world, no, just it's useless.

807
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:56,010
Yeah, I know.

808
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,390
Well, it's think about it if you can't stop ship,

809
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,209
rewrite the whole thing in a different language is like

810
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,290
10 times 100 times worse than not shipping

811
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:09,939
because that's gonna cost you a lot of money.

812
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:10,589
Yeah.

813
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,550
Yeah, I mean, that's,

814
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,750
that's true. That kind of comes back to that stop shift discussion we had is

815
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,140
even even bad shipped software makes more money than software.

816
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,910
That is perfect and never ships.

817
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:24,060
Yeah.

818
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:25,619
So

819
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:29,300
I, you know, I mean, I, I would personally, for myself,

820
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,410
I would only ever use memory safe languages because I'm lazy and

821
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,180
I just don't want to write languages that require a lot of,

822
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:35,260
you

823
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:35,550
know,

824
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:35,719
I

825
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,280
know what you mean,

826
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,069
detail oriented stuff because I'm terrible at that.

827
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,439
Um,

828
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,920
and more to the point, like, to me it's, I just,

829
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,290
I want to use more advanced tools now and I get

830
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,609
that there's a place in a time for ce C++ whatever.

831
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:47,770
Right.

832
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,359
There's just certain stuff where you, you just have to do it that way right now.

833
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:51,880
Yeah.

834
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,920
Yeah, there is.

835
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,000
Although, wait, what is, uh, hang on a sec? What language is?

836
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:01,910
Uh, ok. Hang on a second.

837
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,430
Hm.

838
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:06,359
What is this thing written in?

839
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,179
Uh, it's written in c,

840
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,708
um, the, uh, the Google, Os Fuxia.

841
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,629
Yeah.

842
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,300
Well, you could, you could

843
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,120
-- go or
-- something. How do you write an operating system in go,

844
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:22,830
I don't know.

845
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:23,989
But

846
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,330
if it can spit out a binary, I mean, theoretically, why not?

847
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,850
Well, it's complicated. I mean, bootstrapping

848
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,879
-- theory, it should be possible in practice. Yeah. No, nobody would do it
-- because

849
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,600
this is one of the next things on, on the show note list here we put together is

850
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,770
Fuchsia is a new operating system. Apparently. Google is working on

851
00:34:44,428 --> 00:34:45,069
and

852
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,197
I, I guess here's, here's the question

853
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:49,809
is if anyone can do this,

854
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,009
it's Google.

855
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:52,428
But can they,

856
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,179
well, they have, but more to the point is it

857
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:58,500
viable?

858
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,320
No, no, this is not production ready.

859
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,659
This is a long way to go before they're gonna be using it

860
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,179
in something. And so the question is really,

861
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:08,989
do you think

862
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,110
it's gonna happen?

863
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,110
I,

864
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:18,540
here's the brutal reality is Google operates servers out of scale. Where

865
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:22,659
for the sake of argument, if you can save a dollar a year on every server

866
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:25,219
for them, that's hundreds of millions of dollars.

867
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,439
So,

868
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,389
for them at that scale, you know what

869
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,399
just think about, like if they, if they

870
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,679
don't, if it reduces their global reboot count by one

871
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,090
because they do some clever because it's a micro kernel, right? So, uh

872
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,250
OK, so long story short, there's basically two theories, I guess,

873
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,000
or two camps of like operating system design,

874
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,689
there's the monolithic kernel, like Linux Windows,

875
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,919
whatever where you basically just have a ginormous blob

876
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:57,199
of software that runs the computer suite mostly.

877
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,850
And then the micro kernel guys are sort of like, well,

878
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,120
let's be a little more clever about this.

879
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:03,550
So the idea being you have this really tiny

880
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,770
kernel that is the actual like sort of minimum core of the system.

881
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,729
And fundamentally all it does is just pass messages around,

882
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:11,899
you know,

883
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,419
and then everything else is like kind of plugs into it.

884
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:15,879
And so

885
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,340
in theory, you can like

886
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,770
unplug those things and plug new things in,

887
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,669
you know, on the fly even whereas with a monolithic kernel,

888
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,090
well, you can sort of do that now with things like um

889
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:27,919
uh oh

890
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,750
what the heck is it called uh

891
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,050
case splice or what's the other one

892
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:34,949
K patch.

893
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,320
Yeah.

894
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,719
Yeah. Which basically involve like sort of

895
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:42,489
patching the binary by like shoving a bunch of, well, essentially jumps in to,

896
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:42,969
you know,

897
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,949
scissor out part of the binary you don't want and put part of the, you know,

898
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:47,689
a new binary in.

899
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:51,840
But with micro kernels, obviously this is a lot more uh supported.

900
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,320
So from that perspective, like if they come up with, say a, a truly, you know,

901
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,790
uh a secure core that then, you know,

902
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,560
all these other bits can be unplugged and plugged

903
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,889
in and they don't have to do reboots.

904
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:03,489
You know,

905
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,389
even if a reboot only takes their machine like

906
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,439
two or three seconds multiply that by like,

907
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,320
you know, tens of millions of machines,

908
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:11,379
that's a significant amount of downtime,

909
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:15,360
-- you know, lost product. Is
-- it true? Well, I would imagine

910
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,959
that without some of the overhead of Linux,

911
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,419
you could also have higher density.

912
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:23,199
But here's,

913
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,100
here's part

914
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:26,040
of the, the question is

915
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,209
adding all the features you need to actually run an operating system is nontrivial.

916
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,639
And it's the one of those things that a phd student thinks is neat and easy and fun.

917
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,479
But when it comes down to it, we kind of come back to that whole stop ship thing is

918
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,229
there are

919
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,780
just certain real world requirements that

920
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,770
win

921
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,219
when it comes down to doing it right and getting it done.

922
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:53,520
And, and I think like the Linux kernel is a great example of a,

923
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,100
a million decisions between doing it right.

924
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,820
And getting it done

925
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:59,469
and granted they, they do a lot. Right. Don't get me wrong.

926
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:02,199
But there's also a lot of like, let's just get it done.

927
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,469
Yeah.

928
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,159
Well, and what, what's interesting to me though is,

929
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,489
uh and actually Linux is a good example.

930
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,040
Linux tries to be a lot of things to a lot of different people.

931
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,659
Right.

932
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:14,139
It runs on everything from smartphones to supercomputers,

933
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:16,159
to network devices with no

934
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,360
like no console or anything, right?

935
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,550
Um

936
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:22,830
Whereas Google uh and this is of course,

937
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,610
a huge assumption that like my assumption would be that they're looking at this as a,

938
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:28,530
you know, something to run their servers,

939
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:29,659
you know, the dose

940
00:38:29,899 --> 00:38:32,250
and G uh Google computer engine and all that stuff.

941
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,649
So there they would have a much more constrained problem space, you know,

942
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,199
they literally control the hardware to a degree

943
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:41,679
that almost nobody else controls in their environment,

944
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:41,810
right?

945
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,570
Because they're actually working with Intel and making their own switches and,

946
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,370
you know, doing all this custom stuff.

947
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,370
Um Secondly, their workloads, right?

948
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,320
They obviously, you know,

949
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,770
-- have much better well defined workloads than most people
-- think about this a lot.

950
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,169
And in fact,

951
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,840
this is something somewhere where Java kind of gets some of

952
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,560
this right as well if you don't have to really,

953
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,830
I mean, you kind of do, I know it's complicated, but

954
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,879
the idea is you just kind of write a thing and then it works.

955
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,629
-- Yeah. Right. Once
-- run

956
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:11,060
anywhere. No, it's not. But, you know, that's

957
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,580
well, and

958
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,570
Linux is sort of that run time now, like, within reason

959
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,379
most Linux

960
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,810
workloads can run on, you know,

961
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,719
at least a variety of near Linuxes without too much of a horror show, you know,

962
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,189
compared to say, like Windows versus Linux, which even now it is becoming, you know,

963
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,699
-- possible because Windows has a Linux subsystem
-- which is crazy.

964
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,399
So

965
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,679
I love it,

966
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:36,189
dude.

967
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:37,669
I

968
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:37,879
know

969
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,449
clearly, you know,

970
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,659
that's what gets me is, is, yeah. Can you imagine 20 years ago if we'd been like,

971
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,320
oh yeah, don't worry about it.

972
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,479
This is gonna be awesome and it'll be Windows o you know,

973
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,340
Microsoft will ship it on Windows eventually,

974
00:39:50,189 --> 00:39:53,169
right? Nobody, you know, they all would have put you in a padded room.

975
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:54,550
Um

976
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,120
But yeah, back to this, I mean, assuming

977
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,070
that assuming

978
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,780
Fuxi for example, like if you could define the workload as like

979
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:05,159
you essentially have to run, you know, containers that like have a

980
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,350
glib C basically

981
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,699
and then just basically talk to the network, talk to the disk, talk to memory,

982
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,830
-- talk to the CP
-- U.

983
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,360
I mean, it's not unreasonable and and there's always talk of this with,

984
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,199
oh what do they call the, the micro

985
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,229
Os thing?

986
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,629
That's always that there's been so many

987
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,810
research papers about like uh micro kernels,

988
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,669
I think it is,

989
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,280
-- is it or rump
-- kernels

990
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:28,550
the

991
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:29,129
kernels.

992
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:30,530
No. Is it?

993
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,159
Oh,

994
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,540
I forget the name anyway.

995
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,070
You get the idea. Right.

996
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,090
-- Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. Oh, it's on
-- the tip of my.

997
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,439
Don't you love it when you just,

998
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,540
it's not coming back.

999
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:43,909
Old

1000
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,189
man. Getting old is the worst decision I ever made.

1001
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:48,989
Uh, they're known as rump kernels.

1002
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,070
I keep thinking rump kernel and I know they have another name. That's less bizarre.

1003
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,469
That makes sense.

1004
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,939
But anyway.

1005
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,179
oh, these guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because the whole idea was you would like,

1006
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:03,620
literally take like a little bit of kernel compile your application

1007
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:04,439
that

1008
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,540
you have your application.

1009
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,860
Right.

1010
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:09,360
Yeah,

1011
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,500
I think there's potential here, but it's still very,

1012
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,489
it's very much a research project. And

1013
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:20,659
part of me wonders if we're ever even going to get there

1014
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,770
just because

1015
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:24,510
it's easy to write a research project.

1016
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,189
It's a lot more work to actually get the job done.

1017
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,520
And this is

1018
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:30,510
Linux

1019
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,469
does it though. Like, Linux actually works, you know, it as ugly as it is

1020
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:38,459
and as much as we don't wanna, we, it's that friend.

1021
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:42,429
We wanna pretend we don't know, like it's getting the work done

1022
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:46,629
well. And I've read, um, I forget which phone company it is,

1023
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,489
but they actually have,

1024
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:49,610
um,

1025
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:52,939
it was open stack, I believe, running on their, you know,

1026
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:56,610
massive phone switch server, do hicky rack thing in a jigger.

1027
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:00,800
And it was actually handling like DH CP requests by spinning up

1028
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,909
a container to process the DH P request and then killing it.

1029
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,050
And it was doing this whole thing within

1030
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,689
-- like 40 milliseconds or something
-- cleaners are designed to start

1031
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:12,229
up very quickly and be destroyed just as fast.

1032
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,790
So that's, that's fine.

1033
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:14,760
Yeah. And

1034
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:15,580
I

1035
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,550
suspect Unic kernels

1036
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,790
running on hardware are not ever gonna happen,

1037
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,659
but maybe some sort of quasi

1038
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,459
-- Unic kernel style container,
-- you

1039
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:24,719
don't

1040
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,129
need

1041
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:30,280
-- it in a container. It's just running an application and
-- more to the point

1042
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,330
actually, it's, it's even obsolete because you would just go cus

1043
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,550
and why would you even care about the Os? Right? It's just abstracted away from you.

1044
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,939
There's your Python runtime

1045
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,989
the right way to kind of start thinking about a lot of this is, is who cares?

1046
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,580
And now someone like Google might care

1047
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,139
because like you said,

1048
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,020
if they can save a dollar per server, that's, that's real money.

1049
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,060
But for, for people like us,

1050
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,729
big deal, right?

1051
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,649
Whoopee. It's, it's Os X or it's Windows or it's Linux or it's BS D like who cares?

1052
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:00,100
It doesn't matter.

1053
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:05,669
Yeah. All, all I really care at this point is like, how's the battery life?

1054
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,449
How fast? No, like how long, how fast

1055
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,040
this is like blowing my mind.

1056
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:16,199
So, so I got, I got a Macbook for work, the one without the, the F keys.

1057
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:17,219
It's got the stupid

1058
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,520
whatever. I, you know, it's a funny thing. I, I didn't realize how little I use.

1059
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,810
Escape anyway, because

1060
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,239
for, for people, old school folks, uh, escape is

1061
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,260
really just control, uh,

1062
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,040
bracket.

1063
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:30,899
And that's what I use.

1064
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,790
And, like, I don't even realize I never touched the real escape key and then, like,

1065
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,830
I lose a real escape key.

1066
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,239
I'm like, oh, I, I didn't even realize it was gone. Like, everything is fine.

1067
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:40,020
But, uh, anyway,

1068
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:43,590
you can, it, it has USB C for charging, you can charge the thing,

1069
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,209
I guess off a five volt USB C it has like magic inside of it to, to charge the battery.

1070
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,350
It takes like 100 hours but it can be done.

1071
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:54,550
Which is crazy. That's like madness man. Like madness

1072
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,979
standards, right? Standards work.

1073
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:01,090
Anyway, I don't remember how we got there. Uh Right. Oh, let's just keep moving.

1074
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,929
Uh Bitcoin, let's fork Bitcoin.

1075
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,520
Yeah. Well, I mean,

1076
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:08,929
-- everybody's doing it.
-- I mean, see that's,

1077
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:11,969
yeah, well, you, hey Ethereum did it.

1078
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:16,639
They, you know, did their roll back of a transaction due to the flaw in this theorem,

1079
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:18,459
you know.

1080
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,080
Um I mean, that's the, you know,

1081
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,459
you know what this really reminds me of is like

1082
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:26,120
like I PV allocation back in the day where like I

1083
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:28,500
actually knew a guy who at the age of like

1084
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,639
20 went and got like two or three portable C classes

1085
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,800
and then ended up I think he sold them.

1086
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:40,100
But um he basically managed to be an ISP at his house with like basically a dedicated,

1087
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,540
you know, Isdn line

1088
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:42,520
and get a couple of

1089
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:43,239
this

1090
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:43,770
isn't what

1091
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,449
-- this would be like him.
-- And it's just, well, no, no.

1092
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,350
But in the sense of it's just the wild west, like every,

1093
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,540
it is to everybody what they want it to be,

1094
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,909
but at some point for it to be useful,

1095
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:56,409
it kind of has to steady down and like become stable.

1096
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:57,520
It's not even just that though.

1097
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,879
I mean, the fork is an interesting story because what it really comes down to is

1098
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,580
the size of a block in Bitcoin is

1099
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,550
basically at its limit.

1100
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,139
And so it's,

1101
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:09,889
it's like

1102
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,830
a megabyte or something.

1103
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,159
I know it's, it's too small basically.

1104
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,129
And

1105
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,389
there's, there's kind of a couple of different ways to look at this.

1106
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:20,500
Now, I don't know how much Bitcoin you've done, but when I run the Bitcoin client

1107
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:21,929
and just run it right,

1108
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:24,290
just where it's essentially part of the

1109
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,739
network and it's receiving new information,

1110
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,780
whatever. I'm not mining, just running

1111
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:33,449
it consumes like two megabits of traffic constant right up and down,

1112
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,030
which is, that's pretty significant in all seriousness.

1113
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,590
And so the issue though is that

1114
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,030
the people forking

1115
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:43,149
want bigger blocks because obviously

1116
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:45,699
the blocks are so small now and it takes a

1117
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,350
really long time for your transactions to be verified correctly.

1118
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:50,810
And, and so

1119
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,800
if you're lucky, it can be days depending upon a variety of circumstances.

1120
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,489
So anyway, I understand the people who think they need to fork it.

1121
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,239
And part of me also understands

1122
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:01,850
the,

1123
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,209
the people who think we need to keep this

1124
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,250
small because this is like getting out of hand

1125
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:09,739
and it's, this is a tough one, man. I don't know what the answer is going to be.

1126
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,260
And I guess

1127
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,310
the beauty of this is

1128
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,530
the market is going to decide,

1129
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:14,959
right?

1130
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:17,560
Like there's always these people who are like, oh, I'm free market, blah, blah,

1131
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,040
blah, you know, until something you don't like happens and then you're like, oh,

1132
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,429
we should, we should stop doing that.

1133
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:22,790
Let's go get those people.

1134
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,479
And, and

1135
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:26,054
this is one of those instances where like the,

1136
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:29,284
the invisible hand is the only thing

1137
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:30,364
-- that, is there
-- a

1138
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,804
-- stupid
-- question though, is it the market at large or is it the

1139
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:34,415
Bitcoin?

1140
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,165
Well, the mines,

1141
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:37,594
the market at large, I

1142
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:38,665
mean, let's face it.

1143
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:39,705
Ok.

1144
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:41,185
So that's,

1145
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:42,685
yeah,

1146
00:46:42,695 --> 00:46:46,175
it's going to be the miners who basically decide what is

1147
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:49,145
going to happen to the future of Bitcoin in this instance.

1148
00:46:49,155 --> 00:46:51,665
And, and I, I mean, I have no idea what it's going to be

1149
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:54,050
but here's what it kind of comes down to is

1150
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,969
so the new fork I think is called Bitcoin Unlimited.

1151
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,719
And it's currently being viewed as an alt coin.

1152
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:00,790
And if it stays.

1153
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,030
So for those of you who don't know, and I know way more about this than I should,

1154
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,139
I don't even know why I,

1155
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:07,100
for some reason I decided it'd be fun to learn about

1156
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,209
Bitcoin a couple of years back and I bought like,

1157
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:12,120
some mining gear and like, II, I spent way too much time on this.

1158
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:16,219
But anyway, the point is, uh, there's Bitcoin, which is like the granddaddy

1159
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,570
and then there's what they call alt coins,

1160
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,419
which are things like Ethereum falls into them

1161
00:47:20,439 --> 00:47:22,659
and there's pure coin and dog coin and,

1162
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,810
like, more than I can even remember.

1163
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,199
And anyway, the idea

1164
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:27,629
was

1165
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:32,179
no, they made fun of Kanye with one of them and I forget what it was called.

1166
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:36,699
That, that, that I think, I think that one is gone because I believe they were sued.

1167
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,929
But anyway, the, the, the, the point is

1168
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,649
these alt coins are viewed as kind of second class citizens

1169
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:48,100
and their value is tied directly to Bitcoin in most instances.

1170
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,439
And so if Bitcoin and Limited

1171
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,070
is an alt coin, its value will be pegged against Bitcoin property.

1172
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:56,800
Whereas if it's seen as a Bitcoin competitor,

1173
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,719
then it's gonna get weird.

1174
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,340
So we have a free floating, well, we have the current thing with, you know,

1175
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,679
uh currencies globally in the real world.

1176
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:08,620
Like there are company or companies, there are countries sorry

1177
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,689
that have literally pegged their currency to the US dollar in some cases

1178
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,899
at one time. These are generally not,

1179
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:19,600
we'll say giant economies, well, except one, but I think they fix that.

1180
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,340
Uh, you know, and

1181
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,219
I, I don't,

1182
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:27,389
I'm really interested to see what's gonna happen to this because I view this as like,

1183
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,810
this is the invisible hand

1184
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,679
that like this is

1185
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,689
economics at its rawest because there is nobody in charge,

1186
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:42,479
right? Nobody is in charge. We're gonna find out how this ends when it ends.

1187
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,659
There's nothing else to do. But wait.

1188
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:50,639
And part of me also, I mean, the, the greedy part of me kind of hopes that, uh, Bitcoin

1189
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,649
doesn't fork properly because that would dilute the

1190
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,399
value of the Bitcoin I have so there.

1191
00:48:58,709 --> 00:48:59,830
But anyway, anyway,

1192
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,090
yeah.

1193
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,260
No, it's,

1194
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:03,889
it's, it's, it's interesting to see

1195
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,560
-- true consensus protocols is fascinating.
-- I agree. I agree. It's crazy, man.

1196
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:12,209
You know, it's something I think we lack in the security world is we don't,

1197
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,159
I don't think there's any consensus, not even on, like, even, even in terms of like,

1198
00:49:17,169 --> 00:49:19,939
like my favorite all time thing is like, what's a security vulnerability?

1199
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:20,129
There's

1200
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,439
not even

1201
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:21,149
on

1202
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,389
this.

1203
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:23,760
I'm strongly in the no camp

1204
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:24,820
and,

1205
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,159
uh, I like the new C so we got, I talk to her all the time about,

1206
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,689
I think antivirus is dumb.

1207
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:35,040
She's like antivirus is good. I'm like, we'll just agree to disagree here because

1208
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:39,030
II, I think it's both the most terrible thing on the planet,

1209
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,689
but also absolutely necessary for some people.

1210
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,179
You know,

1211
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,659
-- me, you know,
-- anyway, let's,

1212
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:49,300
there's a certain class of people that if you don't have antivirus on their systems,

1213
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:52,300
you're gonna like, then they only have like days for

1214
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,429
weeks

1215
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,959
with one more story.

1216
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:56,469
And this one

1217
00:49:56,649 --> 00:50:01,110
I love for so many reasons. Do you wanna, why don't you explain it? Kurt?

1218
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,879
Which one? The, the next one in line?

1219
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,939
Oh God. That thing is terrifying.

1220
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:07,909
It kind

1221
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:08,429
of

1222
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:08,780
makes sense

1223
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:09,090
for.

1224
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,679
I have no issue with the events happening here. So

1225
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:13,560
no,

1226
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:16,639
so, ok, well,

1227
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,199
depending on how you look at the story,

1228
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:21,149
it's about what I guess we would call dual

1229
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,120
-- use technology.
-- So this

1230
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:22,250
guy

1231
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:24,320
start there.

1232
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:25,659
Yeah.

1233
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:29,669
So this, this guy wrote a remote access tool called NANO

1234
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,159
core. And ostensibly according to him,

1235
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:36,429
it is, you know, it's supposed to be like a legitimate, you know, remote access tool.

1236
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:37,080
So you can like

1237
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:42,239
remotely administer control, whatever a machine log keystrokes,

1238
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,780
look at the log files, blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

1239
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,340
And of course,

1240
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,459
that's the exact same stuff that like most malware does, right? I mean, you know,

1241
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,699
and so he got arrested

1242
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:52,540
and charged, you know,

1243
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,870
for essentially being an accomplice for a whole bunch of hackers.

1244
00:50:54,879 --> 00:50:56,979
Now, obviously this set the community up in an uproar.

1245
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,330
Um and it's a little more subtle than that because apparently he went on to

1246
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,979
was it hack or hacker forums.net dot com or something?

1247
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:06,939
Um

1248
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:08,590
to like advertise this thing.

1249
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,239
Not

1250
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,820
only that.

1251
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,379
So here's the only thing that happened is I went to the way II I spent

1252
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:16,520
some time researching this to make sure I wouldn't make a fool of myself when,

1253
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,189
when I did this.

1254
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:17,750
But uh

1255
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,570
this guy got arrested

1256
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:22,370
and I have no problem with that.

1257
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,429
And here's why

1258
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:26,840
is I went to the way back machine and I loaded up the NANO

1259
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:28,340
core dot IO website.

1260
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,360
And now

1261
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:34,729
if you're looking to acquire a legitimate remote administration tool,

1262
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:39,709
let's see if you're interested in features such as stable remote surveillance.

1263
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,679
OK? No big deal, remote desktop. OK. Fine.

1264
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:44,909
Remote webcam and audio feeds.

1265
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:45,909
What?

1266
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,800
Um dude school

1267
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,610
and they shouldn't

1268
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,479
like, look, look here, we have uh reverse proxy connection, Sox five SOX four,

1269
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,090
http ssl, reverse proxy.

1270
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,879
When you're doing remote administration, why would you need that?

1271
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:06,360
Um I could sort of, well, so that you can uh send their traffic through you to,

1272
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,189
to inspect it

1273
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:07,959
seriously.

1274
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,500
Now

1275
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:12,239
your devil is pretty weak here. Uh

1276
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:17,580
So we'll keep going. There is talks about here. It never drops your clients. It's OK.

1277
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,570
Fine. Uh

1278
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,739
This is clearly

1279
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,750
an application with, with nefarious use.

1280
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,209
I would say it's definitely towards the dark

1281
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:29,379
and I don't think

1282
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:30,620
this guy

1283
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,709
positioned himself in a way that gives him a plausible story that you know,

1284
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,870
it is dual use.

1285
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:38,969
Don't get me wrong. It totally is.

1286
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,790
But

1287
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,649
I don't think in this case

1288
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:46,830
that's how it was being positioned. I think this was clearly meant to be

1289
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:47,610
a

1290
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,209
we'll say questionable use

1291
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:54,159
-- device or, or tool.
-- Well, there's a question if

1292
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,610
I, you know, I'm reasonably certain,

1293
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,449
um,

1294
00:52:57,889 --> 00:52:57,909
I

1295
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,590
mean, I know certain professions have like, a duty to report

1296
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,030
if somebody says they're going to commit a crime. Right.

1297
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,280
And, I mean, for example, I know what, like, for example,

1298
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,870
uh,

1299
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:11,429
you know, in general, in most jurisdictions, if you go to a gun store

1300
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,709
and say I would like to buy a gun and they go, ok, cool. You know, just offhand.

1301
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,350
Why are you buying this? And you go because I'm planning to rob a bank

1302
00:53:18,189 --> 00:53:20,860
-- reasonably certain they're not supposed to sell you that
-- or

1303
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,419
imagine if there was a gun store whose ads were,

1304
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:27,879
you can rob people 20% faster with this gun.

1305
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,520
Like,

1306
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:29,189
do you know what

1307
00:53:31,389 --> 00:53:34,739
I mean? That's kind of what this is, this is set up as

1308
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,479
you can commit crimes much easier with this tool.

1309
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,169
And

1310
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:39,850
I

1311
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:45,169
in, in the story, obviously, the lawyer and the, the, the,

1312
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:50,149
the gentleman in question are positioning themselves and themselves as victims

1313
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:51,050
and

1314
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,889
in any court case, that's what you do.

1315
00:53:55,179 --> 00:54:00,629
You make sure the guy goes out and tells a sob story and explains how he's the victim

1316
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,520
and that's just part of the way it works. And in fact, I don't,

1317
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,620
so

1318
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,300
I understand why this is being done. My one concern,

1319
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,459
I don't feel bad.

1320
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:13,969
-- My
-- biggest concern is that it starts to slide potentially, you know,

1321
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,500
that dial of

1322
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:17,600
um,

1323
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:19,860
culpability and, you know,

1324
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:20,580
um,

1325
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:22,939
well, guilt

1326
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:24,580
literally, uh you know,

1327
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:27,699
to, because I go, you know, I checked on github

1328
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,820
and if you go to that link, um there's like, what was it?

1329
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,060
You can't just say that link hurt. No one knows what that means.

1330
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Yeah. Oh, so sorry if you go to, ah, here we go. If you go to github

1331
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:43,300
and you plug in reverse shell into the search bar

1332
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,419
329 repository results,

1333
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:47,879
you know,

1334
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,149
and um

1335
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:49,260
uh

1336
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,229
some of these are, you know, quite clearly,

1337
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,149
um

1338
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:54,629
legit

1339
00:54:55,149 --> 00:55:00,350
and some of these, OK, like, uh let's see, 12345, the fifth result,

1340
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,179
Hercules is a special payload generator that can bypass antivirus software.

1341
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,229
Interesting.

1342
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,790
Yeah. And it's written in go, which is, that's nice.

1343
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,389
Uh And then on the flip side,

1344
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:13,280
there's other ones that are like a little bit more legitimate, like say a Python,

1345
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,750
reverse DNS shell, you know, that'll send stuff over DNS which,

1346
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,929
and I've actually talked about these in the past because you can use them to,

1347
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,750
here's the deal though, if I do this

1348
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,520
and I put it on

1349
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:26,199
github

1350
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:33,659
and if someone uses my tool to hack, let's say one of the major US parties, right?

1351
00:55:33,669 --> 00:55:34,209
Whatever

1352
00:55:34,669 --> 00:55:37,199
I would expect a visit from the authorities,

1353
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:41,729
I won't say yes, there can be ex

1354
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:42,449
ex

1355
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,159
circumstances here.

1356
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:47,679
But I think fundamentally if you're going to play this game,

1357
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:50,040
you have to be ready for what's going to come.

1358
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,399
And I agree like it's, it can be questionable ethically

1359
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,560
as to whether this is ok or not. Ok.

1360
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,520
It's like, you know, gun manufacturers know their,

1361
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,669
their guns kill people but they still make them.

1362
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:03,270
-- But like,
-- well, part of it is, you know, some of these people are doing this for

1363
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:03,689
purposes.

1364
00:56:04,939 --> 00:56:09,750
It's a complicated area. I'm not going to disagree with you. But I think in this case

1365
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,870
I don't feel bad for this guy.

1366
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:13,379
Well,

1367
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:17,310
it's funny because I remember and this is years ago and I'll have to find the link but

1368
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,189
I wanna say University of Calgary, uh part of their comps,

1369
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:22,429
I think they were gonna have a course on writing

1370
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:26,554
and, oh my God, the amount of controversy caused

1371
00:56:26,735 --> 00:56:29,145
and of course they went to all sorts of, you know,

1372
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:31,794
like they're going to be air gapped computers, not online, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1373
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:31,905
blah.

1374
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:34,635
And all I can remember thinking was like, who cares?

1375
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:38,794
There's like millions of viruses coming out every year. And this is like a decade ago

1376
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:39,435
that you

1377
00:56:39,675 --> 00:56:42,754
think the criminals are gonna go and learn and then

1378
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:44,274
steal grammar's fine,

1379
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:48,179
the whole Satan thing, security analysis tool

1380
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,439
to do. And honestly, like, it didn't do anything. All that exciting.

1381
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:55,600
And now those things are

1382
00:56:56,409 --> 00:57:01,229
standard commercial products that are actually, in some cases require, like,

1383
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,659
doesn't PC I require it.

1384
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:03,020
Don't

1385
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:03,750
know.

1386
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:06,340
I'm pretty sure the payment card industry standard

1387
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,500
requires some level of network scanning on a somewhat regular basis.

1388
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:13,820
Yeah, they, they they have continuous monitoring

1389
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,550
to a degree which that can be part of it. It's

1390
00:57:17,149 --> 00:57:19,530
no, I know. It's, it's complicated anyway.

1391
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:22,330
It's from 2003. I know it's really old.

1392
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:22,469
Uh,

1393
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,989
no, Satan is even older than 2003. Man. Satan's from like the nineties

1394
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,830
University of Calgary.

1395
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,709
-- The
-- virus.

1396
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,330
Satan is like 95

1397
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:31,580
than before.

1398
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,939
Oh, yeah. No, that's, he got, didn't he get fired? I

1399
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:37,129
remember now. It's been so long.

1400
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:38,899
Yeah.

1401
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:40,820
So, I mean, you know,

1402
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:44,260
and it just makes me laugh now because honestly these things are like,

1403
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:48,070
yeah, I mean, even if you wrote like a really terrible virus,

1404
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,840
-- it's like literally a
-- drop in the bucket.

1405
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,510
It is. It is. It's,

1406
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,449
and, and I guess

1407
00:57:54,129 --> 00:57:57,189
we can wrap everything back up into

1408
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:02,469
the one thing we keep talking about over and over and over again is the fact that

1409
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,750
all of this stuff put together,

1410
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,439
the only solution is to be able to respond quickly to your environment

1411
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,590
because we're never gonna write secure code.

1412
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,159
We're never gonna have TV. S that aren't terrible, right.

1413
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:15,989
We're never gonna have phone companies that don't want to spy on us.

1414
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,770
We're never gonna have antivirus free or, or

1415
00:58:19,169 --> 00:58:19,270
vent

1416
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:23,830
that too, right? Virus and antivirus free computers.

1417
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,250
It's, it's a matter of if you are an organization that can't move quickly, you, you,

1418
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,389
you've already lost.

1419
00:58:30,399 --> 00:58:31,750
I mean, that's just the end of the story

1420
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:32,179
period

1421
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,790
and I would expand that.

1422
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,550
It's not just the organizations that write and create these things,

1423
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,080
-- it's the organizations that
-- consume

1424
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,520
exactly both ends.

1425
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:45,580
You know, if you can't, if you don't know what's on your network and you can't,

1426
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,500
for example, firewall it or,

1427
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,590
um,

1428
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,270
you know,

1429
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,229
somehow deal with it to some degree if it's found to be completely vulnerable,

1430
00:58:53,409 --> 00:58:53,949
you know.

1431
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:57,060
Uh, like, for example, let's say the smart TV S are on your corporate network,

1432
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,429
you know, maybe they should be on their own V

1433
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,149
land that's monitored. Right.

1434
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:02,639
I mean, if you can't do that you've lost

1435
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:03,070
smart

1436
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:03,449
TV.

1437
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,760
Of course, there are. Right. I mean,

1438
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,770
you know, for video conferencing or whatnot.

1439
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:10,580
So,

1440
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:13,639
I, I think that's the reality is we have to move,

1441
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,040
you know? Well, it's think about the real world. Right.

1442
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,689
We, we try crime prevention but the reality is

1443
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:21,699
something bad happens down 911, they show up. Hopefully.

1444
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,840
Exactly correct. It's all about fast response. It's not about prevention

1445
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:30,479
-- because prevention doesn't work. Oh,
-- great example.

1446
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,090
85.

1447
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,209
Oh,

1448
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:31,750
good.

1449
00:59:31,919 --> 00:59:34,719
We should, maybe next week we'll discuss that. That's like,

1450
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,959
well, you know what, we'll discuss it next week.

1451
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,090
Hopefully we'll know

1452
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,459
more of the aftermath.

1453
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,040
Well, it's a pretty simple story and they did arrest him.

1454
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,479
I haven't heard they arrested anyone yet. I, I haven't made it that far but all

1455
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,280
next week, next week, next week.

1456
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,530
All right. Cool.
