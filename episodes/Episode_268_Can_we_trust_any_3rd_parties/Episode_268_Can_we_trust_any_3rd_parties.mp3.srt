Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,239
Kurtz Fried and my partner in biological firmware updates.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,590
-- Josh Bresser. What's
-- a biological firmware update

3
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:15,649
of vaccine?

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,059
Oh, those right. Yes,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,540
that's right.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,389
Well, I, you didn't use those words.

7
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:24,870
I'm not real quick, man.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,700
Well, it's funny because I was actually talking with my son about what is firmware.

9
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,150
And I was like, well, back in the day it was like, you,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,549
you took an E prom and like physically burned it in,

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,349
it was like this magical hardware stuff that you could like reprogram.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,689
It was kind of both the memory and the execution and magic.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,669
And I'm like, and now firmware is just everything.

14
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,799
It's just software.

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,770
Like there's those shoes that had software. My, all my light bulbs have software.

16
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:52,639
This sort of leads into our topic for today, which is

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,720
what happens when you get things that are so large and complex. Can you secure them?

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,389
No.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,080
No, you can't.

20
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,189
Right. And, and that's kind of,

21
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,220
yeah, basically, I mean, you can make it less

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,019
like the financial system amazes me like there's all these financial shenanigans.

23
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,650
We try to minimize their impact sometimes we win,

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,699
sometimes we have Bernie Madoff and we lose hard.

25
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,209
I feel like we've just mixed a lot of weird things into the pot.

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,550
-- Yeah.
-- But basically, so this is in the context of five G.

27
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:20,900
Well,

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,370
there's so there's a couple of things that

29
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,089
I think we should frame this conversation,

30
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:25,589
five G

31
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,389
part of it.

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,620
And we'll, we'll, we'll talk about that in a moment.

33
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,330
There's this code

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:30,819
COV

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,949
issue which is we,

36
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,230
we'll talk about that a little bit and then there's just more solar winds news,

37
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,190
which is the story that will never die.

38
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,040
I suspect.

39
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,470
So let's start at and,

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,269
and I guess we're going to wrap this all up into the box of third party

41
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,610
stuff. Ok?

42
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:46,870
And

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,790
sometimes it can work really well and sometimes it can absolutely not work.

44
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:55,360
I think it always works well. But let's start with five G. This one is your story.

45
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,930
I will let you explain it.

46
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,660
I love five G because it has the potential to be so amazing, right?

47
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:04,900
We're talking super low latency, super high speed.

48
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,760
You know, I,

49
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:09,130
I know what it's like now to have gigabit fiber at home and it is fantastic.

50
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,419
Like I'm so happy, for example,

51
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,759
spacelink is now available for people out in the sticks

52
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,940
because they have terrible internet, sorry,

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,380
sorry,

54
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:15,990
whatever.

55
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,149
And so

56
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,779
five G, you know, I look at what the internet enabled whole new industries

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,830
and I look at what smartphones and apps have enabled whole new industries,

58
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,380
right?

59
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,699
Not just new companies,

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,839
but just entirely new things that we couldn't even conceive of before.

61
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,080
You could not run the modern economy on dial up.

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,000
Just you couldn't, you have to have high speed.

63
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,380
And so five G is fascinating because I was, I,

64
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,229
I was running a thought experiment with myself which is given a

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,070
five G network that I own and operate and fully control.

66
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:49,149
Can I actually

67
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,029
know for sure that it's not

68
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,610
aggressing data that I want to stay in my network?

69
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:58,380
So like billing or customer data or it's like secretly mirroring all the

70
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:01,070
phone calls of all the government officials to a server in Russia.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,250
And the answer is because five G is so big

72
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,860
and complicated and there's so many ingress and egress points,

73
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:10,102
like it's connected to the internet, it's connected to millions of cell phones,

74
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,962
it's connected to millions of computers.

75
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,132
You can't lock it down.

76
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,873
There's even more to it than that.

77
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:20,313
And I'll put this story in the show notes is from the European angle.

78
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:24,973
The providers of all of this gear for five G is the United States or China.

79
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:28,692
-- If you're Europe, do you trust either of those entities?
-- Well, and it gets better.

80
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:31,376
It's not just the, they're providing you the equipment

81
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,636
in a lot of cases, they're operating it for you. Right. Right.

82
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:35,835
And that's the thing like there.

83
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,755
If I buy the equipment and operate it there's, at least

84
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:44,076
-- maybe the possibility I can sort of secure it.
-- No, there isn't. Well, not anymore.

85
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:47,555
-- Well, no.
-- And then, yeah, now with it being as complicated as is there is no chance.

86
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,975
But if I'm not even operating it, if that's outsourced, then there's no hope.

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,820
You literally

88
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:53,960
the security.

89
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,100
It,

90
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,869
it's basically bank security and that I give my money to the bank and

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,779
I trust and hope that they do the right thing and don't lose it.

92
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:03,020
Right? And from the aspect of Europe, like,

93
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,880
do you, do you trust the United States government not to do shenanigans?

94
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,610
And the answer is no, they don't.

95
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,669
Do you trust the Chinese government not to do shenanigans?

96
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,250
And the answer is no, they don't.

97
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,740
-- Yeah,
-- look, I'm just thinking, you know,

98
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,029
given 30 days of cell phone and phone records

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,369
for a country that's the entire social graph.

100
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,890
Who knows who, what their relationships are probably.

101
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,049
And I was thinking about this, like, how do you securely,

102
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,440
how do you securely communicate with somebody else nowadays? I mean,

103
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,260
and you know,

104
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,970
so uh you're gonna need like end to end encryption so nobody can watch it.

105
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,769
But then the second problem is who cares? Because meta data is usually enough.

106
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,890
But just the fact that a talk to be at three in the morning for 20 minutes,

107
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:49,649
the only answer is you have to go to the park and sit on opposite park benches and

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,670
right, just like in the movies, I'm sure that's fine.

109
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,589
Yeah, that was my favorite thing with the Burn after reading was all these people.

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Like,

111
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,820
I've been to DC

112
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:00,429
and

113
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,670
there's, like, in all these movies, there's just tons of people in suits,

114
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,709
sitting on park benches,

115
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,609
like eating an apple and reading the paper or just sitting there staring,

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,869
not at you. And I'm like, that doesn't happen in real life.

117
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,589
Some of the parks might have. I mean, so here's the thing. Everyone in DC wears a suit.

118
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,100
-- Yeah. But, and they're all camped out on their phones.
-- I mean, now they are, but

119
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,959
you know, these old movies, it was different,

120
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,359
right where you didn't have a phone so you might have to read the paper or something.

121
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:34,239
Stare at the squirrels, maybe. I mean, you figure if I've got an hour of free time

122
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,299
gonna go sit outside and, and do nothing, you know,

123
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,779
the, the other thing is,

124
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,899
is you can't not deploy five G if you want to have a modern economy, you, you,

125
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,170
you can't opt out of this.

126
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,839
-- So what do you do?
-- Well, and, and so this kind of leads itself now into this code

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,450
COV

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,470
discussion as well where the, the,

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,940
so the story that happened here is there's this company, I'm probably,

130
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,170
I'm probably pronouncing it wrong, but I call it code COV

131
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,130
in my head.

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,743
And the idea is this is a company that provides a tool that when you run your tests,

133
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,183
it will tell you how much code coverage, your test hit.

134
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,903
And obviously in any application, ideally,

135
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,414
you want your testing to hit 100% of the code you have written.

136
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:17,053
And of course, that's never the case.

137
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:19,334
There's always some amount that never gets hit in testing.

138
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:20,694
-- Well, unless
-- you're Google,

139
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:21,824
you have

140
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,044
-- shenanigans.
-- Right.

141
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:23,664
Right.

142
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,194
And so what happens though is the way this

143
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:30,694
works is you basically inside of your like Jenkins scripts

144
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:31,608
you

145
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,928
call

146
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,358
out, it's the, you know, curl

147
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,247
pipe to sh sort of command

148
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,208
where you call,

149
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:44,567
that's literally the documentation is bash space less than bracket.

150
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:44,958
E

151
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:45,167
hyphen

152
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:46,898
S blah, blah, blah, blah blah bracket.

153
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,678
And so what happens is you're downloading the script from their

154
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:54,167
server and then basically just running it in your environment,

155
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:57,377
-- run your tests, magic and then you get a
-- report.

156
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,567
My favorite part of this is

157
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:03,312
you're not just downloading it once and keeping a copy of it, but you're doing it

158
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:04,872
repeatedly potentially.

159
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,611
That's right. Every time you run it, it's a

160
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:07,941
new

161
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,962
for bad things to happen.

162
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,242
And, and that's basically what happened is it

163
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:16,592
-- an evildoer got into their stuff.
-- We don't know that they were evil,

164
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,511
whatever

165
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,752
of an entity

166
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:26,682
of unknown origin and intent, basically added code to this script

167
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:27,876
that then

168
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,605
we, we don't exactly know. And this is one of those stories.

169
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:36,295
No, it exported all the, all the, the g environment variables.

170
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,036
That's what we know today and here's my concern with that is the story.

171
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,026
It's evolving over time.

172
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:45,876
Like Joseph Men just wrote a story this morning at the time of recording that,

173
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:47,376
that kind of shed some more light on this.

174
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,955
There's a lot more going on here. We don't know. And my suspicion is the ko

175
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,635
-- people don't know either.
-- Well, the thing is we can't know,

176
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,899
we know for sure one instance of the script did this one bad thing.

177
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:59,350
But I mean,

178
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,500
there could have been scripts flying out of there that formatted

179
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,739
the hard drive or inserted malicious code or a malware or,

180
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,230
or they could have done anything.

181
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,670
And I mean, here's where it gets complicated is so

182
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,160
generally speaking,

183
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,779
in most C I environments

184
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,980
you,

185
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,619
you aren't, you,

186
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:24,070
you want to build your code and not necessarily release what

187
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,899
you're testing in that way and it's complicated and weird.

188
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,739
But I think in many instances,

189
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,769
the potential for backdoor here is probably pretty low,

190
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,599
but it's definitely not zero because obviously everyone kind

191
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,460
of has their own Homebrew C I infrastructure,

192
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,643
which is one of the unique challenges to this problem.

193
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,244
-- But anyway, anyway, there
-- are,

194
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:44,814
you don't have to be that sophisticated to place

195
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,283
a back door because you can go buy them,

196
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:47,403
you can rent them. Now.

197
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:47,734
That's

198
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,484
like the ransomware stuff. It's

199
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:49,924
true.

200
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:52,883
And I'm kind of shocked that nobody shoved a ransomware into one of these things.

201
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:56,453
-- But anyway,
-- so this is I, I want to tie this now to the five G story,

202
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:57,523
which is kind of that.

203
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,393
How do you trust what you're getting from

204
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,789
your five G vendor? How do you trust what you're getting from your software vendor?

205
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,229
And like this totally plays itself now into solar winds, which is like,

206
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:12,630
it's the same freaking story of some company gave you a thing. Now. What?

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,859
Well,

208
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,500
and it's not even just that they gave you a

209
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,619
thing but they've had problems in the past where,

210
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,755
oh, that thing was weirdly modified, whatever.

211
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,835
Just smash that override button and jam it in like straight up.

212
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,695
That's, you know what they were telling customers like, oh,

213
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:25,114
the digital signature failed.

214
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,554
Cool. Y just

215
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,505
force it.

216
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,554
And I'm like,

217
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,775
why even bother having digital signatures if you ignore them

218
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:35,325
-- when they fail? Which
-- everyone does. I mean,

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,359
you know, there's a couple of apps on my Mac where, you know, Apple is like, oh boy,

220
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,359
like it's not from the store and it's not signed and I'm like, just,

221
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,599
just install the same thing.

222
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:44,960
Shut up.

223
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,469
I need to work.

224
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,270
-- Uh
-- I can't help but feel like somebody installing

225
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,239
solar winds should be a little more careful than,

226
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,520
you know, me installing some random whatever on my Mac

227
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,770
one would think.

228
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:58,700
This reminds me of the whole BP Deepwater horizons disaster in that.

229
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,039
A company makes some relatively bad mistakes.

230
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,309
It gets exploited and it has an outside

231
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,742
effect. So

232
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:07,812
the code C

233
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,442
thing is great because it affects about 29,000

234
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:16,721
-- customers,
-- open source and companies and like the number is astronomical.

235
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:21,702
Well, and, and it's not one thing per company customer either, right?

236
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,682
A lot of them have multiple things.

237
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,601
So the amount of code affected by this, it's over 9000.

238
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,281
The thing I'm thinking about here is,

239
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:34,012
is how do you even begin to do incident response when incident response is like,

240
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:34,562
all right,

241
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:38,484
free company in the world has to go audit their code base for bad stuff.

242
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:39,494
Well, if they could do that,

243
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:40,463
they'd be doing that and they wouldn't

244
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,804
-- have as many security vulnerabilities you
-- can't because

245
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,523
for example, a bunch of open source has been affected by this.

246
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,963
You can't audit that, you don't know

247
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,523
-- what's in it half the time as it is. And so it's one of those unique problems
-- where,

248
00:10:56,653 --> 00:11:00,934
well, and it spanned like three or four months. It was from January to April of 2021.

249
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:03,073
-- Like,
-- yeah, it's a long time

250
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,604
that that's what really offends me.

251
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,406
Not only that it was there for three or four months,

252
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,435
but that a customer had to notify them.

253
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,185
I mean, the company didn't keep an eye on this script.

254
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:13,245
Well, I'm sure they thought they were

255
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:13,846
but

256
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,806
-- they clearly weren't
-- because they specifically said as

257
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:18,536
one of their steps for fixing this,

258
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,315
that they are now downloading that script once in a while to you know,

259
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,125
sort of keep an eye on it.

260
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:24,056
And I'm like, well, that's, that's nice, but

261
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,445
there's so many ways to still

262
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,145
-- shenanigans.
-- Right. Right. Right.

263
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,325
So, ok. Ok.

264
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:33,926
-- So here's, I've, I've done a bunch of thinking about this one because this
-- is,

265
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:34,245
there's

266
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:38,607
literally no way to securely do this is to hand out a bash script and hope for the best.

267
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:42,208
It doesn't matter how secure it is because it's easy. So it's going to win. Ok.

268
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:44,487
So let's ignore that part of the problem, right?

269
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:48,328
Because that's, and here's the thing, even if it wasn't a bash script,

270
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:50,357
even if they had

271
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,148
something you downloaded from their website and inserted into your project,

272
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:55,958
it doesn't really matter because it's just going to end

273
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,978
up downloading a bunch of crap from them anyway.

274
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,357
That's probably unchecked.

275
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,218
That's the other thing that gets me right is by definition,

276
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:03,888
anything that has an update mechanism

277
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,650
-- is potential, arbitrary code execution.
-- That's right.

278
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,250
I mean, look at what was the not pet you right where it was,

279
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,150
it was literally an update from accounting software that was full of malware.

280
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:18,150
Here's the thinking on this because I've done a nontrivial amount of,

281
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,650
of writing and thinking on this topic because it matters.

282
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,690
So here's the deal is from the perspective of trust,

283
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,219
you just have to kind of draw a line and say I trust this open

284
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,789
source project.

285
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,190
I trust this vendor, whatever because there's just nothing you can do, right.

286
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,530
You might

287
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,992
think you can. But the reality is you actually can't.

288
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:39,932
If you have 300 dependencies from N PM in your project,

289
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,692
you're not auditing that code, right.

290
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,831
So you've got all this stuff, you're running it in your infrastructure

291
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:47,322
and let's say you think some of it might be bad.

292
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:51,271
So, what are you gonna do? Are you going to stop using it? Are you going to contact

293
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:54,372
the 9000 open source vendors you're using? There's just,

294
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:55,752
there isn't a good solution.

295
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:58,651
And even if you contact your corporation, you're going to say, hey,

296
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,132
give us a statement on this, we're going to be like, everything's fine.

297
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,171
We did our analysis like did you,

298
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,064
well,

299
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:05,174
you don't know.

300
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,374
So here's the thing,

301
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:11,064
the only solution to this problem is to have the ability to move quickly.

302
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,674
So when, when not, if,

303
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,693
when a report comes out that something was

304
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,604
we'll say maliciously modified or has questionable origin,

305
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:25,073
you have to be able to fix that in less than a day. That is the solution.

306
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,343
-- The
-- problem is what does fixing that mean?

307
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,424
Because if you are now looking at some, it means different things.

308
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,854
Well, and the problem is for this, for example, you're now saying

309
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:36,640
there may have been some malicious code added to your thing at

310
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,940
some point in the last three or four months.

311
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,510
I think what this really speaks to is having, you know,

312
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,989
sort of this Netflix style of infrastructure where it's,

313
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,590
it's constantly renewing itself.

314
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,200
Because I think one of the biggest things now

315
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,549
is we have to accept that the Attackers will win and get in.

316
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,909
So we have to make it really difficult

317
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,599
ideally for them to pivot and gain additional access

318
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,780
and number two to get persistence,

319
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:00,210
right?

320
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:03,150
And so, for example, one thing I loved at Red Hat was in theory,

321
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,309
the build system basically took a, you know,

322
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,530
an RP A source R PM package and built it in a quote unquote air quotes offline system,

323
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:10,780
right?

324
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,739
And the reason I like that is because mostly I didn't care about security,

325
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,890
I cared about the fact that we could actually build this thing.

326
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,419
Like if some remote website was down or not working,

327
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,630
we're not up the creek, right?

328
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:25,739
The challenge with that is, of course, it takes discipline and maturity to do that.

329
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,210
But I think it's, it's worth it.

330
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,869
And I think just that alone,

331
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,369
having your BUILD system essentially run in sort of an offline mode

332
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:36,659
would benefit people in so many ways, right? Like left

333
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,479
disappears and everything doesn't just immediately break.

334
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,059
-- That's part of it I think is
-- so caching and being able to do it offline, I get that,

335
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,479
that's tough because, you know, there's a lot of Mavin and Gradel and all these,

336
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:48,640
you know,

337
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,179
build systems that essentially anticipate being online and

338
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,159
grabbing stuff on the fly as needed,

339
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:54,679
right?

340
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,599
And so now you need to build this big thing in

341
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,809
front of it that kind of pre populates all that.

342
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,059
-- But,
-- and even those have had problems,

343
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,780
there's some hilarious problems you get where, for example,

344
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,150
there was a security researcher, I'll try to dig up the report.

345
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:12,179
But basically if you were running behind, I think it was Maven or J Frog,

346
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,900
you could basically

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,080
set it up. So internally

348
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,750
you might be querying some like package at

349
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,875
available in your J Frog except it checks like N PM first.

350
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,375
Yeah, it checks the public ones first.

351
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:28,945
-- So
-- if someone creates a public thing with the same name as your internal thing,

352
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,426
it's going to pull in the public one before it pulls in your internal one,

353
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,546
which obviously is like, hold on there.

354
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:36,585
Yeah, I remember we, I think we talked about that on our previous podcast maybe.

355
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,765
-- Anyway,
-- probably we talk about a lot of stuff.

356
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:39,435
That's the thing, right?

357
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:42,445
These, these build systems have made a lot of assumptions

358
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,452
that may or may not be what you're expecting

359
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,572
and they're definitely not expecting to be offline.

360
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,731
So getting them to work sort of offline is not, it's going to be nontrivial.

361
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:55,432
The other thing that gets me about this is the complexity.

362
00:15:55,702 --> 00:16:01,052
I have sort of set up build C I CD pipelines. They are super nontrivial.

363
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,291
There's a reason

364
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:06,132
that there are so many commercial services that do this.

365
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,090
Yeah, it's super hard, you know,

366
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:12,440
you know what it reminds me of actually is to kind of put my geezer hat on for a minute.

367
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,030
Is

368
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:17,070
I remember creating build systems back in the make days, like when you had auto

369
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,330
-- comp and you had auto make and whatever
-- dot slash gunfire

370
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,359
space make space, make, install or no make test.

371
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,429
When you would do that, I remember you would, you would write like your auto

372
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,390
comp script

373
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,130
and it would be say 300 lines and it would create like 200,000 lines of output

374
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,979
in terms of checking lots of stuff and building your make files and doing this.

375
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:42,369
And I remember thinking I have no way to vet any of this stuff. It just created.

376
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,250
-- I'm going to assume it is correct.
-- I just played whack a mole like, OK, it failed. OK,

377
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,429
just try to fix OK. It's missing a hitter file or whatever.

378
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,270
Just, and just keep whacking what those moles until the thing.

379
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:53,940
I

380
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:57,280
mean, that was once the build system existed though is what you're talking about.

381
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,469
I'm talking about actually creating the build systems.

382
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,080
It was bananas,

383
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,700
how much output you got because these were all these

384
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,670
wacky macros that did all this stuff and it was,

385
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,449
it was a site.

386
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,729
I mean, it was amazing to behold when it worked, but at the same time, it was,

387
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,589
I recognized even back then, I have no idea what is in this.

388
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,510
It's just too big

389
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,030
how many people really don't understand how their house works

390
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,520
-- or their car. I, I, I'm not even going to pretend to understand how my car
-- works.

391
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,368
You don't have to either. Right.

392
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,689
No. No. Well, unless something breaks and then it's,

393
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,949
somebody has to understand how it works to fix it.

394
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,449
-- Well,
-- somebody, you an expert, you bring it to.

395
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,339
Right. And

396
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,060
that's

397
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,619
in the tech world.

398
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,410
It's weird that it doesn't seem to work out very well When we do that,

399
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:41,844
experts, Kurt,

400
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,505
I'll do anything. It's fine. I'll just do it myself. It's easy.

401
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:49,114
But uh what, what always gets me is this like this code

402
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:52,864
C thing? I don't know that it can be done securely because

403
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,824
the script itself is basically designed.

404
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,780
It's written in Bash because it's basically the lowest

405
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,439
common denominator of this will work almost everywhere.

406
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,810
OK. Let me, let me ask you a different question.

407
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,339
So how do you, so let's say we're going to say code

408
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,619
-- COV can't be secured.
-- Well, the alternative is for code

409
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,569
COV to actually build a whole pile of different, you know,

410
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,609
installation specific things.

411
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,050
Why does

412
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,319
-- matter what is the
-- difference that could be signed or could be better integrated?

413
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,260
But you can't prove that's any safer if you have people

414
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,380
downloading your new artifacts every time they do a build,

415
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,300
why, why is it any different?

416
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,359
You could have code signing?

417
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,910
And in theory, like for example, it could be an executable that's code signed,

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,140
right?

419
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,380
Bash

420
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,599
doesn't have

421
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,790
a,

422
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,540
-- that, that's just not a thing with bat. But
-- here's the thing.

423
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,550
If the attacker had the ability to covertly modify a batch script,

424
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,060
they could have totally changed whatever

425
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,439
Kov was distributing, say an N PM. Like I'm just saying, there's,

426
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,920
there's no solution to this problem.

427
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,750
There is no complete solution to this problem, but you can begin to

428
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,050
walk off things that the attacker can do. So you can go,

429
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:58,329
for example, instead of keeping the signing key on the server,

430
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,030
you can have the signing key in an HSM with good logging.

431
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:05,369
And now you can say, oh, the attacker used the key seven times on these dates

432
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:06,329
instead of,

433
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,469
well, the attacker has the key in. Uh we, we have like this is a perfect example.

434
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:12,619
The attacker,

435
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,079
we definitely know that they modified the script for about 3 to 4 months.

436
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,270
That's all they can say. What does that mean? We don't know what they did.

437
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,760
We don't know how often they might.

438
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,119
I'm guessing Ockham's Razor is that they only

439
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,780
modified it the once and just were like,

440
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,160
ha ha this works awesome and moved on with life.

441
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:31,459
I mean, like, so we have an example of this is

442
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:36,520
there is a red hat security advisory that exists because an attacker broke in

443
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,609
and signed a version of open

444
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:42,439
SSH. Red hat had an HSM, the key wasn't leaked

445
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,400
and because of logging, they knew exactly which version

446
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,599
was signed So obviously there's an update that says

447
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:51,099
we'll install this update because this has a

448
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,530
larger version number than this other version of open

449
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:53,770
SSH

450
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,699
that we don't know what's in it, but we know it's probably bad.

451
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,619
We'll never completely solve this, but we can definitely raise the bar.

452
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,839
Oh, no, no, no, we're not done yet. We're not done yet.

453
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,839
So, ok, so let's say code cove signs their stuff, who's checking the signatures,

454
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:08,680
right.

455
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,099
Well, it, ironically they,

456
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,979
they are sort of trying to do so they released a little script that

457
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:19,329
essentially curls the bash script down and then curls sha 256 sum down from github

458
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,099
user content and compares it.

459
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,859
So you'd have to break into their github and

460
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,020
-- you know, their web server.
-- This is new now, I've not seen this.

461
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,500
It's on their code

462
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,219
cov bash uploader web page, I assume they add,

463
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:34,155
let's just say recently.

464
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,824
Yeah, I mean, it, it's, it's

465
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:35,994
a

466
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:39,135
step. It's obviously you're never going to be perfect.

467
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:39,785
But I mean,

468
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:42,864
that's the big challenge is there's lots of things that sign

469
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,905
something and then it never gets checked which defeats the purpose.

470
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,084
The problem is you don't have to be perfect.

471
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,224
The problem is companies are making mistakes like solar winds, 123,

472
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,375
that was the interns fault.

473
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:52,895
It's fine.

474
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:55,265
Yeah. So, I mean, that's,

475
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,030
yeah, that,

476
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,390
that's kind of what I'm getting at if these companies were

477
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,760
making sophisticated mistakes that let me put it this way.

478
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,729
Airlines, typically when they have a problem, it's a, it's a chain of events.

479
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:08,339
It's, you know, my famous, my,

480
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:11,709
my favorite one being air transat where they installed the wrong size fuel pump,

481
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,930
the um, or backwards. I forget which I think it was backwards.

482
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,619
Anyways, the, the, the line rubbed it split,

483
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,349
it started spraying fuel so the one side is leaking.

484
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,270
So what does the captain of the plane do? Oh, you know, uh my left side is

485
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,219
running out of fuel. I'm gonna pump fuel from the right side to the left side

486
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,770
and he manages

487
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:32,910
hail Mary to dead stick landing in the uh like in the

488
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,270
Azure or basically somewhere in the middle of nowhere and you know,

489
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,260
nobody dies.

490
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,670
Yay.

491
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,390
But

492
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,270
like it's a comedy of errors,

493
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,089
right? It's, it's just these like you did what?

494
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:46,790
Now these technology things like solar winds are comically

495
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,869
terrible.

496
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,750
These are the airline equivalent of, oh, we forgot to put any fuel in the plane or?

497
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,290
Oh, you wanted like all four engines installed for the flight? What? Oh, yeah.

498
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,829
No, we thought two was good and you know,

499
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,395
-- we'll get the next two on Wednesday
-- to be fine.

500
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:05,614
-- Yeah, you know,
-- it's sort of look, I think that's an unfair comparison because

501
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:12,005
I feel like so in the airline industry, most of these problems are well understood.

502
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,484
-- Dude. Come
-- on solar winds 123

503
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:19,045
but Kurt that was irrelevant to the actual problem. I recognize that, that

504
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,959
that is an issue for its own reasons.

505
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:26,550
But I think obsessing over that terrible password distracts from the bigger issue.

506
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,449
Well, but it,

507
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:32,619
-- it shows a systemic and endemic failure at solar winds and
-- I'll agree with that.

508
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,069
And that's part of, that's part of the story.

509
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,969
But I think obsessing over one terrible

510
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:40,800
password distracts us from the actual problems.

511
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,040
Sorry, to me that that

512
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:46,873
was a symptom of like, to me it's like this is so much worse than you. It

513
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,463
appears at first glance.

514
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:53,003
I mean, it might be, but it's not just solar winds, it's almost everyone.

515
00:22:53,032 --> 00:22:56,333
And I'm saying that so I see a couple of issues here,

516
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:59,672
the vast majority of developers want to do the right thing.

517
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:00,262
I know security.

518
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:03,692
People love to bash developers and be like, oh, those idiots are just trying to,

519
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:04,883
you know, they just want to make it work,

520
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:05,916
don't care about security.

521
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,836
Like I think most of them do and I think in

522
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,536
many instances it's sometimes hard to do the right thing.

523
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,885
-- Well,
-- it's also what is the right thing? Yeah,

524
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:14,336
we don't always know exactly.

525
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,706
I mean, like signing software,

526
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:19,875
building software supply chains are a great example of it's, this is hard stuff.

527
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,186
Like I'll give you a great, I'll give you a great example is

528
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:27,816
I was reading a report from a very well known security company

529
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:31,536
and they basically said oh, you should do reproducible builds. And I said how

530
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,689
they're like, what do you mean? I'm like, you tell me how to do this.

531
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,989
I know this problem and I know what the solution looks like. I want you to explain it.

532
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,069
They're like, well, I'm like, yeah,

533
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:44,439
you can't tell people to do this

534
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,459
and then not tell them how to do it.

535
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,459
-- Like that is a problem or
-- even have some really solid actionable advice and

536
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:51,920
it's not,

537
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,319
it's all squishy fluffy.

538
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, you should do these things. Like buy a unicorn. It's like, where do I buy them?

539
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,160
Well,

540
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,260
it's what you should do is eat healthy and exercise

541
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,280
more and drink lots of water and get good sleep.

542
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,045
Well, yes, we all know that, but none of us do it. You know

543
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,724
-- what
-- I'm saying is that's not actionable advice. No,

544
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:07,285
I agree.

545
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:08,724
It feels like it could be.

546
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:12,285
-- But it's not
-- like, and I, you know, I feel like a jerk for this but to quit smoking,

547
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:13,244
you just quit smoking.

548
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,944
But then the second part and this is the tricky bit is you never do it again. Right.

549
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,405
-- Right.
-- And that's the second part that a lot of people have trouble with.

550
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:22,765
-- This
-- is what annoys me to no end is the fact that

551
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:26,704
there are countless people who want to do the right thing,

552
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:29,285
but we don't know sometimes what it is.

553
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,834
But even when we do know what it is,

554
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,880
I think we're not making it easy to do. No, we're not.

555
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,260
And even if you know what to do, sometimes it is impossible to do it. Right.

556
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,439
And like my favorite example here is like third party dependencies, right?

557
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,699
Be it hardware, you're buying, be it software, you're downloading, be it software,

558
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,359
you're buying be it Windows from Microsoft.

559
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:49,719
Right.

560
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:54,459
Like we obsess over this and it's becoming a huge topic because

561
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:57,555
of every thing going on around supply chains and it should be.

562
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,035
But I've yet to see anything even remotely resembling

563
00:25:01,204 --> 00:25:03,474
good actionable advice here.

564
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:09,364
-- It's all just hand wavy nonsense that's meant to shift blame.
-- Well, I part of it is

565
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:13,025
I'm not sure we even have defined the terms properly because

566
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,545
we were having this discussion yesterday on the github issues.

567
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,694
Remember where we're talking about sort of what counts as inclusion and embedding,

568
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,599
right? Like this is a subtle thing.

569
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:25,040
So for example, there's a big difference between a hypothetical example,

570
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,599
I update open as a cell to fix a security problem. Cool.

571
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,260
Then I, so I update the system open as a cell

572
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:35,290
and for example, uh Apache the web server.

573
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,130
Well, once it's restarted, makes use of that open SSL,

574
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,540
like I don't actually have to kind of

575
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,219
necessarily maybe do anything to Apache,

576
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,099
right? If it's using the system open SSL as it versus

577
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,969
a piece of software where open SS cell is embedded.

578
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,160
OK. So open SSL updates.

579
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:52,650
Well,

580
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,160
that doesn't do that piece of software any

581
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,969
good until that piece of software updates,

582
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:59,890
its dependency pulls in a new version of open SSL gets recompiled, blah, blah, blah,

583
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,239
blah blah.

584
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,439
Right. And we're talking about sort of where is that line?

585
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:06,339
And that line can be very subtle, you know. Well, system libraries are,

586
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,290
at least it's just a restart. Like you don't need to get new software and do

587
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,770
too much strangeness. Typically it's just

588
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,390
install the update, restart the system.

589
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:18,890
And for example, hope that the fix wasn't to remove something you need

590
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,050
it

591
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,760
because that

592
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:24,755
thing, those are fun and then for kind of embedding and recompiling.

593
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:27,805
Oh, yeah, I remember when I started at red hat that XML hashed off stuff.

594
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:30,395
And so I was looking for who includes like XML.

595
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:33,625
It's like everybody, they all embed it and I'm like, what the heck.

596
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,805
So it works on Windows. I'm like, oh

597
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:37,935
yeah, that makes sense. Same thing for Gzip,

598
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:38,314
Gzip.

599
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:43,474
There are so many wacky copies of zip and G zip included in so many things because,

600
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:46,875
-- well, how else are we going to get it to work on Windows? Yep.
-- Exactly.

601
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,915
I have a great, I have a great example actually. So

602
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,619
node Js

603
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:57,560
includes their own copy of open SSL when you get the binary from them.

604
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,439
And if you're doing any sort of node development, there's this,

605
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,589
this script called NVM, node version manager

606
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,479
that everyone uses because if you don't like it's a nightmare.

607
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,079
And basically so think of it this way though.

608
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:13,660
So open SSL updates, node Js then has to update Node Js and release a new version.

609
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,619
Then like the containers you're using,

610
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,270
you have to update the version of node Js and no and oh and by the way,

611
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,979
there's a bunch of other dependencies that you can update as long as you're here.

612
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,780
You know what I mean? And it gets out of hand really fast.

613
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,885
-- Well,
-- it's like why I love and I hate home on

614
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:29,385
my Mac because every time I run home brew to insult something, it's like, oh,

615
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,324
you got to run an update.

616
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,645
And I'm like, ah, I just need this to work now.

617
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:36,175
-- So,
-- actually, Python and Home Brew is why I quit running a Mac.

618
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:37,755
I ran one for a couple of years

619
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:41,864
and, like, every time you run Brew update, Python is busted and I was like,

620
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,505
you know what this is?

621
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:46,535
I, I'm done, I can't do this anymore because I use Python too much. Just I'm gonna get,

622
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:49,685
I'm gonna get a Linux machine and it's been perfect ever since.

623
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,910
Famous last words, I'm sure it will break later today. Now.

624
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,469
-- I
-- mean,

625
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,459
at least people are starting to use build systems in

626
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,910
C I CD pipelines so that if something is broken,

627
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,760
we have a place to fix it and not, oh, you know, teach Bob to do it properly.

628
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,000
No, no,

629
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:07,209
-- just change the config get better software
-- unless your C I system is back doored.

630
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:07,770
Yeah.

631
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,569
Well, but at least, I mean, if your C I system is back doored, you can

632
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:15,050
get an un back doored one from the vendor at some point.

633
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,645
-- Theoretically,
-- unless the script you're running is downloaded the back door.

634
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:20,084
I mean,

635
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:20,864
like,

636
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,385
again, again,

637
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:25,925
this is how I'm going to wrap this all up is there's all these considerations,

638
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:29,084
there's all these dependencies and I'm not saying you should

639
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:31,405
be like f it and throw caution to the wind.

640
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:33,594
I do think there's a certain amount of due diligence.

641
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:36,285
All of us are responsible for doing, of just saying

642
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,324
at least know what you have, right?

643
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,545
-- Know if someone says, yeah, but
-- that

644
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:41,724
-- is
-- a lot harder than you

645
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,125
think it is. I agree.

646
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:43,974
And that's,

647
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,194
that's a, that's an elephant, right? You don't eat it in one bite.

648
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,489
But the point is

649
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,699
the most important aspect of all this.

650
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:54,069
And the lesson we should all have here is that rather than

651
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,000
obsessing over our third party stuff, it is vastly more important.

652
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,160
We know what we're shipping and we can move

653
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,819
quickly because when it is time to move quickly,

654
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,209
it is imperative, you can do it like 90 days is not going to cut it.

655
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,599
-- And
-- that speaks to automation,

656
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,239
automation is fast

657
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,892
reproducible and you can fix it

658
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:15,052
and humans are bad at this stuff.

659
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:17,853
-- So don't, don't let them
-- humans are unreliable, right?

660
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:21,892
Like that, that installer script I wrote for Hyper Ledger fabric. I mean, it is,

661
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:25,262
there's actually quite a few steps and if they happen out of order it breaks

662
00:29:25,512 --> 00:29:28,532
and there's quite a bit of subtlety going on to make it all work.

663
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:30,072
And there's no way as a human being,

664
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,253
I can remember to do all those steps consistently every time.

665
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:33,142
So I scripted it with

666
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:37,345
also has the benefit of now anybody with Ubuntu 20.04 can just

667
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:39,326
