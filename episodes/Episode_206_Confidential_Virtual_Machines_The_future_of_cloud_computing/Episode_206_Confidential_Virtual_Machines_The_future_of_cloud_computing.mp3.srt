Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,359
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,149
So I just got a new monitor and it is one of those ridiculously wide ones

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,709
and I am loving it

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,049
curved or flat. It's a little curved.

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,010
It's 32 inches wide, which is, I don't know what that is in metric, but it is,

6
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:26,840
it's two

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,340
inches

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,219
and

9
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,229
that's how we measure monitors here because all of the monitors.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,799
Yeah. Well, because like the US market is 10 times bigger than Canada.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,639
So when you list a monitor size,

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,759
like if I go to Costco dot C A and I look for stuff,

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,400
how big do you think the screen sizes are while they're listed in inches?

14
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,439
I don't know. Ok. Well, anyway, all the Canadian sites do that 32 inches wide.

15
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:54,384
Well, it's a 34 inch monitor, but it is 32 inches wide.

16
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:56,625
Is the like physical dimension of it.

17
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,845
Is that the diagonal or the actual width, width,

18
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:01,444
the width width is 32

19
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:02,974
and there's a slight curve.

20
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:05,934
So if, if I put the, if I measured along the curve,

21
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:08,535
I'm sure it's like 32.5 or something like that, but

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,330
it is 32 inches wide.

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,910
And I love it.

24
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:17,349
I didn't know if I would enjoy it or not, but my old monitor was acting up and I,

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,900
I told work, I'm like, I need a monitor, help me out and they said,

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,470
just pick out one you like and I was gonna get two and I saw this and thought,

27
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,470
let's do it right?

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,550
Why not? And

29
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,669
I love it.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,949
I've honestly also gone to the one big high, high quality at least four K monitor,

31
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,269
right?

32
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:35,010
Like I have two desktops, each one is a four K monitor.

33
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:36,459
I can't go back to anything less.

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,949
And I kind of do wish I had the curve now because

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,839
from what I've seen especially well for stuff on the edge,

36
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,029
it, it does matter

37
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:43,459
a

38
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,410
little bit. I, I agree with that. It's less eye strained looking to the side.

39
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,099
But the, the most surprising thing I think is

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,110
I just like having the wi because I can basically have two

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,949
or three windows literally next to each other at all times.

42
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,069
And nothing's overlapping.

43
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,379
And my favorite part though.

44
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,349
So I've had two screens before obviously where you've got a seam down the middle.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,020
I love having nothing in the middle because I can put a window

46
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:13,190
in the middle of the screen and then have like other

47
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,990
weird things off to the sides and it is absolutely lovely.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,910
Well, see, and this is my hope is apparently,

49
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,869
uh Apple is working on augmented reality

50
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,199
and they get

51
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,000
that resolution matters.

52
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,330
And that's one of the reasons I hate to say it,

53
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:29,440
but I love Apple products is their screens, the quality on the ipads, the iphone.

54
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,039
They do have nice screens

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,570
like the resolution, the DP I and all that,

56
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,389
the colors and apparently the A R glasses they're

57
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,610
working on are very high res because apparently that's,

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,610
you know, that's become a thing now with all the other guys, uh, what is it?

59
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:44,440
I can't remember the names.

60
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:45,970
Offhand starts with A Q their,

61
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,169
their resolution isn't great and they've just sort of given up on it, you know,

62
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,440
in favor of other things.

63
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:50,809
And,

64
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:54,110
well, I'll be blunt, like the world itself is a very high res

65
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,089
place,

66
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,169
right? No, it is. And

67
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:58,610
it

68
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,020
is.

69
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,830
You know, I,

70
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:03,839
I'm thinking that's probably one of the things because I've used VR before

71
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,089
and honestly didn't much care for it unless it was like cartoony.

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,910
In which case, low

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,119
res works. But with augmented reality.

74
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,960
Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure cartoon shapes,

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,880
overlaid reality is going to work very well.

76
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,654
I don't know, man, I feel like

77
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:19,335
I don't think the technology is ready yet for humans,

78
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:23,244
but we'll see apparently Apple is about two years out from releasing something.

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,054
I am going to be very hesitant to get on that train.

80
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:31,695
Oh, Yeah, I bet it won't be awesome. But I bet it will be better than

81
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,309
what we have. Well, better be better than what we have.

82
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,149
I would trust Apple to not screw it up as bad as many of the others.

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,470
Like Google classes.

84
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,910
I think those still exist, don't they? I feel like they do.

85
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,889
I think they technically exist in the same way that you can buy, like,

86
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,490
pet rocks.

87
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,100
Like, yeah, you can probably go buy one somewhere.

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,330
I think they're still actually producing them.

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,179
And you can,

90
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,080
I believe I read that somewhere anyway. Anyway, that's not the,

91
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,979
we could rathole on this for hours.

92
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,839
I don't want to,

93
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,789
we're going to talk about encrypted V MS today because that's far more interesting,

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,369
I think.

95
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,845
And you're wrong you, if you're a company, you can get Google Glasses Enterprise.

96
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,075
But that, that's the thing. I'm a company, I

97
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:19,733
guess. Well, if you're going to buy 1000 of them. Sure. Do you have to buy 1000?

98
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,165
I don't know.

99
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:21,983
Do you think Google's gonna sell you one?

100
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:22,804
Maybe?

101
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:23,894
I don't know. Anyway.

102
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:25,285
But, yeah, no.

103
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:28,355
Encrypted V MS are definitely because, you know, coming from the cloud space,

104
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:29,035
here's the thing, right?

105
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:29,845
Everybody wants

106
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:34,200
to not have to run hardware anymore because hardware is a complete pain in the ass.

107
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,579
But at the same time, everybody wants magically, you know,

108
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,570
those security guarantees of like,

109
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,049
especially in a multi-tenant situation that the other tenants can't

110
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,660
touch you inappropriately or even in a single tenant,

111
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,089
you know, where you rent out the whole hardware for like, whatever,

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,429
10 bucks an hour extra

113
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,959
that, you know, you're,

114
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,589
you're safe even from like some shenanigans running in the data center.

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,850
Well, I don't think anyone pretends there's any safety in

116
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,529
this space today. We've all basically Jedi hand waved it away and said good enough.

117
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,880
Well, there is and there isn't in the sense of, I mean, I honestly,

118
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,140
I do trust Amazon and Google to not be,

119
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,329
you know,

120
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:13,549
making copies of the hard drives and showing the data on some random website,

121
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,510
like,

122
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,260
you know, just as I trust my bank, I gave them my money and I damn well,

123
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,089
better get it back.

124
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,570
Well, and I mean, this is the point of having

125
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,809
a contractual relationship is if they do something that damages you,

126
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,489
you have legal recourse to go after them.

127
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,130
But ideally,

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,970
I'd like to avoid that and just have the system secure in the first place.

129
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,049
Right. Oh, I agree.

130
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,589
I agree completely. It, it's kind of that whole defense in depth. So here's,

131
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:40,369
here's the reason we're talking about this is, is literally this morning,

132
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,149
we've completely changed all of our, our plans for the, the episode,

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,350
but like literally this morning,

134
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,609
we found a new story that said Google in their cloud

135
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:53,910
has an encrypted VM and they're using a technology called SEV

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,920
from A MD to be I think even more clear, it's not just an encryption VM,

137
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,970
but they call it confidential VMS because the reality is too,

138
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,829
is it's more than just encrypting the VM.

139
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,309
It's actually because what we want is

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,670
we want multi tenant situations where the tenants

141
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,869
hate each other and like, want to hack each other and can't.

142
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,910
Right. And so let's, let's, let's lay this all out and then we'll go from there.

143
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,119
So they're using a technology AMD created called SUV,

144
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,850
which is secure encrypted virtualization.

145
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,970
The idea behind this is

146
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,350
imagine you've got your current architecture of a

147
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,970
computer where you kind of have memory,

148
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,070
you have disk, you have ac pu in the middle, you have IO right?

149
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,290
And it just kind of all this data flows around and

150
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:37,890
in the event you have virtualization,

151
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,269
you kind of carve some of this up into little pieces.

152
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,420
But for example, the the non guest machine like like the host machine, right,

153
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,929
the underlying hardware, right?

154
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,535
Like the underlying machine,

155
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,434
it has the ability to say,

156
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:54,515
inspect all the memory or inspect the disk or look at the traffic

157
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,704
as it's coming in and out of the network or things like that,

158
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:57,015
right?

159
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:58,375
That's totally expected.

160
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:03,785
And so this is kind of where if you're in a virtualized machine, in theory,

161
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:07,065
you can't cross the boundary and look at what someone else is doing there, of course,

162
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,015
been some security issues involving this problem.

163
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:10,674
But some,

164
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,769
I mean, the the classic example here is of like the console makers, right?

165
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,399
Because the console makers tried to do a lot of this stuff ages ago

166
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,649
so that people couldn't, you know,

167
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,970
hack their consoles to play unlocked games or whatever, to a degree.

168
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,970
It's similar to that, but not exactly the same.

169
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,730
Well, they would be the starting steps of this kind of whole

170
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,269
mess.

171
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,369
What a MD has done is they've created this technology where imagine

172
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:38,410
your, your virtualized machine

173
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,459
has basically like encryption built into it. So the memory is encrypted.

174
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,410
And as the memory streams into the processor,

175
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,670
it becomes magically decrypted and then the processor does its work.

176
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,010
And then as soon as anything leaves the processor,

177
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,369
it becomes encrypted again as it's traversing the other pieces of hardware

178
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,209
you might have in the system.

179
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,869
And the idea is if you have low level access to hardware like the in the processor,

180
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,470
which in theory, I, I haven't read up on this technology in a while.

181
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,089
But when it came out, if you could say

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,029
get into the CPU,

183
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,190
you could inspect registers and things like that and see what was happening.

184
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,500
But that's obviously

185
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,480
a very sophisticated attack to be blunt, like if you're at the point where you know,

186
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,700
you've inserted custom microcode and hacked the CPU.

187
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,859
Yeah, you're, you're like state level.

188
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:31,700
And so the idea is, let's say I break into the host,

189
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,409
I can't read the memory because I can't access the

190
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,558
key that decrypt the memory and the memory is encrypted.

191
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,210
So where do the keys live? Like in a piece of security hardware?

192
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,099
Yeah, they have a, it's a secondary process

193
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:48,325
but you obviously have to get them in them in their security.

194
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:48,815
There's,

195
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:53,614
and there's some management interfaces and you have the ability for example,

196
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:58,275
to just say generate a random key and obviously you can never migrate

197
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:02,804
that machine somewhere else if it has a random key on the host,

198
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,734
yeah, you could, you could just copy the memory over like the old.

199
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,594
No, no, you can't because the key is trapped

200
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:09,424
in

201
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,434
a special secure processor

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,080
well,

203
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,200
but like you can still read the memory and interact

204
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,469
with it if you are running on that system,

205
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:16,630
right?

206
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,359
So you could choose on the system. Yeah.

207
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,500
So you could choose to then copy it out and move

208
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,549
it to another one like that old red hat product did

209
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,239
remember how it copied out blocks of memory. You can't do that

210
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:29,549
it. Well, no, no, let's just say no. OK.

211
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,900
So, so basically this, this changes the security equation from

212
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,309
the attacker always has access to your data to the attacker

213
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,500
would have to get at the key when it was loaded.

214
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,010
And if he misses that opportunity,

215
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,090
well, too bad.

216
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,369
And you,

217
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:46,000
and, and

218
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:46,869
in theory,

219
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,479
yes, exactly. But in theory, if you do this right, the key cannot be stolen. It is

220
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,330
impossible. Which is of course never true.

221
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,619
But the idea is so you have two virtual machines running

222
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,390
and even if say someone breaks from one virtual machine into another,

223
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,669
they cannot look at any of the data of what's going on.

224
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,590
Let's say you have a malicious cloud provider.

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,940
They are unable to even understand what your VM is doing.

226
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,710
They can look at how much CPU it's using, they can look at how much memory it's using,

227
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,603
but they literally have no idea what it is happening inside of that machine.

228
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,562
They cannot see it. Funny thing.

229
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:29,562
I spoke with an Amazon person and he basically said many years ago,

230
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:32,182
we honestly don't care or need to because just based on

231
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:36,343
very general traffic patterns of network CPU and ram usage,

232
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:41,442
we can basically tell legit from malicious workloads pretty darn reliably.

233
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:44,002
I believe that I think there's a lot of power

234
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,776
metadata and we often discount it in this particular

235
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:50,236
instance and not that even let's face it.

236
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:53,335
Amazon has so much stuff going on in their network.

237
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,185
I love that you do a port scan and you get

238
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,666
a nasty email from them like 30 seconds later saying,

239
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:58,916
why did you do a port scan?

240
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:00,806
Right? If you do it again? Yeah.

241
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:03,935
And I'm like, well, never doing a port scan for my corporate account again.

242
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:04,835
That's right. That's

243
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:05,616
that lesson.

244
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:06,710
Yep. Yep.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,960
So, so anyway, the idea here is that

246
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,130
you have the ability to deploy these machines

247
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,849
that even your cloud provider can't pry the

248
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:21,270
lid off of and look inside of and I can understand a certain appeal to this.

249
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,719
And I think it is

250
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:25,390
probably the future of all cloud computing.

251
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:25,859
Yeah.

252
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,830
Well, I mean, that's where it's been moving, right.

253
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,989
Like, look at Amazon and Google and Microsoft.

254
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,650
So they have this storing data in their data centers, right?

255
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:39,590
And they obviously encrypt the discs themselves

256
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,349
and they also have, you know, very tight tracking of these discs. And if a disk is,

257
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,989
you know, damaged or whatever and

258
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,630
they, they destroy it,

259
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,669
they don't like ship a slightly broken disk back to Seagate or whatever and be like,

260
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,080
you know, can you swap the board on it and send it back, please?

261
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,890
Like, and, and you can even buy this, like, uh I know,

262
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,630
I remember back when Dell started offering this for servers where you pay a couple

263
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,020
extra 100 bucks

264
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,349
and basically the way disc arms worked is you said I want a new dis,

265
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,539
they sent you a new disk

266
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,669
and then you just destroyed the one you had, right?

267
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,570
So the one you had never left your control.

268
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,169
And so despite all that,

269
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,530
they still offer me disc encryption of my like application levels, right?

270
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,429
Because they know that I don't necessarily fully 100% trust them not to lose. Like,

271
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:19,789
I

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,460
don't know,

273
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,140
like a shipment of drives that were supposed

274
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,090
to be destroyed at the DC and accidentally

275
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,270
didn't get destroyed river. You know, even though, like, realistically

276
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:30,400
they're probably going to be a lot more on the ball about that than I ever will be.

277
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:34,979
Uh, probably, but it's also, again, it's defense in depth because

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,280
it would not shock me if truckloads of drives that were supposed

279
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,570
to get destroyed ended up on a secondary market somewhere once,

280
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,940
at least once.

281
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:45,650
So, yeah, I mean,

282
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,690
and that's what I love about this is we're already at the point where, you know,

283
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,349
most everybody has accepted cloud computing and made the, you know,

284
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,169
been willing to make the risk trade off of.

285
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:54,890
Yeah, I mean,

286
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,250
Amazon or Microsoft could go super evil and do something bad to you probably won't.

287
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,380
And well, now technically speaking, like Google, I don't want to say can't,

288
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,369
but it would be much, much, much harder, you know,

289
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,770
by several orders of magnitude of work.

290
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,130
Right. Right.

291
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,140
And that's great.

292
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,849
Like

293
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,900
that's, that's what we want to see in this industry is for

294
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,530
movement.

295
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,450
No, I absolutely. And, and this is, this is cool.

296
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,840
So the other thing I want to kind of maybe explain to try to set some of this.

297
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,549
So here's a question I have. So what is the difference between this and Intel's SGX?

298
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,030
Right? Because you got in

299
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:27,679
uh

300
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,320
no, I can't remember what SGX stands for Security

301
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,000
Guard

302
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,989
extension or something.

303
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,950
Yeah. Secure. Sure, why not? I don't remember.

304
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,609
So the,

305
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,229
the difference is actually quite large in reality.

306
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:44,859
So the idea being SGX is an enclave and the idea

307
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:48,940
is I want to kind of set aside a small piece,

308
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,849
a small place in my CPU

309
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,789
to run

310
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,369
trusted code

311
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,340
where

312
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,250
things are gonna happen inside of this enclave.

313
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,500
And absolutely nobody can peek inside of it.

314
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,210
And let's say you're going to do encryption in there, right?

315
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,719
You could potentially say load an encryption key,

316
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,419
do your encryption work and then take the results back and there's no way

317
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,900
anyone could unders like take the key out of the enclave. That's the intent, right?

318
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:19,020
You can imagine the the idea like this is a cool idea. It was actually we were talking

319
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,713
before we hit record and Kurt said, oh,

320
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:26,432
it's like T PM 2.00 I just found a slide deck that is

321
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,713
there's I knew SGX was basically T PM 2.0.

322
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:32,163
But I didn't realize like, but there is T PM 2.0

323
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:32,603
But,

324
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,812
but I mean, this is I didn't realize, for example,

325
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:38,732
Intel SGX only addresses up to 120 megabytes of memory.

326
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:39,093
Whereas

327
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:39,242
A

328
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,632
DSEV is like,

329
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:41,062
well,

330
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,893
they're not comparable is people, people like to compare these technologies,

331
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,986
they are not comparable in any way.

332
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:53,575
And the reason being SGX is meant to be I would say closer to TPM. Whereas SUV

333
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:59,085
is basically a new computing paradigm where the idea is you have your processor,

334
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:01,245
you have everything else happening outside the processor

335
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:03,515
and everything is happening in an encrypted manner.

336
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,015
Well, and here's my trick question,

337
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,935
what changes do I have to make to my application to make use of

338
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:08,245
AMD

339
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:12,755
CEV? And the answer as we both know is zero. Whereas Intel SGX,

340
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:16,799
you have to specifically call into SGX.

341
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,849
So, and that right there, I'm sorry.

342
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:19,440
But

343
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:24,270
if you have a, I don't care how awesome your security thing is.

344
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:27,090
If I have to rewrite my software versus

345
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,710
I don't, well,

346
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,520
like one of those is gonna get used a bit more

347
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,049
than the one that is going to require a rewrite.

348
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,049
Yeah.

349
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,280
Yeah. And, and that's what really drives me nuts about.

350
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:39,619
Some of these security technologies is like, it's like so cool, but it's like, oh,

351
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,059
but I have to like basically spend 6 to 12 months reengineering a big chunk of my app.

352
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:45,750
That's just not gonna happen.

353
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:46,900
Absolutely not.

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,750
Or at least not widely. Can you imagine trying to sell your boss on that?

355
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:49,869
Like,

356
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,659
let's just stall development out for half a year

357
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,859
versus this other technology where we just use it?

358
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,570
No, no. Well, again,

359
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,176
comparable though, right? They're just,

360
00:15:57,385 --> 00:16:02,536
they're different use cases and I'm not going to say SGX doesn't have value.

361
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:06,495
It's just in this particular conversation. SGX is not a solution,

362
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,736
it has very limited value,

363
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,656
it has none in this context.

364
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:15,895
This is, this is like saying that I have to choose a screwdriver or a hammer.

365
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,021
It's like, well, what am I doing? You know,

366
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:21,211
am I hammering a nail because then I want the hammer,

367
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,952
am I screwing a screw into something that I want the screwdriver?

368
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,021
Well, but as I understand it,

369
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,221
you essentially everything you want to do with Intel SGX,

370
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,411
you kind of get by default in the,

371
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,271
in the AM DS EV.

372
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:36,331
Well, it's, it's not, no, no, no, that's not the right way to think of it.

373
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,052
So

374
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,611
you think of it like you're saying,

375
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,849
comparing SEV to T PM,

376
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,619
right? It

377
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,820
it's not the same.

378
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,710
So the idea behind sev is you have the ability to run discrete virtual machines in

379
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:51,369
a system and each of those virtual machines

380
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,030
are functionally separated by a layer of encryption

381
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,950
and you can't break through the layer because obviously it has a key.

382
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,869
So let's say, for example, I'm a malicious VM

383
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,189
and I find a way to read arbitrary memory off the computer, right?

384
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,760
I can read memory but I don't have the key. So I'm reading

385
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,098
Gobbledygook,

386
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,630
right? And without the key, I can't decrypt that memory into anything usable.

387
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:21,000
Now SGX is more of a, let's think of this as

388
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,348
I want to run

389
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,529
something

390
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,578
in the CPU in a secure manner, right?

391
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:32,218
Let's say I need to generate, let me think about this. Yeah, let's say I want to

392
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,009
decrypt some data

393
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:34,869
in,

394
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:37,578
in a manner that is similar to an HSM, right?

395
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,808
A hardware security module Well, see, and that's, that's my, my,

396
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:44,718
my understanding of T PM and Intel's SGX was essentially,

397
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:45,928
you, you get

398
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,369
very limited,

399
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,260
usually cryptographic related functionality. That's the idea.

400
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,910
And part of the problem, like, I didn't realize it was limited to 128 megs of memory.

401
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,219
I knew it was very computationally limited.

402
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,270
It is, but it's also very memory limited. So it's just, it's all related.

403
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,900
I mean, I don't know if, if there's a technical reason

404
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,900
they don't let you access like all the memory, for example, but I think the intent is,

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,420
it's meant to be very small,

406
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,599
single purpose use and they might have been worried that

407
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,699
people were going to do ridiculous things with it.

408
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,180
If you let them access, say all of the system memory, I,

409
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:20,729
I don't know exactly why that is.

410
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,859
But again,

411
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:26,010
they're completely different paradigms. One is a virtualization technology.

412
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,189
The other is just a secure enclave that

413
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,819
anything can access that's running on the CPU.

414
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,619
It has nothing to do with virtualization.

415
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,780
It doesn't necessarily make virtualization better or worse.

416
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,339
It's just, it's, it is what it is

417
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,530
and it's,

418
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,780
it's complicated and hard and weird and it's,

419
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,849
it's not the easiest thing in the world to understand.

420
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,819
But so now I will say

421
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:49,859
I need to do some more research on sev because I haven't,

422
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,430
I haven't looked at it in a while.

423
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:57,329
It's been a couple of years, but I will say that it is not a perfect technology. And

424
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:01,630
the, the last time I looked at it, the biggest problem it had was

425
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:06,050
it would basically imagine the, the, the magic decrypt

426
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,349
sits as a, like a ring outside the CPU. So you take say

427
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:10,520
like

428
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,760
ring,

429
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:11,569
negative one.

430
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,170
No, no, I mean, I don't mean that kind of ring. I mean,

431
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:18,310
imagine like a wall, right? Like a special wall with a gate.

432
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,449
And the,

433
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,189
the data is going to come from the memory and it's going to

434
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:26,410
pass through this this decryption wall and then it goes into the CPU.

435
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,489
And so what could happen though is if a, if an attacker has the ability to

436
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,890
like view uh For example, you could,

437
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,640
you could turn on like a debug mode in the CPU where you'd step through instructions

438
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,589
and you could just step through every instruction

439
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,229
and look at what the instructions are doing,

440
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:42,859
for example,

441
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:46,030
and then do things like reconstruct memory as it's being read and written.

442
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,300
So stupid question. So the contents of memory are encrypted. What about like the,

443
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,869
the CPU registers?

444
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,270
So the last time I looked at it,

445
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,630
that was not where basically this data came from the memory,

446
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,859
it was decrypted and then it landed in the caches,

447
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,589
for example, in the CPU, it was not encrypted.

448
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:03,020
And that obviously you can see right away with some

449
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,130
of the the various cash attacks against the CPU uh

450
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:08,449
in sev dash

451
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,660
es the VM register state is encrypted on each hypervisor transition so that

452
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,010
the hypervisor cannot see the data actively being used by the VM.

453
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,979
It's like A and D thought about this.

454
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,550
I'm just, I'm kind of blown away that they can encrypt the CPU registers in a way

455
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:23,540
that is

456
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,880
because like, what's the access time on those things now? Like a nanosecond?

457
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,709
No, it doesn't surprise me at all though.

458
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,449
I mean, well,

459
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,060
the fact that they can decrypt and encrypt the

460
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,869
data fast enough that it's not a performance hit.

461
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,979
That's pretty cool. It doesn't totally surprise me. It's probably there.

462
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,310
I'm sure they built their algorithm,

463
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,719
you know, in silicone with transistors literally in line, but even a, even a, like

464
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,329
a extra billionth of a second there adds up.

465
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,589
Yeah, I mean, you're not, I won't disagree with you. You're definitely not wrong.

466
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,420
But that's, this is, this is amazing.

467
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,930
They've also sorry, they've also got this thing called SEV dash SNP,

468
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:01,810
which is essentially there's they list sevseves and SEV SNP,

469
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,030
which is like the next next one.

470
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,119
And the list of capabilities on this SEV SNP is there's stuff

471
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,579
in here where if you told me this 10 years ago,

472
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,050
I'd be like, that's impossible to fix in ac pu because that's how CP US work.

473
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,119
No, like, really? Right. Like, well, that's what makes this so cool.

474
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,000
Like the fact, like, like encrypting your CPU registers 10 years ago,

475
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,459
I would have been like, you just can't do that.

476
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:25,719
It will kill performance. Well, in the first version of this couldn't do it.

477
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:26,439
And that's why.

478
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,520
But of course, everyone who looked at it,

479
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,910
that's the first thing they said was you have

480
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
to encrypt the registers because if you don't,

481
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,349
this has much less value.

482
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:36,030
This is why, like I just, I know CP because honestly, I

483
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:39,564
really paid attention to CPU and computational improvements in the last decade

484
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:41,785
because computers are just fast nowadays.

485
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:46,275
There hasn't been a lot of exciting work going on. But this, this is exciting.

486
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:48,454
Like I remember the Gigahertz Wars

487
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,385
and man, that was a great time to be alive.

488
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:52,854
Like literally going from like one gigahertz two gigahertz

489
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:56,395
or like, well, I remember going from a 4060 X 266

490
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:57,564
to a P 100.

491
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,290
I got,

492
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,119
I went from a 3 86 25 to a Pentium 166.

493
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,189
That's like going from a skateboard to a,

494
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,260
to like a formula one, a rocket ship.

495
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,520
It was like a rocket ship. It was,

496
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,250
it was an unexplainable difference

497
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,420
in the computing experience. And it was lovely.

498
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,280
Well, and I guess that's kind of where we're getting here is, I mean, things like,

499
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,359
yeah, OK, your, your CPU registers are encrypted.

500
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,099
You're, and they have this huge list of just like I said, crazy stuff that I,

501
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,939
I didn't think you could actually do.

502
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,979
Like in the sense of you can do it but it

503
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:36,599
will kill performance so bad that you can't do it.

504
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,979
Well, I mean, look, so this is,

505
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,449
this is what's going to happen now with CP US is

506
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,579
we can't make them any faster because we just like physics,

507
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:46,060
right?

508
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,859
And

509
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,349
we can

510
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,260
work out

511
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,219
and, and, well, the thing is by increasing core count, then you have to have this

512
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,290
because, you know, once you have, well,

513
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,869
I'm not even speaking theoretically anymore.

514
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,060
Once you have ac pu with like 64 or 100 and 28 cores, well,

515
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:02,810
you can't just run a workload on it.

516
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:03,119
Right.

517
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,689
You're generally going to have more than one workload running on it and

518
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:09,650
those workloads probably aren't at the exact same security level or same tenant.

519
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,400
So now you have to start, you know, having strong borders and VM controls. Right.

520
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,800
Right.

521
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,439
And

522
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:21,469
the, I would argue that the bigger advantage even for their cloud providers

523
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:22,349
is

524
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,920
now they are very hands off with respect to what's happening in these V MS.

525
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,050
Or you think today,

526
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:30,900
if I go and I'm doing something illegal,

527
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,729
someone can make the argument to Amazon.

528
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,949
Well, you, you knew what they were doing, why didn't you stop it or rather they,

529
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,969
they could look, you know, like all those FBI subpoenas to Apple and Apple is like,

530
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:40,069
yeah.

531
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,670
Nope, we made the technology so we can't do that.

532
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,089
Yeah.

533
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:43,989
Right. Right.

534
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,989
Exactly.

535
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,209
And in this case, obviously

536
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,170
with,

537
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,010
with I mean, let's pick on,

538
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,619
on Google here because they're obviously the ones deploying this,

539
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,319
this gives them that deniability.

540
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:57,150
You know, if you're running in their environment,

541
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,760
they can't possibly look at what you're doing or do anything about it.

542
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,930
It's like everyone wins here. Right.

543
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:06,425
It's like the whole safe deposit box at the bank thing. They don't know what's in it.

544
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:07,704
They don't want to know what's in it.

545
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,545
You've got your key, you go in the room, you mess with it.

546
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:14,645
Like don't just don't ask, don't tell, I don't want to know, you don't want to tell me.

547
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:18,505
No, this is uh we're gonna maybe, I don't know, there's a PDF here and

548
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:20,699
they have a list of stuff that they don't

549
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,280
yet support anywhere but like some of this stuff is

550
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,859
like page level side channels, example, attack, track VM,

551
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,859
access patterns through page tables like they haven't fixed it yet,

552
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,439
but it's on essentially, this looks like their to do list.

553
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:35,540
And that's really cool. I mean, this is, and look, let's

554
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,520
it. So here's, here's one of the things to always think about, right?

555
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,369
You've got Intel and AMD are the dominant CPU makers today.

556
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,949
Arms coming up pretty fast. I'm getting it

557
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,209
right arm is coming up. And what is the advantage Intel and AMD have over arm today?

558
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,530
For example, I can use it to heat my house,

559
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,859
but you get the idea right?

560
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,280
Is,

561
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:00,699
is this is the kind of work that someone like a MD and

562
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:05,209
Intel need to start doing because just having AC pu isn't enough,

563
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,819
just having cores isn't enough.

564
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:09,170
Just having fast virtualization isn't enough.

565
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:10,869
And so this is actually really exciting.

566
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,819
And in a lot of ways,

567
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:15,469
I think this is going to be more exciting for the future of processors

568
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,260
than what we saw in the past where it was just about speed

569
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:19,800
this

570
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,714
to that true utility grid

571
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,214
mode of computing

572
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:28,064
where I can just throw workloads out to some,

573
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:32,494
I may not even ultimate like essentially the model that a lot of people want is I,

574
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,645
I have a workload

575
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:36,415
and I go to a market for, you know,

576
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:38,484
compute time and power and I don't even

577
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:40,255
actually maybe know where my thing is running.

578
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,854
It's just I, I have a broker who offers me the best rate

579
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,734
and I get my workload run through them

580
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:46,650
and knowing that they can't monkey with it

581
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,930
and the ultimate provider which could be like,

582
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,930
Lord knows where can't monkey with it.

583
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,920
That's the dream

584
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,479
because it just makes security so much simpler.

585
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,900
And well, I mean, that's what we've done with the electric grid, right?

586
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,010
Like I get my electrons don't care where they came from.

587
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,849
Like uh my understanding is, you know,

588
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,329
Alberta has what we have a lot of power generation,

589
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:07,579
but we also import power from other places sometimes and export it.

590
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:07,760
And

591
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,630
like, I don't care if my electrons are from BC or the US.

592
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,109
Right. Right. I, I have a friend who

593
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,260
worked for a company that was an electricity broker and he explained this to me

594
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,699
once and I'm sure I'm going to oversimplify and get some of this wrong.

595
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:21,069
But I mean,

596
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,069
functionally it was a matter of people would have power

597
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,609
and they would say I'm going to sell this power for

598
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,189
this price and everyone just kind of laid down their price.

599
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,209
And for example,

600
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,770
a nuclear power plant is generating electricity

601
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,060
no matter what it doesn't, you know.

602
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,699
So they're just going to say I'm generating electricity,

603
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,930
here's the price I'll take and their price is

604
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:44,500
always the lowest just because it's like they're,

605
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,819
they're making it and they can't stop.

606
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,250
Whereas there's other places where, for example,

607
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,859
like a wind farm could look and say, all right, so the price looks like it's,

608
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,915
I can't make money doing that, uh turn them off, you know,

609
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,915
and then you just don't do anything and that's OK sometimes.

610
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:02,084
But I mean, obviously in the case of most renewables, it's very much.

611
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:04,114
Uh well, this is basically free. So.

612
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:04,474
Well,

613
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:08,785
the difference being with compute is if I have all this compute infrastructure,

614
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:11,694
essentially my marginal costs,

615
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:12,885
I'm not going to say are zero,

616
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,614
but they're damn close to zero in the form of electricity and operations.

617
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,275
And I have to do operations like you can't just have

618
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:20,114
everybody take off for the day and not pay them,

619
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,969
uh, electricity.

620
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:22,229
You know,

621
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:26,520
I can't just actually turn everything off to a cold state and save a few bucks.

622
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:30,589
So, the problem is I have all this stuff that if it's sitting there not making money,

623
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,290
it's, I'm actively losing money because also, like, last I checked,

624
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,209
computers don't hold a lot of value past three years.

625
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,150
Three years, probably three months now. Well, yeah. Well, in data centers. Yeah.

626
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,750
I mean, that's my understanding of like a lot of S sds and stuff because they,

627
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,020
they ro I and what not, especially on energy expenditures measured in months.

628
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:48,969
But I mean, that's

629
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:49,635
exactly it. Right.

630
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:51,415
So your electricity thing,

631
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:54,145
there's also I learned the other day actually that there are

632
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:58,375
companies that agree to buy a certain amount of electricity,

633
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,655
whether or not they need it.

634
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,295
Thus they get a better price.

635
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,454
So it's like the inverse of the nuclear power plant generating it all the time.

636
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:08,255
They say we will guaranteed consume X.

637
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:11,015
And the challenge though is they actually have to physically

638
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,694
consume X ray because otherwise the grid would get unbalanced.

639
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:17,314
I bet for factories. That's probably not hard crypto coin mining.

640
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:22,270
Right? That's, that's part of how these guys get their cheap electricity

641
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,359
is. They, they basically say like, well, I got a bunch of, you know, mining rigs.

642
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:31,670
Yeah, they have to stay turned on or I'm literally like, literally losing money.

643
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:32,589
Right. Right.

644
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:36,310
And so they agreed to buy x amount of electricity, you know, for cheap and,

645
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,250
and do it no matter what,

646
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,109
which is one of the reasons apparently why they have such a hard time doing upgrades.

647
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,109
Right, because they can't shut down properly. Right. Interesting.

648
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:47,069
So, here's, I have one other bit to add before we end this. And

649
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,300
that is.

650
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,540
So obviously I'm sure that one thing everyone's thinking about right now is

651
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,760
talking about this kind of utility computing and sending jobs out is,

652
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,739
oh, but who owns the keys?

653
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:58,189
Because obviously,

654
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,109
if you don't control the key and you're sending a job out it,

655
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,560
it doesn't matter because if the bad guys

656
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,180
own, if they have access to all the keys,

657
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,859
they can do whatever they want. But the good news is the window of opportunity is very

658
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,750
much shortened. You don't need a window of opportunity.

659
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,089
Part of this technology is their management interface

660
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:19,869
gives you the ability to bring your own keys into the environment,

661
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,989
which is

662
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,699
really, really wild. I mean, I,

663
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,829
of course, there's tons of asterisks and there's lots of complicated

664
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,420
things you need to worry about here.

665
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,939
But you know,

666
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:31,640
more of the point I'm looking at this and the amount of

667
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,150
progress they've made in the last four years is mind boggling it.

668
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,199
It, I have no doubt.

669
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,089
And I'm saying I should,

670
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,250
I should have looked more of this up before we started the show.

671
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,079
Unfortunately, ran out of time. But yes, it is

672
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:48,229
amazing. Technology encrypted CPU registers without a performance hit. Well,

673
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,050
performance hit. It's acceptable though. Yeah.

674
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,869
Right. Right.

675
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:56,420
I love it. It is so cool

676
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,339
and I'm so excited to see someone actually using this now for real.

677
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:00,489
Well,

678
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,439
not just using it but providing it to the rest of

679
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,260
us in a way where we can actually use it realistically.

680
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,619
You know, this isn't some, like hypothetical, well, you know,

681
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,660
if you rewrite your software to use these special extensions, it's just a VM.

682
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,790
Yeah, it's,

683
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,630
it's extremely cool and I can't wait to see

684
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,280
where this goes next because I think there is

685
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:22,500
a lot of potential for a lot of really cool technology. I mean, this is the dream.

686
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,349
Like I want to be able to chuck my workloads

687
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,969
and approve and I don't want to pay the extra,

688
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,979
what is it like $10 an hour for a, like for a, you know,

689
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:32,869
a dedicated computer host because $10 an hour adds up?

690
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,949
Uh Right. Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

691
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,689
But even even with dedicated compute hosts,

692
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:40,270
if you can't trust your cloud provider,

693
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:41,719
you have a problem.

694
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,640
It's awesome. I'm excited. I can't wait to see where it goes. All right, man.

695
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:46,390
I'm calling it.

696
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,770
