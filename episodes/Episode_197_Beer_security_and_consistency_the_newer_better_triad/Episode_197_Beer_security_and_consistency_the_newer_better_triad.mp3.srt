Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,310
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:12,720
Josh Pressers. How's it going? Good.

3
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,359
-- Today, we're going to have two of your favorite topics.
-- I,

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,360
I, ok, I know one of them is beer, which is a favorite of mine.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,260
-- I would agree, but I have no idea what the second one is.
-- Reproducible

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,639
builds.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:29,079
-- Hey, I love that topic, man. That's a great topic actually. But
-- here's a question.

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,979
What do beer and reproducible builds have in common?

9
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,000
-- I mean,
-- I could think of a number of things.

10
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,138
So I'd be more curious to know what you think they

11
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:38,577
have in common versus what I think they have in common.

12
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:41,647
-- So
-- for beer, obviously, there's different kinds of beer,

13
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:45,417
but I'm going to go with sort of generally mass produced beer.

14
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:48,847
I'm like, I'm not talking like one off cask. You know, we made this special thing.

15
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:52,518
I'm talking about like beer that generally, you know, they make a lot of it

16
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:53,647
repeatedly

17
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:55,937
and that's reproducible builds.

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,787
-- I
-- mean, functionally, yes, because this is true of nearly any, any product,

19
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:02,358
obviously, because a great example is

20
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:03,736
right.

21
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:04,254
I mean, this is,

22
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,615
this is kind of the power of mcdonald's will say where I know

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,755
I can walk into a mcdonald's in any country on the planet.

24
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:15,335
I go in and I, I know exactly what I'm going to get. If I order a Big Mac and fries,

25
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,596
you know what's really funny, I must say first though,

26
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:19,435
every time I visit a new country,

27
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:22,146
I literally go to mcdonald's and order a Big Mac and fries

28
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,555
with the secret hope it will not be exactly the same.

29
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,435
And they always are.

30
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,716
-- I've
-- also, yeah,

31
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:29,155
the one thing I will say that I love about mcdonald's

32
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,494
is they have these weird regional things in the Czech Republic.

33
00:01:32,503 --> 00:01:35,634
They had that pork, what was it called? The pork something burger?

34
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:38,734
And I mean, it was beyond delicious. It was amazing.

35
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:43,613
And in like India, they have like, what is it lamb burgers, which I would love to try,

36
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:45,494
but I'm not going to go to India to eat a hamburger.

37
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:47,454
I've heard their chicken is phenomenal also.

38
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:51,554
-- But I have never, I've never set foot in India. So I cannot
-- say back to beer.

39
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:55,924
So, and one of the things I love about beer too is that to put it bluntly in 1516.

40
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,874
So 504 years ago in Bavaria, they

41
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,293
passed the reinheitsgebot

42
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,031
which is the, the essentially the German beer purity regulation,

43
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,632
-- which
-- why don't you explain what that is?

44
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,711
Because there might be some people who don't know. And it's very cool actually.

45
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,582
-- So
-- basically,

46
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:16,511
it's a regulation that specifies what you're allowed to put in beer and also

47
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,261
how big it is and how much you're allowed to charge for it.

48
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,951
So the ingredients thing comes later.

49
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:21,412
But basically,

50
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,052
it says the only ingredients used for brewing of beer must be barley hops and water.

51
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,871
So, I mean, this is 500 plus years ago where they didn't know about yeast.

52
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,111
It was magic. Exactly.

53
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,330
It has been updated since then to include yeast and other things.

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,250
But what's interesting is they said from micro

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,460
mass to Georgy, the price of one mass.

56
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,169
So it's just over a liter or one cult fits a ball shaped container for fluids.

57
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,479
Not quite one mass. I think it's like 900 or something.

58
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,009
Milliliters is not to exceed one Fennig Munich value.

59
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,589
Which, and I mean, that's another throwback, right?

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,470
You've got to remember back 500 years ago, Germany wasn't a country, right?

61
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,050
It was a series of kingdoms that loosely hated and liked each other.

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,927
So, you know, when you talk about money, it's like which one?

63
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,988
And then they talk about pricing for the rest of the year and

64
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:06,087
part of that was to prevent competition with bakers for the grains.

65
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:08,207
Oh, I didn't know why. That was, that's cool.

66
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:12,417
Again, 500 years ago, it's not like we had giant combines and tractors and, you know,

67
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:13,587
a surplus of grain.

68
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,787
A lot of people invest heavily living an engrained life, trying not to starve,

69
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,867
trying to make just enough extra food that they could sell it to have a bit of a life,

70
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:25,757
you know, and then all those people in the cities living off of that.

71
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:26,667
Not like today where we've,

72
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:29,326
is it 2% of the population grows all the food for the rest of us.

73
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,835
It's a mind boggling number for sure. Yeah.

74
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:34,326
Part of what I love about this is just, especially in Germany.

75
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,205
There's this huge emphasis on quality of beer and I don't

76
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,296
mean just quality in the sense of like making good beer,

77
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,595
but quality in the sense of it's the same.

78
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:46,485
I've literally had beer from Germany that I've, you can like hack

79
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:46,695
a

80
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:46,835
s

81
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:50,005
that you can have in Germany and also exports and like,

82
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,526
I'll be damned if I can tell the difference.

83
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:55,445
-- And that's spanning like a period of 10 or 20 years.
-- I would argue that's true

84
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:58,623
of nearly every beer you buy in the store today.

85
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:02,684
I can't think of very many beers that I've purchased at two different

86
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:06,333
-- times and I've gotten what I would call two different beers
-- I have,

87
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,544
but usually with the smaller micro brews where that's

88
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,134
also part of their shtick where it's like,

89
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:10,733
literally,

90
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,623
we don't do that. Like, it's,

91
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,983
it's very, it's variable.

92
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,783
But yeah, like when I buy a beer, like coconut or something, like,

93
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,664
I'm pretty sure if I could somehow, I don't know,

94
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,023
maybe freeze a can of it or something.

95
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:24,063
Keep it for 20 years and then try it against another can of Coke.

96
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:27,321
20 years. Yeah. They'd probably be, like, chemically identical.

97
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:29,111
I mean, Bud Light does this too.

98
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,701
-- That's not,
-- that's

99
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:31,842
-- what
-- frustrates me. Right. Is,

100
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:32,592
oh, my God.

101
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,962
I've had so many good rice beers and then I've had Bud Light and it's just like, what

102
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:36,941
is this?

103
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:40,881
It's Bud Light man. It's actually so, you know, it's really funny.

104
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:44,441
The story I will tell is long ago in America,

105
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,761
there was a marvelous beer industry and then prohibition came

106
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:51,731
and alcohol was outlawed and obviously the beer industry collapsed.

107
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:52,881
And then

108
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,299
after prohibition,

109
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,739
we ended up with just a handful of very large breweries that basically made

110
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,510
everything and generally things like Bud Light and Miller come to mind whatever.

111
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,220
There's people who like him, there's people who don't. And then I would say

112
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:09,130
that reigned supreme until probably the mid to late nineties in the United States.

113
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,420
And now like we have another booming industry of these micro breweries.

114
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,700
But what's really funny is there's still places you can

115
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:19,019
go and they're generally very rural where they will say,

116
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:23,037
haven't experienced this boom in micro breweries.

117
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,937
So I went to, I was at this bar out in the middle of nowhere.

118
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:29,148
This is about a couple of years ago. I walk in and like, oh, what are you drinking?

119
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:32,638
I said what you got, they said we got both kinds and I thought, oh, my,

120
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:38,518
-- one of these,
-- I had the experience once of being in a delicatessen in New Jersey and I,

121
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,058
I, you know,

122
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,817
where they would make you a sandwich and

123
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,888
they had like all the normal processed meats.

124
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,197
And then he's like, do you want cheese on that?

125
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,398
I'm like, yeah, and he's like which one? I'm like,

126
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:50,548
what you got and he's like, we have white and yellow and I'm like,

127
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,519
my brain is like this isn't, is this a brand? Is this like what?

128
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,299
And he's like, I'm like, what, what do you mean like white and yellow, right?

129
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,239
Like these are colors, not cheeses

130
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,500
and he's like, we have American white and American yellow and I'm like, OK, that's

131
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,559
not out there, man. I'm like, what

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,160
are those? And you know, it's just heavily processed,

133
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,339
I guess cheddar

134
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,040
ish

135
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,850
would be the

136
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,269
closest

137
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,350
thing sort of cheddar

138
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,649
and the white's gonna be very provolone

139
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,029
ish is what you're going to. I,

140
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,809
I guess they

141
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,299
whatever,

142
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,540
it wasn't like bad, bad cheese. It was just, but it was like, not

143
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,950
-- exciting look,
-- man,

144
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,269
you're not going to a deli in New Jersey for the quality of their cheese.

145
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,859
Like that's just the reality of it.

146
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,170
I just, I, well,

147
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:33,160
I was led to believe through movies that like all

148
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,910
the delis in like that part of the world were,

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,250
-- you
-- know, in Manhattan, the delis in Manhattan are Froy,

150
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,890
the Delis outside of Manhattan are just Delis.

151
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:42,670
Ok.

152
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,260
Right. Exactly. Yeah. So back to this, I mean, to me that's one of the beauties.

153
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:46,679
Like I,

154
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,179
there's one or two brands of beer I drink consistently because to put it bluntly

155
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,440
enough other people drink them that those beers are never stale at the store.

156
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,880
Like I prefer to get some of the fancier beers,

157
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,709
but I've literally picked up like Sam Adams is a great example because

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,859
they put their expiry dates on all their beers and they actually do

159
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,059
send out like random guest inspectors to like, clear them out.

160
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,589
But I've more often than not in liquor stores here,

161
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,660
encountered expired Sam Adams beer, which I mean, it's not bad but it's not great,

162
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,970
you know.

163
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,459
So honestly I drink a couple of major brands

164
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,049
that everybody else drinks because they're always fresh.

165
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:23,029
-- It just moves. I mean,
-- that's pretty fair. I can't think of it actually.

166
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,440
You know what? I did have skunky beer a while back I went to.

167
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,260
So we have in town, they call themselves a Chicago Deli. It's like,

168
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,861
it's basically a restaurant that just serves a bunch of terrible Chicago food.

169
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:34,821
And it's marvelous.

170
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,221
And I actually ordered,

171
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,541
there's a beer called Goose Island which started in Chicago.

172
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:39,992
It's actually brewed in New York now,

173
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,701
but I ordered a Goose Island while I was there. I'm like, I like Goose Island.

174
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,861
You've got Goose Island. Yeah, it expired like a year before I got it.

175
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,552
And I thought I'm not going to make a big deal about this because, like,

176
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:49,622
the guy was pretty grumpy.

177
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,791
I was already dealing with and I felt like this is how you get, you know,

178
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:52,782
spit in your food.

179
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:52,981
Yeah.

180
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:53,252
-- But
-- I

181
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:53,992
-- mean,
-- that's like,

182
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,944
this is what Gordon Ramsay starts screaming at

183
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,794
people and he's right to scream at them.

184
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:00,584
Yeah. But I don't want him spitting in my hot dogs. So it's fine

185
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,834
and, and they have Marvelous Chicago style hot dogs there, which is why I go.

186
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:05,493
But yeah. Yeah.

187
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:09,063
So it was, it was bad. It was so bad.

188
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,144
The thing I love about reproducible bills is

189
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,664
why do they actually matter for security?

190
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:17,164
And I would say they matter for security for the same reason, it matters for beer

191
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:18,424
and it shows me

192
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,096
that you can actually produce the product correctly

193
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,105
and in the case of software, you can actually correct it and get it out the door.

194
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:24,485
Sort of,

195
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:28,135
this is a complicated topic and I've probably written about this in the past.

196
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,946
I'll see if I can dig out some old blog posts maybe.

197
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:33,375
But reproducible builds are incredibly misunderstood

198
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,926
in the industry because people think

199
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:39,065
they mean something they don't all reproducible builds mean is that given

200
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:42,705
what the source code I claim I built, given the build system

201
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:47,067
claim I used, you should get the same thing on the other end that I got as well.

202
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:50,106
It doesn't mean that it's secure, it doesn't mean it doesn't have bugs.

203
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:52,187
And my favorite example of this is Ken

204
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,586
Thompson has a piece called Trusting Trust where he

205
00:08:55,596 --> 00:09:00,687
basically took ac compiler on a unit system a million years ago and he hacked it.

206
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:04,706
So every time it built the login program, it would insert a backdoor.

207
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,786
But then he even turned it up to an 11

208
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,130
because the compiler also would look for when it was building

209
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,179
a new compiler and make sure it backdoor that compiler too.

210
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,080
Just so people couldn't build a new compiler and then build a new login system.

211
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,780
The whole point of this basically is saying that

212
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,960
there you can only trust what's happening to a certain degree.

213
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,020
And then you have to just say there's nothing I can do after this point.

214
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,239
And I mean, reproducible builds are sort of like that of,

215
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,109
can you trust all of the components in your build system?

216
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,229
Absolutely not.

217
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:36,685
I would agree, but also partly disagree.

218
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,486
If you're willing to go to ridiculous lengths,

219
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,416
you can essentially get a relatively clean build system.

220
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,096
And I don't mean just like bootstrapping it

221
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,106
from like hand coated assembler and like,

222
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,625
you know, wiring up your own eight bit chip on a bread board.

223
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,426
Although people have done those things. I mean, no, that's, that's absurd.

224
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:52,306
What you can do.

225
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,406
For example is, you know, if you're buying equipment,

226
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,286
you just go to the store and buy it randomly.

227
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,265
You don't, you know, order it and like have, you know, hey, going back to like our,

228
00:09:59,276 --> 00:09:59,705
you know, the

229
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,752
about the NSA intercepting hardware and adding chips and whatnot.

230
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:03,411
For example,

231
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,831
if you just go to a random apple store and buy a Mac or

232
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,392
you go to a random best buy and buy like a Lenovo laptop,

233
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:08,562
you know,

234
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:11,271
chances are if somebody didn't monkey with it in the supply chain

235
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,591
on the way to you unless they monkeyed with all of them,

236
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:13,841
right?

237
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,502
In which case, all bets are off. Like that's, that's an like no offense.

238
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:21,312
If an attacker can monkey with a supply chain to that degree to then target you.

239
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:24,111
They're just going to like kidnap you and beat you with a lead pipe.

240
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,771
I, I wouldn't even argue that's

241
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:26,132
a

242
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:26,898
threat model.

243
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:30,408
I mean, what I would say is more likely is, let's say, for example,

244
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:34,038
I'm building Fedora and I'm going to pick on Fedora just because I've,

245
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,518
I've worked with them for a long time when we were at Red Hat.

246
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,288
So Fedora has a build system, right?

247
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,557
And logically,

248
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,927
the build system used in Fedora today can

249
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:44,598
trace its roots back to basically Red Hat Linux

250
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,507
from, you know, 1927 when it was first created

251
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,677
and there's kind of AAA lineage there.

252
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:52,427
And so far

253
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:53,364
as an attacker,

254
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:56,434
I know if I can insert the right kind of backdoor

255
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:59,244
or the right kind of malware in the right place.

256
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:02,093
The next and future build systems are potentially

257
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:04,723
going to contain this malware that attack model.

258
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:07,223
You can't defend against that with reproducible builds

259
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,473
because you're using the same backdoor build system.

260
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:12,164
I am. So we're going to get the same backdoor builds.

261
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,984
What reproducible builds can do though is you can say, all right,

262
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:18,843
so here's a build system, here's what comes out the other end

263
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:24,250
now. And I think is it the Firefox browser, the Tor Browser does this where basically

264
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,340
software comes in software comes out.

265
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,830
And so it's a way to say, I'm going to rebuild this software.

266
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm going to check all the files and I'm gonna make sure that the files I get are

267
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,280
the files they built because between the time it

268
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,260
was built and the time it was published,

269
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,789
what if somebody mucked with that?

270
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,909
And obviously, in the case of something like the Tor Browser, there are real,

271
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,840
we'll say there are

272
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,791
well funded organizations that would have a real interest in back door, that thing.

273
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,260
Well, and part of it too speaks to the maturity of the organization.

274
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,221
Like I've encountered a lot of places where to do a

275
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:57,120
build of a software you need Bob because Bob knows how to

276
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,801
do the magic to make it work. Like literally right?

277
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,361
Versus you just shove some code and hit a button and

278
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:06,111
out pops, you know, something at the end with no human interaction.

279
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,841
There was a company I worked for once. This is before Redhead. It wasn't red hat.

280
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:10,721
The only way to build

281
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:15,291
software we had was you had to create a user with the name of the guy who developed

282
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,841
the build system on your system because it would

283
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:20,492
look for certain things in that home directory.

284
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:20,771
And

285
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:25,052
-- so I have hard coded paths.
-- If it wasn't there, it wouldn't work at the same time.

286
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:27,572
There's another angle to reproducible builds.

287
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,731
Let's say I have a product I built a year ago.

288
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,901
If I had to, could I basically like,

289
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:36,622
change it to that branch or check that code out at that point in time and rebuild

290
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,783
software and basically get back what I built a year

291
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,213
ago or am I going to get something drastically different?

292
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:45,442
And the reason I say this is so let's think of the node ecosystem, right?

293
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,822
Let's say I'm pulling in a package.

294
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,112
Let's say, I don't know, like make up a package name, right?

295
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,203
Let's say, let's say low dash.

296
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:52,742
We picked on that a couple of episodes ago,

297
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,502
low dash a year ago looks nothing like low dash today.

298
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,182
Well, it kind of does because their development is going very fast.

299
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:58,822
But you know what I mean?

300
00:12:59,033 --> 00:12:59,473
Like,

301
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,482
well, and that speaks to the whole, you know, vendors, your

302
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,434
dependencies or pinning them and things like that because

303
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:10,593
yeah, like most, well, a year is a huge amount of time for software delta,

304
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,473
especially in something like the node ecosystem.

305
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:16,093
I mean, well, even in something like GCC 10 is just,

306
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,033
is it out or is it just about to come out?

307
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:18,314
-- I,
-- I

308
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,073
-- don't
-- know, I haven't paid attention to GCC in a long time.

309
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:21,314
Right.

310
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:24,943
But I'm going to assume you do a reproducible build system with like

311
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:28,383
GCC nine and a reproducible build system with GCC 10 and you're going to

312
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,794
-- get the same thing,
-- they're guaranteed to be different.

313
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,565
-- No way that's going to happen.
-- Right. Right. Yep. Absolutely funny.

314
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:35,724
You mentioned pinning

315
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,195
and I'm going to pick on that as well.

316
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,525
So even that's not something you can trust because for example,

317
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:45,104
remember when it was the left shift guy and node got mad and deleted all his stuff.

318
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:45,594
Yeah.

319
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:49,474
So now anything that needed that library that hasn't been updated and was built,

320
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:54,215
say back before that was gone now it just won't build at all because that NP MP,

321
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:57,435
it is. Well, I think it exists again because someone made it, you know what I mean?

322
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,195
Like, well, and that speaks to vendors,

323
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,435
your dependencies where you use something like I think, what is it like,

324
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,276
yarn or whatever to actually pull the files in and keep them locally.

325
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:07,335
-- So you have like a stashed copy. Yeah.
-- Yarn does that.

326
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,716
There's J Frog has a product called Artifact that does that I think

327
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:10,966
WASP

328
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,926
has something too they're pushing now. That's similar. But, yeah. Yeah.

329
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:15,176
That's hugely important.

330
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:15,685
-- And
-- again,

331
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,075
that speaks to not security but just having the darn thing

332
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:20,216
work at like Saturday at four in the morning when,

333
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,169
well,

334
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,619
I remember once when like python.org disappeared from the

335
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,799
internet for me because my ISP had routing issues.

336
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,450
And so like a whole bunch of Python related stuff broke because I couldn't, you know,

337
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,460
pi pie, right?

338
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,119
Like everything is broke. And I was like calling my IP.

339
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,599
and they're like, you know,

340
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,950
because it was hosted off of access for all back in the day,

341
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,830
which was also where the Pirate Bay was and,

342
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,940
and the guy was like, oh, you can't get to the Pirate Bay.

343
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,380
I'm like, well, I can't, but honestly, I don't care.

344
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,580
I need python.org like I need, I need freaking Python to work here.

345
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,099
And he's like, what?

346
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:50,299
And I'm like, Python, you know, they posted with the same people.

347
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,979
He's like, oh yeah, it seems to be down.

348
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,926
I'm like, yeah, so it finally after two weeks got fixed.

349
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:55,676
Ouch.

350
00:14:55,935 --> 00:15:00,625
Yeah, I, I'd literally just VPN through a machine in the US. Yeah. Lesson learned.

351
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:04,885
What gets me though is looking at software when people make beer, you know,

352
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,765
they're constantly sampling and testing things to make sure, you know,

353
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:11,866
like the hops aren't all weird or full of squirrels or whatever, right?

354
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,216
And they're going to measure it right.

355
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,966
You're not going to just be like, I just throw some hops in. I don't know, whatever.

356
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:19,205
Like no, you're gonna, you're gonna measure it.

357
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,885
We're putting in exactly one bucket of hops. Right.

358
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:22,031
Oh,

359
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,831
my God. You Americans. You volumetric, man. A

360
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:28,312
bucket. A bucket is a measurement. It's fine. Everything's fine.

361
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,892
-- It's a volumetric
-- measurement,

362
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,952
-- which is,
-- oh, as

363
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:31,692
opposed to weight.

364
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,031
Actually, that's fair. That's true.

365
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:37,031
-- I, you know, I've been trying to do more
-- because every time I do baking,

366
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:37,841
is that packed?

367
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,302
-- Is it loose? Is it?
-- I agree.

368
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:43,372
And I'm actually, I've been, I've been making a lot of effort lately to use weight,

369
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,661
but I still fall back to volumetric all the time.

370
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,831
In fact, I just, I made waffles this morning for breakfast and

371
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,359
it was volumetric where I needed cups of water. Well, water, I guess is ok.

372
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,239
-- But cups of
-- temperature and whatnot. But, yeah, cups

373
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,090
of water and cups of flour. And

374
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,380
I kept thinking that while I'm measuring, I wish I had weight for this one.

375
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,419
Well, because every time something talks about, for example, using like nuts,

376
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,650
well, like a couple of walnuts.

377
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:09,729
Like, do you want me to get them in there with a hammer or do I just, like,

378
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:10,700
throw a handful in?

379
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,390
You put as many walnuts in as you can fit?

380
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,859
-- That's how many walnuts are the right number of walnuts.
-- Yeah, exactly. So,

381
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,849
ah, anyway,

382
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,630
-- by
-- weight, it should just say, wait all of the walnuts. That's how much it's,

383
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,570
well, and that's where you end up with the raisin scone. That's like all raisins.

384
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,780
I hate raisins. But yes, that's exactly right.

385
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,239
Well, just this weekend, not this weekend. Sorry.

386
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,859
Last weekend there was, what was it? Oh, here we go. Here we go. Found it.

387
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,380
Finally a one line package.

388
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,599
Broke N PM Create App and it's the is under or is

389
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:45,700
hyphen promise in node made a change that you needed to,

390
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,580
I think you need to change how you call it.

391
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,940
Like you actually had to change the arguments you used to call,

392
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:54,224
which of course broke everything.

393
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:54,955
Yeah, here we go.

394
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:59,265
However, the export syntax requires a relative URL eg dot slash index dot MGS,

395
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,575
not index dot MGS uh sorry.

396
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,804
So it wasn't the arguments or a number of arguments.

397
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,104
It was the the argument now has to be an actual

398
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:10,145
relative path name like dot slash instead of just file name.

399
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,314
I'm good with that though.

400
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:15,775
I mean that's and, and sometimes you need to make changes that hurt. I I get that

401
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,680
mean clearly,

402
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:21,479
-- nobody was expecting this
-- maybe one of the challenges in any ecosystem.

403
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:21,750
Well,

404
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,489
like Python two just released their final version like for real final version.

405
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,550
Thank goodness.

406
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,619
And if I look at my, you know, my terminal here on my Mac and I type in Python hyphen V,

407
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,750
you know, I get 2.7 0.6.

408
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:36,989
-- What is the, what is the current version?
-- The latest Python two?

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,589
They just released like a week ago was a 2.7 0.17.

410
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:45,334
And is that the version of Python that Apple is distributing?

411
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:48,675
-- No,
-- they're doing a classic red Hat, you know, sort of quasi.

412
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,665
Or at least, I hope they're doing a classical red hat of back boarding for all.

413
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:54,915
-- I know they're just shipping an old version
-- and they might be because let's face it,

414
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:58,395
the number of security issues is generally low

415
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,155
in things like core languages.

416
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,165
And I mean, to be clear,

417
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:03,724
-- they also have Python three and
-- everyone should just be using

418
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:06,584
that because it's vastly superior to Python two in every way.

419
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:07,334
Yes.

420
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,839
And it's supported.

421
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,670
That's a minor detail

422
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,079
back to this.

423
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:17,770
So I see stuff like this where somebody makes a change that, you know, is uh well,

424
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,270
technically a breaking change, it's not that bad because like, yeah,

425
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,640
a bunch of build systems broke and people fixed them.

426
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,900
-- Let's
-- put this in the context of beer. OK?

427
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,479
Because I think it might be easier to understand.

428
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:31,160
You have a supply chain in beer, you have certain ingredients,

429
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,680
you have to have to make it if one of

430
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:36,579
your suppliers suddenly has different quality or even just vanishes,

431
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:37,439
which does happen,

432
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,166
-- times you have to adapt
-- well.

433
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:43,286
-- The haw shortage in 2013 to 15,
-- that's a perfect example.

434
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,786
And this is the same thing with software where

435
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,646
sometimes your suppliers are going to flake out,

436
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:49,016
sometimes they're going to have bugs, sometimes they're going to disappear.

437
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,516
Part of being on the end of the production line

438
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,567
is you just have to deal with it sometimes.

439
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,286
And that's, there's,

440
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:59,006
there's no good way to ever be prepared except to be able to move quickly.

441
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,766
There are preparation steps you can take

442
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,557
like using something that actually downloads and keeps

443
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:07,217
a copy of your dependencies so that you have them in case like Python dot

444
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,734
routing gets broken or whatever.

445
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:13,254
Well, and so I would argue that's still comparable to our beer situation

446
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:14,313
because for example,

447
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:17,854
am I going to start making beer before I have all the ingredients in the warehouse?

448
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,173
No way. Right.

449
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:22,394
I'm going to say, all right, I have all the hops I need, I have all the grains I need,

450
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,563
you know, water's free coming from the city, whatever.

451
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,563
I'm good there. Then we start making the beer.

452
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:29,274
We don't say like, oh the hops are on the way. They'll be here tomorrow.

453
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,183
Let's start boiling the grains like no,

454
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,963
don't do that because if the hops don't come

455
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,264
tomorrow now you've just wasted and ruined everything,

456
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:35,614
right?

457
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, I guess the difference between soft terms,

458
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,230
you don't have that kind of wastage or spoilage problem, right?

459
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,620
I mean, we don't, it's different.

460
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,061
Conversely, storage of software is actually pretty tricky.

461
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,671
It's very difficult, you know,

462
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,161
because I'm just thinking like if I gave you a tar ball of some dependency, great,

463
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:52,470
cool.

464
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,140
-- How do you feed that into the build system
-- these days, you basically can't,

465
00:19:56,151 --> 00:20:00,260
unless you're willing to stand up like your own custom N PM system,

466
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,220
which is a nightmare in itself.

467
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,850
Yeah. Don't do that.

468
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,651
Folks use something like a tooling system like yarn or whatever.

469
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,910
No, seriously.

470
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,699
Like, I know, like all these people that, you know,

471
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,219
the whole idea of custom container registries, honestly, unless you're Netflix,

472
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,260
you're too small to bother doing it.

473
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,839
It's a pain.

474
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,209
Well, just because I've stood up, you know, I've,

475
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,500
I've stood these things up and to properly care and feed

476
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,160
for them and back them up and make sure that they're available

477
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,030
is just no.

478
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,920
Well, that's like anything. Right. It always seems easy

479
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,060
to get something running. But then it's hard to keep it running.

480
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:39,234
I see that every day where someone says, oh, we should do this and you say, all right.

481
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,454
But who's going to own it? And they say, what do you mean?

482
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,844
Like, well, we're going to stand this up and then someone has to care and feed it,

483
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,765
you know, for the end of time.

484
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:48,114
-- Well, yeah,
-- until we stop using it. Yeah.

485
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,175
And then they're like, oh, well, I don't want to do that. Like, yeah. No,

486
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:56,175
nobody does. So, but at the same time, if you're not willing to own it,

487
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,614
no one's going to do this because I don't want to either.

488
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,744
Well, I'm now making the transition, you know, we're transitioning out of

489
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,390
structure as a service and moving to platform as a service because quite frankly,

490
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,099
I don't want to manage the servers and, well,

491
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,800
neither does the DEV team and we actually

492
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,839
just had uh one server like randomly reboot.

493
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:16,680
And I go in, OK. The up time is weird. It's like it got rebooted. I'm like checking in

494
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,079
a did Amazon reboot. It did I make an image of this thing or something automatically?

495
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,880
No. And it literally was an out of memory error. And so Linux went all Ky

496
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,000
and killed something that ended up with the machine rebooting.

497
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,010
And I'm like, well, fantastic. Do I just double the ra M in this

498
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:32,765
or? That's the easiest.

499
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:37,045
Well, no, the actual answer is like, OK, this is slated for movement from IAS to PA

500
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,925
in like a few weeks.

501
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:42,525
-- So we'll just make that like, let's do that actually,
-- you know,

502
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,834
it's funny you bring this up.

503
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,165
I have a great I learned a lesson about.

504
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:51,204
So there's a game called Donkey Kong 64 that came out on the Nintendo 64 long ago.

505
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:55,994
This is probably, I bet what the year probably 9998 maybe give or take.

506
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:57,125
-- It came
-- out in 99.

507
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:57,255
I

508
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:57,685
was pretty

509
00:21:57,785 --> 00:21:58,834
flies. So,

510
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,229
so anyway, this game was the,

511
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:06,150
I think the first game on the Nintendo 64 that required the memory

512
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,569
uh expansion pack, which is basically like it doubled the ra M in the Nintendo 64.

513
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,630
And the thing was, I don't know, it was 20 or 30 bucks.

514
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,910
I forget how much it was back then.

515
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,859
And anyway,

516
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,349
the only reason it needed this is because the

517
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,790
game had a memory leak and it would crash in

518
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,550
about four hours to play without it and it would crash in like 40 hours of play with it.

519
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:24,390
So,

520
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:29,109
their solution to the memory leak was just, you have to buy more memory.

521
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,910
And honestly,

522
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,510
I've seen that happen with large scale pieces of

523
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,189
software that just sort of don't clean garbage.

524
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,735
Well, it's probably cheap than fixing the bug.

525
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,605
-- Now, Nintendo's selling more stuff
-- that's not a memory leak.

526
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:43,806
A memory leak is where you expose memory according to CW.

527
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,385
You know, the common weakness, enumeration database,

528
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,576
-- whatever
-- that's from the security perspective.

529
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:51,615
Yeah, but so this is a memory allocation error,

530
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,975
-- whatever everyone calls it a memory leak or
-- what is it?

531
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:57,936
-- Sorry, memory use and lack of freeing or whatever it's called memory
-- leak.

532
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,906
We all call it a memory leak.

533
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,495
And,

534
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,722
and my experience like dealing with memory leaks is

535
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:05,362
the cost of having somebody competent to go do that

536
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:08,332
versus, yeah, telling your customers just add another stick of ra m

537
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:10,751
Well, like those, what is it? The Patriot missile system?

538
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,562
Remember because I had that integer overflow where it

539
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,092
drifted over time from time and same thing.

540
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,491
What is it like seven some model of the 777 I want

541
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:21,381
to say or 787 has to be rebooted every like 43 days,

542
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:22,712
-- like every 32 bit one
-- of

543
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:23,702
-- the Boeing
-- planes.

544
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:24,271
And

545
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:29,560
now I will also say though in the nineties, when Donkey Kong 64 was,

546
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:34,420
was being created, the memory, I guess inspection tools were really bad.

547
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,880
It was actually really common to have a memory leak in your application.

548
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,449
If you wrote c that you couldn't figure out because it was,

549
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,410
it was leaking in some ridiculous and weird way

550
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,569
because once you start doing crazy pointer arithmetic,

551
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,849
things are out of hand these days, there's tools like valgrind, for example,

552
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,530
that you basically run your, you know, you compile your tool with the debug info.

553
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:55,167
My devs like I forget which ruby thing they did,

554
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:58,378
but they basically bolted on a ruby thing and were like, OK, you know,

555
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,187
here's a bunch of problems and they fixed it in like a day.

556
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,858
Oh, that's like the A PM stuff,

557
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:05,907
not A PM was something else that like tells you about your memory usage and CPU usage.

558
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:09,338
And they just found like a bunch of code that was like, not at all optimized.

559
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,218
But and that's the thing like, and honestly, in modern computing terms,

560
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:15,338
you don't have to optimize code because like literally the

561
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,017
slowest machine I have in this house is probably my,

562
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:19,868
well, that's a computer, like not

563
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,485
my light bulbs that have computers in them, but

564
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:26,026
-- it's like a Raspberry Pi four with four gigs of ra M.
-- Right.

565
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:28,735
That's like the slowest system I have in this house.

566
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:33,115
Now, I will say you have to remember. It's easy to say that that it doesn't matter.

567
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,975
But like if you have to scale up because now

568
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:37,015
once you have a fleet of a million machines,

569
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:41,015
if you can decrease that by even 10% that's cash money right there.

570
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:43,166
OK. Then explain Google Chrome to me, please.

571
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:45,436
Because man, that memory is not their problem.

572
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:47,385
Like actually in all seriousness,

573
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:49,894
I've quit running Google Chrome almost exclusively,

574
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:52,534
I'll still like I use it for the podcast because it does work better.

575
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:55,894
Like they obviously test that the more, more so with the service we use.

576
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,234
Well, Chrome is the first class web browser nowadays.

577
00:24:58,244 --> 00:24:59,053
-- I mean,
-- it kind of is,

578
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:03,254
but I've been running Firefox almost exclusively and the memory use is lovely.

579
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,004
It makes a huge difference.

580
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:06,144
I'm very and, and of course,

581
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:09,024
I'm happy to support Firefox because Google is

582
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:11,604
a terrifying organization for a number of reasons.

583
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,004
Well, you know, even if they mean, well,

584
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:15,203
if they accidentally like kind of lean up against you,

585
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,052
it's like an elephant leaning up against you like you're, you're a bug split,

586
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,342
right? So,

587
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,572
but anyway, anyway,

588
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,952
all right, all right. Purity.

589
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:23,651
-- I
-- guess maybe the moral of the story is,

590
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,812
is you don't need to do a lot of crazy things to make.

591
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:31,031
Let me put it this way. You don't need to get a full 100% reproducible build system.

592
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:31,411
I mean,

593
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:35,052
in my personal opinion, you should and, and that's not from a security point of view,

594
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,171
but purely from an efficiency, pushing a button,

595
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,031
making it build point of view and getting it to work.

596
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:39,932
I mean, on the flip side,

597
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:42,371
I've got like a bunch of Python scripts that literally say like mem

598
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:42,562
cash

599
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:45,810
D to walk through it and get all the items out of mem

600
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:48,739
Cash D from within Python is basically a complete pain in the butt.

601
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,250
Whereas there's a command line utility called like Mem

602
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:51,439
cash

603
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,510
D dump or something.

604
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:55,890
And so my script literally says before you run this script, you have to go run mem

605
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,040
cash

606
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:56,459
D dump.

607
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,369
Hyphen O space

608
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:00,569
file name, do that first and then run the script. Why?

609
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:02,689
Because it backs up everything in mem

610
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:02,880
Cash

611
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,229
D

612
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:03,459
I

613
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,130
understand. So basically I write stuff to mem

614
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:05,280
Cash

615
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,329
D and then I want to export it. Interesting.

616
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:10,569
So, you know, and that's per example, like with this reproducible build system,

617
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,119
don't maybe shoot for 100

618
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:13,447
percent reproducible builds.

619
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,628
But like for the love of God, maybe download all your artifacts just so that,

620
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:19,387
you know, when, when the network or something has a glitch or

621
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:24,708
no Js has a DNS related issue or who knows that you can still rebuild your software.

622
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:27,848
Reproducible builds are surprisingly difficult.

623
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,468
Well, I'm saying it's a continuum and you can,

624
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:31,447
you don't have to shoot for 100% reproducible.

625
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,728
But there are steps you can take that actually also have a benefit.

626
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:38,167
-- I would
-- argue you should shoot for 100% reproducibility.

627
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,047
But you have to understand it's a journey.

628
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,489
You're not going to go from 0 to 100 overnight because that comes

629
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,119
back to the typical security problem of perfect or nothing means nothing.

630
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,530
And it's like when with anything you do, you can't go from 0 to 100.

631
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,689
It's, it's a journey and it was the same thing with the quality and purity of beers

632
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:58,859
where

633
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:03,449
the ability to consistently make a type of beer that tastes

634
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:07,130
the same and is functionally the same that didn't happen.

635
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,310
It took us 400 years like

636
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,729
it's OK.

637
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,349
Well, I would make one caveat is that for some people,

638
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,489
you don't really actually need reproducible oil.

639
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,640
So for example, if it's like an internal tool,

640
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,670
having Bob come in and do the magic to make it work, hopefully,

641
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,390
as long as Bob documents it somewhere so that if he gets hit by a bus,

642
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,880
you're not completely up the creek by and large.

643
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,380
I mean, I'll be blunt, like

644
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:29,660
obviously there's variability in the beers I drink.

645
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,180
I don't have the palate to notice and more

646
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,729
to the point like every time they talk about,

647
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,170
you know, beer,

648
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,000
palates and wine palates and then they do the test where

649
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,290
they take like a red wine or rather they take two,

650
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,530
they take two bottles of identical white wine.

651
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,250
They put red food die in one and like, put it in a different bottle.

652
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,290
And of course, you know, these,

653
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,660
these master sommeliers describe them completely differently.

654
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,530
And it's like, well, those people are useless. No offense.

655
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,130
I have an opinion on this and I don't want to

656
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,250
get into it too deeply because we're nearly out of time.

657
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,130
But I think fundamentally

658
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,380
and I'll, I'm going to pick on wine here because I,

659
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,079
I do love wine and I drink it whenever I can

660
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:05,560
is part of the fun in drinking wine

661
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,479
is the experience

662
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:08,430
and

663
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,160
the color of the wine

664
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,189
and the smell of the room you're in and the temperature outside and all of that

665
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,869
is part of that experience.

666
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,420
And so while I understand that a lot of this, the descriptions people give is like,

667
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,819
-- technically BS,
-- well, I would say this is also true of beer and food.

668
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:29,495
Right. Like I don't ever want to eat hot wings in summer unless it's on a patio.

669
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:33,145
-- Yeah, that's true. If it's, if I'm outside drinking beer, I'm good.
-- Yeah, exactly.

670
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,206
And that's the point. Right. Same thing with Christmas pudding.

671
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,026
I eat Christmas pudding once a year at Christmas.

672
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:39,465
That's it. Like, I, same thing with pickled herring.

673
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:42,196
I eat pickled herring once or twice a year in the week between Christmas

674
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:45,465
-- and New
-- Year's and I can eat pickled herring anytime I love pickled herring.

675
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,956
I do too. But like the, you know, my breath and everything, everybody hates me.

676
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:53,712
Well, actually my problem is no one else in my family eats it except my dad. I buy a jar.

677
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:54,791
I split it in half.

678
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:55,362
And then, yeah,

679
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:57,802
by the time I'm done with it it's like I am sick

680
00:28:57,812 --> 00:28:59,942
of pickled herring because this was a lot of pickled herring.

681
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:00,671
But anyway,

682
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:03,391
the point is it's part of the experience, right?

683
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:08,442
And so, and, and honestly, I think even software is this to a degree where it's

684
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:11,052
the journey is the reward, as we say, right?

685
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:16,112
Where do what works for you and screw everyone else. All right, I'm calling it.

686
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,171
This was, this was fun. It is

687
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,579
two of the topics. I do indeed enjoy beer and reproducible build.

688
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,459
