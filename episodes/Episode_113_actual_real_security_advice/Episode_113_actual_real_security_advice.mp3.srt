Hello and welcome to episode 113 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,659
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,689
-- How
-- you doing, man?

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,420
-- Good,
-- good. Just enjoying the smell of burning dust.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,489
But what

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,379
it's fall. So I had to turn the furnace on.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,739
Ah, I see. That's right. You live in the Arctic Circle

7
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,739
Fall comes much earlier for you

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,139
to anybody else.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,729
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,450
I don't, I don't look forward to, to winter but whatever it is, what it is,

11
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,340
you deal with it.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,849
All right.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,930
Cool, man. So, the topic this week is

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,319
actionable security advice.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:46,939
And I,

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,560
I came across this article in the Washington Post written by

17
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:55,520
a person whose name I dare not try to pronounce.

18
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:59,229
And basically this guy was talking about trying to help

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,840
the, it specifically calls out the Democrats

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,620
because of how terribly they got whacked in the last election for security.

21
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:11,660
But basically talking about how do we teach security to these people?

22
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,580
And then he kind of goes through some of the things and,

23
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:16,339
and he basically lays out just a lot of the bad decisions

24
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:21,699
now just to clarify what do you mean by these people? When you say the Democrats, you,

25
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:23,040
uh, uh, I,

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,370
-- I, the, the Democratic Party
-- in the US? Ok.

27
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,809
So not like Democrats, but the Democratic Party,

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,669
-- which we
-- call Democrats here.

29
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:35,650
I thought Democrats were the people that belong to the party.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,870
But whatever this is America Kurt, we make our own rules.

31
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,169
Exactly.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,000
Anyway.

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,120
Yeah.

34
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,559
So, and, well, actually we've had the same thing come up with our,

35
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,569
we have a federal election coming up next year

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,209
and there, there is already talk of, you know,

37
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,459
-- and
-- the potential

38
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:51,900
for

39
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,510
meddling in this context. Are you saying we as Canada or we

40
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,769
having? Well, II, I

41
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,190
really hope the US is not having a federal election in

42
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:03,730
2019 because that means things have really gone off the rails.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,580
It's nothing would surprise me at this point.

44
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,699
So, but yeah, no, so we're, we're, we're also

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,360
looking at this, you know, and there's been talk of like, what was it?

46
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:17,990
I think Facebook and whatever, having extra security for the Canadian, you know,

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,139
politicians and the people running and stuff like that.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,880
But uh yeah, so to this email, uh yeah, because yeah,

49
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,970
my understanding is like there was that whole thing about the Democrats emails

50
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:31,529
and the emails being leaked and the servers being hacked and blah,

51
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,179
blah, blah.

52
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:37,259
And yeah, I was, I, I briefly glanced at this article and how do I put this nicely?

53
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,300
I, I feel for this guy. He's, he, you know,

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,020
there, there these people want to help and they want to make things better.

55
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,199
Uh Good luck.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,979
All right. So I wanna, I wanna split this show into two kind of pieces because

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,110
you see more doom and gloom than, than maybe I am and, and maybe you're right.

58
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,149
I'm, you've convinced me of nearly everything in the past.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,110
So I'm confident in your ability to sway my opinion now.

60
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,649
But then additionally,

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,199
uh we scribbled down some notes talking about like these

62
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,449
are actual things you can tell people to do if

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,919
they ask you for help because we're really bad at

64
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,710
giving actual advice that that can make a difference.

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,429
And so let's first off

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,490
and to be

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,410
clear, you're kind of doom and gloom here.

68
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,539
So first off, none of the advice we give is 100% sure,

69
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,169
which is why a lot of security people won't give this advice,

70
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:29,100
but I'm ok with it. I'm ok with 80 90% solutions because

71
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,479
they're better than like

72
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,330
100% solution that nobody can implement or use.

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,610
I'm going to point at seat belts in cars here where we all

74
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,270
have the crazy uncle who says those things kill more people than they save

75
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,360
or they come to the

76
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,690
corner case like what if I crash into a lake

77
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,440
and I'm drowning and I have to cut myself free,

78
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:48,300
blah, blah, blah, blah.

79
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:49,690
It's like no. Statistically,

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,330
yeah, statistically, wear your damn seatbelt,

81
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,800
you know, don't disable the airbags in your car.

82
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:59,229
Exactly. Like there are instances where it could actually make things worse.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,119
But, but those are

84
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,509
substantially less common

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,660
than the,

86
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,130
the usual instance of you hit something and

87
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,970
you don't want to fly out of the windshield

88
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,029
or the guy behind you hits you

89
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,889
like the passenger behind you get, you, like, people forget about that

90
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,548
anyway. So, yeah, so I'm a bit more doom and gloom on email.

91
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,790
Security for two main reasons.

92
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,970
Number one in general, it's just, people don't seem to care.

93
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,440
I, I do think there's some of that and I, I won't disagree with you but I feel like

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,010
the stance I have is I don't try to force this on people anymore, but if

95
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:37,455
-- someone comes to me, I make sure I have something to tell them.
-- And that was

96
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,066
kind of my second part of that is people have

97
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,726
to want help before they can before they'll do it.

98
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,015
Exactly.

99
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,545
I have seen so many security projects in

100
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:49,085
security departments that showed up and they said,

101
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:49,885
oh, we're security,

102
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,045
we're here to help and nobody wanted their help

103
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:54,765
and like they failed because let's face it.

104
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,436
If, if, if somebody you

105
00:04:56,941 --> 00:05:00,821
to help wants you to fail, by definition, you've already failed.

106
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,062
Well, or they just want to be left alone by you,

107
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,921
they don't want you to harass them and force them into some weird thing

108
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:09,682
mandated by security, you know. Right.

109
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,601
-- Right. We have, we have work to do here,
-- run this application on your laptop.

110
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,761
It will make it 30% slower and do nothing.

111
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:16,432
Right.

112
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:19,201
And it will occasionally fail and lock you out.

113
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,510
The other thing is, is email is one of those things. It's, it's like electricity.

114
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:24,679
Right.

115
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,929
We, there's a lot of electrical safety stuff people ignore and end up, like,

116
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,890
burning their house down.

117
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,309
Like how many people actually,

118
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,760
like, for example, I learned ha ha much well, after the fact that

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,239
you're actually not really supposed to do your own electrical work,

120
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,190
you're supposed to get a certified electrician to do it.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,839
And technically speaking,

122
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,899
you're supposed to get it inspected if you make any changes,

123
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,279
as opposed to just say, replacing something.

124
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,160
-- How many people do that? Basically
-- nobody,

125
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,269
some people do. I don't know. It's,

126
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,850
I'm trying to think. I do know some people that have done

127
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,459
some electrical work.

128
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,290
I've done some myself, but I've also, I have a lot of electrical education

129
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,209
so it's a bit different.

130
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,149
Yes.

131
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,790
And I, I think I, although, although I guess at the same time

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,779
we have reached a point with the way electrical systems work in homes that

133
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,820
you have to make some pretty serious mistakes to burn your house down.

134
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,100
I read the code book for my local area actually. And it, it is really clear.

135
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,739
Two lessons, two things.

136
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,220
Number one, there's been a lot of deaths and burnings and whatnot.

137
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,209
So specifically, we have rules, like,

138
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,940
for example, like outdoor outlets now are actually,

139
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,380
like, they're hooded and they,

140
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,019
they really keep the rain out and there's a whole bunch of other stuff.

141
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,579
And then the other thing is that

142
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,940
these rules are clearly really designed.

143
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,029
So that, yeah, some dumb schmuck does come along and start doing dumb stuff.

144
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,809
It, it is difficult for them

145
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,890
to electrocute themselves or burn their house down.

146
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,149
But the problem being, of course,

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,470
is that dumb schmuck comes along and does some wiring and doesn't do it properly.

148
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,399
Then the next poor bugger who comes along,

149
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,579
you know, that stuff's not earthed properly or it's not shielded or, you know,

150
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,149
whatever.

151
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,320
So that's, that's part of the catch. Right is,

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,470
yeah, if every, it's kind of like in traffic,

153
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,269
if you're not paying attention and everyone else is paying attention,

154
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,529
then you're ok.

155
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,250
But when two people aren't paying attention and texting and they go,

156
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,190
both go into the traffic circle at the same time.

157
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,890
Guess what happened,

158
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,329
then they have a low speed impact because it's a traffic circle.

159
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,089
Yeah. Well, not the way people drive here.

160
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:21,890
But,

161
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:22,350
um, I

162
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,519
know there's, you know,

163
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,019
it's nothing pleases me more than pulling into the

164
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,820
traffic circle in front of someone going really,

165
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,130
really fast and purposely driving about five miles an hour

166
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,609
just to be a jerk

167
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,369
and, and watching the rage and their faith,

168
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,619
I may get shot someday, but it's gonna be worth it.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,040
So

170
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:39,989
I can look.

171
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,920
So kind of how that applies to email is

172
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:44,489
like, for example,

173
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,470
a lot of people still think they can run their own email server securely.

174
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,970
Hang on. That's advice. We'll get to that. I think

175
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,299
your doom and gloom was less doomy than I expected. So, so do we agree that

176
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,570
if people don't want help, they're going to keep doing whatever it is they're doing.

177
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,739
But if somebody shows up and says, please help me,

178
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,660
-- there's some real opportunity there,
-- right?

179
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,799
There's at least a chance that A they will listen

180
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:07,220
to you and B that they will actually carry out

181
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,220
the advice.

182
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,220
I I think fundamentally and this will go without saying that

183
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,779
the long term goal is for technology to deal with all of this stuff.

184
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,399
But in the short term,

185
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,079
we do have to have some people change some of

186
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,149
their behaviors because the technology just isn't there today.

187
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,500
Well, also some of this technology is so general purpose that

188
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,119
sometimes like for a great example, being is I,

189
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,709
you know,

190
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,659
there are people who legitimately need to email around infected virus files,

191
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,830
they're, you know, malware researchers

192
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,299
and, and so II I know, but I'm saying like, for example, with these, you know,

193
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,570
with the Democratic Party,

194
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,330
there are people that need to send around some very,

195
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,489
very sensitive information that might be, you know,

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,020
password protected or encrypted.

197
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,669
And for example,

198
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,989
an antivirus scanner just can't and should not be allowed to really look into it.

199
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,440
And that's ok. Right. That's ok. And, and for those instances,

200
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,419
you can take special precautions, but we're going to try to beat. This is for

201
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,190
general normal advice.

202
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,190
Not, not, you know, I have this insane use case that no one else has help me do this.

203
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,450
Like that's something else.

204
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,109
If you have that, go find a professional and pay them money to help you.

205
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,309
Right. Don't, please don't use a podcast you found on the internet.

206
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,640
-- Hey,
-- at least it's, it's a start

207
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,570
-- assuming the podcast is good and reliable,
-- which of course is

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,559
actually let's just say it upfront,

209
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,460
it's not reliable or good because that way if someone does this and gets hacked,

210
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,080
-- we can be like,
-- oh

211
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,900
-- yeah, we're disclaiming all liability.
-- Yeah, we told you we were a bunch of idiots.

212
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:40,880
You shouldn't have listened to us.

213
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,549
Yeah, I don't have any errors and omissions insurance. So

214
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,169
it's right.

215
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,549
But I don't live in America. So. Right.

216
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,570
Right. Right. Ok. So you mentioned about don't run your own email

217
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,030
and I'm gonna say it's even more than that,

218
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,809
go out of your way to run as few of your own services as possible.

219
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,650
This is everything from your email to websites, to document hosting, to like

220
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,099
anything. And here's the reason I say this.

221
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,369
So I, I work at Elastic. Right?

222
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,229
And we have a product called Elastic Search which is

223
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,190
used by a lot of people for searching data.

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,789
Right now, we have a support organization.

225
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,080
If you need help, you can call them and ask, ask questions. Right

226
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,340
now.

227
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:27,390
We have a cloud offering and the thing I've really come

228
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,179
to realize is everyone here uses this stuff all day,

229
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,909
every day.

230
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,750
By definition, you are never going to be better than us at running

231
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,450
elastic search because you probably have another job, right?

232
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,210
-- Where that would be part of
-- actually doing something useful with elastic search

233
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:45,609
well,

234
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,590
and being an administrator,

235
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,119
right? And this is, this is true of every service

236
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,270
on the planet.

237
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,789
If you're, if you're working with, let's say Google for email,

238
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,890
that's literally they have a team, this is all they do.

239
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,969
Unless you have a team dedicated to email, you cannot do as good of a job as them.

240
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,750
Well, the problem is it's not just a team,

241
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,010
they have multiple teams, they have people doing the hardware data center designs,

242
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,989
they have people doing the power design for the data center,

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,719
they have the people doing the server design,

244
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,460
they have people doing the operating system,

245
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,859
they have people doing the email service, they have people doing the data storage,

246
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,729
they have people doing the data backups.

247
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,020
You do have a full time backup admin, right. We'll get to that one, you know.

248
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,239
Yeah, exactly. Right.

249
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,179
And then, and then the security team

250
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,409
and then the anti spam and then the anti malware and then, you know, like,

251
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,900
like Google bought virus total, right?

252
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:39,020
Which is a site where you can go submit a file and it gets scanned by,

253
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,159
I think the last I checked it was like 56 or 63 somewhere in there.

254
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,359
Virus scanners, right?

255
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,650
So for example,

256
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,380
I actually run all of our digital artifacts through

257
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,960
it before we post them to our website,

258
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,590
which is

259
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,140
to make sure.

260
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,859
No, no, no,

261
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,869
you're going to be annoyed because that's not why I do it.

262
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,390
I do it to make sure that we're not triggering any false positives.

263
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,739
No, that's a great reason.

264
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,109
-- I mean, that's, that's part of the reason to do such things,
-- you know,

265
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:04,299
and also to make sure that we're not shipping something with a virus out because

266
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,700
there's been picture frames in USB key S and God knows

267
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,979
what else that have gone out with viruses in them,

268
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:09,419
right.

269
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,429
Um So, you know, I really don't want to have the cloud security lines, you know,

270
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,659
distributing an Excel file with a virus in it.

271
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,260
That would be bad.

272
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:17,359
And that's the thing.

273
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,710
Like, there's no way I can replicate that even anything close to it.

274
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,460
No, it will.

275
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:26,909
Not only that, how many, how many small businesses don't even have an IT guy,

276
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,109
but rather they're paying someone two hours a week

277
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,739
like you have no chance.

278
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,030
Well,

279
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,299
or a managed service provider and those managed

280
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,409
service providers are like really lowest common denominator.

281
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,260
Like, they're not bad. They're definitely better than not having an IT guy.

282
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,780
-- Well,
-- now, would you consider Google a managed service provider or not?

283
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,640
Um, they're a cloud provider.

284
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,679
So when I say MSP, what my understanding of an MSP is, is like, ok, you know,

285
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,549
I'm a small business.

286
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:55,604
I need a bunch of it services MSP. You know, we're gonna pay you. What do you charge?

287
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:59,494
Ok. Well, you recommend Windows small business server or whatever it's called.

288
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:00,494
We'll have it on site

289
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:04,655
and they will like, update it and back it up and manage it and like, oh,

290
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:05,664
I need an account added.

291
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:06,705
They do that, you know.

292
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:07,965
Oh, I need like,

293
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:11,224
you know, all our workstations are locked down. No administrative level access.

294
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,445
So, hey, you know, uh in

295
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:13,744
accounting needs um

296
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:18,330
whatever Adobe distiller to create PDF S for invoices or whatever.

297
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,960
So you need to go install that on our machine and like help her you.

298
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,210
So it's essentially your, it department outsourced.

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,049
Ok? I mean, that's fair. All right. So anyway, running your own services don't do it.

300
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,849
But, but let's go even farther. I'm gonna tell you if you need email,

301
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:35,450
you, you should use Google or Microsoft Full Stop.

302
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,059
Right? If someone says I need help, that is, that is what I'm going to tell you to do,

303
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,669
right?

304
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,489
And this is even true of things like dealing with documents don't, don't buy office,

305
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,250
don't use some dodgy office thing, you download it off the internet and,

306
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,489
and I'm even going to say,

307
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,250
like, just use Google Docs

308
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:56,159
or Microsoft office 365

309
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,390
because like

310
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,659
the trouble you get into trying to maintain and deal

311
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:08,750
with local office applications as AAA non crazy tech person

312
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,039
is

313
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,630
a huge hurdle.

314
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,250
-- Well, just the
-- bandwidth alone now, right,

315
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,900
every month it's like two or three gigs of office updates for each of my, you know,

316
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:17,820
I have a five,

317
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,539
I have a five user, whatever license of office 365.

318
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,590
And yeah, so that's like

319
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,190
eight or 10 gigs of data transfer a month alone just for the updates.

320
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,669
And unless you have high speed internet,

321
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,270
I have no idea how you're gonna get those updates.

322
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,710
Uh You just don't,

323
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,330
that's,

324
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,530
that's what happens and, and

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,630
right, so, so for real, if someone comes to you and says help me with email,

326
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,869
just Google or Microsoft, I don't,

327
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,719
it's the easiest way and not only that if, if you're the tech person,

328
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:47,940
they're asking for help,

329
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,859
they're going to screw something up if you have them do pretty

330
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,150
much anything else and then they're going to come to blame you

331
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,080
and then you have to deal with the aftermath, which is no fun.

332
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:56,859
Yeah.

333
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:59,119
Well, and the nice thing about Google and Microsoft too is that it's,

334
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,130
it's not just email.

335
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,059
See, that's the problem, right.

336
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,200
This is also what makes me angry about the whole email debate.

337
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,359
People don't want email,

338
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,289
they want email and calendaring and a whole pile of other stuff.

339
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:12,270
Like ideally document management, document editing, collaboration,

340
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,229
you know, uh,

341
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,080
address book, an address book might be nice

342
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,559
running that because I have had to run that in house.

343
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:20,880
Yeah, it's,

344
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,039
it's a crazy amount of work to set up something that's kind of just

345
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:27,719
-- not great. It,
-- it, the solutions are terrible. I agree.

346
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:31,539
It's, these guys are doing it better than you could ever do.

347
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,919
And I'm sorry if I just made you feel bad.

348
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,150
Oh, I've given up,

349
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,505
I've been an email administrator for over 20 years now and I still run a couple

350
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:42,825
of email servers because we have one corner case list server doing its little thing.

351
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:43,094
But

352
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,815
for example, I don't have to back it up because it's just, it's, you know,

353
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,395
it's an explosion list server, right?

354
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,195
Yeah, I mean it's fundamentally I've,

355
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,664
I've been doing email for long enough that like, yeah,

356
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,734
I remember when MX records were kind of new

357
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,000
like I'm pretty old.

358
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,219
Yeah, it's

359
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:00,510
never again.

360
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,030
Alright.

361
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,469
We're gonna stop beating this horse, but there's one last thing I want to bring up.

362
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:09,000
Uh never suggest P GP or GP G as a solution for anybody.

363
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,919
So I used to be very pro P GP G

364
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,979
back in the day and now I'm actually kind of, I won't, I don't want to say I'm anti

365
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,469
P GP or GP G

366
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,210
but by and large,

367
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,030
the return on investment of it is very minimal,

368
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,979
assuming you do it correctly and doing it correctly. It's a real

369
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,250
-- pain. It's
-- almost impossible.

370
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,650
And so if you're like super technical, like for example,

371
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,849
I would be comfortable mailing you A P GP message,

372
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,049
P GP encrypted message. I should say

373
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,280
I would not feel comfortable mailing my wife.

374
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,400
Nor do I even want to try to explain to her how to use it.

375
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:46,030
Right. And so this is one of those, pick your audience if we're

376
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,359
doing. This is

377
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,640
a somewhat normal person,

378
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:55,190
never suggest P GP GP G Tor or any of those other crazy services because they just,

379
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,309
they're never going to get it.

380
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:56,830
Well.

381
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,190
And the other thing too is again, you know, for example, uh Google,

382
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,119
I believe it's Google.

383
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,729
Their enterprise level of product

384
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,040
does do

385
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,890
really good email encryption really

386
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,170
seamlessly,

387
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:09,770
whatever

388
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,209
it just works, you know, with. No, no, no, but within your web browser and stuff. So

389
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,959
it's, and people complain, oh, it's not end to end encryption.

390
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,489
So it's not real encryption, blah, blah, blah, to which I say,

391
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,670
yeah, it's good enough

392
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,189
-- and it is,
-- it's fine. Exactly. Exactly.

393
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,829
And you know what if you really have a secret, you want to tell someone,

394
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,709
don't email it to them,

395
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,290
don't email, don't instant message it.

396
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,079
Because even even there have been the court cases recently with

397
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,640
some politicians that were using signal and you know what,

398
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,910
they didn't clear the signal log so that the government got it anyway.

399
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,560
So just for

400
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,130
like,

401
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,900
talk to people with, if, if you have a secret, just call them on the phone.

402
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,939
But best case it's just go talk to them

403
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,439
in person and then write nothing down anyway. Anyway, let's, let's get to

404
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,300
it. All right. Now, next up I have trusted device

405
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,540
and when I say trusted device I'm not talking about, like,

406
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,099
take the old laptop and put windows on it or something.

407
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm saying, buy a surface, buy a Macbook or buy a chromebook. Those are your options.

408
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,880
Well, yeah, I would, I would add to that in general. Um,

409
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,859
if you're, yeah, tablets are a bit

410
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,349
easier to get software updates for because they

411
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,170
tend not to be like carrier locked and,

412
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,569
you know,

413
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,469
the carrier doesn't tend to be between

414
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,119
you and the

415
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:24,569
-- update. I would,
-- I would fit like it. And even then though I would only suggest

416
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:31,930
a, a ipad or maybe one of the, the top tier tablets with Android do not run cheap

417
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:35,650
-- Android tablets, they are
-- trouble. You never get software updates. Exactly.

418
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:35,959
You know,

419
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,689
and, and something like, what was it?

420
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,890
A major percentage of them are shipping with security flaws anyways.

421
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,459
Like, because they're shipping with older software.

422
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,719
There was an article about that last week. Yeah.

423
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,520
Microsoft Surface, I would say is reasonably acceptable.

424
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,530
Uh, I actually discovered there's so Microsoft Surface comes

425
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,630
by default, generally speaking, running in a mode called,

426
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,709
what was it Windows store mode.

427
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,040
And I'm like, what the heck is that?

428
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,030
Well, as it turns out

429
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:01,180
it runs

430
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,390
in a way that's kind of like an ipad and that you

431
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,709
can only by default go and install software from the Windows Store,

432
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,359
which in theory is less of a cesspool than the random internet.

433
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,800
And that would be another thing, you know,

434
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,109
this trusted device don't go installing all sorts of random crap on it.

435
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,369
-- Yes,
-- exactly.

436
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,189
I think

437
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,569
if you can get away with it, doing as much as you can in your web browser is I,

438
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,209
and, and this is where I love the chromebook because

439
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,609
all you get is a web browser. I mean, that,

440
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,560
-- that's all there is. It's great.
-- Well, and

441
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,479
the thing is the, the main web browsers now, you know, Chrome Safari,

442
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,390
-- internet explorer and
-- Firefox, internet explorer.

443
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,430
Come on man. Ie

444
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:41,925
edge.

445
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:44,925
Yeah. Edge, sorry. Yeah, whatever they rebranded it to.

446
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:48,354
I haven't used Windows in a very long time since like Windows seven.

447
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,084
I haven't used it.

448
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:49,895
But yeah, I mean, those,

449
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:53,464
they basically all have security as a pretty primary concern

450
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,685
and Firefox is even making some changes now to make,

451
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,505
you know, the tracking much more difficult.

452
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,030
So, yeah, when, when we say use a trusted device, basically that boils down to is,

453
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,260
you know,

454
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,270
use a device that gets software updates reliably sort of from a reliable source.

455
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,180
-- You know, be that Microsoft, you're
-- too general for real, you're too general,

456
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,670
I think in all seriousness.

457
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,150
Macbook

458
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,089
surface or chromebook

459
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,140
and, and you could maybe put an asterisk that says, yeah,

460
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,790
get some nice tablets but like

461
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:23,189
-- those don't have keyboards.
-- Well, see, I, I actually would take it one further.

462
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:27,619
I would say don't buy, I would say don't, don't buy those, get, get a tablet or a,

463
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,130
an iphone or, uh, like

464
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,489
a, uh, an Android phone that comes direct from Google. That's like

465
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,530
gets the security updates.

466
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,939
I, I would actually, at this point say if you actually do care about security,

467
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,339
don't use a laptop

468
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:45,119
and, and that's fair. I, I would be comfortable with that advice. So,

469
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,349
there you go.

470
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,130
Sweet.

471
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,199
All right,

472
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,520
let's keep going.

473
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,959
-- And
-- then the password manager thing, of course, because people suck at passwords.

474
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:53,439
Uh Yes.

475
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,180
Now, not just saying password managers, the,

476
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,439
the three I know of and you might have some other, other, other ones to suggest,

477
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:04,239
but I know there's last pass, there's one password and there's Dash Lane.

478
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,239
-- I'll even be simpler. I would just go with last pass full
-- stop.

479
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,680
I would be comfortable saying use last pass. I use it,

480
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,864
you use it. We like it. But at the same time, uh,

481
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,464
you know how people are, someone's gonna complain,

482
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,005
someone might complain about these three.

483
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:19,744
Uh, the, the biggest thing I like about last pass is, uh,

484
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,484
like I used last pass personally.

485
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:25,444
And we're also deploying it are going to be deploying it hopefully at the CS A and the,

486
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:28,385
the way they handle multiple accounts actually works quite well.

487
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,905
And that's one challenge with some of these other password managers is if you

488
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,920
essentially want to have like two personas,

489
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,349
like your personal persona and your work persona within it, that does not work.

490
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,550
Uh That, that could be, I don't know, I've never done that

491
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,000
but, and, and I know from my perspective,

492
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,680
the killer for last pass for me is family mode

493
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,599
because that's, that's what I want.

494
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,260
And I,

495
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,930
and I guess family mode ironically is similar to business

496
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:54,400
mode where multiple people need to access the same secrets.

497
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:57,189
Yeah, it's just business mode like,

498
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,069
right. And

499
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:01,839
that's easy enough. And then moving on from there is two factor

500
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:05,319
-- off, right. If someone, someone asks for help, you tell them to use two
-- factor

501
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,199
off, I'm actually going to go one further with the two factor authentication,

502
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,290
I've been thinking about this a lot

503
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:12,770
if you have what I would call sort of a high security application.

504
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,449
So for example, my bank account, uh I don't have enough money in it to really be,

505
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,130
you know,

506
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,729
I would not consider it high security.

507
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:19,430
But if you have, you know,

508
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,760
a business bank account with say several million dollars in it,

509
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,329
I would consider that high security.

510
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,849
Uh, or for example, if you're some high member Muck, a

511
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,439
Muck policy maker with the Democratic Party or whatever,

512
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:33,119
you know, II, I would think that that counts as sort of a high security application.

513
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,500
And I would say in that case that you're better off

514
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:39,619
not using two factor authentication based on phone numbers.

515
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,800
And we've kind of gone to this weird situation

516
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,979
where your phone number is your like identity now because

517
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,260
by and large it,

518
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,030
it is unique and works and people tend to hang on to their phone numbers,

519
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,819
especially with number portability in most of the world now.

520
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,260
But fundamentally, your phone number is actually pretty easy

521
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,819
to hijack or to take over

522
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,420
and

523
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,699
it can be done temporarily like at two in the morning.

524
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:02,810
So you don't even notice that you've been hacked,

525
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,859
you know, and then, and there's a lot of articles where, you know,

526
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:10,500
people have their number snagged and it just basically turns their life inside out,

527
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:10,729
right?

528
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:11,099
Because

529
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,540
how do you prove your identity to all these companies and stuff so

530
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,170
long? And the short of it is

531
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:18,260
definitely use two factor authentication.

532
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,109
I would say generally speaking,

533
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:23,119
only use two factor authentication when it's like a hardware token,

534
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,140
like a UB key or the Google Titan

535
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,579
or it's one of the application based ones like Google authenticator or free OTP

536
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,760
where, you know, you basically install it on your phone or tablet.

537
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,650
It generates a, you know, a little shared secret or not a shared secret.

538
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,339
But generates a public private key, blah, blah, blah magic crypto happens

539
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,619
and then you can use that, you know, to authenticate yourself to the remote end.

540
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
Um But I would say at this point,

541
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,500
uh

542
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,989
if you have a high security application where

543
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,660
you're actually likely to be sort of targeted,

544
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,520
as opposed to just, you know, randomly people are trying to hack a bunch of accounts.

545
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,699
If you're going to be targeted, then

546
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,430
yeah,

547
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,599
if they figure out what your phone number is, which is not that hard.

548
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:04,969
Now,

549
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:10,010
I want to put an asterisk on what you just said because you're right.

550
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,040
However,

551
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,170
making normal people not use S MS could

552
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,089
make things worse.

553
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:21,290
-- Well, that's why I said high security versus low security.
-- Right. Exactly.

554
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,010
And that's, that, it's important to point that out though.

555
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,819
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

556
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:28,609
For, if you're gonna be a targeted attack victim, then they're,

557
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:30,300
they're gonna win there and, and

558
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,770
making basing your security on your phone number

559
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,079
is actually going to make things worse.

560
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,469
But for a normal person like you or me,

561
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,520
it will make things much easier because to put it bluntly, we're not being targeted,

562
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,099
they're just going after the lowest fruit.

563
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,540
And,

564
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:47,109
and here's the other important thing you said about being targeted is something

565
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,400
like two factor authentication isn't there to stop an attacker like that,

566
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,739
it's there to slow them down enough that you realize what's happening

567
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:59,229
-- that way you can do things to take actions.
-- Well, or to make it much more. No.

568
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,260
-- Well,
-- that's exactly it. Right. It becomes noisy.

569
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,849
You see something's happening and then you

570
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,800
can take some actions to protect yourself.

571
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,810
You will not stop them. If you just let them go, they will find a way and they will win

572
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,949
guaranteed.

573
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:13,689
And that's something we forget sometimes.

574
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,890
And then I guess the LA, so the last one on the list then is backups.

575
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,540
Find a, a thing to do backups and, and put them in the cloud and this is, you know,

576
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,949
Apple has time machines.

577
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:25,770
They've got their icloud, you've got Google Drive,

578
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,420
you've got the Microsoft Onedrive, there's

579
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,199
box, there's pick one, this one that the advice is slightly more squishy.

580
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,540
Yeah, I would say at this point also for,

581
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,890
for most people like doing physical backups is again, kind of

582
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,199
almost worse because the discipline to do it correctly is

583
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,469
so high that almost everybody gets it wrong.

584
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,010
Plus nobody ever verifies their backups when they're physical. Right?

585
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,000
Whereas if it's in Google Drive, it's really easy.

586
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,239
Like, yeah, the file appears to be there and it's not deleted.

587
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,680
Here's,

588
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,680
here's the one thing I'd say though is

589
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:56,140
Apple has the time machines and they're real easy

590
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:59,719
and, and lots of device makers, the Nas Box,

591
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,099
but you still have to like physically remove your drive.

592
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,630
Because for example, I know somebody who did it for a company,

593
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,739
somebody broke into the company and stole all their Macs and the

594
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,209
hard drives on the desk

595
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,150
and that's why you need it in the cloud.

596
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,599
Well, exactly. And so they did have off site backups,

597
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:15,395
but they were, you know,

598
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:19,324
a few weeks out of date because rotating these things is such a chore that nobody does

599
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:20,114
it.

600
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:23,204
Whereas with the cloud it's just, yeah, magically up to date. And,

601
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:26,685
and furthermore, if you really depend on this data, like I do.

602
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:29,574
So, for example, for my personal Google account in my domain,

603
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,765
you know, I pay the extra money for Google vault, which basically says

604
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:34,920
sure. Yeah, you deleted it. Uh huh.

605
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,380
It's gone except it's in Google Vault and we can pull it out for you, right?

606
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,400
So even if you break into my Google account short of deleting the whole thing,

607
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,920
it's I, I can very trivially get it back,

608
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,810
which is hugely important because then if

609
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,640
the ransomware hits or something like that,

610
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,199
you can get back at the data.

611
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:52,920
So it, it matters.

612
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:53,229
I

613
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,489
don't know. I, I feel like none of this should be controversial.

614
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:56,709
Well,

615
00:26:56,719 --> 00:27:00,449
what's really frustrating to me is the honestly everything we said boils down to

616
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,760
go with Google or Microsoft and enable the two

617
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:02,979
of a

618
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:03,380
using

619
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:04,199
a

620
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,900
kind of, that's literally this whole pile boils down to and, and use the password B

621
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:09,500
that's it.

622
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,839
-- Those are the three pieces of advice
-- and, and I guess the,

623
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:16,410
the purpose of it is if a normal person asks you for help you.

624
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,540
The advice has to be that simple and that

625
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,339
liable and, and if you want, point them at us

626
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,650
and, and this is what they're going to be, be told.

627
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,060
So, on a side story related, I was at an airbnb, we were at breakfast,

628
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:30,170
another young couple was there and the topic of computers came

629
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,380
up and apparently his wife's laptop was all bucked up.

630
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,339
Uh, I was like, oh, you know, like what?

631
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,739
And she's like, oh, it's really slow and I need to replace it.

632
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,260
And I'm like, oh, you know, what is it? It was like a Mac from, like, 34 years ago.

633
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,780
And I'm like, oh, that doesn't, you know, that should probably be ok.

634
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,109
Like, what are you doing on this thing? Right. Like, video editing and stuff.

635
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,920
She's like, no, like,

636
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,099
email and, like docs and I'm like,

637
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,030
huh?

638
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,579
And I kind of look at the husband.

639
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:53,160
He's like, she's only got four gigs of RA M and I'm like, oh, well, yeah,

640
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,020
you should probably upgrade that.

641
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,000
And I'm, I mean, he's like, I know, I keep telling her this.

642
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,339
I'm like, and I look at her and I'm like, yeah, you just need to upgrade your RA M and,

643
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,839
and does it have a sot state drive?

644
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,959
And he's like, no, she needs to get one. I'm like, yeah, you, you really do.

645
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:08,000
And she's like, she's like, well, but, you know, he keeps saying this is it. Right.

646
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,209
And I'm like, yes.

647
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:09,439
And,

648
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,609
and that's something I find frustrating is people will ask

649
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,135
other people for advice and then be like me,

650
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,295
I'm not sure I trust you.

651
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,385
But then like some stranger comes along. He's like, yeah, I'm Kurt Herter.

652
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:19,645
I'm an itu expert. Sure, whatever.

653
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:21,055
And they like, believe it.

654
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:24,125
And I just, I don't, uh, I don't know what to do at this point with that.

655
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:24,165
I,

656
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:28,744
I have a bit of advice for people suffering from this because I have the same problem.

657
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:33,255
If you ask me what, I think I will tell you once and if you don't do it,

658
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,739
it's not my problem

659
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,430
and, and I, I deal with this, even people in my immediate family,

660
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,810
it's like I will tell you what to do.

661
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:43,050
You don't have to listen to me, but I'm not helping you again. Right.

662
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,609
And, and that's the only way to deal with it. You know what? Great? Don't believe me.

663
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:51,234
I don't care. I will still sleep at night. But like when it lights on fire,

664
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:54,474
I'm not going to go out of my way to help you because I told

665
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,474
you what to do six months ago and you thought I was crazy and,

666
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:01,675
and that's actually working very nicely for me because while,

667
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:03,915
while some people think I'm a bad person,

668
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:09,035
like, no, I'm not putting my life on hold for your poor choices. End of story.

669
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:10,545
Well,

670
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:12,564
fundamentally if people won't listen to the ex and I

671
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,505
think part of the problem too is with computer security,

672
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:15,435
you know, who are the experts?

673
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,609
There are no experts.

674
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:21,939
Yeah. And what I love though is the people who actually are experts.

675
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:25,369
If you ask them, are you an expert? They'll say, like, uh, no, but I'm, I'm ok at it.

676
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,920
-- Right.
-- I'm smart enough to say, I'm not an expert.

677
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,680
Anyone who thinks they're an expert. Yeah. Stay away from those people.

678
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:31,439
They're dangerous.

679
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:32,260
Yeah.

680
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,550
-- If they proclaim their
-- expert and, and that's actually another good bit of advice,

681
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:36,739
right?

682
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,640
Don't, don't,

683
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,260
don't be an expert,

684
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,640
right? Don't be an expert with the perfect advice.

685
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:46,500
-- Yeah. All right.
-- Maybe point them at the Google security blog. Seriously.

686
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:53,089
-- All right, man. Any, any parting words
-- just for the love of God people, please please

687
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,229
-- learn to parallel park.
-- All right. That's not exactly related.

688
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,709
I figure once we have parallel parking solved,

689
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,550
then we can maybe solve email security.

690
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,390
We, we will solve it with self driving cars. Humans will never learn exactly.

691
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,900
There we go.

692
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,520
Problem

693
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:06,989
solved.

694
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,839
When the machines take over, everything will be great.

695
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:11,800
Well,

696
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,199
