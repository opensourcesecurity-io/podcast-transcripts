Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,859
Kurt Siefried and my partner in using an American IP address, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,739
I always, I don't always have an American IP address.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,780
Sometimes I have an IP address somewhere else.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,989
I pretty much always have an American IP address now because I need

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,819
to use A I tools that are pretty much all laws to America.

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,459
And what I love is is I will like log in to one of them and it'll be like you can't do this,

7
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:30,579
you're not American.

8
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,430
And so I like turn on Nord VPN because I forgot to turn it on.

9
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,400
I don't have it set to start with the system, right?

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,189
And then I'll like hit,

11
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:40,560
I literally hit like control R and the web page is like, oh,

12
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,240
-- happy to see you, Mr Siefried. What can I do for you
-- today? Very nice.

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,959
Thank goodness, I have an American billing address for my corporate credit card.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,599
Everything. Fine.

15
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh, actually, no, wait because,

16
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:52,580
yeah, no, that's anyways,

17
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,680
it's just I get why they're geo locking it because like legally they,

18
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,783
I have to otherwise the European Union or something might spank them. But.

19
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:02,132
Right. Yeah, it's so annoying because I get these weird latency spikes.

20
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,663
Like, I can't use it during, uh, the podcast

21
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:08,892
or on calls. I'll just get weird latency spikes where I digital banjo for a minute.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,782
I had a funny thing happen to someone the other

23
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:13,193
day actually is someone I work with was on,

24
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:16,612
uh, they were using Google Hangouts or Meet whatever they call it now.

25
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,733
-- Google
-- Meets, I think hangouts is dead. Ok.

26
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:19,292
I don't know.

27
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:20,542
I don't keep track that closely.

28
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:21,926
Well, and there's two versions of me.

29
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:24,386
-- So, whichever
-- one, of course there is, why wouldn't there be?

30
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,426
But they were using Google Meet

31
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:28,295
and all of a sudden it like boo

32
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,346
them off and was like, we've detected,

33
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:30,786
you know,

34
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:35,075
dangerous information or not dangerous malicious activity from this IP address.

35
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:36,575
Of course, they send me a message. Right. Right.

36
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,155
They're like, oh, is there what's going on?

37
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,575
It's like, you know, kind of start doing some investigating and I'm like,

38
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:41,136
-- there's
-- nothing

39
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,996
VPN this doesn't make, yeah, it was VPN

40
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,346
and I was like, ah, that makes sense.

41
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,386
Yeah, people log in through VPN and,

42
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:47,879
oh,

43
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,819
it's so annoying because I get all these angry

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,620
emails from the club floor automated system saying,

45
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,110
you know, like you're coming from an NYP address.

46
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,169
I'm like, I know, I know it's ok.

47
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,639
Calm down like we have pass keys and a security token enabled. It should be ok.

48
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:59,800
Well, and actually this feeds into the,

49
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:03,000
the today's show topic is being right all the time is hard

50
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:07,480
-- and, and our take on this is, but not needed and
-- impossible as well.

51
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:08,360
Don't forget that.

52
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,029
Yeah. Minor detail.

53
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:11,639
Minor detail.

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,399
I hit a pothole the other day because we had a big dump of snow and

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,149
there's this one

56
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,559
pothole I keep swerving around

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,309
and I forgot it was there and because it was covered with snow dunk

58
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,919
and that's a perfect example. Like roads don't have to be perfect.

59
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:26,039
Like there's giant potholes that destroy people's cars.

60
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,440
-- That's enough pothole talk.
-- But I got it in there.

61
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,559
I know you snuck it in.

62
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm gonna, we'll see. I could, I can't edit that out either. It's

63
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,110
excellent.

64
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,539
Well, there's a couple of topics that all basically boil down to the same thing.

65
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,119
So on the, and I'm just going to list them out real quick. Number one.

66
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,809
Why do data breaches matter anymore?

67
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,919
Like we just, the latest data,

68
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,960
data breach apparently was apparently half of France.

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,880
Yeah, I saw that. That's

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,759
so, I mean, it matters. But

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,679
-- does
-- it,

72
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,389
no, does it actually matter

73
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,509
anyways? But let me just list all three.

74
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,179
Number two, Canada is moving to ban the flipper zero because you know,

75
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,820
it's a car hacking.

76
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,639
It's not a car hacking tool. And even if you did ban it, it's not going to really help,

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,009
can

78
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:07,080
break into cars.

79
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,119
But here's the, here's the even better thing.

80
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,910
One of the articles,

81
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
they actually have a quote from like

82
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:13,779
the Insurance Institute of Canada basically saying,

83
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,649
yeah, we don't support the ban on flippers.

84
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,070
What we actually want is for manufacturers to make more secure cars.

85
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,910
Right.

86
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,610
Because they, they have the data and they're going to look at this. And so,

87
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,210
well, yeah, if you ban the Flipper zero,

88
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,770
it might stop like two cars from being stolen out of a garage.

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,149
Maybe, maybe

90
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,809
it's gonna have a totally negligible effect. The third thing is

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,199
there was a really silly New York Times Make online make newspaper magazine.

92
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,130
I don't know which one it was

93
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,330
talking about how you should be really

94
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,970
careful about handing out your email address.

95
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,880
-- Oh my goodness.
-- And

96
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,119
you know why you don't need to be concerned

97
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,000
about handing out your email address as much anymore

98
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,910
because everyone already has it.

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,839
No

100
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,279
gmail and Yahoo's 2024 inbox protections changes are coming

101
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,779
and that's gonna affect everybody.

102
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,610
Ok.

103
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,690
Anyway, so where do we want to start with this?

104
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:02,949
All right,

105
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,110
I want to start with two data breaches

106
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,470
-- matter because I feel like they
-- do counterpoint,

107
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,600
they don't see to me the data breach is

108
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,449
not

109
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,779
the problem.

110
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,559
The problem is my bank giving a mortgage to somebody because

111
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,149
they faxed them a letter saying I am Kurt siefried.

112
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,390
Please give me $300,000.

113
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,989
Here is a photocopy of a driver's license with the same name on it.

114
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:25,750
-- I
-- mean,

115
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,670
I understand

116
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,559
the idea you're getting at there where this is, like

117
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,920
you're saying,

118
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:35,899
our systems should be set up in a way that

119
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,260
even if someone has a bunch of information on you,

120
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,299
they shouldn't be able to abuse that system.

121
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,649
-- But I don't know if that's realistic
-- because there's legitimate people.

122
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,910
I have to give this data to

123
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,519
my employer. If I'm renting, they kind of need to know some stuff about me.

124
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:53,600
You know, like there's a lot of situations where people have to hand out this data

125
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,959
and it can't we treat this data as if it's secret.

126
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,700
But we also like if you want to get a cell phone,

127
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,890
they're gonna ask you for your social insurance number here

128
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,269
so they can do a credit check on you.

129
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,260
I mean, yeah, and if you refuse to hand it over, they're like, well,

130
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,649
you don't have to hand it over, but we also don't have to sell you a phone.

131
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,690
Yes, I've seen that before too.

132
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,589
-- And
-- this feeds, this is like this is the exact same thing as the flipper.

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Zero in the cars,

134
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,010
the insurance people and most Canadian consumers are like,

135
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,980
yeah, I would like our cars to not,

136
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,649
you know, luckily we don't have the Kia problem that the US has where they put the,

137
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,790
they didn't put an immobilizer on the steering wheel, right?

138
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,279
So like I have a Kia

139
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,450
and my version of the Kia here in Canada has a microchip in

140
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,230
the key fob which you know when I turn the car on it,

141
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,839
asked the chip for a code and the chip responds with the code and then it turns

142
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,096
in America, it doesn't have that.

143
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,305
So you just have this thing where you literally stick a USB drive into this

144
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:45,395
little slot and crank it physically turn it and it turns the car off.

145
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:46,605
That's what happened.

146
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,936
Somebody made a tiktok video of here's how you still steal a Kia car.

147
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,895
You, you just physically get entry into it.

148
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,936
Which, yeah, if you have a hammer or a rock or

149
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,545
whatever, not a difficult thing to do.

150
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:01,165
Like every time I've seen the A MA come by to like,

151
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,846
get up uh to unlock a car because there's keys locked in it.

152
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:04,645
You know, they're there for like

153
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:05,902
three or four minutes.

154
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:08,782
Oh, it's very fast. Yeah, it's not hard to get into a car.

155
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,101
My favorite thing is like the, the tools they have are like, you know,

156
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,291
it's like a cat toy with a stick with a string or it's like

157
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,511
a piece of crazy carpet with a string tied to it or whatever.

158
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:15,782
Right.

159
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,582
Yeah. But basically

160
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,131
no amount of, oh, you should keep your keys secure.

161
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:24,182
Oh, you should keep your data secure. I can't keep my data secure.

162
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,541
I have to hand it out to a whole bunch of people.

163
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:32,641
I had a credit card popped and I am 99% certain I know which website lost it because I,

164
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:36,398
I normally only use that credit card to buy things like from Amazon or from whatever,

165
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:37,697
from a bunch of large retailers.

166
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:40,067
The point is we're not going to get these more

167
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,127
secure systems because a car manufacturers gonna be like,

168
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:43,398
yeah, your car being stolen.

169
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,097
Sounds like a, you problem. Not a me problem.

170
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:45,417
I mean,

171
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,528
-- it kind of is your problem
-- until the cities

172
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:50,338
in the US have started suing the carmakers.

173
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:50,657
Now.

174
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,697
-- That's a thing now. And
-- that, that's good.

175
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,317
Well, and that's an American solution that wouldn't happen in Canada, for example.

176
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,308
All right. So anyway, so I guess here's how I would frame this.

177
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,697
You are correct

178
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,253
in that a data breach

179
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,123
technically shouldn't matter.

180
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:08,473
I mean, you, there's more to that, but let's set aside some of the, the asterisks,

181
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,403
obviously, like mental health

182
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,514
-- related data breaches
-- are. Right. Exactly. There's lots of personal details.

183
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,574
You don't want to get out.

184
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,373
Yeah, medical stuff and all that.

185
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:19,614
-- Let's
-- say your, your tax ID number,

186
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,593
home address, phone number, name,

187
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:22,764
date of birth.

188
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,454
If, if our systems worked in a perfect manner, you could say yes, you

189
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:28,704
like, you could print it on it,

190
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,130
t-shirt and walk around with it and it wouldn't matter.

191
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,209
I, I don't think it's necessarily realistic because

192
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,450
like, there's no such thing as perfect security. Right?

193
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,119
We exist in a universe where competent security teams

194
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,880
have gone away from this idea of perfect.

195
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,559
-- And they've gone to, like focusing on risk and reducing risk. Right.
-- It's simple.

196
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,230
Perfect. Security is too expensive.

197
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,769
There's, there's, the return on investment is negative.

198
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,589
It, it doesn't exist, it's not even too expensive. It just doesn't

199
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:56,825
f

200
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,446
managed risk. You,

201
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,205
it, well,

202
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:04,205
it manages your risk and you make money and you spend money appropriately and,

203
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:04,795
you know, I,

204
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,786
I don't have a whole house generator to power my house

205
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,925
because we have so few power outages here in Alberta.

206
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,425
Knock on wood except for that one time where

207
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:13,316
we almost had to turn off power to the province

208
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,716
when it got cold out.

209
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:15,705
Right.

210
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,316
But fundamentally, you know,

211
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,395
I'm not going to spend $15,000 on a whole home generator.

212
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:23,316
What I did do actually is I changed my furnace so it's now a plug

213
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,481
into a socket so I can unplug it from that and plug it into a Jacky

214
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:29,791
to run my furnace. Right. Right. And that was like a $50 change.

215
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:30,082
I mean,

216
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:34,812
so here's a good way to think of this and this is something I've I've done in the past is

217
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,572
like insurance. Does this as well. Ok.

218
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,541
Where you can put together ideas that say like

219
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,001
if we have a breach of this particular data,

220
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,841
we expect the cost of the breach to be this,

221
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:47,961
to prevent that breach.

222
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:52,512
It would cost us this much. If the amount of the breach is less,

223
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,880
then the cost of preventing the breach,

224
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,880
that's accepting the risk, right?

225
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,630
Because you're, you're saying we're going to pay this cost instead of that cost.

226
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,059
But the problem there is now that leads to a lot of Externalizing of security costs

227
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,000
much like, oh, if we put le if we don't quality control the,

228
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
the ingredients in our toothpaste,

229
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,429
we might kill a few people. The cost of that lawsuit is x

230
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,599
it's less than making good toothpaste, right?

231
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,359
And that's the problem is a lot of that.

232
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:21,309
Uh

233
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,460
insurance and risk kind of thinking

234
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,090
depends explicitly or implicitly on Externalizing cost.

235
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh, these people will have to spend 10 or 20 hours dealing with their identity theft,

236
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:32,750
right?

237
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,640
Like every time I read about identity theft,

238
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,900
it sounds like such a nightmare where these people are going

239
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,159
to their bank and they're saying look my identity got stolen.

240
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,400
I need account locks put on, I need this, I need that and the banks like

241
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,909
just totally ridiculous,

242
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,869
you know, or people, well,

243
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,440
my favorite thing is like these people who post reddit and they're like

244
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,349
I turned 18 and now I'm getting calls from creditors about a credit card

245
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,679
that was taken out in my name when I was four. What do I do? And they're like,

246
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,909
here's what you do.

247
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,650
But the fact that these credit like these debt collection

248
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:03,775
agencies just are gonna harass and hound these poor people

249
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,775
knowing full well, there's no way that this is

250
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,445
like legally their card

251
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,244
and, and OK, so look,

252
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:14,044
I think there's two conversations here, you're combining together,

253
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:17,885
there's the aspect of trying to protect some of this data

254
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:21,244
and making it will say less useful to the universe.

255
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,354
But then there's also the angle of,

256
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,380
I don't think anyone would argue that a lot of

257
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,630
our existing systems that rely on like credit systems,

258
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,349
whatever

259
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,059
are kind of broken

260
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,859
because they can't accommodate the world we live in today.

261
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,820
And the costs are externalized.

262
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,409
And this is where like having a large fines for losing, you know,

263
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,330
tax ID numbers and things like that, you know,

264
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,099
social security numbers here in the US.

265
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,590
That's where having large fines,

266
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,340
I think can take it from an externalized cost

267
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,880
to an actual cost the organization has to pay

268
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,599
and you can say like we should have a system that, that doesn't matter if this

269
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:59,046
stolen. But I think

270
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:03,395
that does need to change as well because the current systems we have are

271
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,926
basically built for a world where everything is done on pieces of paper,

272
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,135
fines are just the cost of doing business.

273
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:10,955
-- I mean,
-- to a degree

274
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:14,916
have GDPR fines really truly meaningful

275
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:19,281
stop data breaches or made behavior that much different. Probably. Yes. And

276
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:20,231
that's a terrifying thing

277
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,481
terrifies me is things could be far,

278
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,351
far worse than they are and they probably would be without GDPR.

279
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,552
I think they would be.

280
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:31,151
-- Yeah, for sure.
-- But I do think we maybe need to start moving

281
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,002
the cost and the liability.

282
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,192
See if in my mind,

283
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:38,062
if a bank takes an action of creating a

284
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,512
mortgage and giving that money to somebody else,

285
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,289
if something goes wrong with the identity validation process, and it's not me,

286
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:47,729
the bank should be entirely liable.

287
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,869
Why should I be affected in any way? I'm, I'm the victim.

288
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,510
-- I mean, sure, that's a legal matter now,
-- but we don't have laws that really set

289
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,729
that.

290
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:56,979
No, we don't. Not at all.

291
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,799
Absolutely.

292
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:02,429
And, and I'm going to turn this into a conversation, let's say about

293
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:06,479
like in the US, there's this thing coming out called the, well, it's out,

294
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,409
it's called the SSDF

295
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,619
the secure development framework,

296
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,599
software, secure software development framework, SS two SS

297
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:13,770
and,

298
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,219
and CIA

299
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,109
is putting together like they're calling it an out

300
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,570
of station worksheet where in order the idea being,

301
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,979
if you're going to sell to the federal government,

302
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,229
you have to fill out this worksheet.

303
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,489
And it, it says things like I'm, I'm, you know, checking my,

304
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,609
my software for vulnerabilities. I'm, I'm vetting my

305
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:32,409
dependencies, you know, a bunch of stuff, right?

306
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:35,250
And like this is an example where if you don't do that,

307
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,169
there's a real cost, right?

308
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,969
Whereas when we think about a lot of,

309
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:43,340
especially like human personal security things,

310
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,729
there's often

311
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:49,809
no negative aspect for the organizations involved, right?

312
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,385
This is password breaches, data breaches, this is whatever.

313
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,984
Well, I mean, they outsource to some, you know, um,

314
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,734
I forget where was it that I got that email and I finally tracked it down.

315
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,544
It was legit, like some company got popped.

316
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:06,104
They hired a third party essentially call center to deal with it, you know,

317
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,614
and you get like a year of free credit monitoring, blah, blah, blah.

318
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,065
Again, the problem is if the profits outweigh the cost,

319
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,284
then the business is going to do that.

320
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:15,664
And that's why, for example,

321
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,479
for example, with environmental regulations, there is now in many jurisdictions,

322
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,159
not just fines but criminal

323
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,599
uh because you can't

324
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,010
pollute so much.

325
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,010
Like we don't want people like I don't want

326
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,159
people polluting the North Saskatchewan because you know,

327
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,549
the there's over a million of us that rely on that river to drink water from.

328
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,719
And if we can't drink water from it, as we found out a few weeks ago

329
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,419
when uh the electrical system died at the

330
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,700
station and took out all the pumps for like five days.

331
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,440
That's a little scary because like I don't wanna move.

332
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,489
But if my city has no water,

333
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:48,400
well,

334
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,559
that would like end a city for sure.

335
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,159
The there,

336
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,440
there's a famous thing about 20 years ago written by a member of parliament

337
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:57,429
talking explicitly about how the quickest way to kill

338
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,809
a community is to not have clean drinking water.

339
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,169
And this is the context of small northern communities,

340
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,929
essentially indigenous communities where we still have uh tens and hun, like,

341
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,570
I think it's maybe even hundreds of thousands,

342
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,969
but definitely tens of thousands of people

343
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,599
living in these communities without clean water.

344
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,559
And somebody pointed out, like,

345
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,520
if this happened in the Greater Toronto area it'd be fixed in a week.

346
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,989
Oh, yeah, for sure.

347
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:18,979
For sure.

348
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,510
Ok, let's, let's,

349
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,960
let's bring Flipper zero into this now because

350
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,859
I think it's a similar sort of problem where

351
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,349
Flipper zero for anyone who doesn't know Flipper zero is a little device

352
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:33,309
-- that does what
-- it's a software defined radio with a computer chip.

353
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,789
And a really, it's just, it's got a convenient form factor. That's it.

354
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,390
It's got a built in battery, it's got a couple of buttons, a little screen.

355
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,469
Yeah, it also does infrared and you can use it to like copy NFC.

356
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:49,090
Well, basically all the flipper zero does is it can accept radio transmissions,

357
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,559
it can do computation and it can produce radio transmissions.

358
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,679
So for example, you can record and play back a signal or um with a rolling code

359
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:58,440
uh

360
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,630
like a garage door, open or rolling code system.

361
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,659
If you uh record a couple of rolling codes,

362
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,679
you could write software to

363
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,719
reverse engineer the seed and

364
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,549
you can basically clone it. You can use it to clone it as a rolling door.

365
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,919
But you can also do that by just going to your garage door,

366
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:17,109
turning on the rolling code app, pressing the little button on your garage door.

367
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,099
Well, no No, no. Um, and teaching it and,

368
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,929
-- yeah,
-- like when you buy a $20

369
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,510
remote, I want to move on. It's being used to steal cars.

370
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,000
-- That's the important part.
-- It's not,

371
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,210
it's not being used to steal cars.

372
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,789
You don't think it's not being used is something else being used.

373
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,090
There have been zero confirmed cases. What has been

374
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:35,770
sort of,

375
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,450
yeah.

376
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:40,169
Well, I've, I ha there has been video evidence, for example,

377
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,719
from Britain where somebody was wearing a backpack

378
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,690
and holding up a big aerial and they were

379
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,270
using it to essentially proxy the signal from the

380
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,549
keys inside the house next to the the door

381
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:53,979
to the parked vehicle because as somebody pointed out, like when you start the car,

382
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:57,200
it, you know, talks to the microchip in the key and says, hey, are you the key?

383
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,940
Do you do the right key? I can start good

384
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,059
but you don't like

385
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,130
just because it loses contact with that microchip,

386
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,000
you don't stop the car because as somebody pointed out like,

387
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,520
what if your kid throws the key out of the car at highway speed?

388
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,849
You don't just have the car come to a

389
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,789
-- that way
-- on the brakes.

390
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,780
So what you do is you essentially have a stronger,

391
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,820
like a better finer tuned receiver and a stronger transmitter

392
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,710
so that you can essentially get the car to think that the key is in the car when it's,

393
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,619
in fact, it's, you know, 50 ft away or whatever.

394
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,059
And so you just proxy the signal. Could you use a flipper zero for that? Absolutely.

395
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,260
Yes.

396
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,630
But you'd have to like, take it apart and add the aerial and a bunch of other stuff.

397
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,789
-- And at that point.
-- Well, no, no, no, my understanding.

398
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
And this is

399
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,960
for, I think Hyundai and Kia,

400
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,119
you have such a weak system used in their keys

401
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:45,250
that it's becoming trivial to just

402
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,280
use any sort of

403
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,119
NFC device

404
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,450
to just

405
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:51,770
trick the car.

406
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:56,039
So there's like attacks where you, for example, with a rolling code, I block you,

407
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,150
I jam it and I record your rolling code

408
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,500
and then so you play rolling code A and I jam it and record it

409
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:05,118
and then you put the, you push the button again because you want your garage door open

410
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,589
that says rolling code B I block and jam that and I play rolling code A and you go, oh,

411
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:09,910
good.

412
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,189
My garage door worked it just glitched. Sure, whatever.

413
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:15,949
And I now have rolling code B that I can use at a later date

414
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,880
to open your garage door.

415
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:23,239
Right. Sure. Sure. And so flipper zero can do things like that sort of.

416
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:24,729
But fundamentally

417
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,239
I think what happened is

418
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,839
the Canadian Justice Minister's car got stolen three times in three years.

419
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,680
You know, versus the rest of us who people are having their car stolen,

420
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,550
they're tracking them to a shipping container and then to the

421
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Middle East or Ukraine because they put air tags in them

422
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,569
and they're like phoning the police saying, hey, my car is at this, like,

423
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,040
I know where it is to within 10 ft.

424
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,489
It's at the docks. Can you please go get it?

425
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,969
And of course the cops are like, yeah, we might get on that real soon now and of course,

426
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,400
by the time they get there, the car's gone,

427
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,089
you know. And what, what I love is that somebody pointed out if you can smuggle cars

428
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,479
out of Canada this easily, what is being smuggled in anyways?

429
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,069
-- Ignoring that little chestnut.
-- Oh, who knows?

430
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,949
I mean, yeah, that's another conversation.

431
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,000
So, but the problem is we keep blaming the messenger

432
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,199
-- and not fixing the problem.
-- Well, I

433
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,199
don't know if I'd say we're blaming the messenger.

434
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,930
The, the problem I see this is a very human thing I think

435
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,040
is

436
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,050
we see inactivity happening

437
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,890
and will often say like, like stealing tax I DS is similar.

438
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,250
We blame the company that lost the tax ID.

439
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,439
We blame the company that built the flipper zero

440
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,630
when the reality is the place that thing is being used is the actual problem, right?

441
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,849
Where these cars have terrible authentication.

442
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,349
These credit agencies have no authentication.

443
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,270
We've already outlawed the behaviors. It's illegal to steal.

444
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,310
That mostly works but not really and real realistically,

445
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,640
you can't

446
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:51,060
make a theft proof car. You can't make a theft proof business.

447
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,609
Like perfect example is banks.

448
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,040
I love that banks

449
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,560
can still be robbed.

450
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:58,380
But the last number I saw was the average cash

451
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,439
getaway of a bank in Alberta was just over $2000.

452
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,880
-- So
-- they've, yeah, I, I believe it's terrible.

453
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:08,369
They've essentially minimized that to the point where it's like, oh, yeah, we,

454
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,479
yeah, it sucks.

455
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:10,079
But, you know,

456
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,680
we'll eat the $2000 loss rather than somebody get hurt with medical cost,

457
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,160
like $2000 of medical cost.

458
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,936
This is like three aspirin and a five minute

459
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,105
consult with your

460
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,605
doctor for sure.

461
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,316
And that's the thing, like, like we have potholes in pavement,

462
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:23,536
but as long as we minimize them,

463
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,696
so there's not like a giant one in the middle of a busy road.

464
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,806
-- Cool. Fine. Great. Let's do that.
-- We are not talking about potholes.

465
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:31,595
-- You're done, you're cut off and if you say it again,
-- no, no.

466
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:32,855
But so we, we plow,

467
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:36,395
we plow the main roads and the side roads are slick and covered

468
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,416
in snow and you better drive a little bit slower than usual.

469
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,316
But that's ok because you're only driving half a kilometer on these

470
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,362
small side roads when you get to the big roads that were,

471
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,871
you know, to get where you're going,

472
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,432
they're plowed and we just have to do a good enough

473
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:49,432
job.

474
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,141
But I think part of the problem is we keep Externalizing and we

475
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,521
keep allowing and almost encouraging companies to

476
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,751
externalize costs and make people miserable.

477
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,832
-- So that they can save a penny.
-- That's the, the story of humans.

478
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:07,312
What you're talking about is making unwanted behavior expensive, right.

479
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:12,072
So we want to make unwanted behavior expensive essentially. But

480
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,439
like in the case of the flipper zero or the data breach,

481
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,270
the problem isn't actually the unwanted behavior.

482
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,750
The problem is

483
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:25,339
the car has poor security or the credit agency has poor security.

484
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,660
But we are almost always focusing on

485
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,420
the other side of that. Right.

486
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,209
The place where the information or the device or the whatever came from

487
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:38,140
versus focusing on the actual problem itself.

488
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:40,300
Like a perfect example is, is focus

489
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,699
focusing on password breaches when the answer is

490
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,369
we really need to just move past passwords.

491
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,329
Sure. Right. Right. Right.

492
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,650
Like they're just, they're not capable, like they're just not capable of true.

493
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,619
Like, it's like cars, we, we had ignitions with a key,

494
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:58,410
we moved past that to ignition interlocks with a microchip because

495
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:02,449
just, it's, you can jam a screwdriver and then if you can physically turn it,

496
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:03,510
you can start the car

497
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,930
right. And putting a microchip in the key just 100% stops that.

498
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,359
And especially Britain, the numbers, uh, there was a report which I'll, uh,

499
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,479
anyways, the point is when they started

500
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,569
having microchips in the keys,

501
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,319
car thefts fell off a cliff. Right.

502
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Right. For a while. And that's the thing. Right. It's, it's like this is a much more

503
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,680
if all I have to do is break your car window,

504
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:30,760
jam a screwdriver in the ignition lock and physically turn it with all my force.

505
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,160
Yeah, I can steal cars. But if I need to

506
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:37,099
buy a flipper zero and start cloning stuff, that's a much higher bar.

507
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,130
I mean, this is the nature of security. It's very cat and mouse, right? Where

508
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,199
the bad guys do a thing

509
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,920
and then the defenders can defend against the thing

510
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,300
and then the bad guys do another thing.

511
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,459
We see this in computer security all the time.

512
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:52,589
Maybe the thing is that it seems like we've plateaued,

513
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,170
especially with

514
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:57,650
banks and credit agencies and all this doing these

515
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,369
things that allow people to do bad things.

516
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,790
I mean,

517
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,609
I know that on the back end they are absolutely

518
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,189
doing more fraud detection using A I tracking stuff,

519
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:04,810
blah, blah, blah.

520
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,550
And again, it might be truly worse

521
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,290
if they were doing nothing.

522
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,880
But I feel like the car theft thing in Canada is getting bad

523
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,089
enough that it's making the national news cycle now on a repeated basis.

524
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,170
Let me maybe flip this on its head

525
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,130
and let's think about the data breach perspective because I

526
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,770
think that one is more interesting than stealing cars.

527
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,880
Everyone

528
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,199
is holding your data now.

529
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,800
It used to be 10 or 20 years ago. A

530
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,150
lot of places didn't have it,

531
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,545
but like your freaking grocery store has information on you now, right?

532
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,564
That's just the way it is literally everyone

533
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:39,665
there was that thing with the,

534
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:43,035
they found a bunch of vending machines secretly taking pictures of people.

535
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,545
M and M machines. Yeah.

536
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,994
Right. Like, when I read that I was like, what, like,

537
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,035
I wasn't even surprised. I'm not gonna lie. I was like,

538
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:51,694
I'm not surprised.

539
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,084
Well, they, they had the same thing with the, um, what was it clear case where the mall

540
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:59,224
-- kiosk with the mall maps had cameras taking pictures of people's faces,
-- right? Ok.

541
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:00,665
But anyway, so here's the thing,

542
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:07,000
I if the number of data breaches has gone up, but it's probably gone up less

543
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:12,310
quickly, less fast as the number of organizations holding your data,

544
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,500
which is everyone now.

545
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:17,170
So I do think things are probably getting better in some ways, in some ways,

546
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,640
they're not like we have other problems as well.

547
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,160
And I think this kind of comes back to,

548
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,680
we focus on the data breaches when obviously the answer is like,

549
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,599
why do you have my data

550
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:27,839
is the real question?

551
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,530
Well, and the problem is they need to have my data because if they sell well,

552
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,689
not so much now because you can't bond phones to plans, they have to be unlocked.

553
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:36,030
But back in the days, for example,

554
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,869
uh Well, actually, no, especially now when they sell you a phone in Canada,

555
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,319
they want to very much know who you are

556
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,869
because they're giving you this $900 device that you can turn around and sell on

557
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,180
Khai

558
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,180
or Craigslist for Americans and

559
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,000
you know, stop paying the monthly contract and run away from it.

560
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,369
And so they really need to know who you are.

561
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,560
And so they want to

562
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,599
like from their perspective,

563
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,859
we want to get all this data about you so that somebody can't impersonate you.

564
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,959
But then conversely, are they good stewards of that data?

565
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,760
Well, I think there are,

566
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,319
there are organizations we interact with that Absolutely

567
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:11,520
should have access to some of our information.

568
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,680
I acknowledge that. Right. Like if my, my cell phone provider needs to know who I am.

569
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,010
Yes. Banks. There's like there's

570
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,734
requirements for banks to verify your ID.

571
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:25,015
Right? Like when I opened a bank account I had to bring in a ton of freaking paperwork.

572
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,454
I get it. That's ok.

573
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:32,905
But like why does my freaking grocery store need to know my phone number and address?

574
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:37,165
Right. I mean, you can, you can tell them no, but we all know most people don't,

575
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:38,454
you know, they, I do love it.

576
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:40,734
They think I'm a freak because I never, I never give them that stuff.

577
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:43,675
-- I'm like, no, don't you want a reward? No, I
-- don't.

578
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:45,724
I've noticed more and more a

579
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,454
lot of them. Just very,

580
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,699
what's your postal, like they ask for your postal code in a way where they expect it.

581
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,819
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they, they, they don't even know what to do when you say.

582
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,359
-- No, sometimes.
-- Well, actually, no.

583
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,300
What I've noticed now is more and more they have

584
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,270
a button to just go on to the next screen.

585
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,770
Whereas in past they would type like hohoho or t one, t one, t one, t one or whatever.

586
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,349
But now most of them have a button that they just hit and it moves to the next screen.

587
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:10,530
Same thing at IKEA. Right.

588
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,359
If you're not an IKEA family rewards, whatever the heck it's called,

589
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,500
there's a button on the screen now that lets you go past it.

590
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,890
Whereas,

591
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,189
you know, a shopper's drug mart makes it like you have to,

592
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,410
you have to basically not be a member and click through

593
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,510
it like three or four times to get to the payment.

594
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,640
I, I don't think we can regulate those behaviors.

595
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,380
I don't think we can really significantly

596
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,380
prevent that because businesses want that data.

597
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,729
It's valuable because they can sell it.

598
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,869
And I think something to remember too is I don't care who

599
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,939
leaks my data. The fact is now my data is leaked.

600
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:39,869
It's in a public data set potentially. And

601
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,479
whoops. See. And that's part of the problem is

602
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,880
I don't care that my data is held by 10 or 20 or 1000 people.

603
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,189
I care that my data got leaked once and now is public to some degree

604
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,329
and once it's out, it's kind of out.

605
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,189
I mean, this is like, ironically back in the early days, you know,

606
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:57,050
there was the old hacker saying information wants to be free

607
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,709
and what the purpose of that saying really is, is like,

608
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:04,000
-- once information leaks it's out forever
-- you can't fix confidentiality.

609
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,380
Right.

610
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:04,890
And

611
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,170
this is one of those things that

612
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,949
there are a lot of people who don't care

613
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:13,829
that they might not have confidentiality, but there's

614
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,540
a lot of people do.

615
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,949
And it's also, it should be like a decision. Right.

616
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:21,540
-- Like,
-- if you legally change your name from Max to Maxine,

617
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,229
-- there's a lot of the world where you do not want that to be public.
-- Yeah.

618
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:29,449
Unfortunately. Yes, that's absolutely correct. It's, it's kind of nuts like that.

619
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,349
-- Well,
-- also we don't get to decide what matters 10 or 20 years from now.

620
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,750
-- Yeah,
-- that's true too.

621
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,380
That's another thing.

622
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,790
Like, there are behaviors 20 years ago.

623
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,630
You're not wrong

624
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,609
about things changing in the future, you're not wrong about

625
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,500
making this decision.

626
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,260
I mean, at the same time though, like,

627
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,930
I feel like we've just talked in circles

628
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:47,219
and there's no outcome to this conversation.

629
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:50,689
Well, and maybe there isn't and maybe this is just part of the human condition

630
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,420
and maybe part of it is

631
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,290
maybe accepting that

632
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:59,550
and part of it is maybe there are clever ways to make this better through.

633
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:04,770
-- Well, we've seen it with GDPR. Right. GDPR has tried.
-- We can't accept it.

634
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,569
No, we can't accept it. Look,

635
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,750
I think

636
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,910
when pollution was terrible 100 years ago,

637
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,464
there were lots of people that said Oh, we can't possibly do it anything about this.

638
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:15,364
And you know what we did,

639
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,025
we did something about it and it was really expensive and

640
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:20,344
it was really hard and it took a really long time.

641
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:20,665
Yeah.

642
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,145
And I think this is exactly the same thing.

643
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,805
This is like the story of computer security is,

644
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:28,895
there are tons of people that stand around and say there's nothing we can do.

645
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:31,425
It's too hard to fix. Like this is just the way it's going to be.

646
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:33,079
And the reality is

647
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,280
it isn't like we can literally do whatever we want. We just have to go do it.

648
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:37,479
Well,

649
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,910
maybe a better example is house fires because there used to be a lot of house fires.

650
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,630
And for example, the electrical code has changed so much in North America,

651
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,949
like disconnects arc fault circuit interrupts,

652
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,910
all sorts of things that are expensive.

653
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,989
-- Like an arc, fault circuit interrupt is like 200 bucks
-- for,

654
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,189
-- I mean,
-- automobile accidents.

655
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,410
How much does an airbag cost?

656
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:57,239
Yeah, exactly.

657
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:02,614
And maybe that's the problem is we're so used to houses burning down.

658
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,094
We just can't imagine a house that doesn't burn down.

659
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:05,734
All right.

660
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:06,005
I,

661
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:09,535
I want to end this one on kind of a happy note and we've run ourselves out of time

662
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:10,494
and I feel like we're not going to add

663
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,704
anything of value to this conversation at this point.

664
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,285
What a, what a strange topic.

665
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:16,094
It's always funny we go into some of these things like, oh,

666
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:17,155
that sounds really interesting.

667
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:20,724
-- And at the end I'm like, oh, I feel depressed.
-- That was depressing. I need

668
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:20,925
a drink.

669
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,574
But, but look, I think at the end of the day,

670
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:29,199
this is one of those situations where as professionals in this industry,

671
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,290
as humans in society, like

672
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,680
we it's OK to make demands, right?

673
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,920
It's easy to say, oh, there's nothing we can do.

674
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,839
There's always something we can do, it might not be super effective,

675
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,439
but

676
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,439
there's something you can do, right? And this is where

677
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:44,829
you know,

678
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,699
talking to politicians making sure you're like doing what you can at your job.

679
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,719
There's things we can't do.

680
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,949
I think educating people to the reality of this is very important because for

681
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,479
example,

682
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,140
this is like what Thomas was talking about where a

683
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,310
lot of these officials think open sources is this big

684
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,819
happy, healthy ecosystem

685
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,790
and some of it is like the Linux kernel. Absolutely A K

686
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,030
jillion people curl.

687
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,540
I think he's I know it's over 1200 developers was

688
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,849
the last time I saw him too on Mastodon.

689
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:11,760
God, I hate saying too,

690
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,420
I'm just gonna go anyway.

691
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,319
So he announced it on Mastodon and there are definitely there is that.

692
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,780
But then like your data with,

693
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,459
here's the long tail of like 100,000 N PM projects, you know, with 50 developers,

694
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,459
owning half of them.

695
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:27,189
All right, I'm gonna call this one. I

696
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:27,859
feel like

697
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,810
this is a conversation, I'm sure we will have again and it will never end.

698
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:34,739
So I have a parting thought that I think might help, which is

699
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,469
let's hope.

700
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,130
Let's all try to be better.

701
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:37,469
Yeah,

702
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,760
that's fair.

703
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,520
And if nothing else, at least be nice to each other.

704
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,260
Yeah,

705
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,290
that's the least we could do.

706
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,000
