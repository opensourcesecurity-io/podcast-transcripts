Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode number

1
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:11,970
37 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:12,810
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,930
How you doing, Kurt?

4
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,389
I am doing actually surprisingly awesome.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,000
Fantastic, man.

6
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,600
So this week, yeah, nothing exciting has happened so far, right?

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:26,600
Not really. I mean, there were those two kernel vulnerabilities, but honestly,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,200
-- you know, who cares?
-- No one will ever know because

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,900
because of vault seven,

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,389
which is way cooler than vault one through six. Right.

11
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,240
True. Yeah. Sadly, I've never played fallout.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:39,750
It's been

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,259
actually I, I just II, I know a fall out boy,

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,000
which I appreciate because do you know why he holds

15
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,060
his thumb up in the strange way he does?

16
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,610
So

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,389
I, I didn't know this. I, I think I learned this from Reddit one day. But

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,700
so the, the, the thinking is if you hold your arm out and you hold your thumb up

19
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:01,389
and if your thumb can cover the mushroom cloud,

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,269
you're far enough away from the nuclear blast that you won't die

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:05,790
if

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,150
it doesn't cover it, like you better get moving.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,699
But what if you have like those weird flat paddle thumbs?

24
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,379
You know, some people have those, like, weirdly flat thumbs.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,360
I, this is an estimate, I imagine.

26
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:19,900
Right.

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,139
And like, yes, if your thumb is the size of a dinner plate,

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,419
I'm sure the least of your problems is going to be the fallout from a nuclear blast.

29
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,900
Yeah.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,650
Well, it reminds me of, um, what was it called? I think it was, uh,

31
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:33,760
it was a,

32
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,620
it was a short range nuclear weapon but the launcher couldn't launch

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,050
-- the weapon far enough for the crew to kind of survive
-- whoops,

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,089
uh

35
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,550
you know, minor detail. Right. Yeah.

36
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:47,489
Well, I mean, I, I assume by the time you're using those kind of weapons,

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,069
that's the least of your concerns.

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,779
Yeah, that's probably fair. I

39
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,209
Yeah.

40
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:51,750
Yeah. Yeah,

41
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,430
you're right.

42
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,550
Yeah. So, yeah, so the big news this week Vault Seven.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,319
Oh man,

44
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,349
it's so,

45
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:04,959
so here's what I wanna do is I don't wanna dwell on

46
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,309
too many of the crazy details of this because there have been

47
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,919
numerous write ups that are much better than anything we could possibly do.

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,139
And

49
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,229
what I want to talk about is the fact that Vault Seven

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,910
convinces me beyond a reasonable doubt that

51
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,139
we now live in the Neuromancer universe.

52
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,500
I would agree and I would go one further than that cause

53
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:31,389
there's a really awesome comment here on hacker news I wanna read

54
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,259
but puts Vault Seven

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,880
in a, in a sort of it frames it in a way I would have never thought. Um But basically,

56
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,550
so this is from uh

57
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,270
this is on hacker news uh item 13810015.

58
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,929
from a po

59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,289
here we go in what is surely one of

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,940
the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory?

61
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,419
The CIA structured its classification regime

62
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,369
regime such that for most market valuable part of

63
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,289
vault seven

64
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,860
unquote the

65
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,820
CIA'S weaponized malware

66
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,199
implants and zeros listening posts LP and command and control systems.

67
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,500
The agency has little legal recourse.

68
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,279
The CIA made these systems unclassified.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,050
Why the CIA chose to make its cyber

70
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,050
arsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military

71
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,800
use do not easily cross over to the battlefield of Cyber war

72
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:27,059
to attack its targets.

73
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,660
The CIA usually requires that its implants communicate

74
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,490
with their control programs over the internet.

75
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,229
If the CIA implants,

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,339
command and control and listening post software were classified,

77
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,520
then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating

78
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:44,770
rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the internet.

79
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:45,979
Consequently,

80
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,399
the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying and war code unclassified.

81
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,139
The US government is not able to assert copyright

82
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,880
either due to restrictions in the US constitution.

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,860
This means that the cyber arms manufacturers and computer hackers can freely,

84
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:00,919
you know, basically, quote

85
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,460
unquote pirate these weapons if

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,699
they are obtained.

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,270
The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.

88
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,149
That's fascinating to me that's from the vault seven stuff.

89
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,639
Uh,

90
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,869
you know,

91
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,750
that sounds like a lot of legalistic. Mumbo jumbo. I mean, let's face it.

92
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:18,899
I

93
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,390
don't think it matters that much to be honest,

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,910
-- but it isn't,
-- but it puts an interesting light on this in that,

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,440
you know, for example, if you have a classified Zero Day,

96
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,179
well,

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,820
how do you use it online?

98
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,859
If it's classified, you would have to, it would have to, by definition

99
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,220
be able to be used on a non classified network,

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,559
the internet

101
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,260
and it might fall into the wrong hands

102
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,049
-- if they have an idea.
-- That's overly legalistic to me though because I mean,

103
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,220
-- let's face it.
-- Have you worked for the government

104
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,529
ever?

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,010
No, I never worked for the government.

106
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,410
There, there's,

107
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,970
they have their classified rules and they have all

108
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,750
these rules and all this stuff that happens,

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,040
but

110
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,959
there's still the realm of reality they exist in.

111
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,309
And I mean, I,

112
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,130
I'm sure this is very similar

113
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,109
to the transport of classified intelligence documents

114
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,549
which let's face it.

115
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:09,700
You know,

116
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,459
you see in the movies where you got like the guy with

117
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,709
the briefcase and the handcuffs and all that stuff because in reality,

118
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,880
you bet you a significant number of these documents are

119
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,709
literally transferred by like a dude with an envelope.

120
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,119
Most diplomatic pouches are just like literally a pouch

121
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,029
with a seal on it and like fedex,

122
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,170
right?

123
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:32,910
And, and I'm sure that that technically violates some obscure law, but in reality,

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,230
these guys have work to get done and they're gonna get it done.

125
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,690
I, whatever that,

126
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:42,309
ignoring the legal side of it. I've always wondered about this because,

127
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,519
you know, when I use some intrusion technique, like I break into a safe or something,

128
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,119
the actual technique is not necessarily, you know, exposed

129
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:51,510
as

130
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,239
-- easily.
-- I'm

131
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,440
gonna call this up. How many safes have you actually broken into

132
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,399
zero?

133
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,170
But basically what I'm saying is like there's a, I mean,

134
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,989
the reality is most people don't have good cyber defense,

135
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,619
they don't have

136
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:03,929
cyber

137
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:04,420
defense.

138
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,940
But the reality is if you know, by their nature, these digital things can easily,

139
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,779
you know, be cloned and copied.

140
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:18,209
Yeah, I mean, that's the nature of digital.

141
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,109
I mean, heck man, that's the nature of physical documents.

142
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,880
Once you write something down on a piece of paper, I mean, all,

143
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,589
all you need is another piece of paper and a pen

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,089
and you can copy the document. I mean, that's the reality of it.

145
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,700
Yeah. No, I'm curious about this because it's

146
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,070
the whole vault seven thing and, and apparently, uh, I mean,

147
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,899
you mentioned this earlier,

148
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,119
but apparently the majority of the stuff is not actually zero days or that,

149
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,850
-- you know, fancy schmancy.
-- That's my understanding is it's not zero days.

150
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:51,929
And, and the first thing I thought of when this all came out was, was Neuromancer.

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,230
And

152
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,959
if, if any of you out there listening, have not read the book Neuromancer.

153
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,540
I suggest you, uh, press pause right now

154
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,040
and go read the book

155
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:02,980
because

156
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,339
I, I'll probably, I,

157
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,739
-- I guarantee the first
-- chapter and then come back and finish the podcast,

158
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,859
-- be gone for a week.
-- You won't regret it. Just read the whole book and

159
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,750
I'm, I'm certain we're going to spoil it

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,589
and that's

161
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,089
whatever it doesn't matter. It's an old book. It was written in 1984.

162
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,109
If you haven't read it by now, you certainly should.

163
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:22,299
And,

164
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,029
but here's the thing I remember reading this way back in the day

165
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:26,989
and

166
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,260
one of the things that always stuck out to me is

167
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,989
they, they basically,

168
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,899
the main character is

169
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,390
case. I, I think it's,

170
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,739
and he, he buys like a, an exploit

171
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:38,350
from

172
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,670
the icebreaker. Exactly from, and I think he even said it was from China

173
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,070
and this thing, like, it builds itself up and it, it, it, you know,

174
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,480
he keeps watching it in cyberspace and, and it's turning into this huge thing and the

175
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,079
virus. Right. Right.

176
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,940
It goes to like it, it doesn't attack and, and you know, it, it,

177
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,920
what it breaks through the turning rules or whatever it is to let neuro.

178
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,519
So

179
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,420
turing was the agency in charge of uh

180
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,679
licensing and controlling a is and making

181
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,429
sure they didn't, like, wipe out humanity.

182
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,549
Well, I'm glad you remember this better than I do. But, but here's the point.

183
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,579
-- Here's the point. Right.
-- It's not always good. That I remember these things,

184
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,880
whatever, man. It's awesome.

185
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,190
So, but here's the deal, right? Is

186
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,929
I, I think about Neuromancer. I remember being like, that's not how exploits work.

187
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,779
You don't just buy an exploit from China

188
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,019
and then it,

189
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,290
it builds itself up into some giant

190
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,170
monstrous creature and then attacks the internet.

191
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,000
And now I'm like,

192
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,179
that's exactly the way it works.

193
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:33,950
You know, it's funny

194
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,340
because, I mean, nowadays we take, we take,

195
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,099
do you remember when Satan came out security analysis tool for networks?

196
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,419
-- And
-- it was 95 maybe? Yeah.

197
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,150
And it was like, literally the end of the world as we knew it like that.

198
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,099
I almost got sued. It was in, you know, it was

199
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:50,960
a, it was like

200
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,150
huge, it was a huge deal.

201
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,330
And of course, it's funny now because things like

202
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,010
mises and Metas

203
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,479
are just like, whatever, they're commercial products, who cares,

204
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,520
you know,

205
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,820
and even things like metas plait.

206
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,760
I remember when, you know, HD Moore came out with Meta,

207
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,469
it was like, oh my God, you know,

208
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,020
we're doomed because the bad guys are gonna

209
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,539
have this like tool that they're gonna like

210
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,039
rape and pillage the internet with and all that.

211
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,080
And it's like, and now it's just kind of like, yeah, whatever,

212
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,309
you know,

213
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,400
and, you know, I, I even uh

214
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:20,750
one of the 1st 1st commercial ones was uh core impact

215
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,080
and I actually went, you know,

216
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,070
um

217
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:28,340
down to Argentina and like wrote the documentation for it. And I was like, holy cow.

218
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:30,539
This is the best thing. And here's the funniest thing is like

219
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,840
their test servers keep, kept getting screwed up because they would, like,

220
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:34,609
they had the,

221
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,099
they had several different exploits and one of the

222
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,619
exploits was they could inject the exploit into the running

223
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,549
code of the process.

224
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,210
So there was like nothing that would show up anywhere

225
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,099
basically,

226
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:47,789
right?

227
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,340
Like it would,

228
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:51,659
it would compromise whatever service you compromised and like inject a bit of

229
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,190
shell code into it and then just happily like listen on port,

230
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,580
whatever it was and like take commands and stuff

231
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:00,080
and they had to reboot that machine every once in a while

232
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,909
because it just got kept getting so infested by the testers,

233
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,090
you know, and they couldn't get these things to die.

234
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:08,119
They just wouldn't, the shell code just wouldn't die.

235
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,479
There was no nice way to clean it out.

236
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,510
So they would just have to reboot this thing every day or two,

237
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,719
right?

238
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,489
And that's what really gets me is when you look at

239
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,219
some of these root kits and some of these other,

240
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,559
you know, tools,

241
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,489
how do you get rid of them?

242
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,210
Like how do you get them off of a running system nicely or even detect them?

243
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:29,090
But if you look at the requirements of these tools, like turning it off

244
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,090
isn't on the list, right?

245
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,400
I mean, once you get in, let's face it,

246
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:37,650
it runs till it's found and then turning it off isn't your problem.

247
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,809
And that leads to the second thing which is on something like, say a smart TV.

248
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,210
-- How the hell do I examine the system?
-- Right.

249
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,250
-- So,
-- actually the TV,

250
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,729
one is super interesting because I wanted to pick on

251
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:50,359
this and especially pick on you because you're very anti

252
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,760
smart TV. And I'm lazy and I connected my smart TV to the, it's

253
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,559
-- not that I'm
-- anti

254
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:58,400
-- smart TV, it's that they suck,
-- whatever it runs out.

255
00:10:58,469 --> 00:10:58,580
No,

256
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,479
not even security wise, I've seen the apps on these things. They're garbage.

257
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:01,989
They don't,

258
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,219
youtube takes like a minute to turn on

259
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,440
my smart TV. Runs Road.

260
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,349
And so it's awesome,

261
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,130
but here's the deal, here's the deal.

262
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:10,830
The TV

263
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,190
-- actually has a Roku built into it,
-- like it's built into it,

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,429
which is why I bought this particular TV.

265
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's the only one and, and that was

266
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,549
when I saw that I said

267
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm buying this and it's not even like one of the

268
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,150
fancy brands by any means. It's, uh, I think insignia is the name of it.

269
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,840
It's like, it's like one of best buys off brands, but

270
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:29,530
that Roku

271
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,429
built into it was that totally sealed the deal for me.

272
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,469
And I'm, I'm quite pleased with it actually all in all. Um, anyway, this,

273
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,989
if I could buy one honestly with an apple TV, built into it, I would buy that.

274
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. Same deal. Right. Anyway, anyway, so here's the deal

275
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:47,989
is the various things I read talking about smart

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,669
tvs and this Vault seven thing says that apparently

277
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,429
the,

278
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,750
the malware that targeted smart tvs didn't care

279
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,549
if it was connected to the internet or not

280
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:02,229
because it would just use the Wi Fi on the TV

281
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,630
to connect to something to X, fill the data later.

282
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,239
And so, like, even if

283
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,320
you don't have your TV connected to the internet,

284
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,119
it doesn't mean you're safe because there, it, it, it can connect to a Wi Fi

285
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,760
and it could be like, literally, you know, the,

286
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,919
the plumbing truck parked on the street

287
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,559
and, and it happens to be,

288
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,239
you know, an open access point

289
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,679
and full of not plumbing supplies.

290
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,200
It's getting better because honestly, by default, all the routers issued by, well,

291
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,039
the local IP S at least here in Canada by and large have, you know,

292
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,549
a password enabled on them.

293
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:36,669
Yeah.

294
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,989
-- Well,
-- you know, if you buy a router kind of in general now it comes with a password,

295
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,219
but it doesn't even matter if it has an open access point.

296
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,669
The fact is you could have the malware.

297
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:47,724
-- You have
-- a

298
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:48,205
drone.

299
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,594
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

300
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:49,664
You

301
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:50,375
have a drone with the Wi

302
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:52,005
-- Fi, the gums stick thing.
-- I mean,

303
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:57,135
let's face it if you have a piece of hardware and it has a Wi Fi radio in it

304
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:57,674
or

305
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:00,395
Bluetooth. Right. Any sort of radio, right?

306
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:05,044
Who basically have a means of XL now built into that device.

307
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,614
Where was that on? Um, remember that, um,

308
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,820
uh, phone radio hack?

309
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,900
There was, remember the be,

310
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,090
oh, hey, here we go was from two years ago. Wow.

311
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,690
Um,

312
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,390
so I was looking for at the Chaos computer conference in Germany,

313
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,520
they had a guy who basically managed to get like a, a normal IP speaker phone

314
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,119
to become a radio transmitter. Remember?

315
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:30,460
Um,

316
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,809
but here's the thing,

317
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:33,750
-- he
-- just bit

318
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,549
banged, uh, like an unused pin

319
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:38,539
to get it to listen.

320
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,530
Um,

321
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,520
but apparently also because here's a dirty little secret. Right.

322
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,280
All cell phones have an FM,

323
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,729
uh, chip set built into them. Remember, for the FCC emergency stuff or whatever?

324
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,320
Yes. Cell phones have amazingly versatile

325
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,099
S pr radios and

326
00:13:56,229 --> 00:14:01,479
apparently you can maybe sort of get them to listen outside the frequency

327
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:04,169
-- range of what they're supposed to.
-- I believe it.

328
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,869
Well, it's kind of like, have you ever, uh, there's these radios,

329
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,299
RT L something or other?

330
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,229
I have one at home.

331
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,710
I have a software to find

332
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,690
one of those. I have one of those

333
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:12,919
new

334
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,419
-- hicky. It's like a little USB key.
-- Right. Right.

335
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,669
-- Yeah,
-- I think I paid like 13 for mine from China.

336
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,669
Yeah, they're super cheap.

337
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,719
But here's the deal is there. They were, they're meant to be

338
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,169
essentially a television receiver for high def television.

339
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,849
And someone figured out one day that Hey, this is,

340
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:33,010
this is a radio that we can tune to this huge frequency range,

341
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,409
not just this narrow band that's used for television

342
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,489
and they're, they're super awesome.

343
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,729
Well, that's what gets me right.

344
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,450
It is just this classic thing of, like, well,

345
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,169
we could implement a control in hardware but that would cost money.

346
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,330
So let's just do it in software. Yeah. Right. Exactly. You know.

347
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,030
And so, yeah, all these,

348
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,010
all these quote unquote hardware radios are actually just like

349
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,010
a completely generic radio that can do pretty much anything.

350
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,630
And they just,

351
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,390
you know, well, that's, I mean, that's always been the classic problem in Linux.

352
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,630
Right.

353
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,049
All these Wi Fi drivers are binary blobs because they don't want people, like,

354
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,320
blasting out their transmitters at like, six watts or some, you know,

355
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:11,690
absurd amount of power or, you know, across wonky frequencies or,

356
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,150
you know, like in North America. Right. We have 11 Wi Fi channels.

357
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,049
Right. France. Yeah, France and Japan have like, what is it? 13 or something?

358
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,880
There's like two wars,

359
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:22,869
you know?

360
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,429
So, you know.

361
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,510
Yeah, I mean, you don't want people interfering with, like, the radios used by,

362
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know,

363
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,619
-- the police or whatever,
-- whatever, man. I,

364
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:32,340
yes,

365
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:32,979
anyway,

366
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,780
so we won't get into this.

367
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,059
-- But,
-- yeah. No, it's, it's, it is,

368
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,390
it is fascinating because

369
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,609
I think what it really boils down to is

370
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,169
ok.

371
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,070
If you have internet access there's, you can't, like,

372
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,119
data will be ex filtrated end of story.

373
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,159
And even without internet, it's still,

374
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,729
it's,

375
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,289
I mean, there was that article about, you know, using hard drive lights to flash

376
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,559
Morse code out.

377
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,289
Right. That's the thing, you know, you don't need

378
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,580
-- internet. I think the fact is that just
-- have the smart TV, show QR codes

379
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:03,030
and look

380
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,260
through the

381
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,039
-- windows
-- so

382
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,599
many ways to exel

383
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:06,789
data. I think

384
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,440
we've reached a point that if you're up to no good

385
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,820
and you have any sort of

386
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:15,940
electronic device in your possession,

387
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,770
you're in trouble.

388
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,809
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

389
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,609
Well, and I mean, this would be why, you know, the US and, well,

390
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:26,669
Western agencies in general have historically invested

391
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,409
a lot of money in tempest shielding

392
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,809
and, you know, things like skiffs, you know, what is it,

393
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,169
secure compartmentalized information,

394
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:33,539
uh,

395
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,760
whatever things which are basically to put it bluntly shielded

396
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,250
rooms where you can control what goes in and out

397
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,049
physically and electronically.

398
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,400
Um, but it's hugely expensive because I actually looked at doing it for my house

399
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,159
to keep my kids off the internet when they get older.

400
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,070
No, it's just, it's too expensive.

401
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,190
Excessive.

402
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,940
Well, it's just, you know, because the reality is four or five years.

403
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,650
Well, already today you could go to a pawn shop and buy a new smartphone for 10 bucks.

404
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,250
You can go to the store and buy a new smartphone for 10 bucks.

405
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,550
I think you need a credit card.

406
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,209
Can you use a prepaid credit card?

407
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,640
Uh, good point.

408
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,719
Yeah.

409
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,868
Anyways, but point being

410
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,719
is, it was more like, because, you know,

411
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,959
when you and I were kids we would read under the bed with like a flashlight.

412
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:21,138
Right.

413
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,739
That was our Wi Fi stealing. Yeah, exactly.

414
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:25,229
And our kids are going to be, like,

415
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,019
hiding under the bed with like an ipod or an ipad

416
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:31,619
or a whatever Samsung Galaxy seven that hopefully doesn't catch fire.

417
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:35,259
This is where I'll just hook up the directional SDR

418
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:37,458
their bedroom.

419
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:41,298
So I'll know if they're, they're using Wi Fi in the middle of the night.

420
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:46,218
But I mean, that's the thing like tempest shielding is incredibly expensive

421
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,660
and almost impossible to do correctly because even a

422
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,400
pinhole gap is enough to like leak radio signals.

423
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,760
-- Yeah,
-- it's complicated. It's not that

424
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:57,150
easy. So here's what we want to look at it. So

425
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,810
you have a microwave, right?

426
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,670
And you can see inside of your microwave, right

427
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:04,250
when it's on

428
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,290
and it cooks things

429
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,099
and what is protecting you from

430
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,050
boiling your eyeballs when you look inside your microwave,

431
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,319
-- the shield with the little perforated
-- holes and the small holes.

432
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,660
And so what it really comes down to is the, if,

433
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,459
if the whole size is smaller than the wavelength of the radio signal,

434
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,089
which let's face it, microwaves operate at like five gigahertz,

435
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,380
then

436
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,500
you won't die.

437
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:27,979
So it's

438
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,609
pinhole, it's more complicated than

439
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:33,260
-- fundamentally
-- when you talk about doors and windows and stuff.

440
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,119
Yes. Exactly. It's, it's hard to do. I'll agree with that.

441
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:39,939
Well, it's hard to do correctly and, I mean, I, like,

442
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,699
you know, you need window coverings, you need door gaskets,

443
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:44,000
you need all sorts of crazy stuff.

444
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,780
So, the reality is nobody's going to do it apart from the government,

445
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,579
-- you
-- don't have windows if you're in a room

446
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,500
that you care about this kind of stuff.

447
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,510
-- Well, that's not true. Uh
-- Like you don't have windows. If there are windows, that's

448
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,030
no, just don't use that room

449
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,430
like,

450
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,500
-- well.
-- So for example, here in Edmonton, we have a lovely brick

451
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,489
square cube down town, the central exchange

452
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,510
and it's got this lovely concrete thing over

453
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,430
the door with the old Edmonton Tell logo over

454
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:15,390
it and it's like such a big massive hunk of concrete and the logo is so deep,

455
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,500
they can't get rid of it even though the phone company changed name twice now.

456
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,060
And it's got

457
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,930
the building has these weirdly gold colored

458
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,689
windows that are like eight inches wide,

459
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,780
4 ft tall, roughly,

460
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,989
you know, and, and they're obviously shielded, right?

461
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:34,589
Ok. And it's more about, you know,

462
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,579
shielded. No, if, if you're dealing with

463
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,790
classified info,

464
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,890
you do not have a window because people can

465
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,829
look in the window and see what you're doing

466
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,089
like seriously

467
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:43,989
oval office,

468
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,050
the oval office is,

469
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
yes, it has windows. I'll agree with that. However, however,

470
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,390
however,

471
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,719
I will say that

472
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,800
-- the, the truly interesting class.
-- If you're

473
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,469
behind the oval office looking in the windows, we got bigger problems.

474
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:00,250
Yeah.

475
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,599
Right. Exactly.

476
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:02,160
It's,

477
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:06,819
and, and not only that, I, I don't know this for sure, but I would suspect

478
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,939
that

479
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:10,619
the layout of that room is

480
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,839
not a coincidence

481
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,380
and,

482
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:13,699
you

483
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,079
know, they gutted the White House in the 19 sixties. Right.

484
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,420
So,

485
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:19,729
they, actually, there's,

486
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:24,410
there's pictures of the White House with structural steel holding it up and

487
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,130
the inside is empty and there's people in bulldozers driving around it.

488
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,790
Yeah, they, well, so, uh, historically because I'm Canadian.

489
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,150
So, you know, the war of 1812,

490
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,250
the reason the White House is white is because the British sailed up the Potomac and,

491
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,920
you know, shelled it and burned it down.

492
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,890
So they painted it white when they redid it all.

493
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,760
So it got rebuilt then.

494
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,270
And like I said, in the 19 sixties,

495
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,729
I forget when I think it was Nixon or Ford or something.

496
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,119
But they basically, the, the concern was, you know,

497
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,250
if a nuke went off anywhere near that thing,

498
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,660
it would have collapsed and killed the president,

499
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,069
right?

500
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,660
Because it was like a really old building.

501
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,800
And so they literally gutted it,

502
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,810
like they put up structural steel to hold it up and they,

503
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:05,530
they gutted it and rebuilt it to like military, you know, standards,

504
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,280
right? And that was like 4050 years ago. So,

505
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,439
yeah, I mean, well, and no doubt you know,

506
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,300
it's not like they spared any expense because

507
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,060
it's the White House, like, obviously.

508
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,859
-- Right. Right. Exactly. It's, it's like Air Force one.
-- Right.

509
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:21,420
It's like this costs only $2 billion.

510
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,560
Right.

511
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,959
Yeah, White Hill Reconstruction was, oh, I lied. Sorry, it was in 1950.

512
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,819
And, yeah, there's a lovely picture on Wikipedia here of a bunch of guys,

513
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,729
like a bunch of dump trucks and bulldozers driving around the inside.

514
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:35,189
I did not know that.

515
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,199
Well, part of it too was the thing was actually, I mean, without a nuke,

516
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,319
it was going to fall down

517
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,560
as well.

518
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,079
So

519
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,359
there was also, you know, like it was,

520
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,599
well, it was,

521
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:45,800
I

522
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:49,079
mean, it, it got burnt down once already

523
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,319
100 years ago before that. So,

524
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:54,089
so

525
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,119
anyway,

526
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,589
we're talking about vault seven and classified

527
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,829
intelligence and the fact that it's,

528
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,109
it's impossible

529
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:02,869
to

530
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,300
prevent your data.

531
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,099
How do, well, even preventing that,

532
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,930
how do I even know the state of my cell phone or my smart TV?

533
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,109
You have no idea. In fact, that's something I was

534
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,739
about

535
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:15,579
dump the firm.

536
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,670
No goodness. No.

537
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:17,939
You know,

538
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:23,349
you can't and you own an Apple phone which makes it even worse than some of the others.

539
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,829
Not that I've given any better shape. I mean, let's face it.

540
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,060
Well, it's not only that one of, one of the challenges here as well is

541
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,469
I was reading that there are various news organizations reporting that

542
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:35,469
signal

543
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:39,290
and whatsapp encryption have been broken and in reality.

544
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,510
Right. Exactly. That's exactly right where

545
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:48,800
the, the, the apps and the encryption are fine,

546
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,400
they just attack the end points which let's face it

547
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,040
is the easy way to deal with that problem.

548
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,979
Oh, totally. I have a machine with a wireless keyboard.

549
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,510
If anybody ever sets up a, you know, radio sniffer,

550
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,270
they're gonna find out my login password.

551
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,880
And I don't, let's encrypt the data at least.

552
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,020
Ok.

553
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,939
Well, in fairness, I,

554
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,260
I actually looked for a keyboard that said they do

555
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,359
AES encryption and they supposedly do a s encryption.

556
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:18,579
But like, again, how, how do I verify this? How do I verify that they're using any

557
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:19,939
for all I know.

558
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:22,979
Yeah, they're doing a s encryption but every single one has the same key

559
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,979
because you'd have to have the dongle paired to the keyboard

560
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,420
and at the manufacturer they're gonna actually put a separate key on each of these,

561
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
like a $30 keyboard man.

562
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:39,069
Like, exactly. So, honestly, I'll tell everybody right now

563
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:44,650
the password to the unprivileged account on the Mac Me in my living room is password.

564
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,209
That's

565
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,520
a very bad. Why bother.

566
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,109
Uh Sure.

567
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:53,339
-- Yeah, I mean,
-- I,

568
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,180
I run,

569
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,180
you know, I,

570
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,319
what's the point of pretending to have a password?

571
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,239
But I'm transmitting it wirelessly all the time.

572
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,949
You just not have a password

573
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,699
on a Mac.

574
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:04,300
Um,

575
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,140
I guess I could have an auto log into something but it's just

576
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,739
I also want to be able to log in as my cell.

577
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,780
It's basically also my backup workstation in case my primary one, like,

578
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,280
catches fire or something.

579
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,310
So, there's like an unprivileged account that basically lets you do,

580
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,160
like youtube and VL, like, run the media player.

581
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,969
Right. Right. Ok. Interesting.

582
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,819
Well, it was either that or like, you know, set up a Plex box or something, but

583
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:27,900
that's a lot of work.

584
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,979
Yeah, exactly. Mac mini plug it in. Go,

585
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,339
you know what else is convenient when you buy a TV, with Roku built into it.

586
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,989
Oh, I mean, I used to live in the US.

587
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,300
That's right.

588
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,229
That's right. That's right.

589
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,150
So, and, and just, uh, you know, I

590
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,069
-- was
-- gonna, however, I will say

591
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,150
I can't like kinder eggs, which I think is the greatest crime

592
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,050
against

593
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,400
that. Goes back to a law from the 19 thirties

594
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,819
where you can't have a non-food item in a food.

595
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,300
And, you know, the worst thing is there is a kinder

596
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,060
egg quasi

597
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,010
equivalent that's allowed in the US.

598
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,790
And what they did is they have a plastic shell inside,

599
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,339
surrounded by chocolate

600
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,989
-- with a little plastic pig sticking out.
-- I know

601
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,189
-- I,
-- I've had them the,

602
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,410
the, I

603
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,989
-- hear that they are sadness personified.
-- The chocolate isn't near as good.

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,829
And the toys inside made me sad.

605
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:20,469
So it is not nearly as good. In fact, funny enough is,

606
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,109
uh, yeah. Anyway,

607
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,829
no kinder eggs. It makes me sad.

608
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:28,000
Well, and it's a $2500 fine per egg

609
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:31,969
to import them to the U si looked at sending you a

610
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:33,859
bunch but then when I found out what the fine was,

611
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,050
I decided not to.

612
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,420
That's, that's a risk you should be willing to take.

613
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,439
Well, II I can still send you squirrels.

614
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,699
-- Uh,
-- you can mail me

615
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:42,959
not African squirrels,

616
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,729
not African squirrels. That's right.

617
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:47,119
Yeah.

618
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,650
-- Right.
-- We're talking about vault seven or we're trying to

619
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,729
vault seven. Kind of reminds me of this whole Lius

620
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,780
curl thing. It's just like, yeah, it's bad.

621
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,270
But like, honestly, it's just another day at the office for us.

622
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:02,400
You know, I, I don't think you're wrong and this is where I come back to my,

623
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,719
we live in the Neuro Manta universe kind of view on all this is,

624
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:10,655
this is the way the world works now is

625
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:15,875
there's constant security issues, there's constant exploits,

626
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,574
there's constant leaks.

627
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:18,214
And

628
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:19,255
I would

629
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:20,474
say it's worse than that because

630
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:23,645
we've now entered a world where, like

631
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:26,125
the majority of my computers

632
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:31,474
are boot locked to some degree, for example, my iphone and my ipad.

633
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:37,119
Right. I, I can't like, stick in a SIM card or an SD card and boot it off of that.

634
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:38,500
Um,

635
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,479
you know, uh,

636
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:43,449
ignoring all of that, both A MD and Intel

637
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:47,599
CP us have like that binary blob thing, microcode stuff.

638
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,000
Um,

639
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,650
all my Wi Fi chip sets have a binary blob, all my cell phone chip sets have a binary blob

640
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,089
that can apparently be exploited via like wonky S MS

641
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,209
text messages,

642
00:26:59,319 --> 00:26:59,380
-- the
-- cell

643
00:26:59,869 --> 00:26:59,939
phone

644
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:02,704
crazier because most people don't realize.

645
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:07,145
But your cell phone actually has kind of two computers inside of it. Is there one?

646
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:09,064
Well, ok. Yeah, that's fair.

647
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:12,015
But there's, there's like the main computer you think of,

648
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:13,364
say I OS or Android

649
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:14,155
CPU

650
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:17,464
and then there's the, the baseband

651
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,425
processor, which is actually the thing that runs the cell phone radio

652
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:22,564
and that's,

653
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,944
those are like hideously exploitable is my understanding and things like

654
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:29,265
that text messages can actually kind of take them over.

655
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh, yeah. No, that's happened. That's been published.

656
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,699
I mean, we'll put in the show notes. But um

657
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,640
yeah, hang on, sir.

658
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:36,819
You gotta love it, man.

659
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,219
Uh Yeah, I mean just, oh jeez, that's sad.

660
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh

661
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,310
dear

662
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,859
Pack phone S MS Remotely.

663
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,780
-- Hello. It's called hellos spy
-- dot com.

664
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,790
And I would imagine Lord, it still works on many, many things. Right.

665
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,589
Well,

666
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,270
this is one of the reasons I will never buy an

667
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,819
Android phone in Canada because the carriers don't give freaking updates.

668
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:07,579
Uh No, they do not. Well, even in the US, it's really bad.

669
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:11,790
I mean, there's some of the phones like Samsung does. Ok.

670
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,030
I own a Nexus which is Google itself and in fact,

671
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,829
I don't get my updates through my carrier.

672
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,550
I get them directly from Google

673
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,609
and

674
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,459
you know, the, the big brands

675
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:22,670
do. Ok.

676
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,270
And then it's, it's bad once you kind of exit that sphere.

677
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:32,750
No, I'm looking at buying a couple of cheap tablets for just media players. Right.

678
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,609
Just literally to have something you can hold in your hand and watch a movie on.

679
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,800
I assume that I'm gonna,

680
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:43,020
-- whatever version I'm getting of Android is what I'm stuck with
-- probably.

681
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,319
And, you know,

682
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,040
just buy like the crappiest cheapest ones you can instead

683
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,270
of the guest wi fi network and who cares?

684
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,569
-- Pretty much.
-- Yeah,

685
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,400
that's, that's the only thing you can do. I mean, let's face it. It's,

686
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:55,920
and, and again, though,

687
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,359
we kind of bring ourselves back to this neuro mana

688
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,359
world now where you have these devices that were,

689
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,260
they're, they're, let's say five years old,

690
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,660
they haven't had security updates in forever.

691
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,569
And so, like,

692
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,579
the idea of buying a security exploit kit to

693
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,050
use against one of these things is totally plausible

694
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,180
because,

695
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,790
you know, there, there have been five years of security for

696
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,285
that now, work against this device.

697
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:21,734
I would disagree with that.

698
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:25,005
There's more than five years because they had security flaws when they were

699
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,094
created because the software, like,

700
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:30,484
it's not like you build software for a car in one day and ship it.

701
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:34,045
That stuff is like one or two years old by the time it's shipped.

702
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,765
Right. Absolutely.

703
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,925
Actually, what's really funny if you say that? And so

704
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:44,765
I was one of the lucky individuals to acquire a Nintendo switch on launch day.

705
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:45,604
And of course,

706
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:46,724
being who I am,

707
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,420
what's the first thing I do?

708
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,979
I go into the menu and look at the

709
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,380
licensing info that shows all the open source licenses

710
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,060
and all the things you're using and,

711
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:58,290
and for what it's worth, uh, this, this is well known now,

712
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,020
but it runs free BS D and it's got uh free Bs D.

713
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,489
Yeah, it's got free BS DC

714
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,329
notices all over the place.

715
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:06,525
But here's the other interesting thing though,

716
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:10,665
if you look at a lot of these other libraries, it's using like Lib PNG, for example,

717
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,944
or Lib XML or whatnot.

718
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:18,545
Well, that's the thing. The copyright notices are all from like, 04 and 09.

719
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:20,545
And I don't think there were very many that were

720
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:22,035
in 2010.

721
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,729
But here, here's what I wonder.

722
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,790
Right is, are they actually using old versions of the software?

723
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:31,660
They are? And I'm sure they are. And that makes me sad. Or

724
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,060
the,

725
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,520
the thing I'm hoping they do is they just happened to download

726
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,489
the old copyright notice using an updated version of the software.

727
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,250
How don't ruin the

728
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:42,550
stream

729
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:43,510
card, don't ruin it.

730
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:44,770
Ok. Ok.

731
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,540
So what they,

732
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,670
what,

733
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,729
what probably happened is when the lawyers were reviewing the copyrights,

734
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:51,930
they made a Typo

735
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:56,839
and it was probably from 2017. But they, you know, it's just, that's probably,

736
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,449
-- so,
-- you're, you're ok, you're

737
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,170
all right.

738
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:01,979
-- So,
-- the good news is,

739
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:04,800
I guess that means there's a good chance we can jailbreak these things because

740
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,079
that's one of the things holding me back from buying a wii U is I was like, you know, I,

741
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:10,439
I google like wii U jailbreak and it's like what?

742
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:11,675
Actually, you know, it's

743
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:16,594
funny if you talk about that and Nintendo has a bug bounty on the switch. So if you find

744
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:17,755
a way to jailbreak it,

745
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:20,944
you can acquire yourself some money.

746
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,425
-- How much do they
-- pay? I don't know. I don't think it's terrible,

747
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:24,994
but

748
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:28,994
is it less than those guys in China or whatever would pay you?

749
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:32,354
I, are there guys in China shelling out for

750
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:33,055
switch?

751
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:37,074
Oh, dear. $100 minimum bounty

752
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:38,395
or Nintendo?

753
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:39,439
Yeah. I'm just looking

754
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:41,770
at the page 100 bucks minimum bounty.

755
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:43,969
-- That's it.
-- That's the only number given.

756
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,869
Well, look at like Tavis, I mean, Tavis Ormon, he finds like,

757
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,869
literally the worst damn bug on the internet ever.

758
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,300
It's like everything that's ever been through Cloer

759
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,750
May or may not have been exposed and we don't know.

760
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,910
And he might at best qualify for a

761
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,910
t-shirt.

762
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,810
I hope they sent him a t-shirt.

763
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:03,930
I hope they send him a,

764
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:09,880
like a truck full of t-shirts or a house shaped like a T shirt because

765
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:11,510
like, seriously.

766
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,810
Oh, interesting. Arm 11 and Arm Nine

767
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,829
Kernel and user land takeover

768
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,329
or the switch.

769
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,290
Yeah. So it's got an arm nine and an arm 11.

770
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,229
Kernel. Well, that actually makes sense. Right.

771
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,380
Because you got the handheld part and the dock part.

772
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,770
Well, no, I thought the dock part was only like, literally just a pass through

773
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,260
like the, the, the, uh,

774
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,770
the circuit board and it was like an inch square or something ridiculously tiny.

775
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,729
That could very well be.

776
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:40,589
I know when I, I called the toaster, which if you've never seen before,

777
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,329
it looks like you're putting it in the toaster.

778
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,180
And I,

779
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,459
I think my kids are almost on board with this

780
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:47,489
and I figure eventually I'll brainwash them to the point.

781
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,160
They won't know any better. But regardless of that is,

782
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,000
yeah, when you dock it, it, it works as a handheld

783
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,380
and you dock it and it obviously shows up on the TV at that point.

784
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,060
But my, my understanding is the, the toaster

785
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,099
doesn't have anything in it and it

786
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:05,339
basically is just passing everything straight through.

787
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,229
And the other thing that's interesting is

788
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,420
when you're holding it in your hand,

789
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:14,449
it, it obviously reduces performance a little bit in whatever you're doing with it.

790
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,599
But when you dock it, it actually has a fan inside of the switch and you can feel the,

791
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,719
like it gives off a lot of heat.

792
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,810
So they're obviously like, they're cranking something to

793
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,410
it down right when you plug that sucker in doing

794
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:26,569
it.

795
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,569
No, it's, it's,

796
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,510
-- that's smart.
-- Yeah. Yeah,

797
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,180
it is.

798
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,180
That's one thing that gets me about Nintendo. Right.

799
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:38,010
Their build quality historically has been amazing. Like my Nintendo, we

800
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:42,599
um I bought it a year after it came out in 2006. So I bought it in 2007.

801
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:46,050
So 10 years ago played with it for a little while, then put it in a box

802
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:51,180
and it's been in a box in the basement, in the garage in a bunch of places,

803
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:52,250
pull it out,

804
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,369
plug it in.

805
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,699
Uh I had to actually on Amazon buy like a

806
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:59,489
little adapter for whatever Wonky Nintendo thing to HDMI.

807
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:03,800
-- I plug it in. Boom. It just works. But
-- you have your, your Wii U

808
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,410
or your regular Wii plugged into HDM. I

809
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,020
Yeah, it's like a, it's like a $10 adapter you can buy on Amazon for it.

810
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,070
Just go to Amazon and Google like Nintendo wii HDM. I, and it's like this little $10

811
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,699
thing from China. Like, I don't know, it just works.

812
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,639
I, I only had mine doing what RGV video,

813
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,478
but

814
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,010
-- it
-- looks like you're watching like a VCR on the TV.

815
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,350
Like it's, it is hysterically terrible. Like,

816
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,504
you know, like, well, no, no, no, it's, it's no, it, it is the, I mean, the,

817
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:34,114
that poor little Wii is putting out all the pixels.

818
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:34,725
It can,

819
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,284
it's just, it was designed in a day and age where, you know,

820
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:42,705
the number of pixels on a TV could be like, counted by a human being in an afternoon

821
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:46,764
because I think the wii by default only does like, what, 480 P.

822
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:50,054
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well, it was designed for, like, C RT S.

823
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:51,324
Yes.

824
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,168
Right.

825
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,330
And so, yeah, you hook it up to like a 40 or 50 inch TV. And it's like, whoa.

826
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,739
Yeah, let's stand back a little bit and squint.

827
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,459
Actually, I haven't done that before. I,

828
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,659
-- that's awesome.
-- I don't think I want to. Although, you know what?

829
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,419
I have a, I think it's a 40 some odd inch TV.

830
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:10,510
And I hook,

831
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,739
-- we
-- don't even know how big our

832
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,620
-- teams are. Like,
-- who cares? It's big enough, right? It doesn't matter.

833
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:21,830
Uh I, I hooked up my nes, my Nintendo entertainment system to it some months ago and

834
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,510
the games look hilariously bad

835
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,840
-- when you plug them in.
-- Well, the funny thing is you actually need,

836
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:33,929
uh, and you can buy these, you can get these filters for like opening moon stuff

837
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:40,639
to essentially the, the old consoles used the pixel layout on the C RT s

838
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,040
to their advantage.

839
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,429
And so you actually have to have like a filter.

840
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,709
That sort of, I don't want to say down samples it, but sort of

841
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:50,750
shift samples that I guess would be maybe the word, I forget what the word is,

842
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:52,100
but essentially it

843
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,159
mangle

844
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:57,439
because the pixels on an L CD and the pixels on AC RT are, are different,

845
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:58,510
right?

846
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:01,399
And so it kind of mangles it. Uh But I'm just looking here.

847
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,489
Um, yeah, here's the one I bought. So dial we to HDM I converter 40 P,

848
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,270
uh,

849
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,550
$6.90

850
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,540
big spender. So, actually, you know, you mentioned the, the C RT thing and

851
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,699
have you ever seen, do

852
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,280
you remember CG A graphics from back in the day?

853
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,419
-- They were like, always like pink and blue,
-- right?

854
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,449
-- Managed to skip straight to V
-- G A.

855
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,879
But here's the deal. Ok.

856
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,389
So

857
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,379
anyone who remembers CG A,

858
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,070
they were hideous. But they weren't though, here's the deal. They weren't,

859
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,780
they weren't. And I'll, I'll put a link in the show notes.

860
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,379
There's this guy on youtube called,

861
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:37,800
I think he's called himself the eight bit guy or something like that.

862
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,280
And

863
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,300
anyway, so, so

864
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,540
CG A graphics relied on analog signals into AC RT.

865
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,649
And so when you, when you combine the colors in bizarre ways,

866
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,459
they actually look really nice. But when it's a purely digital signal as it was,

867
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,219
it's, it's pink and blue and it looks like,

868
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,820
and it's really crazy

869
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,580
to see how these, these obviously, you know,

870
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,389
designers utilize these bizarre nuanced

871
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,939
qualities of AC RT screen.

872
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,250
Well, it was like, um, I forget which video game it was,

873
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,169
but all the sound files were just random chunks of memory

874
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,010
that sound good when you played it through a speaker.

875
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,040
I, well, I, I know on the Atari

876
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,320
you were saying that Y

877
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,169
is revenge, I think is the name of it but anyway, we, we're in the weeds

878
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:26,750
we're

879
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:27,080
talking about.

880
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:28,780
Well, but here's the reality, right.

881
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,800
This stuff matters about as much as this vault seven in the sense of, like, like

882
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,120
this stuff is full of, it's, it's all, you know,

883
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,439
it's all flaws all the way down.

884
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,979
Why,

885
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,379
why are we surprised?

886
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:42,850
Yeah.

887
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:44,750
You know, it's like this week.

888
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,429
Oh, look, there's, uh,

889
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:50,590
I actually pulled up the emails in case I have to reference them.

890
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,010
And then I think I closed the tabs because quite frankly, who cares

891
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:56,020
to put it bluntly, like,

892
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:59,580
go to OS S security and like search for Linux kernel

893
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,239
and there's one for 4.5 and up and there's one for

894
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,250
some other version,

895
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:07,169
it's like a local exploit to root and it's like,

896
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:09,610
uh OK,

897
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,469
that

898
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:11,000
happens.

899
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:14,570
Here's the thing and this is what I wonder about a lot is

900
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,250
if this is the new normal

901
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
and I think it is

902
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,560
-- like, what is that?
-- How

903
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,810
-- is it gonna change?
-- Right.

904
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,689
-- What, what?
-- Right.

905
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:27,870
I mean, are things ever going to get better? And I, I'm, you know, the optimist in me

906
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:32,090
believes there's always hope and things are certainly going to get better.

907
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,780
There is because, ok, we'll have to put this in the show notes.

908
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,780
But uh this is an amazing page. Um, chrome

909
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:38,639
security

910
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:38,949
breaks.

911
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,010
Um

912
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,010
There is a security breaks sheet from the Chromium project.

913
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:44,550
Yes, I

914
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,600
read that the other day.

915
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,169
Yeah,

916
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:48,270
it's pretty damn impressive.

917
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,189
Now, I think the reality is something like, for example, chrome or the lungs kernel

918
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:56,540
will never be correct and it will always have security flaws,

919
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,600
but

920
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,879
we can deal with that. We can work around that.

921
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:02,479
We can do things like sand boxing, we can do things like,

922
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:06,439
you know, antivirus and ad filtering and stuff to minimize

923
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,800
the chances of getting nasty stuff

924
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,830
and then building with failure in mind.

925
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,679
So like, you know, assuming that at some point,

926
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:15,439
some horrible content is gonna come in and hijack it, you know,

927
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:17,669
do sandbox and do you know,

928
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:21,360
demarcating the system into, you know, various chunks, you know,

929
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:22,679
and

930
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,600
that is the new normal, right? Like the new normal is things like cus

931
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,820
programming where you like actually break up

932
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,409
your program into a bunch of like little

933
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,370
cus chunks

934
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,570
with well defined interfaces

935
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,679
that, you know, if an attacker manages to get through hopefully one layer,

936
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,620
they can't get any further, you know,

937
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,909
because the reality is like the Linux kernel is, is never going to get simpler.

938
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,969
-- It,
-- it is not, it will

939
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:47,010
make it worse.

940
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,620
Chrome or the Linux kernel

941
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:51,750
are

942
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:55,219
very high profile projects that let's face it

943
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,419
have really smart people working on them.

944
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,239
And so I think they're in a different league

945
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:03,939
and let's face it even like we can even pick on the kernel.

946
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:06,699
Like the kernel has some of the smartest people in the

947
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:09,820
world working on it and it still has lots of problems.

948
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,610
Well, I mean, my hope is, and this is why I love open source.

949
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,979
My hope is is that these guys in China were not making stuff

950
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,489
rather than build it in house or whatever.

951
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,540
We'll simply like, oh,

952
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,659
let's go download the latest version of Busy Box and keep it up to date.

953
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:26,010
Now. Obviously, they're not keeping it up to date,

954
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:27,510
but that's my hope.

955
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,530
Why would they do that? Why should they care? And let's pick on Busy Box, right.

956
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,489
Busy Box

957
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,510
is a phenomenal piece of software, but it is not built for security or failure.

958
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,290
For the most part, it does what it's supposed to do

959
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:44,889
by stripping out tons of functionality and I'm sure plenty of error checking.

960
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,159
And so how do we expect that

961
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,080
to have any sort of resilience built into it?

962
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:51,840
Well,

963
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,419
so here's the problem that boils again down to

964
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:57,199
that economic problem of why would I spend money

965
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:00,189
maintaining a product for which you are not paying

966
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,810
like a subscription for it, like you paid for it once I shipped it to you, ha ha.

967
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,219
Right.

968
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,340
You,

969
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,100
you know,

970
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,090
so that's, that actually leads nicely into.

971
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,550
There was, uh there's a guy on, on Twitter, I follow Jeremiah Grossman. We uh

972
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:19,739
we, we met him at RS A, actually, he was a guy from Sentinel one that we talked to,

973
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,860
talked about cybersecurity insurance at the speaker dinner.

974
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,199
And

975
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,189
in any way, he, he put a thing on Twitter today that basically said

976
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:29,870
the the cybersecurity industry is something like $75 billion.

977
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:31,040
And

978
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,629
I think 1 billion is spent on

979
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,239
securing the software,

980
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,919
but secure insecure software is basically the problem,

981
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:39,679
right?

982
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:40,840
And so

983
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,719
how do we fix that incentive?

984
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,860
And

985
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,530
like, honestly, I

986
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:46,570
don't know,

987
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,000
like I can't even think of anything that isn't just

988
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,600
like made up crap to even try to address this.

989
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,649
Well, see part of my, my thought process is, you know,

990
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,129
for example, looking at engineering,

991
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:01,209
there are seven ways to build a bridge.

992
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,929
That's it, seven ways,

993
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,709
-- right? There's seven
-- kind of,

994
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,989
there's a right way and the wrong way.

995
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,649
But like fundamentally engineering is like there's seven ways to build a bridge,

996
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,310
then there's a bunch of different concretes and steels and materials

997
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,209
that have certain properties that are well understood and documented.

998
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:22,090
And when they're not like a great example, being carbon fiber, carbon fiber,

999
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,969
we think it's awesome.

1000
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:23,459
But you know,

1001
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,020
Boeing wants to make an airline out of this stuff.

1002
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,229
Well, what happens when it constantly cycles through?

1003
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,929
But they spent an obscene amount of money making

1004
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:36,139
-- sure it wouldn't like fall apart
-- because they can't

1005
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,100
test it with people inside.

1006
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,479
Yeah, exactly.

1007
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,750
So that's the difference, right?

1008
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,810
Is like Boeing can take a new material,

1009
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,060
put it through like say 10,000 pressurization cycles and be like, oh OK, it works.

1010
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,820
But with software, you know,

1011
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,979
we're literally dealing with stuff where it's like five years from now.

1012
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:54,729
It's not that what I built today is obsolete,

1013
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,300
but the entire, like

1014
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:59,209
ecosystem of that thing is obsolete.

1015
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,139
So I'm going to compare this. I'm sure inappropriately

1016
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:04,840
to bridges.

1017
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:05,820
And

1018
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,550
if you look at, when they built bridges, let's say, in the 14 hundreds,

1019
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,419
I'll just pull that number out of flying out of my behind

1020
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:14,439
and

1021
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:18,120
like, like, think about those bridges, how many of them lasted for five years?

1022
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:19,399
Probably not very many.

1023
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:22,419
I'm sure many of them killed lots of people and they were just

1024
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:26,560
like literally a dude piled some stuff up until they crossed the river.

1025
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,699
And then he said, there's the bridge it's done.

1026
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,760
-- And
-- there's a perfect example.

1027
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:34,389
The Roman, you know, army had engineering that was amazing to this.

1028
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:38,040
You know, they've built piers and bridges and roads but stand to this day.

1029
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,540
But, you know, again,

1030
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,770
they had a very limited set of designs and

1031
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,550
a very limited set of well understood materials.

1032
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:47,629
The Romans because they did it right.

1033
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,340
And we're going to think about

1034
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,030
what is the difference between a bridge built in

1035
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,510
the 14 hundreds in a bridge built today.

1036
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:56,540
Yeah.

1037
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:58,810
No, no, seriously answer the question.

1038
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:03,739
So part of it would be materials, part of it would be actually having a plan,

1039
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,050
a

1040
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,290
-- plan
-- because you could build a bridge today

1041
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:10,350
with the same materials they had in the 14 hundreds. Ok.

1042
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,969
So let's take materials out of this.

1043
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,469
-- So what's the part
-- of it would be having measurements and plans?

1044
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,780
Like you literally could write down a plan for this thing?

1045
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,280
Well, that's part of it, right? Is the fact that like

1046
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,469
there are rules

1047
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,939
and there are designs and there are expectations around

1048
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:29,669
these engineers and not only that the engineers actually,

1049
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:33,439
like if you're, if you're a civil engineer and you build a bridge and it falls down,

1050
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:36,239
you get in trouble and you might not be an engineer anymore.

1051
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,540
Well, even more to the point is, um, there's the whole concept of, um, so I worked for,

1052
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,620
uh, an electrical firm for a while that did industrial electrical.

1053
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,020
And there was the concept of, we have a blueprint

1054
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:49,750
and we have the US built plans

1055
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,780
because the reality is when you're building like an oil refinery or something,

1056
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,429
you know, and this is like 20 years ago.

1057
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:59,100
So we didn't have the fancy, uh, biff, you know, software that we have now.

1058
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:01,379
But essentially you'd be trying to build something.

1059
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:04,469
You'd be like, oh, there's like a concrete support in the way or, oh,

1060
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,429
somebody put like a mash tank here.

1061
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:07,530
Why did they do that?

1062
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,350
And so you'd essentially have a set of blueprints that said, like, you know,

1063
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,600
from here to here, you have to like, have this cable and it's like, no, we're,

1064
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,229
we're gonna have to run around this thing or through this duct or whatever.

1065
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,290
And that would be documented.

1066
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,899
So you'd actually end up with a set of blueprints called the US Built Plans,

1067
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,850
which were literally, it's like, well,

1068
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,010
we had a set of blueprints that told us how to build it.

1069
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:31,280
We mostly followed them. Here's the actual blueprints of what we ended up with.

1070
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,689
Right.

1071
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,969
And that, that in itself is a huge step for us because now, you know, 10 years from now,

1072
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:39,600
some poor schmuck is looking at what was built and it's like,

1073
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:41,169
what is this?

1074
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,969
You know, why is this thing here?

1075
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:46,010
Like you and your window that opens?

1076
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,620
Right. Right. And, and

1077
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,820
no one knows what that means.

1078
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,610
So

1079
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,889
I am,

1080
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,620
I'm actually in San Francisco right now at,

1081
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,290
at the Marriott Marquis down by the Mosconi

1082
00:45:58,739 --> 00:45:59,360
and

1083
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:05,149
I'm on the 26th floor of the hotel and the window in my room actually opens like

1084
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:08,760
I could open the window and like hang out and wave at people or something or,

1085
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,899
or throw things or whatever.

1086
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,760
I just, I still think I, I still want pics or something because I don't, honestly,

1087
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,840
my brain can't believe

1088
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:15,280
it.

1089
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,239
I can't really care for heights a lot.

1090
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,600
So I'm like not opening this window and you'll just have to take my word for it.

1091
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,790
I basically like I looked at it,

1092
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,510
I thought this window looks like it opens and I

1093
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,320
opened it like just a teeny crack and said,

1094
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,909
yep, it opens and then I closed it and that, that's enough and just knowing it does,

1095
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:31,669
that is terrifying enough for me as it is.

1096
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:36,189
Well, it's funny because I told a friend and, and they were like, what?

1097
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,469
And I'm like, exactly, that's what my brain did.

1098
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,199
I

1099
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:39,969
agree.

1100
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,419
This seems like unnecessarily dangerous to me because

1101
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,699
the thing I keep thinking of is

1102
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:48,729
like, I could see

1103
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,830
somebody doing something dumb and managing to fall out

1104
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,379
of the window and obviously on the 26th floor,

1105
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,050
you're not going to have a good,

1106
00:46:58,379 --> 00:46:59,189
uh, any fall.

1107
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,300
Well, once, once you hit 20 ft, your risk of death hits 50% and that's 20 ft.

1108
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,290
That's two stories.

1109
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:06,199
Yeah.

1110
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:07,250
Yeah,

1111
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,760
you don't have to fall far to kill yourself.

1112
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,850
-- Yeah,
-- that's, I guess, I mean, I never really

1113
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,139
-- and kill
-- themselves. That's true. Your bathtub is more dangerous than sharks,

1114
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:16,600
right?

1115
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,699
-- What about sharks in your
-- bathtub?

1116
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:21,030
Could a shark?

1117
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,070
I bet any shark that would fit in your bathtub is probably not very dangerous.

1118
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,879
Let's face it.

1119
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,969
I'm, I'm just gonna guess. I, I don't know.

1120
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:29,070
But,

1121
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:33,600
yeah, whatever. Anyway. Yes. Uh, don't keep sharks in your bathtub

1122
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,979
unless you're a zoo or advice for the day.

1123
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:39,110
Even if you're a zoo, you should probably have a proper place to keep the sharks,

1124
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,570
right?

1125
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,770
Not in the bathroom in this,

1126
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,209
this podcast is getting unnecessarily silly.

1127
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:47,879
Oh, man. Ok. So here's, let's, let's bring it home

1128
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,189
this, this vault seven thing, I guess. This is,

1129
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,620
this is the world we live in now and,

1130
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:57,959
and that's really the only commentary I have on this is

1131
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,659
right or wrong. Yes or no.

1132
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,860
Whatever you want to think about it like this is just the way it is.

1133
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:05,530
There's, there's not a lot you can do about it and,

1134
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:07,250
and I guess at the same time what

1135
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,489
the security industry,

1136
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,790
what we need to do now is we need to start thinking about things

1137
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,709
in that context, not,

1138
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:17,020
we're gonna keep the bad guys out or we're gonna stop this or we're gonna stop that.

1139
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,270
But rather

1140
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,939
there are adversaries with

1141
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:25,860
impressive arsenals of exploits and problems.

1142
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,060
And so we have to decide

1143
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,090
what does that mean for us,

1144
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,760
how do we design systems to be robust against this versus

1145
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,489
the historical view of let's design systems that don't have flaws,

1146
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,649
which we know is just totally ridiculous.

1147
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:40,600
Yeah.

1148
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:41,060
So I was,

1149
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:45,050
I was recently dealing with a customer that basically their security posture was

1150
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:46,409
everything's been hacked.

1151
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,459
So like, how does your,

1152
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:50,649
how does your product deal with somebody having like

1153
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:53,229
rude access on the file system or how does

1154
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,449
your product deal with somebody having like gained administrative access to it?

1155
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:57,600
And it's kind of like, uh

1156
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,620
you know,

1157
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,159
um but fundamentally, uh from today

1158
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,250
related to this poachers break into paras,

1159
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,020
shoot Rhino

1160
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:05,729
Steal

1161
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:06,010
Horn.

1162
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:06,860
That's

1163
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,320
crazy.

1164
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,350
So here's the reality that Horn was apparently worth about 60 $70,000 us.

1165
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,030
I'm guessing most tech companies have some data,

1166
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,060
relatively,

1167
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:19,800
uh,

1168
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,860
easily to monetize

1169
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:25,010
-- to that amount of money.
-- Oh, at least, at least,

1170
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:25,620
you know, it's,

1171
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:26,600
it's like the,

1172
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:31,419
-- it's
-- gonna be less dangerous to ex fill that than it is to break into a Frein

1173
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,439
zoo and shoot a rhino.

1174
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:34,290
Yeah.

1175
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,899
Well, it's like that, uh, the, the largest bank robbery in, um,

1176
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,209
what was it? The, uh, the Ireland

1177
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:42,899
where they basically kidnapped the guy's family and gave him a choice, like,

1178
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:45,850
either, you know, clean up the bank or say goodbye to your family.

1179
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,129
Well, I know I'm cleaning out the bank

1180
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:49,520
in

1181
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:49,979
a

1182
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:51,760
minute.

1183
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:55,399
So, you know, that's the thing, right?

1184
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:55,560
Is,

1185
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,649
is how do you design a system that

1186
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:00,469
potentially you have adversaries where it's like whatever,

1187
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:02,429
we'll just spend a million bucks finding a flaw

1188
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,330
or we'll spend $100,000 bribing one of your key employees

1189
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:08,570
or

1190
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:11,139
spend $100,000 blackmailing one of them

1191
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:12,580
or

1192
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:12,979
them

1193
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,209
for 20 grand.

1194
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,899
I bet you could threaten them for five grand

1195
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:20,570
or free.

1196
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,679
Yeah. You know.

1197
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:24,889
Um, but yeah, I mean, that's the reality is how do you, you know?

1198
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,889
So I, I'm one thing I'm seeing in the cloud, for example,

1199
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,820
is they're talking about having systems where, you know,

1200
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,179
one person has access to the, uh,

1201
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,659
like SSH key,

1202
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:35,949
but the other person has access to actually like the passphrase

1203
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:37,520
on it or whatever and has to type it in,

1204
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,030
you know, and you have like, a dedicated laptop for this or whatever.

1205
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,709
I've, I've heard of such things and that might be part of the story.

1206
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:45,959
I, I don't think we know. Right.

1207
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:49,199
I, I think the reality is things like that are such a pain in the butt.

1208
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:50,370
Nobody's gonna do them.

1209
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,219
Are you kidding me? Well, not.

1210
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:56,760
Yeah, you're, well, ok. Our, our current tools today make them a pain in the butt.

1211
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:57,189
It's,

1212
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,790
anyway, anyway, let's,

1213
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:03,110
we will discuss this another day.

1214
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,709
-- I think, you
-- know what reminds me of his bank robberies is which in general is,

1215
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,030
we've made them difficult enough that they generally don't work.

1216
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:12,739
But if you come up against somebody who's

1217
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:17,419
sophisticated enough or desperate enough and stupid enough, it will work.

1218
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,409
-- But not for a lot of money.
-- I think we discussed this at some point.

1219
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:22,179
I don't think we did on the podcast, but there's,

1220
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,919
there's a significant number of bank robberies every day.

1221
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:25,870
-- They just,
-- but if

1222
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,280
you look at how

1223
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:27,889
much money they get away with, it's kind of,

1224
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:32,364
that's the thing. Ok. And that's the thing and, and that's another story and

1225
00:51:32,604 --> 00:51:36,215
we will discuss that another day. I think it's, it's time to go. Kurt.

1226
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:36,955
We've,

1227
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:38,925
we've been down way too many red holes and

1228
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:41,985
wasted far too much of our viewers precious time.

1229
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:45,125
So, thank you everyone for listening. I appreciate it.
