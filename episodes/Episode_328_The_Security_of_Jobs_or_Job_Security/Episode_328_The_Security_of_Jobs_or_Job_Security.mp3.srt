Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,439
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:14,420
So, what's new? Well, apparently we're headed into a recession.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,270
-- So we're going to talk about job security. I
-- mean, is, is that ok?

4
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:22,569
So for anyone who's been listening to the podcast for a while every now and then,

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,930
Kurt likes to add a topic that he won't tell me what it means or what it is

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,870
and

7
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,180
I oblige,

8
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,579
but then by the end,

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,650
I'm usually telling him we're never doing this

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,020
-- again and
-- then I wait about three months

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,970
against my better judgment.

12
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,330
I've let Kurt do this and

13
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,540
I don't understand what the, the title Job Security Has Security in the title,

14
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,880
which I think is

15
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,299
progress compared to some past topics.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,650
But I,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,479
I know as little as the listener at this point about what's going on,

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,099
which is concerning to me in, in bad ways.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,439
Well, and that's kind of the point is,

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,229
is none of us know what the economy is going to do.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,130
Even the people that

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,199
say that they know what the economy is going to do.

23
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,639
I, I will agree with that statement.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,949
So we're going to talk about job security, both in the sense of job security,

25
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,760
but also in the sense of job security, the security of jobs.

26
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:20,480
So, well, basically, so if the last week has been pretty brutal,

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,199
like Elon Musk announced they're firing or sorry, not firing,

28
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,800
laying off or whatever, downsizing,

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,430
-- um, 10% of their salaried staff Coinbase is getting rid of 11% of their staff.
-- So 18%

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,129
sorry,

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,500
sorry, I was thinking of another one.

32
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,190
Anyways,

33
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:41,379
there's a whole pile of tech companies that have uh instituted hiring freezes.

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,410
According to this Yahoo article,

35
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:47,290
the uh Bloomberg story count for with the term hiring freezes.

36
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,330
Uh

37
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:53,029
Normally it's about 2, 300 a month with like a massive spike at the beginning of COVID

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,370
and then it

39
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,019
like so starting like that April

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,309
and then, you know,

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,610
like sharply comes back down and settles out and then with

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,430
uh this month it's uh spiked back up to about 1200.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,769
So it's about five times normal.

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,740
And so I think we can all agree that things are not as normal

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,509
-- with respect to hiring and job security of
-- all the lessons I've learned over my,

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,630
we'll say extensive time

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,800
on earth.

48
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,949
There is no such thing as normal.

49
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,320
There is, there is a

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,830
times of ease for the well off which I think often become defined as normal.

51
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:32,699
But the reality is like no man, there's no normal.

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,250
Yeah, I think it's not even so much times of ease, but there's,

53
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:38,309
there's change and then, especially if you have a lot of resources,

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,509
you can adapt to that change.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,470
So for example, if it's hot, you get air conditioning

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,070
done, I'm comfortable with this now it's ok.

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,830
You know,

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,339
and then things change enough again that you are no longer comfortable.

59
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,789
And of course, if you have less resources, which is a play way of saying if you're poor

60
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,110
or working poor, you know, it's obviously you're gonna struggle with this,

61
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,070
you know, just like

62
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,130
online schooling being a great example.

63
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,020
If you have high speed internet and laptops,

64
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,070
no big deal.

65
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,509
And if you don't have those two things, then online school is,

66
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:04,949
well, it's impossible.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,899
Like just straight up, you can't do like

68
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:09,690
they were talking about these rural people, you know,

69
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,990
where the teachers are photocopying like crazy and printing out

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,149
packets to give to the kids because they don't have,

71
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,669
they don't have internet at home. That's good enough to go for online school. So,

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,679
so number one is job security

73
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,470
and we're not going to talk too much about that other than to say that.

74
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,149
Yeah, like if you get laid off or fired or let go,

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,300
it sucks. And it's, it can be brutal and it can be really hard to get back on your feet.

76
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,820
And so, you know, please talk to your friends get help if you need it.

77
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,240
Uh There's a lot of good online resources for that.

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,990
Um,

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,699
but ultimately, it is just brutal but the second part is sort of

80
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,089
how these people are often let go.

81
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,309
And that's the job security part I want to talk about. Right.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,830
So there's the old trope of, you know,

83
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,009
like all of a sudden

84
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,669
two large men and a person from HR, show up at your desk,

85
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,470
you know, and ask you to step away from your keyboard.

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,190
Right.

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,500
Yep. Yep. That's right.

88
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
And then they, you know,

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,990
the person from hr starts reading you stuff and making you sign

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,960
stuff if you want your medical insurance to continue in the US.

91
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,669
And you know, the two big burly men watch you as you box up your desk and, and

92
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,470
are walked off the premises

93
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,860
and of course, in tech, we don't do that anymore in tech, what happens is you wake up,

94
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,369
you try to check your work email and it doesn't work.

95
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,108
That that is exactly what in fact. So you say that

96
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,630
if you read the Coinbase blog where they detail what they're doing,

97
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:31,809
they basically said when this blog is published, if you're part of the, the layoff,

98
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,410
you will get an email to your personal email and your

99
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,140
access has been cut off.

100
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:41,380
So basically they were fired by a blog and a personal email like,

101
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:42,299
yeah,

102
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,429
well, and again, at scale, what are you going to do?

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,459
Well and not just skill? I mean, So

104
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,130
I think

105
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,489
there are different types

106
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,529
of, we'll say, um,

107
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,679
I,

108
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,480
I don't know how to a polite way to say

109
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,559
it but there's different types of companies that fire people,

110
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:00,260
we'll say.

111
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:00,809
And

112
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,519
I think any sort of organization like a bank

113
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,140
or Coinbase or even a lot of security people,

114
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:12,450
there are real concerns about real damage from retribution from the employees.

115
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:12,829
I mean,

116
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,989
I remember

117
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,709
when, I mean, when you and I worked at Red Hat,

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,970
most of the security people we worked with like when you put your notice in,

119
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,459
you were told you have a great couple of weeks off, like you're done,

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,420
I was big to stay and they made me work out my two weeks.

121
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,760
Well, not everyone had to do that.

122
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,799
I actually was hoping to get the two weeks off.

123
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,829
That's what I wanted. I wanted to be like,

124
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:37,660
you know, 20 minutes from then I can't check my email anymore. It's great.

125
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,579
I got two weeks to clean the house and do some renos. No, I had to work those two weeks.

126
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,029
That's hilarious. But

127
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,880
like if you have access to sensitive information,

128
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,220
that is a legitimate concern,

129
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,929
I will say and obviously in the case of something like Coinbase,

130
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,209
you don't want like one of the developers like

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,160
cleaning out all the wallets and being like,

132
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,399
well, that was fun guys.

133
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,200
And my response to that is

134
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,109
if you

135
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,470
are in a position where clicking a link in

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,839
an email results in the company being ransom wared.

137
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,329
That's not a you problem. That's a company, it problem.

138
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,359
And I would say the same thing here if letting somebody go all of a sudden

139
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:15,549
means that they could somehow crash your company

140
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,149
or do some significant damage to it.

141
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:17,929
Well,

142
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,880
they could have done that yesterday or the day

143
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,119
before or the month before nothing has changed.

144
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,000
Apart from the sense of, like in the classic sense of an attacker,

145
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,350
you have a threat plus a capability, they always had the capability,

146
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,420
but now they have the intention, the threat, right? That's fair.

147
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,790
And so the problem becomes what that means is.

148
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,959
So those 18% of people you let go,

149
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,380
they're the only 18% of people that can crash the company.

150
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,899
What about the remaining 70 or 82%

151
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,230
-- that may or may not be happy about this? Well,
-- the other 82% are getting paid

152
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,920
for now

153
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,760
-- for now.
-- Is, is correct.

154
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,779
Have you seen the crypto markets?

155
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,320
-- Actually, I haven't looked at the Bitcoin price yet today, but I, I
-- bet it's,

156
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,880
-- yeah, you might not want to look it.
-- I bet it's stellar. $21,000.

157
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,570
-- It down a bit,
-- a little bit

158
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,109
by a bit. I mean, a lot.

159
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,239
But here's my point.

160
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,010
It's not like those 18 18% or 10% of Tesla

161
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,839
or whatever people are the only people that could,

162
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,000
you know, be upset and crash the company,

163
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,750
there's still those remaining people that can do this and,

164
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,540
and if one of those remaining people decides to throw a tantrum and like,

165
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,049
you know, do something bad to the company and they can do significant damage,

166
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,769
-- then your, it
-- sucks. Sort of.

167
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,179
So I think about this one a lot and I have a really good example actually from the past.

168
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,140
So when you and I worked at Red Hat,

169
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,630
we had a signing server and it is how

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,100
all of the artifacts Red Hat distributed were signed.

171
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,600
And this was a computer with a hardware security module in it.

172
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:44,899
It was one of those like

173
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,320
three of the five power rangers have to come together to reconstruct

174
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,299
the key if it crashes and all that kind of stuff.

175
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:54,000
Right? Like we did it up, we, we turned, I mean, we turned it up quite a bit.

176
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,429
It was, it was security done, right? It's

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,000
not as good as the P GP story that's going to come out the week after this episode.

178
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,640
But, but we'll get to that.

179
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,100
But

180
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,549
anyway,

181
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,549
so

182
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,170
we had administrators for the computer that ran the signing

183
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:13,320
server because we obviously had people who had to log in

184
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,250
and conduct maintenance on it, do the upgrades.

185
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,540
They had to

186
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,450
like

187
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:22,100
check the logs, you had to deploy new versions of software like that kind of stuff.

188
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:22,399
Right.

189
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,399
And I was one of the people who could do that.

190
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,299
There were, I think three people, two or three, I don't remember the exact number.

191
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:30,679
I think it was three people who had access to this computer. And

192
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,159
I had the ability to sign

193
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,109
an R PM package on this machine

194
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,630
because I had enough access that I could just like, literally,

195
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,479
like go down into the bowels of the system

196
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,580
-- and access the HS
-- M

197
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,359
hardware security

198
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,330
module.

199
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,450
Yes. Yes. And, and for anyone who doesn't know the, the idea of this device is

200
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,780
keys go in and they never come out

201
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,500
and

202
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,859
we'll put a lot of caveats on that because I'm,

203
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sure the software that runs on these things is a,

204
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,179
a complete tire fire and no one's ever audited it.

205
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,260
But that's another story.

206
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,219
But I don't want to get started.

207
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:04,979
But

208
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,270
the idea is that even if someone attacks the system, they can't get,

209
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,669
they could sign things, but they can't get the key out

210
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,919
and then we rotate the key and move on.

211
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,929
Now the day I submitted my notice to Red hat that I was leaving when I went to Elastic.

212
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,799
Obviously, my access to the key server was turned off immediately.

213
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:22,679
Well, and more importantly,

214
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,219
hopefully they had somebody else who they then gave access.

215
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,469
I, I have no idea and, and

216
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,070
it, I don't care,

217
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,359
it doesn't matter.

218
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:30,869
But

219
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,400
I

220
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,919
think that was prudent security to say Josh is exiting the company.

221
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:41,289
-- He should not have access to this computer
-- for a small number of high trust people.

222
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,320
Absolutely. Like,

223
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,710
yes, but

224
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,919
18% all at once

225
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,479
again, if that 18% is all so high trust that you

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,380
have to lock them out because their access is so privileged.

227
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,210
-- That's way too much privilege across the board.
-- I,

228
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,369
I would be skeptical if they had that level of privilege. I think most people don't.

229
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,429
I think it's just from a risk management perspective, it's easier to just blanket,

230
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,229
turn them all off than it has to be like, oh,

231
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,989
these people need to be turned off now and these people

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,150
can probably wait a day and these people can wait.

233
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,090
Like, no, just

234
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,710
get it, get it done with like pull that band aid off.

235
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:20,080
And I suspect that's, that's how that works. I mean, if I was in charge of,

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,130
thank goodness, I've never been in this sort of environment. But if I was like the co

237
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,340
of a company

238
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,630
that was laying off a whole bunch of people,

239
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,210
I would be inclined to say, like, we're just going to like,

240
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,580
-- it has to happen all at once.
-- No,

241
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,359
no, it's like ripping a band off.

242
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,909
But my concern is so many people seem to think that this really has,

243
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,619
it has to happen because of security. And I think that's,

244
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,010
if it has to happen because of security you're already

245
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,979
in, for a world of hurt,

246
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:52,210
you're probably right because my suspicion is if you

247
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,559
have the sort of access level I had,

248
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,440
for example,

249
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,640
you're probably not on the list of people that a company can afford to get rid of.

250
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,479
And so

251
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,969
I, I don't think you're wrong there necessarily, but,

252
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:08,530
well,

253
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:12,619
I actually had this happen when I worked for a previous company as a contractor.

254
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,739
They were basically preparing for sale

255
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,090
and to make the numbers look better, they wanted to, you know,

256
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:20,090
reduce expenses like headcount is ok.

257
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:20,679
Right.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,559
But

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,450
contractor expense is bad.

260
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:24,530
So they

261
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,809
kept trying to fire me

262
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,190
or to get rid of me.

263
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,650
And of course my manager in the, in the higher ups number, like you,

264
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,969
you cannot get rid of Kurt.

265
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:34,159
Like I was something like 20 or 30% production of all the security reports,

266
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,719
the, the, the accounting sheet, people just could not understand that,

267
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,609
that they really wanted to get rid of this line item expense that was, you know,

268
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,570
pretty expensive.

269
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:43,479
Right.

270
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,090
And,

271
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:45,789
but they couldn't, you know,

272
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,750
same thing and then when the large company bought us and wanted

273
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,010
background checks on everybody before we were allowed to VPN N.

274
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,539
They're like,

275
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:54,369
no, Kurt has to have access now. Otherwise he can't do his job and

276
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
like we need Kurt to work.

277
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,559
So it's always amusing to me that there are

278
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,669
all these policies and standards that are put in place

279
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,320
and

280
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,809
eventually something happens and it's like, no, we got

281
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,799
not this time. Let that one go.

282
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,520
How important is it really?

283
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,159
Well, you know, I see this all the time. Like with how do I put it?

284
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,830
There are like those white glove high touch people

285
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
that it's like we have a password policy.

286
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,549
But, you know, if

287
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,239
Bob over in sales, the money tree shaker violates it,

288
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,239
that's ok

289
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,140
because he brings in, you know, seven figures a year of sales.

290
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:32,750
That's right.

291
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:33,960
I remember,

292
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,880
I remember being in some situations like that in the past where it was like,

293
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:38,200
oh,

294
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,520
let that one go.

295
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,770
Like, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what websites they're looking at.

296
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,750
Like they can do that.

297
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,260
It's like,

298
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,630
wait a

299
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:44,919
minute.

300
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,690
Is that still a thing?

301
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:47,599
Uh,

302
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,700
no,

303
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:48,979
no,

304
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,469
not the filtering part.

305
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,989
Well, it depends where you are. I mean, there's organizations that I don't do it

306
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,919
but I think now it's more of

307
00:12:56,229 --> 00:13:00,950
you are, you have your Endpoint software and it monitors for bad things

308
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:04,960
and you're like, oh, look, someone somehow got all this malware from, you know,

309
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,690
this horrible porn site or whatever.

310
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,409
Like, what are we going to do about it?

311
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,830
And, yeah, it's like if they're, if they're the big sales guy, it's like, no,

312
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,469
it's fine.

313
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,419
Just delete the malware. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Everyone.

314
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:15,250
No one pay attention.

315
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:16,770
Like, ok,

316
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,900
-- I guess,
-- and I guess especially in smaller organizations, like,

317
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,039
you can't do separation of duties if you have like, three people,

318
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,719
you know, like we talked about this, about the podcast.

319
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,739
Like, there's two of us, we can't really

320
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:30,640
do separation

321
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,809
-- of
-- two of us.

322
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,020
There's, I'm, I'm,

323
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:36,469
you do all the work. I'm the critical path of this podcast.

324
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,890
You don't even have to log in to our, our hosting site,

325
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,340
which maybe we should talk about fixing that someday. But,

326
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:45,070
-- but
-- I

327
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:45,289
know

328
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,609
because we actually did ac we for this with voting mechanisms where,

329
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,570
well, well,

330
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,429
a great example is like these consensus mechanisms that require voting.

331
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,669
There was um a uh a crypto token

332
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,590
that got

333
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,960
hacked because they had nine,

334
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,119
there were nine keys and you needed five to get consensus,

335
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:03,869
right?

336
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,000
This seems totally fine, right?

337
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,429
Except one organization held four keys.

338
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,890
I mean, that seems fine to me.

339
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,119
-- So
-- you have one person in one organization, they got the five keys and they

340
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,640
drained

341
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,739
the thing and nobody knows for a week,

342
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,340
which is the best part until someone tried to do a transaction was like,

343
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:23,150
why is there no money in here anymore?

344
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,349
You know, it was on the

345
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,520
news. It was great.

346
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,229
And so we looked at this

347
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,960
and so obviously any voting mech

348
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,989
mechanism you choose, it's kind of like a security mechanism.

349
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,739
There'll be upsides and downsides. So for example, if you require

350
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:43,000
um what kind of majority? 51% 66% 75% a full majority of 100%.

351
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,739
Well, you know, for example, the,

352
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:49,070
you know, the UN Security Council because they require 100% vote

353
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,549
any member of the Security Council and Russia can just veto everything. Right.

354
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,020
Right.

355
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,489
Kind of, no matter what you pick, there's going to be upsides and downsides,

356
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,190
um, different risk profiles.

357
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,840
And, you know, we looked at this, this assumes that you have some sort of critical

358
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,679
mass or plurality to actually vote.

359
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,630
You know, and the, so the CS A is a great example.

360
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,909
Like we're, we're finally growing out our,

361
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,299
it and ops team because previously it was like me

362
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,239
and

363
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,039
I, but, but here's the thing, I have a 20 plus year relationship with the CEO,

364
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:19,729
you know what I mean?

365
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:23,080
And he's treated me very well for 20 plus years. So

366
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,239
that buys a certain level of trust and loyalty that

367
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,580
well, yeah,

368
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,599
it takes 20 years to buy that trust and loyalty and

369
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:33,000
most companies are not willing to spend that time and money.

370
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,179
Well, it, it, it almost doesn't exist anymore.

371
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,390
I mean, you know, when, when you and I were young,

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,590
there were always these stories of people who worked for

373
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,789
one company for 50 years and then they retired and

374
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,549
my dad had one employer.

375
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:50,250
He went to university and then he stayed until he left when he was like,

376
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,429
-- it's
-- pretty awesome.

377
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,940
Like, I think the odds of that happening again are very low.

378
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,109
And I mean, I think this is one of the things you have to keep in mind, obviously,

379
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:04,849
when you're creating any sort of architecture of, of like humans or tech or,

380
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:05,799
or whatever.

381
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:06,520
I think

382
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,559
one of the things that comes to mind is

383
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,869
you're kind of describing all of this and there's

384
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,000
the aspects of voting and, and there's, you know, how much

385
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:17,869
like in your case, you have all this loyalty to Jim.

386
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,349
-- Well,
-- how much collusion do you need for something bad to happen?

387
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,159
Not just that, I think one of the things we do,

388
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,369
especially in security is we obsess over

389
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,289
this like perfect security which doesn't exist.

390
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,229
And you always have to decide like, where am I drawing the line?

391
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,239
And I'm just going to say everything below this line,

392
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,549
I just have to trust because I have no choice and everything above this line.

393
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:44,020
That's the stuff I'm going to put effort into trying to build security

394
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,450
and compliance and whatever else around it

395
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,849
to make it more robust.

396
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:52,630
And I think that's I like this conversation we're having right here.

397
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,510
-- That line is very blurry, I think.
-- Well, I'm gonna subtly disagree.

398
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,000
I agree with you. But

399
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,659
the caveat being is that there's new,

400
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,260
subtle disagreement, there's new technologies and there's new

401
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,969
ways of doing computing that were not available 10 or 20 years ago.

402
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,410
So for example, perfect example,

403
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,780
here is we use cloud ally to back up our Google our Microsoft 365 and our sales force.

404
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,339
And one of my goals longer term is to get that cloud

405
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:21,118
ally backups essentially under the control of somebody who's basically not it,

406
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,819
operations.

407
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,459
So that even if kind of it operations, wigs out and fat finger deletes everything,

408
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,098
there's this wholly separate backup.

409
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:29,270
You mean, like

410
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,270
an off site? Cold backup, right.

411
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,989
You know, things like that.

412
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,979
But yeah, the, the stuff like this wasn't possible a long time ago because just

413
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,209
the services didn't exist.

414
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,319
And I'm pretty sure Google's not going to let

415
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,160
me run backup tapes out of their facility.

416
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:43,630
Right.

417
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,689
I was just gonna say that it used to be

418
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,099
possible because we would ship the tapes off site.

419
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,849
I remember the, the crate would come in every Monday morning.

420
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:54,979
I would take the tapes out, put the new tapes in and then the crate leaves on Tuesday.

421
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,060
That is a line item on every single security questionnaire I've ever gotten.

422
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:58,459
It was like,

423
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:02,010
you know, how, what is the physical security or are your back? Oh, yeah.

424
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,859
It's, are your backup tapes encrypted? And I'm like,

425
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:05,969
not applicable.

426
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,119
Right.

427
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,739
Although I'm, you know, like,

428
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,930
yeah, so

429
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,849
I think that's part of it is not just,

430
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,969
there's a line in the sand we're going to care about,

431
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,369
but there's also

432
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,119
the new thing is the sort of that line in the sand of what can we do

433
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,930
to kind of put this data or control of this data or a back with this data

434
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,020
in an entirely different sandbox

435
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,260
in a way that wasn't possible 10 or 20 years ago.

436
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,410
And I think that's part of where a lot

437
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,069
of security people fall down because they don't,

438
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,900
they don't know that these new things exist.

439
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,400
Like Amazon Glacier is a great example because Amazon Glacier by definition.

440
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,750
Right.

441
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,359
It's my understanding is it's a bunch of hard

442
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,719
drives that get fired up every what is it?

443
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:39,719
4 to 6 hours

444
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,180
to do data reads and writes.

445
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,050
So that right there gives you like that kind of cold off

446
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,609
Lish storage capability

447
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,880
where you don't, like,

448
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,290
you have minutes and hours to go deal with something

449
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,280
because it's on a hard drive that is like,

450
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,489
physically offline,

451
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,390
-- you know.
-- So

452
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,959
it's funny you say that

453
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,510
I know someone who

454
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,640
was involved in glacier at one point in the past.

455
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,959
And I said,

456
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:07,010
I've heard it works like this. Is that correct?

457
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,530
And they just seem to me and said that is incorrect. And I said, well, how does it work?

458
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,020
And they said I won't tell you that

459
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:17,250
I don't know anything about it, but it's like, it's the greatest mystery in all of it,

460
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,689
I think.

461
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,219
Like, how does the Amazon glacier work?

462
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:23,729
Well, it's clearly not like a, I'm pretty sure it's not tape or like DVD S,

463
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,420
I

464
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,260
don't know if they have a printer that's just

465
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:33,329
paper actually. You know, it's really funny. Funny side note.

466
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,650
I remember one time

467
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,339
I was, it was,

468
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,250
I was in an intern in college for an ISP and they were

469
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,750
small and the people running it were very old and out of touch.

470
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,420
They were, they were part of a phone company

471
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,280
and

472
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,250
we were requested by the FBI at one point to produce logs for, we,

473
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,439
we needed the logs for computer access and they wanted phone access logged.

474
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,229
And the guy was like, these log, these go back like two months.

475
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,959
We don't have two months of logs. I'm like,

476
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,199
how long do you keep your logs for?

477
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,939
He's like we changed the printer paper every couple of days.

478
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,130
I'm like, wait, wait, what?

479
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,219
And he's like,

480
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,449
well, yeah, what do you, what do you do with your logs?

481
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,400
You don't just print them into a box. I'm like,

482
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,670
wait, what?

483
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:13,310
And yeah, like, seriously, this phone company had a printer.

484
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,319
That was, it was that long like that?

485
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:19,109
Remember when the paper came in, like the big long sheet, which is paper went in,

486
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,579
it came out of a box in the front,

487
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,849
went into a box in the back and those were their phone records.

488
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:23,390
And I'm like,

489
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,030
this is, this can't be right.

490
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,910
I know a lot of places did that, like, um,

491
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,349
police forces did that for their internal door, sensor logs and stuff.

492
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,890
You know, who's accessing what door, the evidence locker, stuff like that because

493
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,180
you can't tamper with it.

494
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,900
Like it's in a lot of room that only three guys have access to

495
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,819
there. But that's like 20 years ago.

496
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,780
This was in the

497
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,339
mid nineties

498
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:47,540
it would have been 99 98 probably.

499
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:51,260
And, and look for a police store. I think you can make that argument.

500
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,640
But for a freaking phone company that this guy didn't even

501
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,859
fathom that you could just write the data to a disk.

502
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,609
Like he didn't understand because I said

503
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,699
you should be keeping more than a couple of days of logs. He's like,

504
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:08,699
well, how much paper would I need for that? I'm like, none. You need no paper.

505
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,550
Well, though,

506
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,569
you'd need the same amount of paper because it's not like you're just printing the

507
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,469
logs out and it's just a matter of keeping them at that point so that

508
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,420
you don't actually need more paper. You're already wasting it.

509
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:19,390
Anyway.

510
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,449
Anyway, it was,

511
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,670
I'm confused

512
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:26,219
the most ridiculous conversation I've ever had in my life. But anyway, OK,

513
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:28,869
back to

514
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,946
my point of drawing the line and saying the

515
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,395
things underneath any glacier is a great example.

516
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:38,946
I have no control over glacier. I don't care or have to know how it works.

517
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,875
I draw the line above glacier, right?

518
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:45,586
And I think what you're talking about is no different at all. I think

519
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,576
everyone has a line somewhere. Backups are part of it.

520
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:50,725
Like when I would ship a crate of tape

521
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,281
every Tuesday off to

522
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,332
the vault, we'll put that in quotes. Like

523
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,641
I literally had no idea what was happening there.

524
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,001
Like they told me it was being stored in the secure warehouse.

525
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:03,501
But like I didn't go and look,

526
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:06,791
maybe it was being put in some guy's basement for all I know.

527
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:10,671
You know, like they, they only show you the vault when you get a tour.

528
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:11,621
But then,

529
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:13,972
and again though, I had to draw a line and be like,

530
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,521
I have to trust these people because it's not worth my time

531
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,962
to go above and beyond that.

532
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,250
Yeah. No, I'm always reminded of, remember a few man, when was this?

533
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,900
Oh, this is back in 2006, remember two Iron Mountain facilities burnt down

534
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:29,300
and everybody was like all conspiracy theorists crazy.

535
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,099
And it turns out one was an accident and one was an intentional fire.

536
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,599
I vaguely remember that. Yeah,

537
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,569
they're really not supposed to burn down.

538
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,010
Well, I mean, that's the idea

539
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,459
like which kind of raises the question of like,

540
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,030
how's the fire suppression of all of these?

541
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,150
Obviously not that great. If two of them burnt down,

542
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
nobody knows.

543
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:51,699
Well, no, we know we have, we have two data points, two of them burnt down

544
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,449
-- out
-- of how many facilities anyway, whatever it doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

545
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,609
But again, this is where insurance and things like that hopefully help out. But

546
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,810
ok, anyway, we are talking about

547
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,800
the security of jobs,

548
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,650
I guess in this context and I want to bring us all

549
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,969
the way back to the thing we're supposed to be talking about.

550
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,150
-- So,
-- no, I think this is interesting. And I think

551
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,849
again, you know, it sucks to literally

552
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,719
you check your work email, it doesn't work,

553
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,760
you phone the support desk and they're like, we don't know who you are.

554
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,349
You're not allowed to talk to us. Click.

555
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,869
So hopefully you've checked your personal email to find out.

556
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,130
Although I guess at this point it's in the, in the media.

557
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,290
So I guess when you turn on the TV, you might find out that you've been fired,

558
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:29,239
you know, kind of like, um,

559
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,060
what's that scene from the fifth element?

560
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,489
You know, like with the mail comes in the little shoot chunk, you know, and the, the,

561
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,349
the vendors like, oh, it might be good news.

562
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,390
You're fired.

563
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,380
I do remember that when

564
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,369
Zerk has to get,

565
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,270
you know, to cool down the economy.

566
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,380
And, uh, yeah, I just, I guess what I'm saying is, don't lose hope.

567
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,150
I mean, Josh, you and I have been through what?

568
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,829
Well, the.com crash, the 2008 crash,

569
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,520
we seem to have a lot of these once in a lifetime crash

570
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,479
right now.

571
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,670
Yeah, they are every couple of years I think.

572
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,810
Actually, you know what's funny is the dot Bomb

573
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:00,920
was,

574
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,020
I graduated from college in 2001.

575
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:08,739
So, like, I was job seeking in the middle of the.com disaster

576
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,400
and

577
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,270
it, it worked out. I, I got, I mean, look, I love my first job.

578
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,729
It was for a little company that wrote life insurance software and they

579
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:19,770
needed a UNIX admin and it was all a IX and I was,

580
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,920
of course, the Linux nerd they hired to part partially,

581
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,719
they wanted me because I understood Linux because

582
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,849
they were investigating porting the product to Linux

583
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:31,319
and partially they just needed a UNIX nerd who could take care of things. And it was,

584
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:33,390
it was a wild job. But

585
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,650
yeah, I mean,

586
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,709
it is what it is, you know,

587
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,880
it wasn't particularly exciting. Like life insurance is not an exciting industry.

588
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,020
-- Thank goodness.
-- Well, it pays the bills.

589
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,119
But, but anyway,

590
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:46,280
it's, uh, I don't know.

591
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,400
And look, I mean,

592
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,719
I think one other thing to keep in mind is there's

593
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,959
going to be more of this like we're not done,

594
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,400
we're gonna see.

595
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,160
-- Well, it
-- seems to be about every 10 years now.

596
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,459
-- Uh Well,
-- no, I just mean, in this particular recession we're entering,

597
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:01,550
we're going to see more organizations cutting back on staff.

598
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:01,880
I mean,

599
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,010
one of the other things that happens to a lot is once you start cutting back on staff,

600
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,439
it's very common for a big company to cut back literally across the board.

601
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,319
And you're going to see

602
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,910
security teams, you're going to see reduced development teams,

603
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,410
-- you're going to see reduced sales teams like, like everywhere
-- I think.

604
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,030
Well, and a lot of this classic too will be

605
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:22,670
moving from a reliance on people to more on processing

606
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,579
and products because

607
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,810
again, that's something that's a

608
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,790
lot of these things have matured enormously,

609
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,530
you know, like I have, I mean,

610
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:33,229
well, some of the sales products I'm seeing now are,

611
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,719
you know, they, they save our sales people so much time.

612
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:40,569
There, there is some cool stuff and even in the world of security, I mean, there is,

613
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,839
there are better products for, like,

614
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:46,030
sifting through all of the alerts and all of that kind of stuff.

615
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,310
But

616
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,569
there's still, like,

617
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,500
when you take people away from a security

618
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,650
team that's probably already overworked now you're,

619
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,609
you're creating, like, what does that mean for the business?

620
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,250
-- What are they not doing? How does that work?
-- Where there blind spots? Yeah.

621
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,420
Yeah, it's, it's, it's going to be wild man, I think,

622
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,079
I think it'll be interesting to see.

623
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:06,930
So, something that would be fun. I don't,

624
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,949
it would be interesting to watch the companies that

625
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,770
reduce their workforce

626
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,760
and then look at, are there security, are there, like,

627
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,579
more or less security incidents?

628
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,199
Several months down the road?

629
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,670
And I'd have to guess roughly the same.

630
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,410
I, I don't know.

631
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,750
I mean, I,

632
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,579
-- I
-- honestly don't think it'll be that much of a contributing factor

633
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,109
just because security across the board is such a tire fire.

634
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,469
Probably. You're probably right.

635
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,579
But anyway,

636
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,670
anyway,

637
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,750
-- and there's
-- so many confounding factors too. Right.

638
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,790
This is like, trying to say, like, does eating mangoes make you healthier or not?

639
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,260
Well, there's just so many confounding factors. Now like,

640
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,069
well, I mean, what is it, what is it the causation or is it

641
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:46,849
correlation

642
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,260
or correlation does not mean causation? Right. That, that's the saying.

643
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,250
Right. Right.

644
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:51,670
And,

645
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:52,079
and

646
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,270
you can't control for like COVID or

647
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:56,910
monkey pox

648
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,910
or

649
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,619
-- you know,
-- I

650
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,260
know,

651
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:01,469
I know.

652
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,160
Yup.

653
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,530
Yup.

654
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,400
-- It is what it is.
-- Speaking

655
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:05,579
of

656
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,670
good luck on your flights coming up.

657
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:09,589
-- Uh
-- this will come out, yes,

658
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,260
this will come out Sunday night and I will be getting up very,

659
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,430
very early on Monday to go to the Open Source Summit something or other

660
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,449
from the

661
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:18,390
foundation

662
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:23,469
in, in Austin, Texas. So if you're there, if you listen to this,

663
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,979
I, I guess right when it comes out,

664
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,239
there's a good chance, I'd say there's a higher than average chance, maybe,

665
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,310
maybe come say hi.

666
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,589
You know, I'd love to see you.

667
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,630
Yeah, I, I man,

668
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,339
I've only been on one airplane since COVID and like it wasn't

669
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,469
super exciting to me and I'm not super excited to travel again,

670
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:42,229
but I am excited to finally give some talks in front of humans.

671
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,630
I, although I did get my Star Trek talk at cipher

672
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,660
Khan and that was

673
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,469
an amazing treat

674
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,709
to get to speak in front of people and enjoy myself.

675
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:53,089
And I also escaped cipher Khan with no COVID.

676
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,339
So let's hope I escaped Texas with no COVID also,

677
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,630
but I'll be wearing lots of masks and,

678
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,619
and all that jazz. So, so we'll see we'll see anyway. Anyway,

679
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,750
and, and actually this is also, uh, we're talking about the GSD

680
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,199
and that, which we'll have to, we should,

681
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,770
we should talk more about that at some point.

682
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,869
But anyway,

683
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,199
-- I think,
-- especially as we get the edit button working.

684
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,949
Yeah, that's another story.

685
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,579
Just got to get the back to ba

686
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,689
it's,

687
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,420
you know, ok, so before we go,

688
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,310
I just want to mention kind of one thing and

689
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,239
I'm even experiencing this elsewhere as part of other,

690
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,449
like open SS f work I'm doing and even work at,

691
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:31,989
at, at, at a

692
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,260
car is,

693
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,869
it always feels so easy when you want to start a project, you're like, oh,

694
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,920
we'll just create a repo and then we'll write some code and then we'll do this thing

695
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:40,680
and

696
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,500
there's always some,

697
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,099
like writing the code is literally the easiest

698
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,180
and shortest part of the entire process.

699
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:51,829
There's like all the other stuff that consumes

700
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,729
so much time and building community is hard

701
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,339
and just everything like it's,

702
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,780
it always fascinates me when I

703
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,380
start any new project. And I'm like, oh, it won't be that hard.

704
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,030
And then I'm like, in three months,

705
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,569
I feel like nothing's done because all we've done

706
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,140
is commit some things to a repo and that's,

707
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,459
that's the easy part.

708
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:13,140
-- But anyway, anyway,
-- well, I think that's true of many things.

709
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,599
There's just, there's a lot of underlying work that people forget,

710
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:16,910
like having a house.

711
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,339
I like, I had to mow the lawn

712
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:19,650
that takes time.

713
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,510
You know, I

714
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,250
just, all these little things.

715
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

716
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,479
There's always the little stuff and I, yeah, anyway, I should,

717
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:32,319
whatever I'm calling this before we go off on some

718
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,800
ridiculous tangent that has nothing to do with anything.

719
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,560
