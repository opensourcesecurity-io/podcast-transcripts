Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,800
-- and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh
-- Pressers.

2
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,770
I'm very excited. We have Tama

3
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:14,000
De

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,158
Pierre back, join the Illustrious

5
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:16,950
multi

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,139
guest club. I guess.

7
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,629
I guess he's the first one. No, he's, he's like the third. I think.

8
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,049
I think Liz Rice and uh

9
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:24,295
Dr

10
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,625
David Wheeler had been on it at least twice, maybe some others. I can't remember.

11
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:31,545
-- So if I forgot your name on the list, I apologize. But Tama, welcome
-- back.

12
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,784
Thank you. Happy to be back

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:34,154
to

14
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,415
back. And uh

15
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:38,544
I have to say that compared to tools and name you just,

16
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:42,604
you know, brought up. I am definitely not in the same kind of club I think.

17
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,680
Well, you are now. So

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,330
it's very exciting. No, we're, we're excited to have you.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,889
You, we've got some what some eu government topics today,

20
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,549
which is going to be fantastic.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,200
I think so. I'll just, I'll just give you the floor man. Take it away.

22
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:01,959
Oh, thanks. Uh I think uh to, to go with that. Uh

23
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,455
It was interesting thing. So I was

24
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:08,025
so if you remember everyone may remember from the last time I came in,

25
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,964
I came in mostly because of a rant.

26
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:14,375
I wrote as a blog post called I'm, I'm not a supplier.

27
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:15,135
Uh

28
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:16,235
And when I say rent,

29
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,785
it was literally like a midnight rent reading a

30
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,444
Google thing with SLC or something like that.

31
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,944
And it seems to have, you know,

32
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:27,614
struck a nerve and we got quite some engagement discussion around this

33
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,110
and this led to me talking with quite a few people this year.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,279
And there have been quite a lot of, of, you know,

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,629
things happening around open source security and supply chain terms and

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,620
policy making in the past year, a lot of movement.

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,790
And so that led to me being

38
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,389
at F

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,069
them a couple of weeks ago

40
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,199
uh where there was a uh

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,989
a day long on the Sunday workshop with people from the EU Commission,

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
multiple people on multiple workshops around

43
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,489
how do we engage even more for free and open

44
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,559
software with

45
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,120
policy making in particular around the EU.

46
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,129
And so

47
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,264
I think that there is a few interesting to bring here uh from that

48
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:13,835
being the cr a uh how I see things after a year after.

49
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:18,074
Um the fact that I leave this discussion with some hopes but also uh

50
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,975
not that many. And I, a lot of interesting, always

51
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:24,875
a lot of thinking around the fact that there is a lot to build.

52
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:25,464
Yeah.

53
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:26,475
Yeah, for sure.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,619
All right, let's start with the cr a,

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,630
because I find it to be.

56
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,789
Well, it's the thing I know the most about, of, of the various items you just listed.

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,839
So, what is the cr A?

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,800
Oh, I don't know if I'm the best place person to talk about that, but I can do a quick run

59
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,425
if you want to

60
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,744
do far better. You could probably have as a guest.

61
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:47,684
Malta

62
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,544
from NL

63
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:52,395
Net Labs that did a lot of work on this this year.

64
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:52,964
Um

65
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,764
But the,

66
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:58,854
the rundown is that the EU decided that

67
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:03,220
uh as nearly every product in the EU uh the

68
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,800
sell, sold on the EU market. If you were going to sell

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,009
a

70
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,500
product with software in it,

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,850
-- you
-- should have

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,210
everything at this point. A

73
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,169
lot of stuff

74
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:18,460
iot your, your kids toys, right? A lot of stuff

75
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,910
you should probably have some kind of

76
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,820
regulation. Now, this is relatively light.

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,960
This is uh the idea is to reuse the existing

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,929
ce marking which uh for people that may not be

79
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,789
from the EU is a marking you may see on

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,490
a lot of your uh electronic uh electric school stuff.

81
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,559
Like if you look at your charger break, it's probably have this marking on it,

82
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,970
which mostly say that

83
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,520
it

84
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,419
follows the rules on electrical device in the

85
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:50,240
EU and same thing for the software stuff.

86
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,210
Um The

87
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,389
reason we talk about it, a lot, a lot about it in, in, in free open source.

88
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,830
That's why right in open source is that um

89
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:04,020
the original text was really targeted at commercial

90
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,449
use, right? And the idea was that

91
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:08,110
if you,

92
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:11,149
if you sell something, you should, you know,

93
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:15,389
make sure that it follows a minimum standards. Now, on the,

94
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,410
this was kind of problematic because of the

95
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,190
definition of commercial from the EU commission,

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,309
which would mean that if you were getting like some get up sponsors, for example,

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,269
which I know a lot of people try to do

98
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,549
that would count as commercial.

99
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,510
It was kind of scary for the people in open source.

100
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,670
Um There was a lot of engagement during the year

101
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:38,709
and from everyone that worked on that engagement on the,

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,609
you know, false advocacy.

103
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:43,920
Um The Eu Commission and the Eu Parliament has been

104
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:47,410
quite open to uh discussion and the final text,

105
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,079
which is now

106
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,450
more or less official. I think there is maybe a last,

107
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,040
you know, official step to go, but that is, that's not going to change.

108
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,190
The text is quite more friendly for themselves.

109
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,890
There is like a dozen or 20 pages describing all

110
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,450
the situation that open source covers that are not handled.

111
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,690
Um So, so

112
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,910
the reality today is that for nearly everyone doing open source,

113
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,440
except if you are a for profit, big company,

114
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,160
right?

115
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,089
You are not going to be concerned,

116
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,209
you go on. So that's pretty good as a result.

117
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:21,839
Um

118
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,679
And so that's Mui

119
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:23,959
the

120
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:24,549
CR A

121
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,859
uh and Susie to,

122
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,190
to give an idea of what kind of standard regulation we are talking of things like,

123
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,630
hey,

124
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,760
you need to have a way for security researchers to

125
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,540
tell you when there's a vulnerability in your stuff,

126
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:38,350
which is, you know, relatively understandable, right?

127
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:38,540
It's not

128
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,970
feel like it's a heavy, you know, uh lie

129
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:47,160
yelling at you and regulation context, I think for open source folks, the most,

130
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,760
the second most important part is that

131
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:54,320
if what they call an integrator, which is a company using the open source code

132
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,880
find or is made aware of vulnerability,

133
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,079
they are, they have to, you know, disclose it to you and to the public,

134
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:09,119
but also within reasonable timeline. But they also have,

135
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,459
if they can

136
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,989
to provide a fix,

137
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,250
which means for us sending a patch was a fix to the uh

138
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,299
upstream,

139
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,089
which I think is quite a first in terms of legal obligation.

140
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,829
Well, I think for me, it boils down to that fit for purpose.

141
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,899
Idea of like if I sell you a hammer,

142
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:31,489
you have to be able to hit a nail with it and it doesn't break,

143
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,500
right? Whereas if you use the hammer as a crowbar though and it breaks.

144
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,739
Well, ok, sorry, that's not its purpose,

145
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:38,959
right? You can't do that

146
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,260
in broad terms.

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,179
Yes.

148
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,660
But, but the fact that not only do they have to do that but they have to upstream a fix.

149
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:46,549
Yeah,

150
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,779
that's kind of new, right?

151
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,809
For us at least in our world.

152
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh,

153
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,109
that

154
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:58,040
-- is that, I, I'm just because I'm looking at the act and, um, oh,
-- gosh,

155
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,970
I don't know the way it is on the whole thing.

156
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,859
It's 200 pages.

157
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,239
-- It's
-- gigantic. Kurt, it's completely gigantic.

158
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,239
I'm just trying to find where it talks about pushing it because, I mean,

159
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,709
I did find the commercial thing and it has the car vote for open source scene,

160
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,704
reasonably sane and well written

161
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:18,394
as sane as you can make an open source cover out because that's a lot of cases to cover

162
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:19,274
well.

163
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:20,635
And I think in fairness too,

164
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,174
like I still meet people who have a hard time understanding.

165
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,825
So there's all these people globally, like millions of people globally,

166
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,684
just like writing software for kind of fun but not fun.

167
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,355
But because they need to do it but they don't need to do

168
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,135
it but they don't get paid but they do it for free.

169
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,625
And I mean, I admit that,

170
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:37,035
yeah, it sounds kind of confusing if you're like a traditional legislator,

171
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,475
business person who does things for money only.

172
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:40,595
Right. So I imagine

173
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,480
some of this is not so much malicious as just they don't understand the ecosystem,

174
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,809
right?

175
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,000
And,

176
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,649
and something that came up a lot in the

177
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,799
discussion on what happened is that at some point,

178
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,399
the parliament particularly thought that we just wanted to

179
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,880
not have to handle it.

180
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,790
Might like

181
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:01,440
we just wanted to the, the, the the point of view was that.

182
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,359
Well, if we put a car

183
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:03,970
out for open,

184
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,720
all these commercial company will just say, oh, no,

185
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,239
we open source it and then they will not have to deal with it.

186
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,450
And they did not want that and they were really seeing

187
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,839
it as lobbying to be able to get out of it

188
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,320
because that's what they are used to deal with when lobbyists come to them.

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,980
Right.

190
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,679
And so, so that was a lot of discussion and,

191
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,230
and a lot of work around that uh from what I understand, but once again,

192
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,100
I was not in this

193
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,640
discussion. So I may not be the,

194
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,489
-- well,
-- that type of misunderstanding makes perfect sense because yeah,

195
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,599
typically when a company is like, we don't want to do that because they,

196
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,780
they don't want to pay for it.

197
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,419
And I, the big difference here is the open source community in my experience.

198
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,419
Absolutely wants to provide security fixes and good

199
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:44,080
software.

200
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,229
I just don't want to, you know, be held legally liable for this,

201
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,760
you know, we can't.

202
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,429
Right.

203
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:53,270
And so I'm going to go on the other side here, which is, you said,

204
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,030
liable.

205
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,369
So that's interesting because the cr

206
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,140
A actually doesn't handle liability directly.

207
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,849
Um Because

208
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,440
what the cr A give all these, you know,

209
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,469
self assessment you need to do and all these certification and all

210
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:07,090
um

211
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,380
keep in mind it's, it doesn't cover,

212
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,179
it does not cover things that were already covered.

213
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,549
So like your health care device, right,

214
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,700
a pacemaker or something like that is not covered by the

215
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,619
CR A because it's already covered by far more tight regulation.

216
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:24,200
But the second aspect is another directive piece of EU law that

217
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,640
has not been talked as much but developed at the same time,

218
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,780
which is a PLD for product liability directive.

219
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,979
And this is the,

220
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:37,820
you know, rules that spell out how you want liability and who is liable for what

221
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:38,650
in the eu

222
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,890
and up until this year,

223
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,690
software was not part of that

224
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,229
officially,

225
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,070
there was a way to get liability for software, right?

226
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,869
But, but so now it has been extended with official roots

227
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,390
and the big thing for

228
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,700
software I think,

229
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,880
and I will start with it and then I will do a bunch

230
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,710
of caveat and everyone will remember me at the start of the sentence.

231
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,340
I'm sorry,

232
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,460
is that

233
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:02,840
the as is close,

234
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,140
does not stand anymore.

235
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:07,599
You cannot

236
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,429
get rid of liability

237
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,130
with the license of a contract on software anymore.

238
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,700
There is a good reason for that,

239
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,140
which is exactly what we were talking about before, right?

240
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,799
The idea of liability is to protect the weakest.

241
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,809
And so you cannot,

242
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,700
you cannot say, hey, listen, uh you all need to use my software.

243
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,690
But if something goes wrong, it's on you.

244
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,669
And let's let's clarify that because

245
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:37,159
some of us know, but I'm sure not everyone does is that that terms of service.

246
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,460
None of us read and just click, agree at the bottom.

247
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,969
Buried in that phone book of an agreement says, like if anything goes wrong,

248
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,250
it's not our fault.

249
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,000
-- It's your problem to deal with.
-- Right.

250
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:52,450
And also that we can change it at any time with maybe 30 days notification.

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,409
You don't actually have to agree to it. Which,

252
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,580
you know, as I understand contract law is like, that's not how contracts work,

253
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,530
but apparently they do

254
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,849
well, it's not that well tested in court.

255
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:06,659
But the, the interesting part here is more that for us in open source software,

256
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:06,919
right?

257
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,780
We are used to this, you know,

258
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,570
no warranty, etcetera, etcetera everywhere in our licenses

259
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,390
that doesn't stand anymore.

260
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,799
You cannot get out of liability by just saying, hey,

261
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:22,609
um to use this software and to sign this contract that says that it's all on you,

262
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,320
you cannot do that right

263
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:24,950
now.

264
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,880
That seems really scary, right?

265
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,549
Because if my software is used in a place and people get hurt, I could be liable

266
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,109
as an open source maintenance

267
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,750
that doesn't exactly work this way.

268
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Um There is a special carve out which is that if a software

269
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,080
or product with software is sold and harm someone and the integrator,

270
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,590
the person that sold it and integrated all that code is found liable

271
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,979
normally, the way it works in the eu classically is that they will have to pay a fine

272
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,130
and then they can

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,570
go sue the upstream

274
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,690
their suppliers

275
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,080
to try to recoup some of that

276
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:02,729
is there is a special camera,

277
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,570
they cannot do that

278
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:05,190
for

279
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,640
open or software maintenance.

280
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,969
So we are mostly not concerned

281
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,619
is this for open source maintainers or non commercial open

282
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,849
source?

283
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,380
I don't remember exactly the sentence.

284
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,510
But if it's the same as the CR A in general, like if you're not concerned by the CR A,

285
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,469
you are not going to be concerned by the Plde.

286
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,059
OK.

287
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,729
So, so you are going to be good

288
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,530
because I'm going to assume like Red Hat, for example,

289
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,049
is not going to be able to wiggle out of this by saying like, oh, we're open sources

290
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:32,710
as

291
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,650
-- well.
-- Yes and partial is, is because they are integrators.

292
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:36,719
Right.

293
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,210
Right.

294
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,390
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:39,849
Right.

296
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:43,719
Hat. Open source and then uses it and get sued. They

297
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,200
Red Hat didn't integrate that. That

298
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:46,750
makes

299
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,070
sense.

300
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,669
So, so,

301
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,859
but that's not the only one.

302
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,799
There is a few other things but that the guest

303
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,909
of the idea is that you are not too concerned.

304
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,000
But at the same time, keep in mind that this is a real thing that's happening,

305
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,479
right?

306
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,840
And there has been a lot of discussions around this to make

307
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:01,960
sure that it fits this kind of use case for us too

308
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,359
because it would be really,

309
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:06,780
really problematic for everyone if like there is a vanity

310
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,869
girls that end up being used somewhere

311
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,950
and then everyone goes, Daniel see, Daniel

312
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,210
Sanber

313
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,090
says that he pays

314
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:12,390
for

315
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:13,580
losses,

316
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,020
right?

317
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,890
If everybody sued lock for Jay for the lost productivity of dealing with that issue,

318
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,489
that would be

319
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:19,554
dollars.

320
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,164
Yeah, exactly. So that the uh the outcome of this year

321
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,674
is this right?

322
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:27,835
And so this worked pretty well.

323
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:30,465
There was a lot of lobbying and a lot of learning by Friano

324
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:30,775
pins,

325
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:35,304
people trying to do the work on the eu to, to make sure they align well,

326
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:36,940
and yeah,

327
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,200
so

328
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,710
not too really scary.

329
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,369
The end result is not too scary, but it's also changes coming in our world uh slowly.

330
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,380
And it's also uh uh

331
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,969
and that's what generated this also um day at for

332
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,409
them

333
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,630
because the idea was, hey, um

334
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,479
we don't talk a lot

335
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:02,320
with policymakers and policymakers don't know a lot about us,

336
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,320
but we are kind of important and they are starting to be aware of that.

337
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,440
So maybe we should have this kind of, of,

338
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:14,099
of channel communication more open and try to start building this kind of advocacy

339
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:17,840
and do a bit of retrospective and moving forward from what happened this year.

340
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,119
Well, I mean,

341
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,429
what's fascinating to me is like apple

342
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,369
straight up in their security advisories is like

343
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:23,505
open

344
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:24,794
source, like they just list open

345
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,724
source after open source after open source package.

346
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,034
And then plus, you know, a bunch of stuff and

347
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,354
iMessage that we wrote and oops,

348
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:33,565
same thing, you know, Windows a bit less open source in their announcements.

349
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,585
But still, you know,

350
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:35,304
there is,

351
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,104
well, they're apparently bringing pseudo to Windows like

352
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:38,405
there

353
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:38,554
is

354
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:41,354
a

355
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:42,065
lot of stuff

356
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,705
and it's just II I

357
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,304
do. And, well,

358
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,799
it is kind of amazing to me that the world is literally built on

359
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:54,630
open source and I guess because it's worked so well and so quietly succeeded.

360
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,000
But yeah, I,

361
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:01,030
I suspect less than 1% of policymakers know about to find what open source is.

362
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:01,390
Well,

363
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:05,479
yes and no. And that goes to what I have problem with in there.

364
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,000
So I think there's a few things here. So the first one is

365
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,700
they are aware of free software far more than open source software.

366
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,119
And, and for one that I'm going to make the distinction, I'm going to, to do it.

367
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:23,880
Uh And part of the reason here is that the free software movement have been far more

368
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:32,099
focused on end user rights on freedoms on advocacy for this, right?

369
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,900
And part of that intersected a lot with digital rights movements,

370
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:36,580
right?

371
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:41,049
Which uh may not be, I don't know what the situation is in, in a around this,

372
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,280
outside of the eff of course.

373
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,059
Um but

374
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,809
in, in Europe, there is a lot of advocacy work on, you know, digital rights.

375
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:52,130
And that intersect a lot with,

376
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,739
with free software advocacy

377
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
and end user software advocacy.

378
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,880
So people like the EU commission, for example, will know really,

379
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,239
really well stuff like Linux

380
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:03,679
as a desktop,

381
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:04,440
right?

382
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,580
Or stuff like lib

383
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,630
office, right?

384
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,359
Or open office in the old time, all this kind of stuff because,

385
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,159
because they deal with that a lot,

386
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,219
like they literally also have mandate to try to use it on their own desktop.

387
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:21,330
They have a lot of work on that front has been done.

388
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:22,380
Gy

389
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,580
is also a thing that you will hear around when

390
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,630
you talk with people working around the EU policy.

391
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,099
So there is a lot of this

392
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,840
um

393
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,010
which,

394
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,700
and, and that's good,

395
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,260
right?

396
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,820
Like this is stuff we see in the D MA also, for example, for so Digital Market Act,

397
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,580
people may have heard about it in our committee due to Apple compliance, I just

398
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,900
quotes around

399
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,169
uh the name uh around that.

400
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,760
And there was a lot of discussion around this with

401
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,640
the U commission where they came to people saying,

402
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,419
hey, uh do you think that this is

403
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:57,442
actually useful to you and compliance the way they did it?

404
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:57,833
Let,

405
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,692
let's say that there was a lot of loafing

406
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:02,112
uh nervous loafing in the room at this question

407
00:17:02,682 --> 00:17:03,992
and, and the,

408
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:08,392
but, but the D MA among other things say that hey, uh you should

409
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:12,902
your, your protocols for messaging, for example, need to be open,

410
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:13,713
right?

411
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:16,243
Whatsapp need to be able to interact with other things.

412
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:18,665
Facebook messenger need to be able to interact with other things.

413
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:20,334
And so there is a lot of work around that.

414
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:24,805
So, so if you look at it from a user end user perspective

415
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:28,035
and free software and open standard and stuff like that.

416
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:28,694
At this front,

417
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:33,295
there is a lot and lot of work on this and this is something policymakers know about,

418
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,084
at least in the eu

419
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:37,525
where you are, right is the open source spot

420
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:41,010
and, and, and that's where things differ a bit because

421
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,650
open sources use even malls and free software for infrastructure.

422
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,140
And we have some interesting data that came out this year, right? Stuff like

423
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,459
80% of every app

424
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,479
is made of open source software.

425
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,979
It's an average, right? But 80%

426
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:01,420
and they found that 96% of every app they scanned was using open source.

427
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,400
That's a synopsis data, uh data study if I remember correctly.

428
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:11,260
And so when you bring up this kind of data, there is a lot of, oh, well, um

429
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,869
that's a lot

430
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,079
that's everywhere we want, right?

431
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,489
Like everything is open source at this point, right?

432
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,060
Even your property app is by far open source.

433
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,170
What is interesting? And that's a question I ask in that room. So if you go on the

434
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,900
f website, you can find the recording of everything that was said and done here.

435
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,619
So you, you will hear me challenge people a bit.

436
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,560
Um

437
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,800
uh Among the thing is that

438
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,719
everyone in this room, nearly everyone was paid

439
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,880
for their work on free for free software or

440
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,800
on operative software or on advocacy for these things.

441
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,189
And my point is that this is not the people doing the 80%.

442
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,619
And that's not to say that, you know, it is bad that people are paid to do this.

443
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,739
No, that's great.

444
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,280
But I have not seen at any point in the discussion,

445
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,449
any acknowledgement or even a hint of an understanding that these people exist

446
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,939
that this 80% exist.

447
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,020
Everyone talk about free standard and then uses result and free software.

448
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,939
But the talks about stuff like J

449
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,739
or open SSL or look for jail, all that stuff is

450
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,400
not happening.

451
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,760
It's infrastructure,

452
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,619
it's invisible by definition.

453
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:26,800
Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,800
So that's why I have a bit less hope, I suppose.

455
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:30,660
Um

456
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,219
But it,

457
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:35,069
it has been interesting to see the the there

458
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,420
is an existing big free software and digital wide advocacy

459
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,979
but that's separated from infrastructure

460
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,030
and that's where we see a lot of this collision, right? Because peop when

461
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,949
policymakers work on this topic, they work on it based on the end user point of view

462
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,829
because that's what they know.

463
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,699
Well, I mean, it's a perfect example of this.

464
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,650
I actually read my local electrical code book, right?

465
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,430
The the abridged version, which is only 100 and 50 pages.

466
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,209
Most people don't do stuff like that, right?

467
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,939
And it's, it was clear to me in reading this book,

468
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,400
it was fascinating because I could read a paragraph.

469
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,689
I'm like, oh, what happens if and then the next paragraph is like,

470
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,329
and that's why we use armored cable.

471
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,229
So if somebody puts a nail through it, they don't die.

472
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,069
You know.

473
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,280
And I think by definition, maybe it's like a, a weird form of Survivor bias in that

474
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,469
all the,

475
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,089
all the software that's truly successful as infrastructure

476
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,310
by definition is so

477
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,750
quiet.

478
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,369
It just works like,

479
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,260
you know, you just pull in lip curl because what else would you do? Right.

480
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,640
You just pull in lip curl and it just works 99.9% of the time

481
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,329
and they'll 0.1 over a percent of the time. It doesn't work for you.

482
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,849
It already didn't work for somebody else who

483
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,800
filed the bug report and they're fixing it,

484
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,579
right. You know, I

485
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,810
think there is

486
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,280
multiple

487
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,500
aspect here. One of them is, yes, of course, it works, right.

488
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,800
And that's partially why it won. I think the other reason, the reason why

489
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:57,900
what I call open source one and I say open source, not face of all

490
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,270
things

491
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:59,099
that one

492
00:20:59,540 --> 00:20:59,729
and,

493
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:02,770
and the fact that 80% like an average of 80% of every

494
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,489
app is open source means that we want right at this point.

495
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,020
The ID one proper

496
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:07,660
Sowa

497
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,530
is now rare.

498
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,189
It's

499
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,869
the exception.

500
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,670
It's the glue that holds a bunch of like essentially it's that it's like red hats.

501
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,709
A perfect example of this like red hat opens, shift is a very thin

502
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,790
of Red hat glue sitting on top of

503
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:21,530
Kernes

504
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,500
and, and what that means is that open source won, right?

505
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,689
Like open source is a default at this point for everything.

506
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,650
And that's not how we think about it usually, but that's right.

507
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,770
And, and one of the reason it won

508
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,449
and that's something I've brought up and I talked with a bit of

509
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:37,729
Os co si people around it and they agree with me is that

510
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,099
we would not be able to do software as complex if it was not open source.

511
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:43,699
And the reason for that

512
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:47,869
is because you would need too many lawyers to handle contracts and procurement

513
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,880
for every single piece

514
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,410
the infrastructure to handle all this licensing. And even if

515
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:56,035
it costs nothing, I'm not even talking of cost of the software,

516
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,614
but even if the cost was free

517
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,125
in terms of beer for

518
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:02,305
beer, uh I have to do that when we start talking about free software.

519
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:06,494
Um is you would need to

520
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:08,694
handle a contract with the supplier,

521
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,319
which means it has to go through procurement,

522
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,140
it has to go through people that don't know what it is,

523
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,839
how it works and you have to explain it and they have to violate

524
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:17,260
it and they have to do that every year or every two years,

525
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,420
you need to maintain all of this.

526
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,229
If you use it in a new code base, maybe you need to change your license.

527
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,500
How do you know that go talk to legal? Right.

528
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,420
The advantage of the open source stuff and that's why it won for every packages,

529
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,939
right on every language where you python everything you can do ping and it just work.

530
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,579
I mean, no, it's fighting doesn't work, but that's a different discussion.

531
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,599
Um It's because

532
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,000
you don't have to do any of that because the open source, you can,

533
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,420
you, you are the developers, look at him like, oh yeah, that's a license.

534
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,739
I know this is officially approved,

535
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,369
whatever I can just download it and not have to talk to anybody,

536
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,780
right? It's self service and that's why it won because it's easy. It's simple.

537
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,500
And there is not a lot of

538
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,140
organizational cost around it.

539
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,579
Like you don't need to build the whole organization.

540
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,489
And I think building on that too,

541
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,839
one thing I've noticed because I've just been through

542
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,869
this again where I was picking between 10 vendors

543
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,979
in open source.

544
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:09,170
I generally don't have a hard time choosing

545
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,709
because there's typically one or two clear winners.

546
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,040
But more interestingly, the vast majority of open source I use,

547
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,439
I did not pick because it's in the dependency chain.

548
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,569
You know, I picked

549
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:18,920
uh

550
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,589
Python panda and well, it,

551
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,010
it does a bunch of stuff and pulls in other stuff or I picked, you know, Python NLTK

552
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,599
or at a high level, you know, a, a PDF parser.

553
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,650
And I can't help but think because I just literally

554
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,630
spent four days evaluating 10 different vendors for a thing.

555
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,030
And that's that's a not inconsequential amount of time and cost.

556
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,310
But, yeah,

557
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,469
and then if I also had to on top of that

558
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:44,469
to handle all the software licensing issues and contract negotiations and,

559
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,680
you know, the ever classic, like, well, what does this cost?

560
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:47,239
Well,

561
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,500
we're gonna have to talk to you about that because we want to get as much as we can.

562
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,819
Yeah. I, it, it would slow things down horrifically.

563
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,459
Like, uh, my web des would never get anything done.

564
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:58,310
Yeah.

565
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,550
And, and the, so that's one aspect

566
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,650
in this aspect is important to keep in mind because

567
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,209
if that's a defining element that made it one,

568
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,099
it means that anything you do that go against that

569
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,270
is going to be a non secret.

570
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,280
You can't do that

571
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,479
even if you try, it's not going to survive.

572
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,900
And that's when a lot of discussion about a people need to

573
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,040
the, you know,

574
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,140
define how they decided which dependency to use on all. Like

575
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,349
you are bringing it back. So it's not going to work.

576
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,079
So question, did anybody from industry or commercial software come and say, hey,

577
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:37,560
like we need the car vote for open source so we can keep strip mining it and using it.

578
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:38,790
Otherwise it might go away

579
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,000
by definition, they can't do that

580
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,839
because if they knew how much they were using it,

581
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,589
they would not use like the things that make it work is

582
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,709
that you don't have to talk to anybody to get it.

583
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,280
Right. That's what we just said. Right.

584
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,569
What made it work is that the developer decide by

585
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,680
themselves and never have to talk about it to anyone,

586
00:24:58,739 --> 00:24:59,099
Susie.

587
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm not even thinking of it as strict mining because that's not how they got there.

588
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:03,099
Right.

589
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,300
That maybe the behavior we see from the outside

590
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,510
and we interpret it as being a conscious decision,

591
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,810
but that's not how it works.

592
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:12,239
Right. It's more if I want to get my job done,

593
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm going to use open source. So the way I'm never going to get my job done,

594
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,849
they imagine behavior from that.

595
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Well, it's so in other words, it's not a conspiracy,

596
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:24,939
it's just 1000 people happen to come up to the same conclusion.

597
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,819
No, seriously. And this is a thing that happens, right?

598
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,939
Where it's, it's not some global conspiracy of strip mining. It's just,

599
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:34,500
there's 1000 developers that all needed a lip, a library for web stuff and well,

600
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,189
-- they grab lip
-- curl.

601
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:37,660
All right, let me steer this conversation.

602
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,449
We gotta, we gotta think about kind of getting on the downhill of this podcast.

603
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:43,530
So, ok, so you have this meeting at Fos

604
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,170
Dem

605
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:47,189
like what are some of the outcomes that came of that?

606
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,369
Like you said, at the beginning, you have hope,

607
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,880
which you telling me you have hope fills me with joy.

608
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,319
So I'm curious what that is?

609
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:57,239
Oh yeah. In two or three decades we made progress

610
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,140
and That's

611
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:58,270
my

612
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,550
hope.

613
00:25:58,699 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm not kidding.

614
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,400
Uh,

615
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,829
I think people forget how slow

616
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,770
governments and legislation moves fundamentally to keep

617
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,280
up with the world of change.

618
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,680
-- Yes.
-- But in this case, I don't think it's a government education problem.

619
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,910
It's a fact that we are not visible.

620
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:16,959
Like,

621
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,829
like, even if I talk to people that are deeply inside that domain. Right?

622
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,469
And that made the work all year long for this false stuff.

623
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,579
And I explain, you know, 80% of the software you,

624
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,760
you put yourselves and numbers on your slide, 80% of the software is open source.

625
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,489
And all right,

626
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,939
where does this? 80% come from?

627
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,540
They look at me and they never thought of that.

628
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,500
That doesn't even talk show into their mind

629
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,619
was the answer I get most of the time is, well, big companies that pay people to do it.

630
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm like, ah

631
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:54,579
this is something everyone bring up to me even at for

632
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,530
them where people you know, should know better.

633
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,770
There are developers working on free on

634
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,380
software.

635
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,130
Everyone bring it to

636
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:00,329
a

637
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:00,819
no,

638
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,869
that's all these big companies like Google Microsoft and

639
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,319
all that pay people to work on these things.

640
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,930
And every time I have to bring example, explain

641
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,209
the fact that that's not how it works.

642
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,839
They are flabbergasted.

643
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,209
Well, this speaks to Josh, you know, well,

644
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,729
tell your one less than one developer story.

645
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:20,410
-- Well,
-- I'll tell a better story than that.

646
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,369
So I just pulled up the report, I will put a link to it in the show notes,

647
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,109
Tide lift in 2023 did a survey

648
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,010
about

649
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,839
like who are you like, are you an open source developer?

650
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,089
And are you being paid for this?

651
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:31,699
And,

652
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:37,224
and the numbers are 60% of open source developers are unpaid for the work they do.

653
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:41,314
13% are like professionals actually being paid to work

654
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:44,574
on this stuff and 23% are semi professional.

655
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:47,364
It says, which means they make some money from their open source work.

656
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,625
-- But 60% that's a lot.
-- Keep in mind this is Tide lift,

657
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,064
which means that

658
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:54,864
the people they dutch

659
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,824
by design of what they do um

660
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,800
-- will over represent people that get some money out of
-- probably. Yeah, for sure.

661
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:04,780
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

662
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,359
So this is probably uh uh the, the real number is probably far bigger than 60

663
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,369
something percent.

664
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:10,660
Uh

665
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,939
OK. This floor is 60 but still that, that's a ton.

666
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,550
-- If you
-- think about the friction of there's

667
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,469
literally hundreds of thousands of widely used,

668
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:20,780
you know,

669
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,550
small packages that are less than one developer

670
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,400
and that one developer has multiple packages.

671
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:29,430
Yeah, if one or two of them quit, no big deal. But the the friction if,

672
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,670
if chunks of them start to go away or not maintain it,

673
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,109
it, it adds up. And I think

674
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:36,599
I,

675
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:38,770
I think part of the problem though is just people

676
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,630
don't understand the law of large numbers here where,

677
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,469
you know, your average package has easily 1000 dependencies

678
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,569
and if one of them breaks, chances are the whole thing is not going to work very well.

679
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,099
So suddenly I see people getting that,

680
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,040
they are starting to get scared about that.

681
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,510
We start to see a lot of people talking about that.

682
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,599
So I think that came in mostly because

683
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,689
people keep seeing these huge numbers every time

684
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:05,290
they do an update of the packages on seasons with thousands numbers on what the heck.

685
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,189
So I think this, this as we started sipping then

686
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,109
what has not seeping is where does this come from?

687
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,400
How does it get produced?

688
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:18,000
This is something we don't talk a lot about,

689
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:18,770
right?

690
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:21,739
Because I mean, in the, in the, in the, in the physical world,

691
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,459
there's no analog to this, there's no

692
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,650
people producing thousands and thousands of free

693
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,380
products and giving them out for free.

694
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:28,829
Like

695
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,250
that's just not a thing

696
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,400
on, on the scale of open source.

697
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,780
Well, I don't know about you but my grandma always gave me tomatoes and lettuce

698
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,979
and, and like,

699
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:40,670
but she's not giving them to

700
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,729
thousands of people and they're not

701
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,920
based on the restaurant offer tomatoes.

702
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,680
But that's because it's free to use it for more people. Right?

703
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,640
And that's where also there is a problem.

704
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,079
But I think the other aspect is how many times a year

705
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:54,119
do you go

706
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:58,079
on? You? You know, so I, I'm pretty sure everyone here does not, uh,

707
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,920
use the T VA lot, but let's imagine. Right.

708
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,339
You, you, you, you go on your news show, right? Whatever it is

709
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,140
and

710
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,140
you get an engineer talking about roads.

711
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,689
Ok. That's never happened

712
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,890
at best. You may get a politician or a local person talking about roads.

713
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,849
You will never get an engineer talking about roads

714
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:22,719
and, and that's the same problem we have here. right? We don't exist. And

715
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:26,369
what and the other aspect is we are,

716
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:30,229
you know, we're talking about people leaving being a problem.

717
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:32,119
They don't even need to leave,

718
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,760
even people keeping doing it

719
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,079
if they are not catching up,

720
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,650
if they keep being a bit, you know below and saying, oh,

721
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,540
there was all these things I need to do but

722
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:46,500
I will do them next month when I have time and then next month is never happen, right?

723
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,939
Because there is always new things,

724
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:53,180
you can get degradation even if people keep saying and doing the thing, right?

725
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,439
And,

726
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,930
and that can accumulate over time.

727
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,670
We're talking of at least two or three decades of this at this point,

728
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:03,430
something the US and a you know,

729
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,359
you are starting to get the organization that the whole infrastructure work,

730
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:06,770
right?

731
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:09,810
And in other aspects. And so the

732
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:16,189
the part where I am hopeful is that I do think first there is tourism first,

733
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:19,250
I do think that if we manage to,

734
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,640
to tell that story.

735
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,290
If you manage to explain the realities of this 80% right?

736
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,550
We have these numbers and we can use it, we can bring the 80% of everything is us.

737
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,969
And then tell the story of what us mean, who are these people? What do they do?

738
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,489
We can have real engagement and real discussion over the long run on this.

739
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,130
And the uh another aspect that making hopeful on this

740
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,689
is that it would not be expensive to fix.

741
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,050
Like

742
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,890
the example I give all the time rust is doing a

743
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,449
lot of cleaning stuff up at the lower level in this infra

744
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,859
level, right?

745
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,030
And

746
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,489
this is not only about the memory safety,

747
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,949
this is about the fact that I was talking about that with uh who was it?

748
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:01,989
Uh

749
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:03,339
Well, someone from

750
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,310
Tiff um Louis from Tide

751
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,199
Lift and, and some people as a lib as a uh lib

752
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:10,989
evg uh person

753
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,719
around this because they moved lip svg from C to Rust.

754
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:19,750
And the reason they did it was not because of some memory safety,

755
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:21,880
but because they could actually get tests

756
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,630
like you can actually test your code.

757
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,939
I know that's really surprising for sea people, but that's possible. I promise you

758
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,430
you can have documentation.

759
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:32,050
I know that's also really, really surprising for people working on sea.

760
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,069
You can have a compiler

761
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,989
with their message that when you read are useful.

762
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,760
I know that's really surprising for people working on sea. I worked on sea.

763
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,390
But that's possible. We have, we have clean water.

764
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:45,829
That's possible.

765
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:46,750
And so,

766
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,979
but, but we are loafing but you can have packages.

767
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:51,869
That's also something you for. See people,

768
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,050
you can go cow and

769
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,689
-- so your thing and it
-- works.

770
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,949
There is no

771
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,900
like c equivalent of pie, pie or

772
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,689
one for a C++ called

773
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:04,339
Conan, but it's not well used.

774
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,780
No. And it's a pain for a lot of reason. Part of that is the memory safety. That's

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,329
all the discussion. But, but this,

776
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,989
a lot of inac

777
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,869
work was built on sea and not only c but other things

778
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,280
and the thing was bring is not the memory safety stuff.

779
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,599
I mean, it's nice and I, I care about that too, but I care far more about the fact that

780
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,930
the people working on this can get the same

781
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,229
result in less time and losing less sanity.

782
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:30,810
Well,

783
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,739
it's just using more modern tools like we don't build houses with rocks anymore.

784
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,810
We use hammers

785
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:37,760
or nail guns or,

786
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,479
you know, 3d printers or whatever

787
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,680
we build far more stable one and faster with that.

788
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:43,569
Right.

789
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,290
And that's, that's, and that's the point here I'm making is that

790
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
I have hope because

791
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,180
rust in itself and I, I have talked with people that have been

792
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:55,619
pretty close to the rust team at the time and all at Mozilla,

793
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,349
it was what, 10 years

794
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,869
of a dozen people maximum. A lot of them turns a

795
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,500
total cost is probably something around 10 to 20 millions over 10 years.

796
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,930
That's not money I have.

797
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:12,090
But from a point of view of the impact of the infrastructure, that's a really

798
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,699
cheap price. Yes.

799
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,399
-- Oh, we,
-- my,

800
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,810
my city easily spent more than 10 to $20 million trying out a

801
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,330
new road construction technique for the ring road which let's just say,

802
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:23,879
uh it didn't work.

803
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,949
And so I'm going to get into a close here, right, which is on my hopes,

804
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,250
which is if we can tell that story

805
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:33,279
and we can get this kind of story visible,

806
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:38,388
we can engage on this and we can get work done on this kind of tooling and work to

807
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:41,259
make everything better from the ground up,

808
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:44,967
might rebuild this infrastructure and make it bolster it by making it possible for

809
00:34:44,978 --> 00:34:48,928
the people that already I'm already doing the work to do it better.

810
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:53,039
And the all the reason I have hope is because we already have people doing it.

811
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,998
I mean, it's one

812
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:56,018
group and it's a really tiny one.

813
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:59,479
It's the stf right as a sovereign tech fund in Germany. But

814
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,110
we have done so many battles in the past

815
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,149
two decades.

816
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,750
And so I have hope that we can keep building on this

817
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,850
and engaging with policymakers and with the public and by public,

818
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,360
I mean, our public,

819
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:18,090
our field to make it more visible that the reality of everything you are building

820
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,810
is people doing this on their free time

821
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,649
and there is a lot of them

822
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:24,290
and you depend on them

823
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,709
and

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,139
they use really

825
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,000
educated and painful tools

826
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,110
and

827
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,939
it would be relatively cheap to do that work.

828
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:35,659
But that's the work we need to do together.

829
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,780
Right. Because no single company will invest in this.

830
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:42,229
So we have going to have to find ways to organize

831
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,209
both as maintenance and that's really hard because as maintainers,

832
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:46,199
we don't have time for this.

833
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,739
We already spend our free time keeping the road running.

834
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,270
I mean, that's, that's a sad reality, right?

835
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,989
Do you want, you want me to engage in advocacy? That's, that was the topic.

836
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,070
A lot of the topic at the first them in, in this room around this.

837
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,159
I'm like, great. So I can let a bridge fall. So I have time to come do my advocacy.

838
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:05,120
That's what you're asking me.

839
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:07,389
And then everyone looked at me and like,

840
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:10,530
what do you mean you are not keeping bridge up?

841
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:14,050
Well, actually, yes, I do. And that's part of the problem.

842
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,050
That's, that's part of the story we need to tell if we want to get progress on this.

843
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:18,070
Well,

844
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,489
and I mean, the challenge is people won't encounter that unless they are, you know,

845
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,389
like a red hat again, I would work with developers who would say straight up,

846
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,090
like I can fix this in three months when I have a free weekend.

847
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,580
And, you know, as a red hat.

848
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,489
We'd be like, ok, we're gonna fix it and ship it and, you know,

849
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,010
just can you take our patch and we'll, we'll test it and everything.

850
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,110
And, uh,

851
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,459
there's so few people that actually have done this kind of work and interact with it,

852
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,739
interacted with it and understand it.

853
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,939
And like you said, there's, there's no money, there's,

854
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:45,790
there's no company collecting money that's going to pay for lobbying.

855
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,110
I have a, a very interesting data point that we kind of close it out on is

856
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:51,929
the Linux

857
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,149
foundation's

858
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,360
budget is like $200 million.

859
00:36:56,939 --> 00:37:00,620
There's money around for this kind of stuff.

860
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,590
It's just, unfortunately,

861
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:06,389
-- I don't think we have like, sorry,
-- 100 and 77 million.

862
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,699
No, it's, it's 100 and 77 million,

863
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:11,449
7 million this year.

864
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,580
Last year, last year it was 100 and 77.

865
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:16,510
I have a few questions for you

866
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,820
is because, um, I mean, the open ssf got how much money for

867
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,129
-- me?
-- I have no idea. Off the top of my head.

868
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,610
It's millions. I know that.

869
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:27,520
Exactly. Right. Same, same kind of stuff. Right.

870
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:31,850
I could go the CNCF the cloud native. I don't remember what foundation

871
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,219
got a budget, right. Which is pretty big with, if you look at the money coming in.

872
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,110
Um

873
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,870
Do any of, you know, all this is spent?

874
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:41,870
No,

875
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,510
that's one thing I specifically asked the Sovereign Tech Fund, uh,

876
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,879
when they came to me and said, you know, do you want to do some work with us?

877
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:49,689
One of my questions was kind of, what's your overhead?

878
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,459
Like, how much of the X dollars you get?

879
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:55,360
How many of them actually go out the door to do work versus, you know,

880
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,189
get eaten up internally, running the system.

881
00:37:57,419 --> 00:38:01,080
And they were at a bit less than about 20% overhead,

882
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,709
which is actually pretty damn decent for, especially a small

883
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,500
organization.

884
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,689
Ironically, the smaller you are,

885
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,330
the worse it is because there's just functions you have to do.

886
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,429
But in theory, as they get bigger,

887
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,159
that number should actually maybe even drop as a percent.

888
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:17,540
But yeah, like looking at some of these other foundations, I'm just like,

889
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:22,020
yeah, we're like, it's over $100 million a year going out in expenses. Like,

890
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,469
so the thing to keep in mind is

891
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,850
it's not even overhead, right?

892
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,020
It's what is it, what is it invested in because it may not go into overhead, right?

893
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,330
It may just also be these decisions are made.

894
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,580
I was saying, for example, free software advocacy group

895
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,330
manage to have pretty good lobbying and around the same thing for digital rights.

896
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:46,750
And that's not a bad thing, right? I'm not saying we should take the money.

897
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,409
That's not the discussion we have here, right?

898
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,669
But they manage organized for this

899
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,129
and partially this come from all this kind of money and, and stuff. The Mozilla

900
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,439
Foundation spent quite a lot of money on advocacy for these kind of things too.

901
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:58,590
And that's a good thing.

902
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,600
Um.

903
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:00,689
Mhm.

904
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,189
We can't expect maintenance.

905
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,330
And so, so there is a discussion we may also have, which is how do we

906
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:10,050
make advocacy for maintainers a thing?

907
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah. Right.

908
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,969
And that's where I sit down where I have hope that if we can make that happen,

909
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:20,550
we will have results pretty fast and we can engage,

910
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,419
people will be interested in what we say.

911
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,550
And we have now the numbers on the proof that these things are here,

912
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,929
that we have an impact.

913
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,979
And if we talk with policymakers,

914
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,379
they have at least in the EU or I know the N A may be a bit different, but at least in the EU

915
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,370
infrastructure is something they understand.

916
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,320
Yep. Yep.

917
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,510
Right. For sure. And so if we can engage and talk with them, we can get results.

918
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,939
And the free, the free open source software is a free software movement,

919
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:47,639
got results.

920
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,870
There is money being spent every year into

921
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,379
really end user targeted free

922
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,719
software by the EU.

923
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:58,469
And a lot of it may never end up used for a lot of reasons because it may not be,

924
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,699
it's not easy to market something when you, you know,

925
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,540
market it mostly as, oh, it's freedom,

926
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:03,719
right? Can I use it?

927
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,870
No, it's fully comp

928
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:08,010
complicated and we can't pay a designer and we do not

929
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,979
have any users so we couldn't make it user friendly.

930
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:14,500
Well, we don't use it but it's still here. Right. It exists and it works,

931
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,600
we need to find a way to tell these stories

932
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:23,379
and that's what I would say is also important for, for security, almost precisely

933
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:25,050
for

934
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,350
safety.

935
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,149
Yeah.

936
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,360
Yeah. Right. Right.

937
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,489
And, and cybersecurity is a part of that

938
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,969
cybersecurity is part of safety, but safety is larger than that because,

939
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,280
like,

940
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,340
we don't only have cybersecurity problem here.

941
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,600
Right. It's also

942
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,360
really more simple things like, hey, um,

943
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,320
do we have the proper, like, you know, we're talking about, uh there is a lot of

944
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:49,169
on memory, safe channel. That's great.

945
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,419
But it's not only that, it's also that, oh, the pacemaker crashed,

946
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,000
right.

947
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,219
That's

948
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:53,530
right.

949
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:54,929
Right. All

950
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,969
the recently there was a thing, it was a, um, a gli

951
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,810
um

952
00:40:58,929 --> 00:40:59,500
uh

953
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,169
um uh

954
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,280
for diabetes

955
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,320
people, right? People who have diabetes

956
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,419
was and the pump, the incident pump coming for it

957
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,320
would

958
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:11,800
show you

959
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:13,840
the wrong number,

960
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,199
right?

961
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,449
By a decimal.

962
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,159
They would, they would have the decimal once once on the, right?

963
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,409
Um, or once on the right.

964
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:24,229
I'm not sure which one and, but there was a verification, right?

965
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,989
They were showing you what they understood and you could validate the tools, right?

966
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,550
Or not. So

967
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,629
they, they try to push li a bit,

968
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,320
but

969
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,469
that could happen for kind of reasons,

970
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,260
right?

971
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,179
It could be, it's a mistake that could have,

972
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,699
that could easily happen in the UX by just you know,

973
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,770
not buy one on a padding or something like that.

974
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,260
Right.

975
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,010
That's also the reality of people that

976
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,110
are running desperately to keep this running.

977
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,070
Maybe you, you don't know if it did not happen,

978
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:49,520
lays

979
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:51,219
down the stack and open the Swiss d

980
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,649
by someone in Nebraska. Right.

981
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,520
Because that's a mistake that can happen. And so when we talk about this thing,

982
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,949
it's not only cybersecurity, it's also the safety of you.

983
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:03,040
And that's why we end of that's why I think we

984
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,250
need to find a way to do more advocacy on this.

985
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:06,969
I agree completely.

986
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:09,149
All right, I'm gonna call this one because holy cow,

987
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,280
what a fire hose of information as always, I love it.

988
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:12,669
It's

989
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:12,959
a,

990
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,010
you've ruined the rest of my day because I'm just

991
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,620
gonna be thinking about all of this stuff now,

992
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:17,909
which is fantastic, but

993
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,850
