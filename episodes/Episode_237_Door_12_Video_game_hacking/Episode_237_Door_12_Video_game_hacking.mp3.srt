00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,099
December 12th. This topic, I'm so excited about video game hacking.

1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,530
-- How exciting, you
-- know, I like video game hacking,

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,659
especially the older school stuff because

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,460
they're generally not multiplayer games.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,949
So it doesn't harm and stress and like make the experience for other people suck.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,139
-- I mean,
-- OK, so let me, let me clarify when I'm talking about video game hacking.

6
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:20,479
I'm specifically in this context,

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,459
I'm talking about like the speed runners who they trigger these ridiculous bugs

8
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:28,943
cause crazy things to happen in a game.

9
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:34,112
And I will put a link in the show notes to an amazing bug in Super Mario world where

10
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:37,652
they basically place enemies on the screen in certain

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,402
places and they do certain actions and they're by,

12
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,483
by doing those things,

13
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:45,502
they're writing machine code into memory and then they cause an exploit to start

14
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,963
running their machine code to warp them to the end of the game,

15
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:51,493
which is, it's so amazing to see what they've done.

16
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:53,042
But the thing I keep thinking of is

17
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:58,066
when we love to talk about security and hacking and everything going on,

18
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,506
I would say probably 20 plus years ago,

19
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:02,756
there was some really cool research and amazing things.

20
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,125
But I would say today,

21
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:07,795
if you want to see where the most amazing research happening is it is

22
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,386
happening by speed runners in the world

23
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:13,625
of exploit development and abusing computer systems.

24
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,896
And what's always been interesting to me is

25
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:19,505
that the consoles had some of the most amazingly

26
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,279
and strong and time tested

27
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,650
copyright protection schemes, you know,

28
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:29,110
and some of them worked for over a decade or two before they were finally cracked.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,580
I mean,

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,819
which is kind of amazing, you know,

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,110
there was a variety of explanations for that and there's tons of

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,220
videos on youtube about the copy protection and I'm not even talking about

33
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,010
that kind of hacking because that's,

34
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,569
I would say that's its own branch of like video game cracking and

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,669
dumping ROMs and running ROMs and all that kind of stuff.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,050
And that's a whole another ball of wax and it's amazing.

37
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,160
But I just, I love watching speed runners.

38
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:57,550
I love watching how these people are getting arbitrary code execution in games.

39
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,669
And what's really funny is when I started watching

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,129
a lot of these people doing these speed runs

41
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,364
and kind of developing the routes they to take

42
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,694
and how they're going to go fast and stuff,

43
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:08,354
they have their own lingo.

44
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:12,955
And I feel like the terms they're using are starting to line up

45
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,134
with the words we use in security where we're talking about buffer overflows,

46
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:19,115
we're talking about arbitrary code execution and we're talking about, you know,

47
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,145
corrupting memory and it's,

48
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:25,235
it's so much fun and I absolutely love watching the work they're doing.

49
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,725
-- It's so cool.
-- Yeah.

50
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:30,065
No, I'm just looking at this list of, like, lingo and it's, it's, yeah,

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,860
it's, it's interesting. Right.

52
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,460
You know what it really reminds me of is sort of the, the,

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,820
the penetration testing of complex systems where, you know,

54
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,460
you got to get through multiple systems

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,740
and my favorite always being, you know, where

56
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,029
the pen tester just ignores something. And like,

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,789
it's like, yeah, we don't care about the mail server.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,100
We'll just go for the backend database

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,369
and, and, but the security people are like, but you can't do that.

60
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,229
You have to, you have to go through the mail server and the attacker is like, no,

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,860
we don't.

62
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:54,660
Right.

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,399
-- Hold my
-- beer. My version of reality works for me. Sorry.

64
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,119
Or my favorite too is when, when you're pen testing and people are like, oh,

65
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,449
that servers off limits.

66
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,960
It's like,

67
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,440
right.

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,639
OK.

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,130
Yeah. Or my all time favorite was, but why would an attacker do that? Yeah.

70
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,580
Oh, I know. I know. But anyway, it works.

71
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,000
So in the speed running world though,

72
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,119
like in all seriousness when they're doing their

73
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,220
runs and trying to get their world records,

74
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,289
they will create rules where they'll say like in this run,

75
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,779
you can't use arbitrary code execution, you know,

76
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,500
you have to play the game like this or you

77
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:32,496
use these bugs, but you can use these bugs and so they create all these categories,

78
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:35,826
which is really cool because obviously like a great example is if

79
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:38,606
you look at a game like Super Mario World where they can,

80
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:41,276
I think the world record now is like a minute and a half or something.

81
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,296
It's ridiculous. It's,

82
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,246
-- well, it's arbitrary code execution. Right?
-- Oh, ok.

83
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:48,235
Yeah, cause I'm like, I don't even care what sequence of war pipes you use.

84
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:49,106
That seems awful fast.

85
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,111
It's completely ridiculous. Right?

86
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:57,272
But there's, and so obviously that run is fun to watch once, but it's never fun again.

87
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,942
And so by having different categories,

88
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,602
-- you can have like a human actually plays the game,
-- you know what?

89
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:03,391
That's a good point.

90
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,932
Yeah, because like, yeah, watching somebody exploit a buffer overflow.

91
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,671
-- Yeah, you watch it once and it's
-- like, right, I've seen this.

92
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,250
Yeah.

93
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,029
But um but then you watch the guy doing like

94
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,330
the bullet hopping in that one scene in Super Mario

95
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,709
where he gets like a perfect score, you know, with the,

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,000
the wooden battleship thing shooting the giant bullets

97
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,510
and he's like hopping around them like crazy and the

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,570
screen is basically full of bullets and it's just like,

99
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,649
wow, it's, you know, it's like watching a gymnast but it's a video game.

100
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,829
-- Well
-- then they practice and the tass is, are really good

101
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,510
tool, assisted speed run where a bot plays the game.

102
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,559
But anyway, anyway, I guess we're basically out of time.

103
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,390
But I would say the moral of the story here for everyone

104
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,350
is if you want to see some truly amazing security research,

105
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,940
go look at the speed runners and see what they're doing

106
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,739
to these games because it is fascinating and it's entertaining and

107
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,589
you'll probably get some new ideas. So, totally check it out.

108
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,920
Yep. Thanks everybody.
