Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,289
Kurt Siefried and my partner thought crime.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,689
-- Josh Bresser.
-- Holy cow. Do I have a story to tell?

3
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:19,629
So, I have been fighting with my network for the last two days because I've had,

4
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,399
you know, and obviously when you work from home and your home network is down,

5
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:25,639
it is an extremely anxiety filled event.

6
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,159
Right.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,370
It's not like other things. Like,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,209
I don't know if electricity goes out.

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm like, oh, I'll just sit here and read when my network is broken.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,799
-- It fills me with dread.
-- Well, it's something you have to fix

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,490
and worse. If you call somebody in to fix it, they're probably going to make it worse.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,409
Well, and so that's just it. Right. First of all, I made sure it wasn't the internet.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,069
Ok.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,279
And here's what was basically happening is

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,959
intermittently,

16
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:53,900
things would just like, flake out, the whole network would flake out. Right.

17
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:57,759
And for like, one or two minutes and then it would start working out

18
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:58,150
one or

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,790
two minutes,

20
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,450
minutes, like minutes, not seconds, minutes. Right. And

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,888
this kept getting worse and worse

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,449
as time went on

23
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,959
and I'm like freaking out because

24
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,150
obviously I have to work. The internet's not working at one point.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,730
It's just literally like everything was dead

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,449
and I could not get it back.

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,930
So if you were in this situation

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,949
now, remember I also replaced my Google wifi with TP link

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,279
Deos was running my network. What would your assumption be in

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,910
this particular instance?

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,830
Well, that I,

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,819
I actually just had that like plex was behaving a bit badly

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,389
and I just recently upgraded my Google Wi Fi mesh to uh

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,489
what did I buy again? Netgear, no link.

35
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,110
And I forgot to forward the port in.

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,900
So it was just taking a long time to connect because

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,269
it would have to time out and then do something else.

38
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,650
So I would assume like, whatever it is you change to last

39
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:48,209
is

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,639
what

41
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:48,870
broke

42
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,300
because

43
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,680
that's how technology almost sometimes works.

44
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,699
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

45
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:54,830
So I

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,089
obviously take all of the,

47
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,930
the TP link stuff and I start like, doing some tests,

48
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,309
like moving some things around unplugging some things and whatnot

49
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,230
and

50
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:07,550
it seems a little better. I'm like, ok, great. I, that must have been it.

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,190
Then it, it falls apart again and I'm like, oh crap. It's not that.

52
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,330
So my switch

53
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:17,240
in the basement and I have a switch upstairs, Ethernet switches.

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,080
This is funny because I also have a Nintendo switch and I was talking to

55
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,460
someone about this and they thought I meant my Nintendo switch and I'm thinking,

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,250
oh, my, my switch died.

57
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,210
They're like, oh,

58
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,889
well,

59
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,029
that's actually what a normal person would say.

60
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,649
I, I, yes, I, I agree completely. I realized my

61
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,919
mistake eventually.

62
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,210
But anyway, so then I think, ok, the switches are old, they probably finally died.

63
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,889
So I take my old switches, buy new switches

64
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,039
and things seem to work

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,320
and then they don't,

66
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,660
and I'm like, what is going on? Like, this doesn't make any sense.

67
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,720
-- And this is, this is Ethernet,
-- right?

68
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,279
I would start maybe testing cables. Like you can nail a cable or something.

69
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,000
We'll get to that.

70
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:58,860
So my first thought is like, I can't get anywhere on the network, right?

71
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,660
I wired, nowhere wired, nowhere wired on the network,

72
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,449
the whole wire network is dead.

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,009
Right. Exactly. I'm like, what is happening?

74
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,800
This is why my desktop is wired is because so I just wireless can, like,

75
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,250
-- who cares? Man? It's broken. Great. I can work.
-- Exactly.

76
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:20,619
So I'm like, I'm trying everything. I, I literally just take all the TP link stuff out

77
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,539
and I put my old Google Wi Fi back in which is in the e recycling box.

78
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,529
Thank goodness, I hadn't e recycled it yet. So I put that back in, I turn it on

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,070
and nothing works and I'm like, what the heck is going on?

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,020
And I start unplugging things and I'm just like,

81
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,089
I'm trying everything now the whole while I'm doing this. Mind you, I'm I

82
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,419
do my test

83
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,919
and then I would come to, like, this little studio we record and I have in my closet,

84
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,100
I'd come here and check my Linux computer

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,669
and it, oh, this computer always worked.

86
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:58,649
-- So, like a DH CP or I,
-- I don't know, I, I don't know why I'm working on some more testing.

87
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,270
But basically what it ended up being is when this computer went to sleep,

88
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,470
it was basically taking down the entire wired network with it,

89
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,809
but only when it was asleep.

90
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,309
So I, the, the reason it worked intermittently is when this computer would wake up,

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,710
everything was fine.

92
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,369
And normally I don't leave this computer plugged in,

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,329
but I knew we were recording again in two days.

94
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,440
So I thought, oh, I'll just leave it in there plugged in.

95
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,000
There's like that weird QT five application intermix issue where people's wi fi

96
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,160
-- breaks horrifically when they run like a paint application or
-- explain this.

97
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,160
It's so hard to solve a problem like this because I tried so many things.

98
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,920
Every time I would try something,

99
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,579
it, it didn't seem to make sense and it was because modern computers, like

100
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,350
when I put a computer to sleep now it doesn't stay asleep,

101
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,290
they wake up and they go to sleep and they wake up and do stuff and go to sleep and

102
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,890
it was messing with me

103
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,940
when you turn an Apple iphone off. Now

104
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,809
it's still on

105
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,779
like the, the

106
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,839
-- baseband chip. Like, I can find my iphone when it's turned off.
-- That's right.

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,130
And the thing that's, that's really just driving me nuts.

108
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,820
So,

109
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,660
the testing I want to do now is I want to boot this

110
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,220
computer into windows and then see if when windows goes to sleep,

111
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,070
does this happen as well?

112
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,390
Like, is this a Linux problem or is this a computer?

113
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,470
-- I don't know the answer to that yet. Like a
-- Lenovo something or other? Right.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,739
Right.

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,980
I don't know. It's a idea pad. I think it is. Um,

116
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,489
yeah, sure. That's what it is.

117
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:23,809
I tried to get windows to go to sleep. I cannot make windows go to sleep.

118
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,609
Now, granted, I haven't run windows in months and months in this computer.

119
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,570
-- There's like a key combo for it. No,
-- no, it's, it's not the key combo.

120
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,140
I think it's, it's updating all the crap in the background.

121
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,709
I let it sit for like an hour and a half and

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,170
then we recorded this so I had to move back into.

123
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:39,570
But

124
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,440
like, I,

125
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,269
at some point I will boot it into windows and just let it sit for

126
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,079
however many hours it needs to go to sleep and see if it happens.

127
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,859
And at the same time, Kurt, I set up, I've got, uh,

128
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,269
there's this thing called heartbeat that,

129
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,369
that works with elastic search that I can like ping my internal network.

130
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,989
I was peeing a bunch of hosts.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,929
I'm watching ping times I'm watching when things are dropping off,

132
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,420
I'm looking for patterns and

133
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,140
-- like, I could not figure this
-- out here.

134
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,260
This is this guy called Ando or sorry Andrew wrote a

135
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,250
really good blog post willing to it in the show notes.

136
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,519
So what is it? Late last year?

137
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,730
I started experiencing some unusual intermittent connection

138
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,850
issues on my desktop in general,

139
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,600
I had a stable connection with average latency.

140
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,000
However, at seemingly random times throughout the week,

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,119
I would start experiencing sudden 2000 plus

142
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,119
millisecond latency spikes every couple of seconds.

143
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,609
This made all audio and video calling software,

144
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,600
unusable and most long games unplayable.

145
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,320
Right.

146
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,559
-- I mean, yeah, that's, that's a long time, right.
-- Two seconds.

147
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,480
Yeah. No, that's not gonna be usable.

148
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,290
So anyways, then he talks about it,

149
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:36,619
talks about a stuff he troubleshooted the heck out of it.

150
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:36,989
You know, he like,

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,149
tried all these different wi fi dongles and like a whole bunch of stuff.

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,760
-- Right.
-- Right.

153
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,119
And, and I can relate to this because like when my network was having issues, II,

154
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,149
I have all new switches in the house.

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,600
Now I've, I've replaced tons of stuff because obviously

156
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,510
you think of those as the problem, generally speaking. Right.

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,980
So then he, and it was things like, you know,

158
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:59,579
turning off a box fan in his room unplugging his Wcom

159
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,390
drawing tablet,

160
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,149
you know, closing Firefox

161
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,019
and then closing a program called Medibank Paint Pro and that fixed the issue.

162
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,070
A paint program

163
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,049
time out. So like

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,630
he ran Medibank Paint Pro and boom, it happens again.

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,890
And he's like to quote his article, why,

166
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,589
why the hell would digital painting software?

167
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,640
Cause Wi Fi leg spikes? I mean

168
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:23,049
he's not wrong

169
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,440
as it turns out there are multiple instances of

170
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,959
people complaining about this issue with uh the program.

171
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,850
If we take a quick look with process monitor,

172
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,440
we can see it's definitely doing something odd.

173
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,320
So it boils down to

174
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:36,230
it starts querying the registry keys for all

175
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,380
the network interfaces looking at the call stack,

176
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,269
we see that the first non systems library in the call stack is QT five network.

177
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,630
Surprisingly no more debugging is needed as a quick search for

178
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,570
QT five network ping issue will lead you to QT bug dash

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,609
40 332. And basically

180
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,410
any QT five application prior to version 5.14

181
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,519
using the Q network access manager will check for a Wi Fi

182
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,390
interface changes every 10 seconds for the purpose of bear management.

183
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,480
So basically it can like wander around and stuff

184
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:05,209
and this causes massive leg spikes or the packet, the packets to drop entirely.

185
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,269
That's it, right. And here's the best part.

186
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,679
I suppose the workaround is simple enough set the

187
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,359
environment variable QT bear po time out to negative one

188
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:14,420
boom done problem went away.

189
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,230
But like

190
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,190
there are,

191
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,130
can we just imagine for a moment how many thousands

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,630
of people years of time has been wasted discovering this,

193
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,170
like rediscovering this bug.

194
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,910
It's probably a lot.

195
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,489
I would argue that this thing needs like a security identifier and

196
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,169
it needs to be like a critical mandatory fix just based on.

197
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,140
It's like having

198
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,369
a pothole on every driveway in the city, like everybody using QT before version.

199
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,760
What is it? 514 is affected by this? Potentially?

200
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,039
Let's ask the question of if it deserves a security identifier

201
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:49,200
in a little bit because I don't want to talk about that

202
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,039
because I think that's going to be a weird discussion.

203
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,340
I think the more important thing is something that I I this bug

204
00:08:56,349 --> 00:09:01,510
as well as my annoying two days has kind of made me realize is

205
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,250
as much as I thought I had a grasp on technology.

206
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:05,719
I

207
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,200
it's clearly well beyond my ability to comprehend what's going on.

208
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,020
I, I had the exact same thing, right? Like Plex, I changed up my Wi Fi Gear.

209
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,940
The man that Wi Fi six stuff is fast.

210
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:21,200
Yeah, it's really nice when you connect to Plex on a mobile client or whatever,

211
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,979
there's like a few seconds pause and then it

212
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,059
spits out an air saying there's no pinned media,

213
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,549
blah, blah, blah.

214
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,239
And then a few seconds later, it just starts working again.

215
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,469
And I'm like, oh man, what is it?

216
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,130
So like I update Plex on the mobile,

217
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,640
make sure Plex and everything's updated on the server

218
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,539
and no what it was, is I forgot I

219
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,969
had enabled UPNP thinking that U

220
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,840
universal plug and play would

221
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:43,359
let Plex tell the firewall to like I need this port forwarded to me.

222
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,580
So stuff works, right.

223
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,580
That wasn't happening.

224
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,700
So I manually forwarded the port in, you know, set a static IP on the machine,

225
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,450
running it forwarded the port in and

226
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,340
poof pro went away.

227
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:53,669
Right.

228
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:54,890
You know, and, but,

229
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,280
but because it was like one of those things where it's like trying to work

230
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,969
at times and it falls back to something else that works or it just,

231
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,169
yeah, so it kind of appears intermittent even though it's not.

232
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:06,169
But again, chasing it down, I'm like, oh,

233
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,609
I think it's the port but I enabled UPP it should work. And I'm like, well,

234
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,570
I manually signed the port and it started working so clearly

235
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,950
up and I realized I have no way to query my wi fi gear.

236
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,539
Like there's no way to query my Wi Fi gear and say like, hey,

237
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,140
what are you doing with UPNP?

238
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,330
Like, have you done anything

239
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,010
for sure? There's, unless I'm running like a Linux box where I have a log file these

240
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,010
lysis machines as far as I can tell, I have absolutely no way to know what's going on.

241
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,090
Now, I will confuse you further. I also run Flex

242
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,080
and I do not have a port forwarding into my house and it works just fine remotely.

243
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,659
It will work.

244
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:47,619
Uh because it like pulls out or whatever and it enables that kind of back connection.

245
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,239
I don't know. But yeah, like on mine it was, I was getting that weird delay and

246
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,799
like I'm running plex on windows. So maybe that's it.

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,409
Yeah, I run it on Linux

248
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,130
and,

249
00:10:56,719 --> 00:11:00,859
and you know what, you know what? I love those. So I use it for over the air TV.

250
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,705
It's like my DVR and stuff

251
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,744
and I have an Amazon fire stick. I travel with,

252
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:09,385
I can plug the fire stick in, like, in a hotel anywhere in the world.

253
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,135
And I have all my local TV. And it just like works flawlessly from plaques.

254
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:17,104
It's absolutely amazing. Not that I watch a lot of local TV, but it just amuses me that

255
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,424
I can do this.

256
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:19,614
Well, I mean,

257
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,994
what I love is I can actually download my kids show

258
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,625
so they don't suddenly disappear or move to another platform.

259
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,150
Like Pink Panther used to be on Netflix and then one day

260
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,989
it's gone.

261
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,770
And I'm like, oh man, that's bad.

262
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,429
Luckily they'd moved to youtube. So I'm like, ok,

263
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,109
you know, I showed Wolfe and then he's like, oh, ok.

264
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:39,429
-- You know, and like, he's happy again, but
-- back to our topic of the day.

265
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,869
So, so these are two

266
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,849
bizarrely difficult problems to solve that. I think when you think about it,

267
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:48,469
they,

268
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,354
they shouldn't exist. I think in our,

269
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:55,515
-- we'll say knowledge of the past.
-- Well, let's pick on QT developers for a moment

270
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,424
when they

271
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,474
did, they not experience this in testing

272
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:01,395
and see that's the problem is this is one of those things where it's like an

273
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,135
application has to be running that has a

274
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,994
behavior to trigger this pathological behavior in QT.

275
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:09,034
-- They,
-- they obviously didn't because if they did, they would,

276
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:12,195
they would have fixed it or they would just wouldn't have done this.

277
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,570
-- You, you say that, But I,
-- I, I'm completely serious.

278
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,640
Like, look, developers aren't stupid and they're not evil.

279
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,130
And so if they would have seen this sort of,

280
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,710
but my suspicion is they didn't see the

281
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,690
behavior because they were probably doing their development.

282
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,169
They probably had their test suite.

283
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,309
They run the test suite and they're not going to be using their Wi Fi because

284
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,010
obviously the test suite is going to be pounding the crap out of the CPU probably.

285
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,400
And everything seems ok. The test pass, we're fine.

286
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,890
The thing I love is, you know, how all this

287
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:38,304
is,

288
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,114
-- how,
-- how old is it? I did, I open the bug. I did it

289
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,474
2017.

290
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,734
Where do you see this? Sorry. Hang on a second. Where was the year?

291
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,635
I thought there was a year. What was the initial year

292
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,234
-- it
-- was created the 21st of July in 2014,

293
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:52,594
2014. Yeah. 1417.

294
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:55,275
So, yeah, it's an eight year old bug that people are still dealing with.

295
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:58,104
Clearly something has gone wrong here.

296
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:58,945
Well,

297
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:03,304
-- dude, it made the top of hacker news a few days ago. I agree,
-- something went wrong.

298
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:09,809
And if you look at the, the thread of this bug, it is really long, like really long.

299
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,400
It's a lot of people have run into this and ended up here finally.

300
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,640
And this is a perfect example of this.

301
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,539
This isn't just like a nice to have bug fix that improves network performance.

302
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,299
This is something that is eating up

303
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,750
tens or hundreds or maybe even thousands of people years.

304
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,840
-- Well, that's easy to say.
-- Now people are still running into it now though.

305
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,419
That's the thing. So like, why don't we just

306
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:31,770
do something about it?

307
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,190
Like, yeah, we should have done something about it eight years ago,

308
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,679
-- but better late than never. Right? No,
-- that's too easy to say I think.

309
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,320
And I think this is one of my complaints about the security world in general

310
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,840
is we're always like, oh, you should fix this thing. That is bad.

311
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,359
I think what we see often is the

312
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,609
developers don't understand how important something might be.

313
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:52,799
Like, I haven't looked at this bug.

314
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,719
Does it, do they change the severity from the initial filing?

315
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,520
I don't know if I can tell in this bug tracker.

316
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,179
-- It's P two
-- important. Well, now it is. But was it,

317
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,750
was it initially like, I don't, I can't tell.

318
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:08,450
Yeah, there's no, it's I, I cannot figure out the his

319
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,669
there's no history.

320
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,580
But, but anyway, so here's the way to think about this,

321
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,770
I think is when you're a developer, you have a million tasks to do

322
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,869
and someone comes to you with a bug and you might look at the bug and think, oh,

323
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,309
that's not a big deal, right?

324
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,190
Security people will come to you with a bug and say, oh, this is a security issue.

325
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,830
You need to fix it. You might say whatever, no one's ever going to do that.

326
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:31,950
And it is sometimes very difficult for the developers to understand

327
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,390
like what, how do,

328
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,440
how can things line up that this bug maybe

329
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,919
is significantly worse than I think it is initially.

330
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,549
And so I'm never gonna bash developers for not fixing something right away because

331
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,820
if they didn't think it was important,

332
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,950
-- they're not going to fix it.
-- No, no, no, no. What I'm trying to say is

333
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,909
we should advertise the existence of this bug more heavily we

334
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,820
should so that people don't waste time trying to fix it.

335
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,340
They go,

336
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,770
I like they hopefully Google like Q

337
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:57,905
Q

338
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:01,015
five network latency spike and they end up at like QT five

339
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,174
network latency spike.com with a link to this bug or something.

340
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:06,494
Now, this is I agree with you. However,

341
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:09,625
so let's say we assign it a vulnerability identifier,

342
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,775
-- CV E or GSD or
-- whatever this means.

343
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:15,255
Now vendors have to acknowledge it and fix it and there will be more fixes,

344
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,494
ok? But here's my suspicion.

345
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,159
I think in some instances that's true.

346
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:20,760
But

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,799
I don't see a lot of end user

348
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,570
scanning or vulnerability recognition for the most part,

349
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,109
I think,

350
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:31,690
I think you're not wrong in a perfect world,

351
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:36,520
but I am skeptical assigning this an ID would actually

352
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,020
raise its awareness the way we want it raised.

353
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,239
Well, see, but here's the thing,

354
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,609
uh, how many times have we had a security issue that did not have a CV identifier?

355
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:45,440
And

356
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,710
so what? But the moment it gets a CV identifier,

357
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,640
uh All these big corporations, a 30 60 90 day clock starts ticking.

358
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,559
And

359
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,969
obviously, that's probably not going to be so much the case here because, you know,

360
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,880
it's eight years old, probably a lot of people have fixed it.

361
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,719
But more to the point

362
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,760
enough people I feel are still running into this.

363
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,190
This is a pathological bug that is eating up and destroying people's time.

364
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,419
Now,

365
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,630
if I as an attacker could cause some sort of denial of

366
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,090
service remotely on your system with the same two second latency spike,

367
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,169
we would clearly give that an identifier right now.

368
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,250
The thing is this cannot be directly attacker triggered, but it's

369
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,409
triggered commonly enough by, through just software like running

370
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,099
and

371
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,150
pooping all over the network stack. But,

372
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,400
you know, again, like it made the top hacker news. There's tons of people going.

373
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:34,809
Me too.

374
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,549
There's this bug that's eight years old that has

375
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,869
current like relatively up to date feedback in it,

376
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,690
you know,

377
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,630
going well, going back to 2020. OK. That's been quiet for the last two years.

378
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,340
Clearly,

379
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:51,880
there's a whole bunch of people with older versions of QT running into this,

380
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,289
right?

381
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,359
-- And, and
-- so,

382
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,390
OK, so that's enough.

383
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,469
You, you've pontificated on this enough, the point is people need to know that,

384
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,719
that this is a problem and you want to use

385
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,209
security vulnerability identifiers as the way to convey that.

386
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:08,150
Now you can obviously make the argument that this is a denial of service

387
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,915
-- and no one will argue that
-- it has an impact on quality of life.

388
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,915
-- But
-- there's lots of things that do that we don't call security issues,

389
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:14,316
right?

390
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,316
Well, maybe we should.

391
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:18,214
And I mean, that's the question obviously is

392
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:22,635
we draw this weird line of saying like vulnerability, not vulnerability

393
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:23,355
and it,

394
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,005
it's so fuzzy that it's really hard to

395
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,776
say because like something that might affect you drastically

396
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,342
-- might not affect me at all and I won't care about it.
-- Yeah.

397
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:32,582
Well, same thing with security,

398
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,182
right?

399
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:34,582
You don't have much

400
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:39,082
like a credit card processing bug. Home Depot versus a mom and pop shop, right?

401
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:43,062
You know, one's gonna get a giant fine from the sec maybe. And the other one's

402
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,421
not even gonna get noticed. No, I would say so.

403
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,332
The traditional,

404
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:49,732
one of the traditional definitions was it crosses a trust boundary

405
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:50,641
and

406
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,141
I would say two things. One,

407
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:55,229
there's is there not a trust expectation that

408
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,380
when you run software it doesn't like mangle your system.

409
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,589
I don't think anyone would say no.

410
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:03,030
But how many times have you run your web browser?

411
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,410
And it just consumes your CPU until you have to kill it.

412
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,339
-- Like I had Chrome crash twice the other day.
-- I haven't seen that in a

413
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,069
long time.

414
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,709
Ironically enough, loading a hacker news comment thread

415
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,560
seems to have triggered it. It's probably a hacker. I don't know.

416
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:21,082
But anyways 32 restarts that loaded it fine and stopped crashing.

417
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:21,791
But

418
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:22,472
I mean,

419
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,602
the other thing is chrome, for example, now when it crashes,

420
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:28,041
it comes back and it actually reloads all your tabs and you,

421
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,631
-- I mean,
-- they've been doing that for like a decade.

422
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:32,411
Well, but what I'm pointing out is

423
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:36,702
they have minimized the impact of these crashes so that they are not as severe.

424
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,791
So again, that goes back to the quality of life argument.

425
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,041
Like

426
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:42,991
nobody used to upgrade their web browser. Why? Because you have 10 tabs open.

427
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,333
And if you close your browser,

428
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:47,713
you have to manually reopen all those tabs and get back to where you were.

429
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:50,173
Except now you hit that update button and it just bloop

430
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,083
and like 30 seconds later you're back up and running.

431
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,034
Sure.

432
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,754
Do we want to make life better for the end users?

433
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:57,833
Less hassle. Easier

434
00:18:58,313 --> 00:18:59,413
question the, the

435
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:02,473
yes, everyone wants to do that.

436
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:04,274
-- Right.
-- How do we go about doing that.

437
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:08,114
And one of the few sticks or kind of methods we have

438
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,745
is bugs that are labeled as security,

439
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:15,836
typically get sort of forced action and review that regular bugs don't get.

440
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,755
Well, they, they do. But I mean, when I say,

441
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:21,635
like I'm talking about from the end user actually applying the updates.

442
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:26,005
Well, no, not from end users. It's from the, the systems managers

443
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,196
that care about this. The end users don't give two craps

444
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:33,635
about whether a piece of software has a security vulnerability or not.

445
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,489
They literally don't care how many times have you been in a Zoom?

446
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,550
Call someone shares their screen and that little chrome

447
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,280
update button is just sitting there nice and red,

448
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,400
which means they haven't clicked it in a long time,

449
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:47,040
but the users do care about two second latency spikes.

450
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,000
Sure. Sure.

451
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,540
But

452
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,500
here, ok. So here is,

453
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,589
I think the thing we need to think about there are

454
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:57,380
different personas for any sort of buck, right?

455
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,000
And now when we think of things like vulnerability identifiers,

456
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,369
we're thinking about like security teams and system management type people.

457
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,459
That's the persona this has been targeting, right?

458
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,390
You're talking about end users and I'm telling you the

459
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,530
end user persona for security just has a ha ha ha

460
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,630
in the poop emoji.

461
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,660
And that's basically what they care about.

462
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,829
And now you, you are technically correct,

463
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,770
which we all know is the best kind of correct.

464
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,260
That's Right. Exactly. I

465
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,569
actually, we started watching Future Rob and I got to that episode. I was like,

466
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,969
but anyway,

467
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,219
you are technically correct. But now if

468
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,589
we exist in a world today where the vast majority of

469
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,410
organizations cannot functionally handle the

470
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,390
current volume of security identifiers,

471
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,420
it is too great.

472
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,880
And that's because our tooling and process is functionally broken. Right?

473
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,890
-- No one's gonna
-- argue that.

474
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,989
Well, we don't have any, we're just barely getting automation.

475
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,550
-- It's
-- being created like things are getting significantly better right now.

476
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,790
But we're still a ways out

477
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,760
now if we take your

478
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,430
tact of saying, oh, we should assign, identify

479
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,329
all this stuff.

480
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,069
Now, we've gone back to overwhelming people and

481
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,369
the answer isn't going to be, oh,

482
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,869
I'll build better tools. It's going to be screw all this stuff I'm done.

483
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,729
So one comment I would have is there, don't have to be a lot of these.

484
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:08,050
Like, I'm always reminded of

485
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,910
one of the gold standards for security bug is like, does it end up on CNN?

486
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,829
I remember with heartbleed, I was traveling,

487
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,089
remember for the um for uh Red Hat Summit

488
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:18,229
and you know, the I

489
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:21,420
create customs here in Canada, in Edmonton.

490
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,199
And you know, what's the purpose of your visit?

491
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,609
Oh, I'm attending a business conference. Bla

492
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:25,160
bla bla Linux

493
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,989
is like, you know, they do the classic, like, what kind of work do you do?

494
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,010
And he's like, oh, have you heard about Harley and I'm like,

495
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,439
yes, yes, I have. He's like, oh, do I have to replace my router?

496
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:34,410
And I'm like, oh, for bla bla

497
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:34,619
bla,

498
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,079
no, you don't have to replace your router. Just update it, blah, blah, blah.

499
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:37,680
It'll be fine

500
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,439
-- but like,
-- just update it. No, you can't, you can't update routers.

501
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:42,079
Well,

502
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,630
his wifi router thing. Right.

503
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:46,989
Anyways, the point is

504
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,760
when a security bug,

505
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,709
like, ends up making it into normal people's conversation,

506
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,670
we need to do a better job handling it.

507
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,550
Like the log for J thing, that thing needed a good

508
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:00,550
human readable text which we wrote for the GSD.

509
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,949
Like I wrote that thing with workarounds.

510
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,040
Here's the best detection, here's the best hot patches.

511
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,619
Here's the best blah, blah, blah because like that thing made CNN, like it was on BBC.

512
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,170
It was,

513
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,060
it didn't make print media because,

514
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,030
well, yeah, come on,

515
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,670
you'd have to be really bad to bring print media. Did

516
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,020
I guarantee you log for shell was in all the newspapers.

517
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,869
-- I
-- mean, actual physical print. I don't know. I haven't seen a paper,

518
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:24,469
I guarantee

519
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,260
it was in the New York Times,

520
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:26,859
no doubt.

521
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,449
But that's the thing. I'm not saying we do this for every single like thing.

522
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,359
But if a bug is eight years old and

523
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,609
still getting this kind of discussion and activity,

524
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,109
it kind of wins an award.

525
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,170
Ok. I think there might be a different way to think about this.

526
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:45,630
I think you're still trying to hammer the round peg through the square hole,

527
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,630
which you can do as long as you hit it hard enough.

528
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,270
Actually, most people don't know this, but there's a woodworking tool.

529
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,150
I forget the name of it,

530
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,800
but you cut little, um, um, like

531
00:22:54,339 --> 00:23:00,310
not cylinders. Uh, uh What do you call the, like a rectangle peg with the square top?

532
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,130
Like a square peg? We'll call it a square peg, peg, a square peg.

533
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,589
That's a good name because that's what it is.

534
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:05,239
Anyway,

535
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,349
you cut little square pegs and then you literally hammer

536
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,920
them through a round hole and you make them round

537
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,630
and you're thinking um in machining, right? With the uh broaching tool,

538
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:16,540
-- I don't know
-- what it's called.

539
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,400
So a broaching tool is actually turns a round hole into a square hole.

540
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,699
No, no, this turns a square peg into a round peg and then you use it for your dowling.

541
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,260
And because

542
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,060
it's actually because it's hammered through, it's not very smooth,

543
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:28,660
which is good because it holds a glue better.

544
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,939
Anyway. Anyway, that's another story. I forget the name of it.

545
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,699
I'm sure the woodworkers listening are like screaming at me now, but that's great

546
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:35,290
uh at

547
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,829
me on Twitter. So anyway,

548
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,839
there are

549
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,030
various levels of security issues and not right.

550
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,890
If we think of it like AAA sliding scale, right?

551
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,069
There's like the big, big bad stuff, heartbleed log for shell, whatever.

552
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,349
-- There's cross site scripting. And then there's the stuff that matters.
-- Right.

553
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:50,910
And that's just

554
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:51,484
right.

555
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,005
And eventually we cross a line which we've

556
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,165
artificially drawn today that is security vulnerabilities.

557
00:23:57,175 --> 00:24:00,415
But the reality is, it just depends what it is and how it affects you.

558
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:03,635
Now, you can take something like this particular QT issue

559
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,944
which you can, you can make the argument, it's a security vulnerability

560
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:10,050
and we want to push it up into the security

561
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,640
sphere so we can fix it using existing process.

562
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,410
But the reality is I think this falls more along

563
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,989
the lines of like there's this huge bucket of stuff,

564
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,069
be it security or not security issues that

565
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,829
like an update comes out for a library and

566
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,310
you just want the update because it fixes bugs,

567
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,510
it fixes security issues,

568
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,349
it fixes all this stuff and you don't really want to track like the 700 things,

569
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,030
it fixes.

570
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,069
You really just need to take the update.

571
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,650
And I think that's one of the pieces. This is where like depend

572
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,300
AOT on github,

573
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:37,859
right?

574
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,319
Depend

575
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,479
AOT is just like there's a new version, you should upgrade it.

576
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:41,709
Well, a great example, like

577
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,810
there was a red hat product. They, they shipped an update for it.

578
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,209
It had a classic um fail to release memory after use. So that is not a memory leak.

579
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,959
Folks, memory leaks are when you actually like leak the contents of memory.

580
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,589
When you fail to release the contents of memory, that's

581
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,949
technically not a memory leak.

582
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,650
It's this use not released after free, whatever point is

583
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:03,939
the product would die after like 2, 2.5 days. So it got fixed real fast.

584
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:05,459
And even though

585
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,800
it did not technically get labeled as a security bug because like,

586
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,099
an attacker couldn't trigger

587
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:10,510
just

588
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:11,949
days.

589
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,969
And again, I, I was kind of like, I think maybe, well,

590
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:18,180
I was like, regardless of whether or not we labeled it as a security update,

591
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:20,109
it's so bad that people are gonna update.

592
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,410
So,

593
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,439
but the problem is when you have these kind of like two second latency

594
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,469
issues,

595
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,579
it's not so bad that you're going to like, throw your computer out and buy a new one,

596
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:32,439
you're gonna kind of fight it and

597
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:34,189
try and fix it and like, uh

598
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:39,479
you'll probably assume the neighbor's kid is doing something on the Wi Fi or

599
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,160
they bought a microwave that's

600
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,390
not,

601
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:41,989
it's missing

602
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,910
-- a, that would
-- be, that would be my assumption.

603
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,800
I'd assume it was wireless interference from something, not

604
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,400
the paint program.

605
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:52,910
Now, now you, you raised an interesting point, you talk about Attackers,

606
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,790
Attackers can't trigger this, right?

607
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,660
No.

608
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,310
And see, and that's part of it is,

609
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,569
there's a lot of pathological and bad behaviors

610
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:02,689
that cannot be directly triggered by Attackers,

611
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,319
but that do have a massive impact on quality of life.

612
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:07,000
But,

613
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,239
but, and, and there is, again, again, there's a gray line,

614
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,050
let's say because there's that gray line of,

615
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,219
if a program advertises a security functionality and then

616
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,510
to do it properly,

617
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,569
that typically counts as a security vulnerability.

618
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,540
So like if it says I have a firewall and it doesn't, that's a vulnerability.

619
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,069
So, for example, in this case,

620
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,729
well, for example, it's, it's generally implied

621
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,790
that this program is not going to destroy your wi fi performance.

622
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,459
-- It's only
-- implied the,

623
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:33,910
the feature list does not say will not destroy your wi Fi performance.

624
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,229
Like we're fine, we're, we're good. We're in the clean.

625
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,750
-- I know, right? Like it only contains 10 ant legs per pound of cereal.
-- It's fine.

626
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,410
It's all good.

627
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,670
So I, yeah,

628
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,280
I see the problem I have is we don't have like what

629
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,349
other method do we have to kind of drive this forwards,

630
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,469
get it into scanning tools, get it into people's in front of people.

631
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,569
We don't have one

632
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,609
and look,

633
00:26:54,859 --> 00:27:01,449
I I, you are correct that if we assigned it a CD E, it would get more attention.

634
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,369
But

635
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:03,689
I think

636
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,810
abusing an existing system for something like this,

637
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:10,170
it, it creates trust issues.

638
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:10,729
-- Well,
-- so,

639
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:14,359
and that's the advantage of using it in GSD is we're gonna be adding metadata to GSD.

640
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,400
So that for example, you can have a CV E compatible view of the world. Very simple.

641
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,280
Everything that has ac va

642
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,959
you can have a um as I put in my email, like a vulnerability

643
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:26,140
compatible view of the world, which is essentially the to some degree.

644
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,619
The CV E inclusion rules are applied a bit more broadly

645
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,150
because we'll also be doing like backdoors and stuff which CV

646
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,316
-- refuses to do.
-- That's right. Or malware,

647
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,556
they don't cover either of those,

648
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,436
-- right.
-- Like github

649
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,556
has started covering them. Thank goodness.

650
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:43,875
-- But yeah, there's,
-- well, like that freaking colors for Js stuff and like where it's,

651
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,316
again, it ate up

652
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:48,916
thousands of months or years of people, time

653
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:52,995
caused it broke a ton of systems and it's like, yeah, whatever. It's

654
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,895
the guy that did it intentionally. So it doesn't count what

655
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,115
I mean. Again, this is the technically correct territory.

656
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,862
Well, and what I love is if he'd accidentally done it,

657
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,901
then we would have assigned it a vulnerability identifier.

658
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:08,501
-- That's true. Actually, that's a very good point. But
-- because it was intentional

659
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:09,942
and then that raises the question.

660
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:12,141
Well, what if somebody breaks into his account and does it intentionally?

661
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,661
What if he let them break out?

662
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:14,631
Right? Like

663
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,921
I'm let me put it this way. Here's the question.

664
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:20,442
Does assigning this a security vulnerability, uh,

665
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:22,842
security or vulnerability identifier?

666
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:23,072
And I,

667
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:26,741
we should actually start separating those two things but does assigning this an ID

668
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:27,991
make life better.

669
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:29,979
And the answer right now is no,

670
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:30,329
because

671
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:31,780
the tools and everything,

672
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:34,819
but part of it is too, it's a chicken and egg problem

673
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:37,020
is how many of these bugs are there?

674
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,839
Is there only like one of these weird QT things per decade or are there? Hundreds.

675
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:40,900
I,

676
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,140
I have a better way to think about this because I think this is too weird of a problem.

677
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,060
Let's say I have a fuzz

678
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:48,900
and I run my fuzz

679
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,369
and I find

680
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,920
100 bugs that are maybe security issues with my fuzz, but I can't research 100 bugs

681
00:28:56,229 --> 00:29:01,329
and I've got some metadata that says these are potentially questionable.

682
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,910
What do I do with those today?

683
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,489
There's a project called Os S Fuzz that does this and,

684
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,130
and Google Os V captures some of this if you

685
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,680
brought that to something like any existing security database.

686
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:13,569
And we're like here, we should give these identifiers,

687
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,739
they're gonna show you the door

688
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,810
because it would create too much work and people can't

689
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,280
do anything about it.

690
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,739
Well, the low quality of it

691
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:22,130
and right, it's not very high.

692
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:25,699
I mean, the answer to this is just upgrade your freaking library, right?

693
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,170
-- Like here's the fix
-- like a single flaw, 100 flaws.

694
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:33,420
The person running the Fuzz has done the correct work and it is not one bug.

695
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:39,045
It is 100 legitimately different bugs. Now as, as a consumer of this kind of data,

696
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,084
I can't consume this today really.

697
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:43,265
But the correct answer is just upgrade the library,

698
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:45,405
get all the fixes go on with your life.

699
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,604
No one really cares.

700
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:48,925
But now what I really want to do and this is,

701
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:52,685
this is one of the challenges in the tooling is there's the, I'm gonna, today,

702
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:57,805
we're zoomed in, we look at every vulnerability separately as a unique snowflake.

703
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:01,189
But there's kind of different levels like log for shell. Yes. Zoom in on that.

704
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:01,770
That's fine.

705
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,170
But I want to kind of back up a step and just

706
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,839
look at the aggregate and say like how many unfixed things,

707
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:14,130
security bugs, regular bugs, whatever are in this particular library.

708
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,589
Right.

709
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,369
And then I want to be able to set some bars that say, ok,

710
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,930
I'm willing to handle like 10 low bugs.

711
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:24,839
Fine. More than 10, let's fix it, right? 100 bugs, fine. More than 100 bugs.

712
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:25,810
I wanna fix it. Right.

713
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,380
-- And today we can't really do that very
-- well.

714
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,050
It's, it's slowly getting there.

715
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,579
I mean, a big thing is, you know, NVD enriches data with C PE S so that we can

716
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:35,810
programmatically identify and track these.

717
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,939
You know, again, with GSD, we're heavily,

718
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,300
we, you know, we want to use P

719
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,579
URL S, we want to use.

720
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,530
Everyone hates C pe.

721
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:45,920
Yeah, see, well, again, people forget like 20 years ago,

722
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,979
what else were we going to do?

723
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,219
No, seriously.

724
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:53,280
Like, I love how people complain about these technologies and it's like

725
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,979
this was like this is old enough to drink.

726
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:57,180
-- Well, you
-- know

727
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,270
what I like,

728
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,040
but the difference is it should have evolved and changed and grown.

729
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,959
A lot of them didn't.

730
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:03,699
And, and,

731
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,380
but you know why?

732
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,099
Because look at so this is,

733
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:09,660
I'm just gonna get on a soap box here for a few minutes before we end the show.

734
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,099
Like, because why not?

735
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:11,599
I

736
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:14,219
-- mean, you edit the audio, you can say what you want.
-- That's right.

737
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:16,109
I can make you look smart or dumb curt.

738
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,270
It's all up to me and you know what else I realized?

739
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,189
Actually the other day is I keep all of my stories in, but I cut a lot of yours out.

740
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:24,959
So it's like, oh, I'm like the evil dictator here.

741
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:28,810
But anyway, there are especially in security. I feel like there's people who just

742
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,630
plane to complain

743
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,369
and like there's nothing wrong with complaining about something.

744
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,290
But I feel like you all, you have to follow that up with action,

745
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,530
right? Just saying, oh, this is terrible and everything's bad. Well,

746
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,589
ok, like what now like what do you expect me to do

747
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,560
with this

748
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,550
insight you have gifted to me?

749
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,709
And the answer is nothing obviously. But

750
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,949
I think the challenge there is in the past, that kind of behavior was useful.

751
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,739
Like, hey guys that Bush over there is rustling and there's like a tail sticking out.

752
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,270
The problem now is this happens 1000 times a day, right?

753
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,150
And if, if it was like, if there was one good insightful complaint per day on Twitter,

754
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:04,969
awesome.

755
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:09,670
-- But it's not, it's like a billion low quality complaints,
-- complaints

756
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:11,270
don't matter

757
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,650
because they have to come with something else. You can say like C pe s are terrible

758
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,849
but, or I could say C pe s are bad but pearl is better. Let's go work on pearl.

759
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,869
We can't fix C pe. That is a reasonable statement.

760
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,020
But at some point,

761
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,589
there's where you recognize a problem and you don't

762
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,229
yet have any idea of what the solution is.

763
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,400
But you have to start by recognizing the problem.

764
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,670
And then from there,

765
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,930
one of the problems with a lot of the people that complain is they're

766
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:40,810
not complaining from the perspective of I want to start a conversation about this.

767
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,130
They're complaining from the perspective of I just want to complain about this.

768
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,010
Absolutely.

769
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,810
Because

770
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:49,599
complaining is fine, but it has to be followed by action.

771
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:52,630
Starting a conversation is an action, right?

772
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,660
Just whining and complaining and saying everything is terrible,

773
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:57,760
that is making everything worse.

774
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:01,810
And that is, I, I think this, this is all part of it, like this whole conversation.

775
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:05,890
It's, this is uh this is such a weird bug. It's, it's so many weird problems. And

776
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,140
I mean, like even what, what I'm going to do with my network now,

777
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,930
like I'm going to figure out is it the computer, is it Linux?

778
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,770
And if it's Linux,

779
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,810
I'm going to go file a bug if I can prove Linux is creating this problem.

780
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,459
And here's my question. Now, how many people are going to listen to this show?

781
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:22,030
Who have, what was it again? Uh Lenovo idea pad.

782
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:23,140
Yeah, idea

783
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:23,430
pad.

784
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:23,760
The,

785
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:27,020
no, I'm serious. Say the model number and put in the show notes because

786
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:31,040
some poor schmuck is gonna google this or hear this and be like,

787
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:31,849
oh,

788
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,839
yeah, I got one of those too and my network's all funky.

789
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,219
-- It could
-- be. I, I'm, you know, I shouldn't do this.

790
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:40,579
-- I have my computer tipped over right now looking at the bottom and like, yeah,
-- I was,

791
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,579
like, nice floors.

792
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:42,060
By the way,

793
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,719
I do have very nice floors. It's 100 year

794
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:45,170
old.

795
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:45,880
Is it

796
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,239
maple, maple? They're maple.

797
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,020
And it's funny because the trees were all old growth forests.

798
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,589
-- Like there's no knots because
-- here's the thing, I'll bet you a dollar

799
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,959
-- somebody listening to the show is like, oh, it
-- could be,

800
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:58,369
I don't know. I hope so. If I can help someone, that's great.

801
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:01,530
You literally cannot be the only person with this think pad

802
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,189
running Linux.

803
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,310
-- Like there has to be more than one
-- and I haven't, I need to do more work.

804
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,400
Is it just the think pad?

805
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,350
I have the thinkpad plugged into a dock and then the dock plugged into.

806
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,708
And I also one thing, so one thing someone's gonna bring up that's listening.

807
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,418
Yes, I verified the outlet is properly grounded.

808
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,629
That was the first thing I thought of is maybe the

809
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,350
grounding is bad and I got up my tester and every,

810
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,070
all the blinky lights lit up the right way.

811
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,949
-- So I don't think it's that
-- there is a whole bunch of stuff I remember now about,

812
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,909
uh, laptops and docks

813
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,418
and not sleeping and having weird problems, especially causing network problems

814
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,219
with wake on LAN and stuff. And that is well documented in

815
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,458
-- Google.
-- This computer does not have wake on l I could find in the bios.

816
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,199
So,

817
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,489
but the dock might,

818
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,949
-- the
-- dock might, that could be.

819
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,560
That was, I mean, that was also one of my thoughts because I went in the bio.

820
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,668
I'm like, I'm gonna turn off wake on land. I'm like, oh, it's not here.

821
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:57,250
But, but again, well, this computer doesn't have an actual Ethernet Jack.

822
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,239
The Ethernet Jack is in the dock, right?

823
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,389
But I mean, the thing to remember is like docking bays are no longer just a dumb thing.

824
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,669
They're a computer

825
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,310
with software that will never be updated and

826
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,510
-- cause all sorts of problems.
-- So, I, I want to end this on a call to action

827
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:16,510
and the call to action is there's a project called the Global

828
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,909
Security Database that if you listen to the show you've heard about,

829
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:22,409
if you've never heard us talk about it, we, you, you're welcome to.

830
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,469
Welcome to hell.

831
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,090
But,

832
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,669
but

833
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,000
it is, I'll put a link in the show notes.

834
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,399
It's what is Global Security database.org, I think is the website?

835
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:35,370
-- Yeah. Or GSD dot id. We got the short
-- one or GSD dot id. That's right.

836
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,010
I forget you bought that that's, that's such a good, such a good, shorter.

837
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,350
Yeah, that was,

838
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:44,479
-- that was kind of a pain.
-- But that's, that could probably be its own show. But anyway,

839
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,620
like this whole concept of how do we track things?

840
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:50,379
How do we, where do we draw lines about what vulnerabilities are,

841
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:51,110
what they aren't like,

842
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,129
-- what do we track? Like, I'm not, I don't know anymore.
-- Yeah.

843
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:58,000
No, I absolutely like the more we talk about this, the weirder it gets, I think it is a,

844
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,260
it is an open source project that the cloud security alliance has

845
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:04,699
and everyone is welcome to join, whether you're a CS A member or not.

846
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,855
And we would love opinions and thoughts and even just questions, like,

847
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,936
come through the mailing list, join the mailing list, ask questions.

848
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:13,426
There's a ton of work to do. I, we know our getting started experience is awful.

849
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:16,696
-- We apologize in advance. Like, if you show up it's, we
-- don't have one.

850
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:18,645
Well, we technically have one. It's, it's,

851
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:22,416
-- here's our repo. Good luck.
-- Right. It's mostly, yeah.

852
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,625
Yeah, wading through garbage and, and

853
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:28,271
to avoid the fire. But anyway, like, that's the call to action here.

854
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:32,332
I think it's like, I think there's a larger discussion around all of this and

855
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:34,632
it's something that I don't think anyone else is

856
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:37,001
having today other than the Cloud Security Alliance.

857
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,011
And so I think it's great.

858
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:38,931
And additionally,

859
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:41,652
the other big one is because the Cloud Security Alliance has a foundation.

860
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:42,922
This isn't one of those

861
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:43,302
Yin Kha

862
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:44,852
and taking everything and leaving,

863
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,280
which has happened many times in this vulnerability database space.

864
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,459
That's a big difference is the inclusivity like you and I are

865
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:55,439
members of like CWE or what's the one you're on with?

866
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,280
The the thing with

867
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,550
-- the
-- OS SSF with Linux

868
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,090
one,

869
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:03,469
right? And they're not real publicly kind of available, easy to interact.

870
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:04,854
The open SSF is that

871
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:05,034
one is

872
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:07,625
pretty good, but their focus is not vulnerabilities.

873
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:09,415
Their focus is the open source ecosystem.

874
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:12,504
Like this does not overlap with that in any reasonable way.

875
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:15,975
And that's one of the big differences. We are very like we're on

876
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:17,645
the Twitter and on the github

877
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,354
and you can yell at us and just

878
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:21,685
drive bys and we're, we're happy with that.

879
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,879
Yeah, absolutely. Like all data is good data. So anyway.

880
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,459
All right. All right. I'm going to call this one. We kind of dragged this on.

881
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:29,979
So I, I'll, we'll see after I do some more testing,

882
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,399
hopefully I'll have more info on this bizarre network problem.

883
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:33,280
But thank you, Kurt,

884
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,320
you forgot to say the Linux

885
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:35,030
-- distribution.
-- Uh

886
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,429
Fedora, I run Fedora,

887
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,679
I've run Fedora forever and it's because I know the Fedora

888
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,530
people so I can yell at them when something breaks.

889
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,409
It's perfect. I love it.

890
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:43,570
And,

891
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
and actually that's why I also buy Lenovo stuff because

892
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,080
I know the Fedora ex developers all run Lenovo Gear.

893
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,370
So it It always works. Anyway.

894
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,219
