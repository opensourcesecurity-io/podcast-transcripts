Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,970
Kurt Siefried and my partner in analyzing how I say hello, Josh Pressers,

2
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,069
-- but I don't
-- analyze it.

3
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:16,770
You said it weird. And so I asked you to do it again.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,209
What do you think would happen if you took the

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,370
like the last seven years of shows and stack the waveforms?

6
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,409
Like it would it be like my signature where it's pretty close or would it be like

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,250
my actual signature which is just all over the

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,220
-- place
-- your intro or like the show itself?

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,880
-- Yeah. The
-- Hello, like stack just the first word. Hello. And what like,

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,900
I kind of want to see it now.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,639
There is a song where one of the recording artists,

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,200
I forget the name of it because I'm bad at song names and lyrics.

13
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:45,580
But

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,380
there's a spot where it sounds like this like

15
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,900
huge chorus of people is singing part of the,

16
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:51,860
the refrain.

17
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,580
And what the, the

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
the studio people did is they took like every take this

19
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,299
guy did because he did like some absurd number of tapes

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,299
and they put all the takes together and it created this amazing effect.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,040
And it was really cool. It, it's a very popular song.

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm certain you've heard it, but I don't remember the name of it because I,

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,629
I know four songs.

24
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:08,160
So

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,699
I'm pretty useless like that.

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,459
Basically, if the Beatles or Queen didn't sing it, I probably don't know what it is.

27
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,440
Right. Exactly.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,970
So, that's, that's actually directly related to the whole pipe thing.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,779
-- The Beatles and Queens or
-- no, the, the, the taking the cuts and stacking. Because

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,279
so, and, and the other topic too, like,

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
there used to be a lot of things that were possible but really hard, you know.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,839
And the one thing I love the most satellite imagery

33
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,360
because I remember 30 years ago, like,

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,410
my mom worked for our art environment and she'd be,

35
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,889
she specialized in rivers and river related stuff

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,690
and she's going off maps that were made like

37
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,319
100 and 50 years ago by, you know, three guys,

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,949
-- a mule and a sack full of like food
-- with a compass and some twine.

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,620
Yeah, pretty much. Right. And they did some pretty good jobs.

40
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,089
But part of the reality is, is like river banks and rivers move over

41
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,769
well, 20 or 30 years, let alone 100 and 50.

42
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,250
And so she'd actually have to check if

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,830
like, is the river still there? Because it's been 100 and 50 years.

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,490
And so she would have to pay some, you know,

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,220
or rather she'd have to get the government to pay

46
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,559
some ungodly amount of money to have somebody in a plane

47
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:18,789
go, fly up there with a camera and, like, take pictures of stuff

48
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,369
and then they'd have to try and you'd use landmarks, like,

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,529
say a mountain or a hill that don't generally move that much

50
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,570
to line up with the stuff that might move or like,

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,350
hey, there's a forest there.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,740
Now, there wasn't a forest there before.

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,509
Right.

54
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,169
Right.

55
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:30,750
Yeah.

56
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,509
Well, and you know,

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,639
now it's like Google Maps does it for free with like super high resolution, right?

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,220
And there's, and I was reading, there's actually a company now

59
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,149
that is

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,600
using satellite imagery because it's high enough quality now,

61
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,869
like the commercial stuff

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,630
to

63
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,009
index every tree.

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,770
Like, so it's not just like AAA mathematical model of like,

65
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,350
there's roughly this many trees over here.

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,979
It's like, no, there's like 2479 trees,

67
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:57,080
like

68
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,649
-- we counted them. Well, we had the computer
-- count it 10 years ago.

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,119
I would have been like, no effing way. And now it's like,

70
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:06,639
and you're like, I, I could probably do that on my laptop given a

71
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,979
-- couple of weeks.
-- Well, I couldn't but someone smart could,

72
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,199
well, you just need a good GP U and some ra M.

73
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,139
That's the thing, right? It's gone from like,

74
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,550
OK, in theory, we could maybe consider like,

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,550
I always love the human genome project because remember

76
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,240
the human genome project when we were kids.

77
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,960
It was like, oh, maybe in our lifetime

78
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,080
and then the technology got better and they're like, oh,

79
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,309
maybe in 20 years and then technology got better and they're like, oh,

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,229
and then the technology got much, much better and it was like, yeah,

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,779
it was done last Thursday.

82
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,380
So, you know what I love about the human genome project for anyone not listening,

83
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,059
who's not, like, very old.

84
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,949
Basically, there was a time when

85
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:43,884
all of the human DNA was viewed as a monumental task.

86
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,865
It was something we might do one day.

87
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,625
It was like a moon landing

88
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,634
in the sixties of we think it like it's possible if we spend enough money,

89
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,244
we think we can do this, but we're not 100% certain.

90
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,865
That's right. That's right. And, and

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,350
when we did that, when we sequenced it all

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,320
it was, I remember knowing some people looking to hire parole programmers and,

93
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,720
and I was, I talked to some of them

94
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,600
and I was just, I think I was just out of high school or

95
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,000
in like my late stage of high school. I forget exactly where it lined up. But anyway,

96
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,779
it was basically text files piped into pearl

97
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,420
scripts that were piped into other pearl scripts.

98
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,380
And because there was too much data, you couldn't hold it in memory.

99
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:27,809
So you had to pipe it across and all these pearl scripts.

100
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,299
It was, oh man, it was so it was bananas

101
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:34,440
and now, I actually have, I have a copy somewhere in my back clips of my genome.

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,779
That's why I just, well, you know, because II I spent like, what was it?

103
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,480
And this is a while ago. So it was expensive back then. It was like 250 bucks.

104
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:45,079
It's probably like 10 bucks now. Well, I think it's still like, over 100 bucks. But

105
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,239
the point is, yeah, you basically spit in a cup aggressively to get some cheek cells.

106
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,279
Mail it off to 23 me or whoever and then, like, a couple of weeks later

107
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,720
and, and then they send it to your insurance company. So they know when you'll die

108
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,720
that's illegal in the US, but

109
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:01,679
not in Canada

110
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,750
in the US. They passed a specific law

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,750
banning

112
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,640
the use of genetic testing like that to approve or disprove coverage in

113
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,600
Canada though. Yeah.

114
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,429
But in Canada insurance companies are less freaked out because that

115
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,850
the really expensive stuff tends to be covered by the government.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,640
That's

117
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:19,130
right.

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,429
Well, and, and by Canada, I mean, the rest of the western world outside of the U.

119
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,160
I know. I

120
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:24,630
know.

121
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,839
It's like, why I know, I know it's so difficult.

122
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,959
-- Only one western country configure it.
-- But that's the thing.

123
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,880
Like the same thing like this, this 60 minutes thing where it's like,

124
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,640
-- ok,
-- hold on, hold on. We can't, no one knows what you're talking about.

125
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,160
So we have two news stories that piqued our interest

126
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,470
and I think they're the,

127
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,619
they're the same problem, but they don't seem like it.

128
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:48,459
So the first story is on May 20th

129
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:53,049
Pi Pie suspended new accounts and packages from

130
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,200
being published because they were under attack essentially.

131
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:56,989
Now it only last

132
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:58,049
package indexes.

133
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,089
Yes. Yes.

134
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,989
Thank you.

135
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,420
-- It only lasted a day and then they opened
-- it back three

136
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,839
days.

137
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,410
Uh, I thought when I looked at the,

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,760
-- I'll put a link.
-- It was like one or three days. Basically,

139
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,399
it was short.

140
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,720
But yeah, no, it's, it's um,

141
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,690
ok, but hold on before we go on.

142
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,899
And then the second story is a

143
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,970
comment

144
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,299
from Mastodon

145
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,279
where basically it,

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,739
it, a 60 minutes reporter

147
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,279
had their voice cloned

148
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:32,160
and then tricked a colleague into handing over their passport number.

149
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,739
This to like anyone who's been paying attention is not surprised in any way.

150
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,369
But they were. But anyway, then this,

151
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:41,859
this comment talks about how scammers are going to use this stuff.

152
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,399
And we should all have a like a second factor with our family for knowing

153
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,220
if we're actually the person on the phone or whatever.

154
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,119
I have that because I went through the eighties.

155
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,040
You and I are Children of the eighties.

156
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,519
Remember, stranger danger and having your family passwords.

157
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,179
I

158
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:55,890
had

159
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:56,130
one,

160
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,350
I

161
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:56,899
never had one

162
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:57,820
because you know,

163
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,640
somebody might offer you kittens

164
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:02,679
to get in their car. And so they would have to have the password.

165
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,299
But actually it's even worse than that because there's,

166
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:07,130
there's the V FX artists react crew, corridor crew.

167
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,329
Sorry,

168
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,149
that's such a good show. And they do have like some of their defects stuff.

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,230
We'll link it in the show notes.

170
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,329
Um But some of the deep fakes they do are,

171
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,329
oh, it's fantastic, like terrifying, basically, like real time deep fakes,

172
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,390
especially like let's be real voice is actually really easy to deep fake.

173
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,329
-- Oh
-- my
-- goodness. Yes.

174
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,839
Like I'm completely confident that I could replace Kurt with

175
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,100
GP T at this point.

176
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,470
-- And
-- there are there are deep fake systems that only

177
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,880
need 10 or 20 seconds of voice to clone it

178
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:37,649
and

179
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,899
hundreds of hours of you,

180
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:42,329
right?

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,279
And

182
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,429
yeah, so I mean, well,

183
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,109
and even the thing like the caller id is still up like people still

184
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,690
are shocked about caller id, spoofing. And it's like,

185
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:54,230
yeah, that's

186
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,209
just, I mean, caller, caller id is literally,

187
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,119
you know what it is.

188
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,820
Caller ID is literally as secure as the return

189
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,559
address on an envelope you get in the mail.

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,899
I mean, basically,

191
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,049
whatever somebody decides to write on the outside of the letter essentially.

192
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:14,339
Ok. But anyway, here I think is the fundamental underlying issue in all this

193
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:15,470
is

194
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:19,950
we are living in a time of unprecedented change

195
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,480
and it only looks like it's going to increase in

196
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,480
speed if you look at like all of the

197
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,239
-- signs
-- and not just increase in speed but availability.

198
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,839
See, that's the thing.

199
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,630
It's not just like human genome sequencing when it first came out. It's like, cool.

200
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,659
It's faster. Great. But I can't sequence my genome. Are you insane?

201
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,229
It's still tens of millions of dollars. But then 10 years later it's like

202
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,395
$200.

203
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:40,914
And I think that's the difference.

204
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:44,094
Right. And it'll be literally free in 10 years.

205
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:48,335
This A I stuff went from maybe someday one day to in November.

206
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:51,104
Open a releases chat GP T and then six months later

207
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:51,655
it

208
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:55,195
just nuclear bomb explodes and it's 20 bucks a month

209
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,594
now. And, and here's,

210
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,994
I think the interesting part of this

211
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,854
is humans

212
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,494
evolved

213
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,289
in a world that basically would rarely change the world

214
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,929
you were born into in the world you died in,

215
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,710
uh, in,

216
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,469
was functionally the same,

217
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,130
basically more than 50 years ago,

218
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,849
I'd say 50 years, maybe 60. And now, I mean, one of my favorite data points of this is

219
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,210
the time between the Wright Brothers first flight and a

220
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:28,599
person landing on the moon was less than 50 years.

221
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,580
That is

222
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,929
bananas to think about how much progress had to happen for

223
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,770
those two events to occur within a single person's lifetime.

224
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,400
-- Think about tech in the last 30 years,
-- like tech in the last

225
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,025
-- 10 years
-- when I try to think about how many computers

226
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:44,655
do we have in this house if we count all the

227
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:44,875
I,

228
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,895
you know, all the phones, all the tablets,

229
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,405
-- all the iot devices.
-- It's like

230
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,215
infinite,

231
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:50,484
infinite.

232
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,044
I'd have to guess at this 0.100 in my house.

233
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:58,804
So, you know what I was talking to my kids about this a couple week ago

234
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:02,844
when I was in college. So I graduated from college in 2001.

235
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,294
So this would have been about 2000 give or take.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,150
I had to do a senior project and my senior project we needed a microprocessor for

237
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,590
and it was really hard to get one.

238
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:18,719
The only one we could basically get our hands on was a Motorola 65 02.

239
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,429
And it was not cheap and it was very, very hard to use.

240
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,390
And now like you can buy a freaking ESP 32 for like five bucks off the internet and it's

241
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,049
more compute than existed 30 years.

242
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,489
-- But the tool chains are free to use
-- it.

243
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:34,989
Right.

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,929
-- Yeah, that too
-- because when I think people forget like, oh you got ac pu 20 years ago.

245
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,830
Ep No,

246
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,159
-- let's talk about how much compilers cost. And we have talked about
-- a compiler.

247
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,020
I laugh at you.

248
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,909
We had to program it in assembler because that's all we had.

249
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,460
And now granted the 65

250
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,179
to

251
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,940
the instruction set for the particular chip we had like it did on one printed page.

252
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,549
So it wasn't like completely ridiculous. But still

253
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:01,739
there was no compiler.

254
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,799
There was no Python, there was no C we were writing assembly for our like one K of Ram

255
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:08,190
that was

256
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,219
hooked up to the chip. But it was

257
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:15,820
so weird and that was in 2000 and now it's 2023 at the time we're recording and

258
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,049
-- compute is so cheap and it's so available.
-- Well, I just got some Arduino

259
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:23,140
chips that have like only a quarter megabyte of

260
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,929
like flash storage on them.

261
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,359
And I was like,

262
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,440
wow, like,

263
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,820
that's actually a lot for something that's being a temperature pro basically,

264
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:37,359
-- they
-- run at what, like 12 or 32 megahertz probably.

265
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,809
You don't even know that they run.

266
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,059
And now, now I'll be back 20 years ago. Well, 2023 years ago,

267
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:50,729
I mean, if we ran that chip more than a megahertz it like, self-destructed because

268
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,929
nothing ran that.

269
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:52,330
It,

270
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:54,780
it's so, anyway, humans,

271
00:11:55,239 --> 00:12:00,080
we exist in this world and it's so hard for us to apply

272
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,260
the rules of the past into the present because they don't work.

273
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:03,900
Right.

274
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,219
And I mean, I think about this when it comes to security all the time,

275
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,590
it's worse, I'm gonna interrupt because it's also, it's,

276
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,150
there's this fundamental attribute of reality of what's real and what is not real.

277
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,739
And the ways we have of recording reality in the past were things like stories.

278
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,130
And so we know people lying,

279
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:20,935
whatever,

280
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:23,565
then we had written down and written down is a

281
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,356
little bit more real because you can't change it.

282
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:28,185
You know, you can't just alter it without it being kind of obvious on the page

283
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:33,116
and then we had photography. Oh, ok. Well, like, chemical based photography is

284
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,135
very real.

285
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:37,776
Unless back in the original days you do some sort of practical special effect.

286
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,056
Like, you know, have somebody holding a bloody knife and

287
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,176
put the knife in half and, like, put it on his chest.

288
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,815
So it looks like you're stabbing them or something. Right.

289
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:48,851
But that's the, the nature of what is recorded and what is real and what is not real

290
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,432
is out the window. Now

291
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:54,851
it's just straight up anything that can be recorded now could be fake,

292
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,041
deep faked in real time, basically, you know,

293
00:12:57,182 --> 00:13:00,781
and I think that's another thing I think about where like if I'm watching the news,

294
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,882
I know for certainty that, well, this could be like

295
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:07,452
an A I generated news feed on the fly from

296
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:10,132
a script from somebody typing in real time and not

297
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,630
like the traditional evening news that you and I would watch 1020 years ago.

298
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,520
And that's even happened where there were politicians saying, oh,

299
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,619
that's a deep fake of me.

300
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,150
And it's like,

301
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,679
-- I'm pretty sure it's not,
-- but it's happened locally.

302
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,099
-- Yeah, where somebody got recorded. But
-- anyway, anyway, so Pie Pie, right?

303
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:24,270
I wanna,

304
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,590
I wanna talk about this in the context of

305
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,599
pi pie because I think that's the most interesting like

306
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,059
pipe pie is a great example of this is a

307
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,330
packaging repository that it's what like a decade old.

308
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,799
Probably more than that at this point.

309
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,739
And

310
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:41,179
the world they created into back in the day where it's like, you know,

311
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,520
there's no name spacing.

312
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,929
It's global name space.

313
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,030
Anyone can sign up. Anyone can publish that. Made total sense. Because if you were

314
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,270
only eight years old,

315
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,849
that's it.

316
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,789
Creation date. 2015 07.

317
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,940
Awesome. I mean, good job to them.

318
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:57,960
-- Wait,
-- what do we

319
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:01,559
stupid question. I, I honestly have been using PP for song. What did we do before?

320
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:01,989
Oh yeah, we,

321
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,270
we cried a lot

322
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:05,679
and

323
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:06,900
manual oh

324
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,150
user local.

325
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,359
That too.

326
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:09,969
I mean,

327
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:13,020
I remember downloading random Python crap and just installing

328
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,799
it wherever I could to make it work.

329
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,780
It was terrible.

330
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,840
I mean, N PM suffers from this.

331
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm picking on PP just because they're in the news but like they're not special.

332
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,080
All, most of the package repository suffer from this,

333
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,599
but they were created in a time

334
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,799
when, if you could publish a Python package

335
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,440
you were in like the top 10% of tech users probably

336
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,599
like the ability for anyone to do this was 0%.

337
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,400
Like there's no way scammers could do it because they

338
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,150
didn't even have a clue what was going on.

339
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,109
So, like these systems were designed

340
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:46,479
with this inherent level of trust in it.

341
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:49,630
That doesn't, it, it doesn't work anymore.

342
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,530
There also wasn't really a lot of value for Attackers.

343
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,590
That's true. That's very true.

344
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,909
-- Right.
-- And that's the thing. See, here's the problem is

345
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,809
it doesn't matter how hard you make something intentionally or

346
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,909
otherwise because let's face it pipe wasn't hard intentionally.

347
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,799
It was just, that's the nature of the lot of the technology we bought.

348
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,989
It's terrible and hard.

349
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:14,729
You know, it's like R PM packages. They're still insanely terrible.

350
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,919
Like, because I've,

351
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,039
I've been a package maintainer and like, it's,

352
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,239
it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. But anyways,

353
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:25,320
once there is value there for Attackers,

354
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,429
unless you make it

355
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,909
the cost to an attacker to get set up much more than the value they can grab.

356
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,200
They're, they're going to do it and,

357
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,960
and the reality is you can't make that cost so high

358
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,719
that it

359
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,440
dissuades an attacker because then you're going to dissuade

360
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,960
all the normal people,

361
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,239
you know,

362
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:45,429
and,

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,719
you know, there was the hacker news thread talking about, oh, you know, add a capcha.

364
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,409
And literally the response was like,

365
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,780
that's probably not going to keep the bad people out because capa

366
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,750
can, you just have a human, solve them.

367
00:15:59,469 --> 00:15:59,880
That's right.

368
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,200
That's

369
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,380
right.

370
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:05,159
That's it. Like, I'm sorry, you know. Oh, what about a phone number? Well, again,

371
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,000
you can get phone numbers like,

372
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,840
it'll be tough to do this at scale of setting up millions of accounts now.

373
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,500
But for high value, tens or hundreds,

374
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:14,190
easy,

375
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:15,479
for sure, 100%.

376
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,390
And so there's,

377
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,080
that's what gets me is because I've looked at these systems and I'm like,

378
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,549
is there any way to really secure them.

379
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,349
And the answer is no,

380
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:25,299
there's no way to say that we only have good people in here. No bad people.

381
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,900
That problem,

382
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,500
identity is the issue there, right?

383
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,489
But also intent because

384
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,710
-- well
-- ignoring intent, ignoring intent, right?

385
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,500
The if you had a way on the internet to strongly tie identity

386
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:40,630
to something

387
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,849
which we don't really have, we kind of do with like

388
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,869
log sso login and stuff, but we don't really,

389
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,500
I'm, I'm gonna have to

390
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,940
disagree with you strongly because for example, I have an account with login.gov,

391
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,059
ok.

392
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,690
They do pretty strong identity

393
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,369
but that costs and again, it costs a horrendous amount of money,

394
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,090
you know, like, but, and again, that's the thing like,

395
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,790
even if you are willing to pay for this, which the US government is because, hey,

396
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
taxpayer money, not

397
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,160
a problem.

398
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:12,219
And more to the point, they kind of do need strong identity controls.

399
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,839
But even if you're willing to do like login.gov

400
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,030
levels of like,

401
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,130
Kurt had to go to the international airport here in Edmonton where there is

402
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,930
a US customs office and I had to talk to a US customs agent,

403
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,079
get my, you know, fingers and eyes scanned,

404
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,839
you know, they took my passport, driver's license,

405
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:29,709
blah, blah, blah.

406
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,780
And now I have a nexus card,

407
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,349
which I love because I don't have to get in the line

408
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,319
with the people who don't know how to take their shoes off

409
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:38,949
I know, like even if you're willing to do that, there are still cases where

410
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,520
the value of that,

411
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,560
of subverting that system is high enough that people do.

412
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:45,829
Yeah, for sure. And so

413
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:50,219
fundamentally, can we have a system where we keep all the bad people out? Well, no.

414
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,300
So can we maybe have a system where we keep

415
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,969
the most of the bad people out? So it doesn't become a complete cesspit

416
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:56,939
and more importantly,

417
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,430
and this is the thing I keep coming back to with things like pipe pie and N PM.

418
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,390
I think what's really needed is to have a steering committee

419
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,300
or a security committee or whatever you want to call it.

420
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,979
Who's like, oh,

421
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:08,640
this package is evil now kill it or replace it or

422
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,410
put up a good version or roll it back or,

423
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,670
you know, they take some corrective action right away

424
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,699
-- and advertise it.
-- They don't advertise it very well,

425
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,339
but they do a pretty good job of pulling stuff.

426
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,280
Yeah.

427
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,369
And that's exactly what I'm saying is, and that works.

428
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:24,540
I, I think we have to focus less on keeping the bad people out because

429
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,140
I think prevention is almost always a lost cause

430
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:32,739
because if you look at the history of prevention versus detection,

431
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,459
especially in the world of computers,

432
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,689
prevention almost always makes a mess.

433
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,979
I mean, this is everything from like antivirus

434
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,910
to, you know, locking people out of accounts

435
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,810
to trying to make sure that the bad.

436
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,339
People never do anything in these ecosystems like pi pie and N PM

437
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,650
and it's difficult but,

438
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,729
but detecting something on the other end and dealing with it quickly,

439
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,209
that tends to be effective.

440
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,420
Yeah, for example, I it just reminds me,

441
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,199
I actually need to go squat a pi pie package name.

442
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,719
No, like I need to, I just need to set up a stub package and grab the name

443
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,859
to protect one of our projects so that somebody doesn't

444
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,150
file a pi pi package with our project name.

445
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,599
Right?

446
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,800
-- Well, is, is what I'm doing, malicious or evil.
-- And now now it should be said too like

447
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,569
Docker Hub

448
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,280
doesn't suffer from this quite as much because they have name spaces,

449
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,410
right? You can't squat

450
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:30,060
a in a global package name in the Docker Universe because that's not how it works.

451
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,140
And actually it's funny because that's one thing uh if you

452
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,380
read the API discussion uh on the GSD tools thing,

453
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,959
one thing I realize now is anything we build at the GSD has to have name sway

454
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,180
because

455
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,560
there's two possibilities.

456
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:43,619
One,

457
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,979
we don't need name spacing in which case. OK, we wasted a few characters or two.

458
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:52,030
We need name spacing. That's it. There's, there's nothing following that.

459
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,180
-- We need name spacing. We have to support it.
-- It solves a lot of problem.

460
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,949
I think in the context of name spacing,

461
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,579
you don't worry about the identity problem because the name space is the identity

462
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,630
and like random weirdos

463
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,130
they can create their thing and the odds of you installing it accidentally,

464
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,689
-- I'm not saying it's zero, but it is much lower
-- for sure.

465
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,969
Well, and that's the thing. Like, for example, there's a typo squatting. Right.

466
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:17,890
And that's happened in the real world with them all the time,

467
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,569
like Bitcoin and whatever wallets, you know, where so many

468
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,569
typos

469
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,949
or the spell check, corrects

470
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,760
domain name or something or there's,

471
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,979
there's bit flips like we have confirmed bit flips now

472
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,560
in the form of remember those uh those certificate,

473
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,040
uh uh

474
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,310
logs

475
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:35,939
that were wrong and somebody's like straight up like looking at the certificate,

476
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,959
log, it fails and if you flip this one bit now it's back to being correct.

477
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:40,239
-- Yep,
-- for sure.

478
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,130
And I, you sent that to me, I'll try to dig it up and put it in the show notes.

479
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,359
But yeah, like it's fascinating.

480
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:44,969
Yeah.

481
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:49,829
So we, we have like confirmed in the wild affecting a real world system a bit flip.

482
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,119
Ok. Ok.

483
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,790
Before we keep going down this path of just talking about random weird stuff

484
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:58,880
like let's put this now in the context of a 60 minutes report,

485
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,709
right where we deep fake someone.

486
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,290
-- And they're saying, ok, you need your,
-- well, it's not just deep

487
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,895
and so on, but it's also getting the information, getting the right names,

488
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:06,415
getting the phone number

489
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:08,905
again. That used to be really hard and complicated.

490
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,785
But then like social media happens.

491
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:11,935
All that crap.

492
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:16,295
We all have pictures and voice and everything all over the place now.

493
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:19,344
-- And
-- who's your boss? And who's your direct reports and

494
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:21,665
your dog's name? And,

495
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:23,300
yeah,

496
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:26,420
-- that's right. Yeah,
-- I just realized, I don't know your dog's name.

497
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,020
I think you've told me, but I've forgotten it.

498
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,859
My dog's name is Atlas.

499
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:30,910
Atlas.

500
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,810
Oh, ok. At

501
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,579
Atlas? He's a very large dog and so we named him Atlas and

502
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,199
he is, he just had surgery. Actually, he tore his AC L which dogs can do.

503
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:43,500
Yes, for real. And they have this fascinating surgery

504
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:44,160
where they,

505
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,010
the dog's knee is like this weird monstrosity the way it works and

506
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,800
they literally cut the bone and rotate the bone a little bit.

507
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah, for real. Like, it's wild what they do. But, like,

508
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,420
it's been a couple of weeks and he's already walking better than he was before

509
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,199
he had the surgery.

510
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,800
-- Put your dog's leg on backwards to fix
-- it. Not on, not on backwards.

511
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,619
They just rotate it. Like, like what?

512
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,140
I don't know, like 10 degrees or 15 degrees or something.

513
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,829
So, the way, yeah, it's wild. It's wild. It's tplo, I think they call it.

514
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,119
It's completely nuts, but it,

515
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,680
it works and I'm very pleased because he's a large dog and

516
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,069
he likes to run and so he'll be able to run again.

517
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,589
So I'm happy about that. But, but anyway, anyway,

518
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,739
but I just, I just docked my dog's name.

519
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:26,939
So I better now I have to go change all my secret questions. Answer

520
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,260
my dog's name. Anyway,

521
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,900
-- I think, or
-- rename the dog to QX 4719362.

522
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,680
That's right.

523
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,660
You know what else to survive?

524
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,020
There's a, there's a, I love, I love Penny Arcade, right? As a web comic.

525
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:43,760
And there's one where

526
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,479
they're talking about secret questions and the one guy's like,

527
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,000
what is delicious?

528
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,520
And the other guy is like, oh my goodness, this question is so deep.

529
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,780
Like, how do I possibly answer this? You know, what is the what is delicious?

530
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,040
Even mean the other guy is like candy, candy is delicious.

531
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:58,359
It's like

532
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,109
it's so good. But anyway, anyway, I, I feel like there's a second side to this

533
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,900
and

534
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,859
the 60 minute story covers it well in the wrong way where this, this comment says, oh,

535
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,660
you need to set up like a second authentication factor or whatever

536
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:19,060
-- and, but actually use it but
-- you won't, you won't. That's the thing you're not gonna.

537
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,900
And that's the second part to that is

538
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,680
even if you say had some convoluted process with your family saying, you know,

539
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm going to give you a secret code word or whatever.

540
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,619
We're going to say this or that or we're gonna talk about something

541
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:35,859
when you are under duress and if someone calls up and says, oh,

542
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:37,989
so and so was in a car accident and they're

543
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,469
at the hospital and we need this information or whatever.

544
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,699
When you put a person under duress, all of that stuff goes out the window

545
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,770
because

546
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,540
you are suddenly the world changes, you don't know what to do.

547
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,819
Your brain doesn't work, right?

548
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,030
And this reminds me a lot of when there are security events that happen, like,

549
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,989
especially at work or with people I know or something

550
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:03,239
like you and I have lived in the security world for decades at this point.

551
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,920
And so security events to us are normal, like we deal with them all the time,

552
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,780
not a big deal.

553
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,550
And it's always funny because like something will happen

554
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,650
and people come to me super freaked out and I'm like, oh, it'll be fine.

555
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,319
We're gonna do this and this and this and they're like, what?

556
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,020
Blah, blah, blah, I'm like, no, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

557
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,410
I got it like, go away and it's funny because

558
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,359
they're freaking out because they're under duress

559
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,969
and I'm like, whatever, just leave me alone, I'll fix this in an hour, like come,

560
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,130
come talk to me in an hour, everything will be fine.

561
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,069
Well, especially if somebody's never experienced that thing before.

562
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,329
They've never game planned.

563
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,390
They don't even have a basic, you know, what was that,

564
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,709
that famous NFL coach where he's like, if you're trying to make a plan on the field,

565
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:37,969
you're

566
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:38,875
screwed

567
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:39,964
like you're done.

568
00:24:40,984 --> 00:24:43,484
You know, that is the worst time to try and plan and

569
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,265
-- come up with a decision like
-- sports and military training

570
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,535
and all that stuff is like that where the reason you

571
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:56,635
run plays 1000 times in a row is so when you get pounded in the head by some giant dude,

572
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,494
you're not like, oh no, what do I do now?

573
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,824
Like, you just know what to do because you've done it 700 times

574
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:04,994
and the 701st time, you know what's going on.

575
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:09,810
And this is where trying to put this kind of structure in place

576
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,050
on the fly.

577
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,609
Just it, it, it doesn't work. You can't do it as normal people.

578
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,250
And this again comes back to like

579
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,119
Pipi

580
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,689
has professionals working on this stuff

581
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:23,630
and I give them credit for doing something like saying no, no new packages.

582
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,520
We're just shutting, we're shutting it down

583
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,020
-- like that's bold
-- revenue.

584
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,369
Canada has now done that twice, once for heart bleed and once flog for Jay

585
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,290
where they're just like, hey, you want fire your tax on them.

586
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,619
-- Nope, we turned it off until we fix this.
-- And that's, that's ok. And here's the thing,

587
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,630
that's how you can tell

588
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,410
there are seasoned professionals behind this

589
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,959
because a normal person would not do that.

590
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,630
Well, especially the first time around it was like two weeks before tax deadlines.

591
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,180
I

592
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:50,579
remember

593
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,030
like it made the national news like it was a big deal here.

594
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,300
-- And
-- that's the thing like

595
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,319
this is where I think it's, again, we come back to that conversation,

596
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,510
I think of prevention versus detection

597
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,859
when you're on the other side of an attack

598
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,729
and response. Well, yeah. Yeah.

599
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:10,369
Same, same, I consider detection and response in the same bucket.

600
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:15,530
But when you're on the other side of this stuff having the ability to just be, like,

601
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,780
shut it down, like, shut it all down right now,

602
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,040
that's hard to do.

603
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,800
It sounds obvious.

604
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,650
-- But it's not,
-- it's actually more subtle than that because this is something I've,

605
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,239
I've been trying to teach my son is when you're rushing,

606
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,640
you don't give yourself time to think.

607
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,760
So, if something goes wrong,

608
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,800
you panic and it just all goes to hell in a handbasket

609
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,800
and so you can just slow it down

610
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,800
to give yourself time to think

611
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,719
and not just react but actually think

612
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,959
about what to do next.

613
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,670
And the, the case I keep coming back to, I'm like,

614
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,890
have you ever seen a firefighter run?

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,359
No, I'm

616
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:48,550
dead

617
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:48,890
serious.

618
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,650
No.

619
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,119
If you, if you do, you should probably run too as well.

620
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:55,010
And same thing in hospitals go to a hospital.

621
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,650
I have seen nurses run in a hospital, but it was for a good reason.

622
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,780
They were obviously going to an emergency,

623
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,540
-- but that's the only time they
-- weren't running from it. That's for sure.

624
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:04,859
-- That's
-- the,

625
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,260
and that's part of the playbook though. The one time we run.

626
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,969
Yeah. No, it, it is.

627
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:14,290
But again, these are people who do this every day like that is second nature to them,

628
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,939
dealing with catastrophe and emergency is their job, right?

629
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,010
They know what to do.

630
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,410
So, and then the challenge becomes though,

631
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,650
is most of us have the red queen problem where we have to run just to stay in place.

632
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,569
So how do we find time to train and to practice for what ifs that may or may not happen?

633
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:33,859
Like at the cloud security lines, we have general plans around

634
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,750
uh you know, disaster recovery which mostly boil down to.

635
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,979
Well, if Amazon's broken, then you know, Kurt has canned food in the basement.

636
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,599
I mean that II I, yeah, I agree with that.

637
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,069
You know, like I like to put it bluntly if Google fails spectacularly, it's like,

638
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,729
well, Kurt will try and move us to office 365.

639
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:51,540
It's more likely

640
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,329
-- Western civilization has collapsed
-- or Google

641
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,989
did something egregiously stupid again,

642
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,349
like

643
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,390
like the Google analytics for thing where I'm,

644
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,910
I'm explaining to my people like this is why I was trying to get us to fix it because

645
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,750
all of the old data goes away and they're like, can we export, I'm like,

646
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,270
you can export the reports

647
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,079
and not the data. And they're like what now I'm like, this is what Google like

648
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,060
if I could export the data, trust me, I would because I'm not a maniac,

649
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,140
you know, I would.

650
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,250
And then the default being that they only keep

651
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,000
data for two months now instead of 14 months.

652
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,530
And I'm like, oh,

653
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:24,650
I was, yeah,

654
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,780
because I was flipping through the interface

655
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,489
and I'm like data retention two months.

656
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,469
That doesn't seem like a lot like two months.

657
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,760
And I clicked on the pull down to see what my options were.

658
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,770
It was two months or 14 months.

659
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,800
And I'm like, I think 14 months should be the default, but

660
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,489
I guess they're being driven by cost cutting measures now

661
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:40,089
anyway.

662
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,209
But, yeah, so this is the thing, like, we have general ideas of, you know,

663
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,099
how we're going to respond to stuff at the CS A

664
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:46,869
but,

665
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,430
like, I haven't

666
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:52,800
had the time and space to actually run like, a fire drill every six months.

667
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,630
Like, I love it when we get these, um,

668
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,640
questionnaires from these companies that are like, you know, do you have backups?

669
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,079
Yeah. How do you handle your backup tapes?

670
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:01,670
And I'm like, we don't, you know, do you do this,

671
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,709
that and the other thing for security?

672
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,219
And I'm like, yeah,

673
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:03,744
it's like,

674
00:29:03,854 --> 00:29:06,484
do you actually, like a couple of them now have said basically,

675
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,474
do you have disaster recovery plans?

676
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:08,765
Yeah.

677
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:12,564
Do you, like, actually test them once a year? And it's like, who does that?

678
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,805
No, lots of people do, lots of people. Do.

679
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:16,864
They have tabletop exercises to do that kind

680
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,234
-- of stuff,
-- tabletop exercise? But I'm talking

681
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:21,084
like, yeah, you can't really test it

682
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,444
-- but
-- chaos gorilla like Netflix where it's like

683
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:26,685
no one does that. Now, now, here's the thing though,

684
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:29,214
tabletop exercises have value

685
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,405
and

686
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,000
it's not the same.

687
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,140
And even if you practice a lot with the tabletop,

688
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,780
everything's gonna go out the window when it comes to real life.

689
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:37,829
But I think

690
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,140
you will find egregious problems in your process if you tabletop something.

691
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:44,660
-- Well,
-- and if you make somebody sit down and not talk

692
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,560
seriously,

693
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,380
when you do a tabletop exercise,

694
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,109
pick one person at random and make them sit down and not talk

695
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,979
and you will probably find. Oh, oops.

696
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,530
Yeah.

697
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:55,829
Yeah.

698
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,689
Interesting.

699
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,339
Interesting.

700
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,469
You never thought about that.

701
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,910
Another great table top exercise is

702
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:04,410
ok. So slack goes away. How do we talk to each other?

703
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,449
I mean, that's a great question because that's happened to multiple companies.

704
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,650
And so, for example,

705
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,989
we have a signal group chat with myself and some of the principal that I,

706
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,910
I bump a message to every six months just

707
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,910
to make sure everybody's phone number hasn't changed.

708
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:20,689
-- I mean,
-- that's actually a good idea. I hadn't, I don't do that. We keep phone numbers

709
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:21,859
in a

710
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:26,510
-- location we'll say,
-- but how are you going to talk to them, like on the phone?

711
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,670
Like some old timey person, text

712
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,640
-- message,
-- man,

713
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:28,859
you

714
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:29,560
-- know,
-- text,

715
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,729
maybe get them all to install signal or whatever because

716
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,579
then you actually know who it is and so on and

717
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:34,079
what not.

718
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,520
But this is the exact same so, so like, well,

719
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,949
I don't have the time to do these massive exercises.

720
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:43,270
I know enough, I've seen enough houses burned down

721
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,989
to, so to speak that. I know that like, ok, I need

722
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,180
all the phone numbers of everybody in advance.

723
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:49,410
I need all, you know, this,

724
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,630
that and the other thing in advance and we all have signal installed and we all,

725
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,069
you know,

726
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,859
these preventative measures that will make life so

727
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,550
much easier when something bad does happen.

728
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,750
It's funny because these are new problems. Like, historically,

729
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,959
if you needed to get a hold of people, like everyone worked in the same basic area,

730
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:09,770
you probably knew where people lived, we went to work together, go to their house.

731
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,670
You know, it's,

732
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:12,810
doesn't work like that. Now,

733
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:14,760
if you show up at the office and if the office burns down,

734
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,750
you just hang out in the parking lot until everybody shows up.

735
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,369
-- I mean,
-- that's true. You could have done that.

736
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,449
I've, I don't think I've ever had that problem.

737
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:23,839
Well, you have the, you know, the muster point sign out in the parking lot.

738
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,000
Right.

739
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:26,869
But, yeah.

740
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,939
So, and I think that's, that's a big thing is,

741
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:31,719
is that I hate to say the nature of reality has changed,

742
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,280
but some of the big parts of, like,

743
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,650
the nature of recording reality is straight up out the window in the last six months,

744
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,839
it interests me

745
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:39,709
because

746
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:47,010
if we try to solve the problems of today, by the time we come up with even ideas,

747
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,670
there are new problems that we didn't even foresee.

748
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,880
And this, I think I, I don't have an answer for this. I don't even have an idea

749
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,209
and we haven't even identified all the problems of today yet.

750
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,780
No, we have. Exactly. And things are changing faster than we can comprehend.

751
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:08,290
And so like the question becomes, how do human beings as basically glorified apes

752
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,680
deal with a world that is changing faster than we can possibly comprehend?

753
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:18,069
And I have no idea. I have no answers. II, I legitimately don't know.

754
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,229
I don't know how we, what happens here.

755
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,739
See one interesting thing is there, there are some, there's like,

756
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,150
see these sort of very generic pieces of advice.

757
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,729
I think that will always work like maybe

758
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,719
slow down and, and take a moment to think,

759
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,209
right? Get like actually have an A

760
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,189
-- loop and not just a panic loop. I mean,
-- but that's easy to say.

761
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:37,329
-- Well,
-- no, no, I understand. But,

762
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,959
or for example, when I mentioned this to my CFO, he was like, oh, that's easy. You just

763
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,050
when you get like that weird email from the, you know,

764
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,119
the CEO who's trapped in a Mexican jail,

765
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,290
you email them back at their address and you type it out, you don't cut and paste,

766
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,609
you don't hit reply, you actually like

767
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,310
manually punch in their phone number or email

768
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,290
address or whatever good way of contacting them,

769
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
you have to reach out to them.

770
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,589
Right. You don't hit reply on the email because the email might be spooked.

771
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,000
And I'm like, oh, that's really simple.

772
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,229
He's like, yeah, that's what we do in the accounting world and

773
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,130
when people don't do it, they get ripped off and when they do do it, you know,

774
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,930
they actually get a hold of Agnes in accounting.

775
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,920
Who's like, yeah, we didn't send you that invoice. That's weird.

776
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:10,910
No, because we get like, for example,

777
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,760
we get fake invoices all the time from those like internet search companies.

778
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,040
You know,

779
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,880
that's like a new thing.

780
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:15,489
-- We
-- have to

781
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,479
pay this curtain. I'm like,

782
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,119
no,

783
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:22,640
that's a great scam. People send like lots of companies just pay invoices because

784
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,719
I don't know, I've got 7000 vendors. I guess this is a vendor.

785
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,479
They're like, Kurt, did you sign us up for this? I'm like, no, I would no

786
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,319
like RSE on Google is pretty good. We're not, we're not paying somebody for this.

787
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,750
Obviously,

788
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,180
it works because we keep seeing them and

789
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:38,869
I've been seeing these things for over 20 years

790
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:42,339
and they're gonna keep happening man. And there's going to be new scams and

791
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,650
I don't know, I don't have any answer.

792
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,119
They're going to be phoning my

793
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:50,250
-- CFO with my voice saying, hey, you know, we need to pay this invoice.
-- That's true.

794
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,890
That's true. That is probably going to happen at some point.

795
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:55,949
Well, that's exciting.

796
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,630
I I feel like we're leaving this one on a terrible note.

797
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:01,079
I don't know what to say.

798
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,079
Well, even better. Like TD Bank uses voice based authentication. Right.

799
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:06,780
We've talked about this before where it's like that,

800
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,390
that's great.

801
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,820
And that probably works for most normal people again,

802
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,830
up until a few months ago where all these deep takes.

803
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,860
Now there's like, again,

804
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,780
quarter crew used the service where you literally

805
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,550
feed it like a minute or two of audio

806
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,100
and you get the voice.

807
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,159
Oh,

808
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:22,458
I

809
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,540
get, I don't know, buy canned food and get a bunker.

810
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,590
That, that seems like the best solution.

811
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,239
Yeah, I don't know.

812
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,208
Part of me wants to say like,

813
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,879
oh facetime and turn your head side to side

814
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,530
really quickly to prove that you're not a deep

815
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,090
fake, but

816
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,478
-- like that'll be solved in a month or two.
-- Probably.

817
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,969
Well, no, you know, ok, here's how we end this one.

818
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:40,949
That doesn't make it sound like doom and gloom.

819
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,319
Human beings

820
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,697
have an amazing ability to solve ridiculous problems when we want to

821
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:50,299
right to date

822
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:54,178
many of the most ridiculous problems we have,

823
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:56,967
we have been ignoring because human beings are also

824
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:00,499
exceptional at ignoring problems until they can't anymore.

825
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,339
If it's not chewing on, you

826
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:02,658
can

827
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:03,128
be ignored.

828
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:07,314
That is generally what happens. And so some of these problems

829
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:11,935
we will ignore forever because they will never be serious enough to really matter.

830
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:13,044
And, and

831
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:14,895
the ones that matter,

832
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:19,935
we will solve because that is what people do and people are good at it. So

833
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:22,425
it is interesting to me

834
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:26,215
to see what is actually going to come of all this because I think

835
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:30,379
humans will solve the problems we need to and we will ignore

836
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,600
some problems. We shouldn't. But many of them, we also should.

837
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,219
-- Global warming might have been good to solve 2030 years ago. That
-- one is,

838
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,219
yes. But right,

839
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,540
here's the thing this comes back to that humans will ignore things until they can't.

840
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,989
And we're getting pretty close to we and when we can't,

841
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:48,979
but then

842
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,300
I am

843
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,659
optimistic

844
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:57,260
that humans will solve the problem in ways we can't fathom today.

845
00:35:57,729 --> 00:35:58,580
-- Sun
-- Shield

846
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:03,610
using technology and process and things that don't exist and, and look, I'm not,

847
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,139
I'm not gonna laugh at Sun Shield because that might be part of the solution.

848
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:07,979
I don't know,

849
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:08,810
but

850
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,909
I, I am comfortable

851
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,479
in saying humans can solve any problem. They want to,

852
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:16,239
the,

853
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,719
the asterisk is we have to want to do it.

854
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,959
And we have been ignoring an awful lot of stuff for an awful long

855
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:28,590
time and I think the bill is coming due on some pretty big problems

856
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,959
and all of this is part of that story.

857
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,639
So

858
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
I guess that that's probably less optimistic than I'd like,

859
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,479
but I feel like it's not a total.

860
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:38,959
Well, we're all boned.

861
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,100
Well, when you look at the challenges humanity has faced like we're here like,

862
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,959
it's not pretty and it's not always

863
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:48,120
tidy but we're here and

864
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,879
to put it simply, if you look at something like global poverty rates,

865
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:54,560
it's, it's getting better

866
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,080
a lot better compared to 30 years ago, 20 years ago. Like.

867
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:58,750
Yeah.

868
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,479
Yeah.

869
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,219
Wow.

870
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,939
Most statistics, crime, poverty,

871
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:05,409
-- like hunger
-- leaded gasoline. Like, jeez.

872
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,709
You look at that, those charts of crime in the US gasoline

873
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,429
-- and it's just like,
-- holy cow

874
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:10,899
do.

875
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:14,110
Right. Yeah, for sure. All right. All right.

876
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,689
I'm gonna call this one before we end up

877
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,969
in the weeds again on some other unrelated topic.

878
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:18,270
