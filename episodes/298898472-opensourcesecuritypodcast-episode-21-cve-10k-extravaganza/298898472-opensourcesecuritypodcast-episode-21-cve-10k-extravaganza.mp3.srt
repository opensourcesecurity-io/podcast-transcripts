Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 21

1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,210
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,129
We're legal to drink now in the United States, right?

3
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,229
Yeah,

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,760
that's uh 21 podcasts.

5
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:23,840
And we hit a major milestone today in the infosec industry,

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,010
-- a huge
-- milestone.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,290
Kurt,

8
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,719
possibly one of the biggest ever and something we've

9
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:30,680
been warning about for longer than I can recall.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,040
And it finally came true.

11
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:33,159
You were right,

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,340
five years,

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,369
-- at least, man, at least.
-- So today, actually, uh just a few hours ago,

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,159
uh Open SSH 7.4 was released

15
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:46,770
and somebody noticed it has several

16
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,080
security updates including a remote code execution

17
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,040
in the SSH agent code.

18
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,509
And

19
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:53,250
Mir

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,930
has assigned four CV S

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,790
uh to Open SSH one which in and of itself is quite exciting,

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,970
but more importantly, these are CV

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,639
over 10,000.

24
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:11,430
So we now have CV E 2016, 10,009, 10,010, 10,011 and 10,012.

25
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,800
And this affects a pro a product obviously that, you know, open SSH is in everything

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,019
I actually can't think of a network device that doesn't have it.

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,889
No, no, I mean there's alternatives,

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,279
there's things like drop your ssh and whatnot but, but

29
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,930
I don't know if people understand the significance of a CV E ID having five digits

30
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:37,819
is that has never happened. CV E I DS. Ok. Right. We're not gonna count that,

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,010
but practically speaking

32
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,059
in all of history, every CV E ID has had four digits after the year

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,169
and we've been

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,910
concerned for a long time that we would hit

35
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:54,430
10-K and this year in 2016, the year that just keeps on giving,

36
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:00,290
we legitimately crossed 10,000 CV E I DS being issued, which is

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,190
a mind boggling number.

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:02,620
Oh,

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,459
yeah. No, it's,

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:03,660
uh,

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,788
when the DWF assigned, we, we assigned some CV ES that are longer than

42
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:09,288
10-K.

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,100
But, you know,

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,020
a lot of the DWF project isn't really completely live and on stream yet.

45
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,220
But even when we did that, we discovered internally, you know,

46
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,649
that there are some system,

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,449
like there was one system that broke that wasn't

48
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,960
ready to handle CV S over four digits long.

49
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,830
And today, I mean, I can only imagine how many things are breaking right now.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,539
It's awesome.

51
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,479
And this doesn't. Miter has

52
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,350
actually Miter already assigned a CV E

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,070
10-K a

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,759
few days ago,

55
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,800
um,

56
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,350
and put it in the database today publicly, uh CV, 2016, 10,005 for Web

57
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,559
in Pro and Sap Solomon. I have no, it's an SAP related thing, I guess.

58
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,899
Um, and that is now in the database live,

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,460
which means if you consume those CS V files automatically, uh,

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,479
you better hope that you prepped for CV

61
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,240
10-K. Now, now the reality is CV.

62
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,520
10-K has been, I think we've been warning people and dealing with it for,

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,470
I wanna say, five or six or seven years ago.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,830
Long time. Yeah, it's been so long. I don't even remember anymore.

65
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,110
I think it's, I'm pretty sure it's older than my kids.

66
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,949
Well, we should also talk about the fact that

67
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:19,350
meer

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,270
officially updated the CV E format, what three years ago, maybe

69
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,690
to accommodate this, this because originally the,

70
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:34,350
the CV E data format was pegged at four digits and obviously any

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,669
reasonable person realized that was going to be a problem at some point

72
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:42,940
as it would have been today. Had they not fixed it? So what's the new format?

73
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:50,070
-- Kurt, explain it to us.
-- So the new format is very simple CV ES between 0001 and

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,479
9909. Stay the same. They're four digits,

75
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:58,660
then they add 1/5 digit for 10,000 through 99,999.

76
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,270
And then for six and up, we we just, you just keep adding digits.

77
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,589
So there's basically what it boils down to is there's no leading zero.

78
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,460
And the beauty of this is, it means we now have, well,

79
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,710
we're just using integers straight up, starting at four digits long.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,678
Uh So when I said there's no padding zeros, what I should have said is

81
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,600
there are padding zeros for single digit CV, S,

82
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:25,649
double digit CV S and obviously triple digit CV S and then CV, 1000 through 9009,

83
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,320
99999

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,809
have no padding. And above also has no padding.

85
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,519
And personally, I think that kind of makes sense because quite honestly, like CV,

86
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,089
2016-1

87
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,559
would look,

88
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:37,380
you know,

89
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:38,510
a bit strange.

90
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,149
Yeah,

91
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,799
but no, essentially we've now embraced integers and the sky is literally the limit.

92
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,709
It's gonna be awesome.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,920
And I mean, the other great news is in 2016,

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,350
Miter has minted a whole new pile of CV numbering authorities.

95
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,829
You know, we have the Apache Foundation,

96
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,309
we have JP uh cert Japanese cert

97
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,489
including a private individual. We also now have Larry

98
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,670
Kaller minted as AC N A enlisted officially on the CN A web page.

99
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,760
Larry is his own CNA. I had no

100
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:05,269
idea

101
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:05,519
that

102
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,209
-- C
-- N A web page. He is now his own CN A

103
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:09,119
quite

104
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,959
well back in the day, Stephen Christie actually did

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,959
uh presentation on CV and specifically called it Larry Cash

106
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,040
Dollar. I was completely hosing all the statistics for one year

107
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,190
because he found, you know, several 100 remote code execution vulnerabilities.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,739
And um I wanna say Ruby Jim's uh

109
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,209
applications,

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,959
you know, so this one guy single handedly, like,

111
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,720
totally skewed the bell curve for the rest of us.

112
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,320
So, I mean, you know, to me that says, uh, yeah, he's probably ready to PSCN A,

113
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,250
we'll, we'll let it go. Right.

114
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,269
So, well, and the, the problem too is he, you know,

115
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,630
he came to me and he needed CV S and I was like, how many he's like, well,

116
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,790
probably about 1000 of them.

117
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,670
I was like,

118
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,450
you maybe want to consider just being ac N A

119
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,299
at that point. It's like

120
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:56,540
you

121
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,010
don't go to the store and ask for 1000 turkeys.

122
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,549
You could

123
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:03,290
but they might. No, no, it's not even that though. It's not.

124
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,890
This isn't going to the store to ask for 1000 turkeys.

125
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,850
This is going to the store and saying I need 1000 slices of cheese, please.

126
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,029
And the person at the deli looks at you like, no,

127
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,130
absolutely not. Here's, here's five pounds of

128
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,260
uns,

129
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:16,910
somebody

130
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,959
do that at the Italian Center.

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,170
She wanted something like five pounds of sliced ham.

132
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:24,739
-- Well,
-- there's nothing

133
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,149
wrong with it.

134
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:33,320
No, no, five pounds of sliced ham is doable. But if you said I need 1005 slices of ham,

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,239
they're gonna be like, no,

136
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:35,859
I'm,

137
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:39,220
I will slice five pounds of ham or I will s give

138
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,420
you five pounds of ham and you may slice it too.

139
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:45,040
But I am not counting 1005 slices of ham.

140
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,109
Yeah.

141
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,480
Yeah. So, no, this is a, this is a great auspicious occasion. Uh

142
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,079
It also really drives home.

143
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,679
It drives me nuts that some open source projects just don't do

144
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,829
CV S.

145
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,799
-- Are there still some, I guess I don't
-- Linux

146
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,609
kernel,

147
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:04,410
the kernel is weird other than that one.

148
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,450
Open SSH and all of the open BS D stuff.

149
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:07,700
Oh,

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,239
that's true because they released this advisory here with no

151
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,799
CV E I DS which is kind of bonkers and

152
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:13,910
I

153
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,070
agree

154
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,459
with

155
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,369
-- that.
-- It's a cultural thing which I kind of agree and disagree with in that

156
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,959
the Linux kernel and the Open BS D guys, essentially, they,

157
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,000
they profess to only care about code

158
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,820
quality and code correctness and to them,

159
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,220
it doesn't matter if it's has a security implication or doesn't it

160
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,959
is incorrect. Code needs to be fixed end of story. And more importantly,

161
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:36,640
they,

162
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,290
the Linux kernel community and the Open BS D community

163
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,790
generally expects people to be running whatever the latest,

164
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,000
you know, effectively nightly build of the code is.

165
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,609
The Linux guys

166
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,540
are kind of a different story here. But, but if we pick on the open SSH guys,

167
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,589
they had a special security section in this advisory. So they can't claim

168
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,239
that they have no,

169
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:00,730
I,

170
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:04,869
I guess they don't care whether it's a security issue or not

171
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,440
since it's all about code quality because if they didn't care,

172
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,589
they wouldn't have a security section in their advisory.

173
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:10,950
Right?

174
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,010
II I can't speak as to their, what they're sort of

175
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:15,649
doing.

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:15,890
But

177
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,529
I just, all I know historically is that's what they've said. And,

178
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,440
you know, I understand that argument. It, it kind of makes sense. You know what?

179
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,829
No, I'm gonna say no,

180
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,170
because this is 2016.

181
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,049
And

182
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,770
basically all of this code is used all over the place and everybody knows it

183
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,169
and CD E is the standard, love it or hate it. It won guys.

184
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:42,109
It's what everyone uses and you can get on board or you can be

185
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:45,479
like the guy trying to ride his horse down the interstate where you're just,

186
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:49,270
everyone's looking at you and shaking their head and they're waiting for the, the,

187
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,440
the 18 wheeler to come and plow you over.

188
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:52,830
This is true.

189
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,450
The problem is,

190
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,979
and it's funny because I've actually been looking

191
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:57,409
at CV E usage from an economic perspective.

192
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,250
There's not a lot of

193
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,989
incentive for these open source projects to actually use CV.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,580
Other than to be, you know, good members of the community,

195
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,710
you know, open SSH, not using CV E doesn't really impact them

196
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,830
all that much, you know, it,

197
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,869
it certainly impacts the world and everybody else is shipping open SSH and using it.

198
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,280
But that's part of the challenge and, and I'm trying, I've actually,

199
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:26,619
I've got some ideas on how to make CV E more of a benefit to people who use it

200
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,460
so that more people will want to you know,

201
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:32,799
make sure that their issues have CV S assigned as soon as possible.

202
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,799
It's interesting you say that

203
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,080
because

204
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,559
you might not be wrong.

205
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,869
But I think you can make the same argument just with bugs in

206
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,469
general of what's the purpose of having a bug tracker with I DS.

207
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,570
Why don't we just do everything in g,

208
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,530
well,

209
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,219
the one advantage of having a bug tracker is it

210
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,539
actually does have an economic benefit to the project,

211
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:54,650
right?

212
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,750
It makes it cheaper and easier for them to track and manage their own, you know,

213
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,239
internally found things.

214
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:01,869
So there is a real,

215
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,140
you know, in economic terms, there's a real benefit

216
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,409
to having this, you know, you don't have to spend time figuring out.

217
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,380
Did we already fix this? Did we, was this already reported?

218
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,380
Was this already dealt with, is somebody else working on this?

219
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,159
-- But
-- you can make the same argument with CV E I DS is someone could say,

220
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:20,349
did you,

221
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,590
did you fix the security issue?

222
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:23,859
True.

223
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:28,539
But for example, the open SSH and Open BS D communities have historically been uh uh

224
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,020
not as user friendly maybe.

225
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:32,659
Yeah,

226
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:36,419
you know, and, and they quite frankly don't, like they flat out said they don't care,

227
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,260
you know, kind of about that kind of that, that

228
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,419
part of the problem.

229
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:44,109
So essentially what it boils down to is yes, there is a real benefit for using TV.

230
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,419
I mean, the biggest one being is that,

231
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,039
you know, whenever Red Hat finds an issue

232
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,659
and we have to talk with other people about it, you know,

233
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,719
especially if there's multiple issues in something,

234
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,719
you know, then CV E provides a huge benefit in that we can actually

235
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:58,900
uh

236
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,440
identify what it is we're talking about with these other vendors,

237
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,289
especially when there's, you know, more than say, 10 or 20 vendors involved,

238
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:04,619
you know,

239
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,909
but um there's something to remember is open SSH doesn't have that right.

240
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,239
Open SSH development largely happens within the open SSH community

241
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,049
and they essentially push out

242
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,940
versions publicly, you know. Um As far as I know, they've never given anybody

243
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:24,679
-- a heads up or, you know, embargo notification ever.
-- Sure.

244
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,760
And, well, so, you know, what this really comes down to, I guess,

245
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,880
is kind of putting the open source hat on is

246
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,979
Open BS D

247
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,099
is quite free to say, I don't want to use this thing.

248
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,859
But

249
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,140
given the fact that other organizations do care about it,

250
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:44,929
we're able to get involved and basically make these I DS

251
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,700
work in this context just because that's kind of the,

252
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,409
the magic of open source is

253
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,659
a,

254
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,489
the project doesn't have to care about something.

255
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,130
But if someone else does and they're willing to do the work now, it's a real thing.

256
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,609
-- And I guess that's exactly what this is
-- and that's

257
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,710
part of what the DWF solves is long term.

258
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,580
Once the DWF has, you know, our technology stack, stand up, standing up to, uh,

259
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,580
you know, make CV assignments happen a lot more, uh, less painlessly.

260
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,309
We'll be taking on all the open source assignments. And one thing I'll be definitely

261
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,010
doing is, you know, the DWF will act as sort of the insurer of last resort. Right.

262
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,280
If you need an open source CV. And the project doesn't do CV S,

263
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,770
you can come to the DWF to get a CV.

264
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,210
And one thing I will be doing is, you know,

265
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:26,609
with the CV mentor program is there will be people with sort of specialties,

266
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:26,969
you know,

267
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,489
and no doubt,

268
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,559
I will hopefully have one or more people whose

269
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,570
specialty is the whole open BS D open SSH ecosystem

270
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,690
so that we can get good

271
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,320
coverage of them.

272
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,580
Um, because I've actually looked through and, you know,

273
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,729
there's historical bugs that,

274
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:43,429
you know,

275
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,289
sometimes what happens is a flaw gets fixed and it doesn't get known as

276
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,299
a security flaw for weeks or months or even years in some case,

277
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,190
you know,

278
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,719
and especially with people who run sort of stable versions

279
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,650
of the software and back part of the security fixes.

280
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,799
That's a very important thing to find out about,

281
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:02,750
you know, because there's, there's been Linux flaws where uh they were fixed

282
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:04,349
23 years ago

283
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,849
and it's only recently somebody's looking through that code commit and being like,

284
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,070
oh, you know, this plus this equals a security flaw this,

285
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,859
you know,

286
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:12,580
and

287
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,210
as it was not identified as a security flaw back in the day.

288
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:17,880
You know, anybody doing the backboard thing

289
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:19,859
doesn't have this fix.

290
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,989
You know, but the minute you assign it a CV, it pops up on the radar of everybody.

291
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,750
I mean, that's very true.

292
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,989
So, and that's one of my biggest goals. Right.

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,950
I wanna make CV S so easy to request and so easy to assign

294
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:32,830
that. It,

295
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,760
it's like using a bug tracker. Like, why would you do it any other way?

296
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,559
It's, you know, source control, right?

297
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,200
The only people not doing it are, are essentially determined to be backwards,

298
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,489
you know,

299
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,140
and we're not quite at that point yet, but hopefully within 2 to 3 years we will be,

300
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,109
-- that's awesome. And then we'll have millions of CV I DS instead of 10,000,
-- right?

301
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:55,679
Yeah.

302
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,460
Well, especially when you consider we have almost, well,

303
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,659
really no coverage of non-english software.

304
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,150
-- Uh Didn't you just say JP Cert is AC N A
-- now?

305
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,340
They are AC N A? But I mean, obviously it's gonna take

306
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,309
time for them to come online and bring, you know, all of Japan

307
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,900
and quite a bit of Japan is already pretty good about it.

308
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,460
You know, Hitachi and some other vendors are pretty good about their CV S.

309
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,809
Uh But obviously with it being easier, I'm guessing that, you know,

310
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,380
there will be more issues that get CV S because, well,

311
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:24,750
small things that in the past were sort of not given CV S because it was too much hassle

312
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,260
or a few years ago prior to CV,

313
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:27,840
10-K,

314
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,409
you know, miter

315
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,619
and other groups kind of actually had to cut back a bit on CV assignments to make

316
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,890
sure they didn't run out in case something

317
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,619
important happened towards the end of the year.

318
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,099
You know, literally. Right, because it was artificial scarcity.

319
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:38,820
That's true.

320
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,669
If you look at CV assignments,

321
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,530
-- we ran
-- out of

322
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,380
integers.

323
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:42,929
Yeah.

324
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,369
Well, exactly. You know,

325
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,489
uh but we solved that problem now, we have an infinite number of CV S

326
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,010
and

327
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,549
researchers. That's a challenge.

328
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:52,989
-- You
-- know,

329
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,469
it's, it's going to happen.

330
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,059
I mean,

331
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,239
Google announced what two weeks ago now that they are open source fuzzing project,

332
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,479
they were taking candidates

333
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,150
uh for open

334
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,880
source projects that they're going to fuzz and find security flaws in

335
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,369
which is kind of crazy to think about because the day is coming

336
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,030
where we're going to have a computer that finds a security issue,

337
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,140
classifies it, probably writes a patch for it

338
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,250
and sends the patch away without human beings even being involved at all.

339
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,849
Yeah, there's already experimental work with that.

340
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,669
Uh And one of the best ones I saw was not only that,

341
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,369
but it actually came up with exploit code

342
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,349
like a built a test case which

343
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,869
I know it's incredibly useful, right?

344
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,489
Because you need to know that this patch works and that there's no regression later.

345
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,830
In life when you, you know, modify something else. Right.

346
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,140
So, it, it's coming, it's

347
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,000
fundamentally it's one of those things. It's like self driving cars. Yeah.

348
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,179
It's not an easy problem. And snow will definitely make it even harder.

349
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,409
You know, there's a lot of security flaws that are quite subtle. But fundamentally

350
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,690
we don't need to be

351
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,539
very good to be better than most humans.

352
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:57,979
Right.

353
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:59,270
That's the thing to remember too is to make a

354
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,659
self driving car that is better than the average human.

355
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,520
You really?

356
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:03,729
Yeah.

357
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:08,340
You know, we just finished a new season of Canada's Worst Driver, uh, season 12.

358
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,059
And I mean, you know, for some of these people it was like,

359
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:14,539
well, I only drink when I drive because I'm so tense.

360
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,140
I drive, I need to be a bit more relaxed.

361
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,179
So I have a few drinks before I drive and, you know, I know, and the,

362
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,179
the people running the show were kind of like, wait, what, like

363
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,409
you, what, you know, you, you, that's drinking and driving.

364
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,789
He's like, well, yeah, but I only do it so that I drive better and they're like that.

365
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,570
No,

366
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:33,260
you, you know, so there's people that do those things let alone, you know,

367
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,299
turn signals.

368
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,070
So the reality is, you know, with a lot of the security flaws.

369
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
I mean, the fact that somebody like Larry Cash

370
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:43,929
Doer can essentially script this and find thousands of security flaws.

371
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,700
You know, we, we can find a lot,

372
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,090
millions of security flaws with not very sophisticated automated systems.

373
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,400
-- So
-- here's the deal too. Ok.

374
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,580
And this is a complaint I've had for a long time

375
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,010
is finding security issues is quite honestly not difficult to do.

376
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,700
I mean, buzzers have come out and are doing

377
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,260
a marvelous job

378
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:07,459
of this work. And I remember back in the day

379
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:08,659
when

380
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,718
someone would fuzz like a font library and then say, oh, look,

381
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:16,388
here's 1000 font files that crashed this library.

382
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,167
And

383
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,218
it's like, that's not,

384
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:22,417
I'm not giving you any credit for this because this isn't work.

385
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,968
The real work is the poor samp.

386
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,417
So we have to figure this out and of course, it ended up being, you know,

387
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,938
three or four real bugs and the rest are garbage.

388
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:29,259
But

389
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,810
that's the thing, right? Is just finding the issues isn't the challenge.

390
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,619
The challenge is working with the groups and getting this stuff fixed correctly.

391
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,969
-- And like those guys are the heroes
-- even identifying that it is or is not an issue.

392
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,689
You know, I had somebody come to me with exactly that 1000 or 100 or so

393
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,390
test cases for, um,

394
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,880
it was a utility that converted file formats for like office file formats and um,

395
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,449
ok, great. Yeah, I, I definitely agree. You found bugs that crash it

396
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,170
and he's like, can you please, uh,

397
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,150
essentially investigate them and assign c visas as necessary?

398
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,180
My response was no, no I can't,

399
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,170
but, you know, you can come back to me with minimized test cases

400
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,729
and we'll talk and literally four days later he came back and he was like, oh yeah,

401
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,189
these all just crash it.

402
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,650
None of them are exploitable at all.

403
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,770
And I'm like, well, you know, I, that's awesome.

404
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,589
And you're not getting any CV S because, you know, generally speaking,

405
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,420
crasher bugs and command line utilities.

406
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,989
Unless it's something that, you know, typically used by servers to,

407
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,319
to mangle data being passed from the internet, like,

408
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:27,880
say an image library or whatever,

409
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,530
we generally don't bother giving those CV S because

410
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,109
especially with crasher bugs, the response would be, well, just, you know,

411
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,270
you opened a file, it crashed, well, don't open it again.

412
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,709
Like don't sit there hitting

413
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,829
repeat until you die of old age.

414
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,790
-- It's like
-- I want, I want a CV E because when I hit my laptop with a hammer, it,

415
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,790
it stops working.

416
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,750
Well, now,

417
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,439
if the laptop manufacturer made a security claim that it was hammer proof,

418
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,349
then we would consider giving it a CV.

419
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,390
Although we technically don't do CV S for hardware issues that although again,

420
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,859
that line is incredibly blurred because for example FPG eight, you know,

421
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,410
field programmable gator rays

422
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,410
or, you know, TCP/IP in silicon,

423
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,260
right? Is that hardware? Is that software? Well, software in hardware?

424
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,219
That's

425
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,119
an interesting question. And

426
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,229
what about CPU micro

427
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:12,520
code?

428
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,339
Right.

429
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,729
Right. Right. Well, that's magic.

430
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,619
And we don't know anything about those, but there, there are

431
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,540
so, so I know, I don't know how this works anymore since I've,

432
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,760
I've not paid attention to the industry for a long time.

433
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,300
But I know

434
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:29,469
there were actually applications at one point that you would write C code for,

435
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,229
say like an MP3 decoder

436
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,130
and you would run this application on the C code and it would essentially output

437
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,609
the layout for a chip and then you incorporate that into your designs.

438
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,040
And of course, the C code had bugs.

439
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,260
And so

440
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,449
that, I don't know, I mean,

441
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,800
if you found say a buffer overflow and something like that,

442
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,770
that let you do crazy things in hardware is that a security issue?

443
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,119
Well, here's a simple example that becomes very non simple.

444
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,829
You have a hardware random number generator.

445
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,530
These, these do exist in hardware, you know, there's ones based on, you know,

446
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,050
thermal noise in the CPU whatever.

447
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,589
And let's say, for example, every once in a while,

448
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,339
uh let's say it also makes the claim that

449
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:11,030
it is a cryptographically secure random number generator,

450
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,469
right?

451
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,390
Which means it has special properties like it won't spit out a stream of zeros for,

452
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,119
you know, two days,

453
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:18,199
right?

454
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,920
Because if you, if you generate encryption keys based on that, you're,

455
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,150
you're gonna have a bad time.

456
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,680
And let's say it does do that

457
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,489
randomly well, may you know, should it, for example,

458
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,189
let's say for the sake of argument it's caused by cosmic rays,

459
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:34,880
you know, something you just can't block and deal with reasonably. Right.

460
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,239
But should it have maybe had some sort of test

461
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,189
on the output to make sure the output's not garbage?

462
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,219
Right. Where do you draw those, this line?

463
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,050
I mean, clearly you have a problem when,

464
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,869
say your random number generator spits out zeros for two days straight.

465
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,099
Right?

466
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,989
Or, you know, say after a period of, uh, what is it, uh um

467
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:55,819
4 billion seconds it runs out or goes wonky and starts spitting out zeros or,

468
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,270
you know, different cases like this, right.

469
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,709
What is it

470
00:20:58,109 --> 00:20:58,530
Boeing?

471
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,380
What, what plane is it,

472
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,819
-- the Boeing plane that has to be turned off and on every 32
-- and a half

473
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,500
hours, it's their Dreamliner,

474
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,500
the 787, right? Yeah, the new one.

475
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,300
And the best part is though,

476
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,599
actually you can't turn it off and on

477
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,729
too often because that apparently also causes problems.

478
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,099
Of course it does. So,

479
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah, so it's as part of the maintenance thing now,

480
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,780
you're supposed to turn the plane off and on every uh 31 days or something like that.

481
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,849
So, I guess that you don't, you know, mid flight have the system,

482
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,260
you know, go bonkers, right.

483
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,900
Uh But, you know, clearly there are,

484
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,819
-- there is the potential for hardware based flaws to some degree and
-- as miter

485
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,119
prepared

486
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,420
-- to issue CV ID for those,
-- not at this

487
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,660
time,

488
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,339
uh although it's something the board is discussing and we're working on and

489
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,459
obviously a lot of us are pushing for it because the reality is,

490
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:46,699
you know,

491
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,420
TCP, offload.

492
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,099
That, that's a big thing nowadays, you know,

493
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,290
and the reality is that's going to become

494
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,619
the default in TCP/IP stacks because especially with internet of things,

495
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:58,050
you know,

496
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,219
as a manufacturer,

497
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:03,670
you don't have a lot of power and you don't have a lot of software and CPU to play with.

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,719
So, you know, if you can buy a chip that's the same cost that has TCP offload,

499
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:08,400
you're going to do that.

500
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,430
-- Well,
-- what about like some of these enclave processors now where you've got your,

501
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:14,560
essentially the idea, I mean,

502
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,560
like the Apple iphone and most of these phones

503
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,500
use it where they have like the special secure processor

504
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,290
that's designed to hold,

505
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:25,329
you know, key material and, and login material and things like that. So

506
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:28,369
the line gets really fuzzy there

507
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:32,689
as to what is hardware problems and what is a software problem.

508
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,890
And fundamentally, I mean, the reality is just,

509
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,089
I think it's going to happen because there's value in it, right?

510
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,109
I need to know if this stuff works or not.

511
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,969
You know,

512
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,150
even if I can't fix it, I can at a minimum, say for example,

513
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,479
buy new hardware and replace it or stop using it,

514
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,390
you know.

515
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,209
Yeah.

516
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:52,609
-- Yeah, that makes sense.
-- But at least as a consumer, I need to know that it is a problem.

517
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,859
You know, the, it's like product safety recalls. Right.

518
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:59,050
A lot of product safety recalls consist of, go take this thing back and get a refund.

519
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,500
Sure. Right. Because it's not economically viable to fix this thing.

520
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,150
It would cost 50 bucks to fix a $5 device or whatever, you know,

521
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,859
but as a consumer you need to know that there's a problem so that, you know,

522
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,209
you can get rid of this thing or replace it or whatever.

523
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,280
And, and is CV E

524
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,469
the way we want to deal with things like that?

525
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,349
Well, I, you know,

526
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,859
and then part of the challenge there becomes what exactly is a security flaw, right?

527
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,430
So traditionally,

528
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,119
we've talked about, say, for example, denial of service.

529
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,239
Well,

530
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,750
what if I have a remote flaw that lets me

531
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,619
brick your IOT device into a completely unrecoverable state?

532
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:34,540
Well,

533
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,910
let's, I personally would say that that's a security issue.

534
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,739
We can even back it up from there though. Is

535
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,949
we ask questions like, what's a security issue? What happens when

536
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,439
we have sand boxing technology

537
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,650
around

538
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:48,880
an application

539
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,449
and you can maybe take over a certain

540
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,449
amount of the application's ability to do things,

541
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,060
but it's stuck in the sandbox.

542
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,560
Is that a security issue?

543
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,810
It would depend on what you're able to do and not do.

544
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,229
I mean, it would be, is there a trust boundary being crossed?

545
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:06,140
You know, is the attacker able to get additional access, you know,

546
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,469
for example, maybe the application is only supposed to turn the light

547
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,010
on and off,

548
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,739
but maybe I can also then cause it to dim or something or I can, you know,

549
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,760
do other things.

550
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,650
Um,

551
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:20,260
I think a lot of what's gonna have to happen is we're gonna have to

552
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,459
become

553
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,359
ideally a bit more concise about what the security properties of these systems are.

554
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:27,859
So that we know when they're being violated,

555
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,689
which of course is not going to work at

556
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,719
all for cheap devices because they just don't care,

557
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:32,119
right?

558
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,479
They're not going to send out a security assertion

559
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:37,290
document with this thing. You know,

560
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:39,589
I mean, a perfect example that like is FS

561
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,209
testing, right?

562
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:43,280
The federal information protection standard stuff, you know, for encryption,

563
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:43,449
right?

564
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:43,829
Where

565
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:46,359
you have hardware certification

566
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,739
of, yeah, you, you no doubt are familiar.

567
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,959
So you have hardware uh

568
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,849
that does encryption and decryption and is,

569
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,280
you know, some of it is uh tamper resistance, some of it is just tamper evidence.

570
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,250
Some of it is,

571
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,260
you know,

572
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,420
uh I think it will basically commit suicide if you look at it funny

573
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:06,939
so that it can't be decrypted or whatever.

574
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,479
So there's also different

575
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:11,400
pips levels where some are very hardware focused,

576
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,939
some are software focused and some are where you mix the two

577
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,719
is what makes a difference.

578
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:21,540
And Phipps is, is a really interesting one actually because

579
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:26,969
fundamentally and, and I guess this is sort of true in general for CV E is,

580
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:30,260
the intent isn't to deceive or to necessarily

581
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,310
prove absolutes in one direction or the other.

582
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,430
It's, it's more along the lines of

583
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,209
we're, we're showing that we've put in an honest effort here

584
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,750
and this is as good as we think it can be.

585
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:42,430
Yeah.

586
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,069
Well, the reality is, you know,

587
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,199
a lot of stuff based on Open SSL has been FIP certified and of course,

588
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,189
open SSL keeps fixing security flaws.

589
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes. You know, that's just the nature of our reality.

590
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,400
It's complicated though because Phipps focuses very much on the,

591
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,920
the cryptographic math,

592
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,859
not all the other stuff.

593
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:06,000
And Open SSL actually doesn't touch the algorithms very often.

594
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,400
It's all the other crap surrounding it

595
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,839
that gets all the attention.

596
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:15,339
And so, I mean, this is part of what makes Pips so confusing and bizarre is

597
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,619
like TLS isn't covered by FIS but the, the ciphers

598
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,680
that are used with TLS are,

599
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,839
-- and
-- this is, it's

600
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,099
just only covering the low

601
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,390
-- level,
-- very,

602
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:29,170
very low level. Yes.

603
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,750
And actually this is one of the things that the,

604
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,979
the nist folks have been talking about is the fact that

605
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,459
you can have,

606
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:40,229
you know, super secured, validated ciphers

607
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,689
and you can have a TLS layer that's absolute garbage.

608
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,530
And so you could have a Phipps validated product

609
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,770
that is essentially a huge piece of crap.

610
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:51,280
And that's a problem. Right.

611
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:52,020
Well,

612
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,910
I think a lot of that boils down to is truly

613
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,530
testing the software and giving it assurance either way is,

614
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,550
is impossible.

615
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:58,219
And

616
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:02,430
I personally think I would rather look at it more from an operational standpoint of,

617
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,500
you know, we know that this, so we know that all software has flaws,

618
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,979
for example, what is the vendor capable of doing response wise? Right.

619
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,890
How fast can they get a security update out? Do they have a security team?

620
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,069
Do they have just one guy or is it like 20 people?

621
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:18,949
You know, do they? I, I've dealt with companies where they,

622
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,239
they absolutely don't work except between 9 to 5.

623
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:23,270
Right.

624
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,839
So, out of hours and on the weekends there's, there's literally nobody home,

625
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:30,530
-- it's impossible to deal with and,
-- and there's a huge holiday coming up.

626
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,660
How many organizations are going to basically shut down for an entire week?

627
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,150
Yeah.

628
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,500
So personally, my take on it with security is,

629
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,550
and this is kind of where I'm hoping to move CV.

630
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,829
Economically speaking is

631
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:47,560
right now CV, is seen as a, as a bad thing. Right. You have a CV, you're bad. Right.

632
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,030
You've got four CV s and open,

633
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,469
bad, bad, bad

634
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,040
to me. It's actually the opposite. It's good. Right.

635
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,109
I, it means people are identifying and fixing security flaws.

636
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:57,849
I,

637
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,689
I agree with you completely and I feel like we may have mentioned this in the past and

638
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,739
I might, I, I've written this down.

639
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,630
I know many times in many different places is the fact that

640
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,849
if you have a product and there are zero CV E I DS for that product

641
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,510
that is a product no one cares about.

642
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,510
Nobody is looking because every single piece of software on the planet,

643
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,540
no matter what it does has security issues.

644
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:23,790
Well, and it actually,

645
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,229
it's a bit worse than that now because there's a lot of stuff with embedded software,

646
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,739
like every network device is probably running Linux

647
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,380
by large,

648
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,300
you know,

649
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,640
and so there are definitely flaws in it.

650
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,699
It's just they haven't been explicitly identified in that

651
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,060
whatever that vendors shipping what version they're using,

652
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,900
you know,

653
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:43,469
uh

654
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:43,939
and the,

655
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:47,189
and the problem is you don't have to look that hard to find them, right? You can use

656
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,770
old attacks, you know, in metas

657
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,260
or, you know, various security scanners to very easily, you know,

658
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,739
poke at a device and find out whether or not it's flawed

659
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,569
with very minimal effort. Uh The challenge then being is, you know,

660
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,589
for example, let's say you did some research into

661
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,380
IP cameras, you know, IP based cameras

662
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,510
and you found a whole bunch of them running outdated software. What would you do?

663
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,280
I would join them to my botnet.

664
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,560
-- You
-- know, currently there's no easy way to say,

665
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,329
update the CV descriptions and information to say what's vulnerable.

666
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,050
And fortunately that is changing, you know,

667
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,020
that's something we're working on currently

668
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:24,390
uh in the CV world.

669
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:27,229
Wait, wait. So you want to let

670
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,390
normal people

671
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,430
basically say this particular product or application is vulnerable,

672
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,000
that's hugely valuable. Look at that.

673
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,520
I mean, it comes back to that, that Google guy who was reviewing uh USB C cables.

674
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:47,489
Remember on Amazon and finding cables that like fried his laptop or pixel that

675
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,060
you know what that is incredibly valuable work and data, right?

676
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:54,530
Because I I don't want to fry my stuff by buying like a cheap cable.

677
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,369
I agree with you.

678
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,270
So let's think about this for a minute. And, and I'm very much in favor of this

679
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,459
idea.

680
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,250
The secret is, is that you have

681
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,219
within a CV, different classes of data, you have sort of the,

682
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,900
the the really trusted high quality data like

683
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,140
the description or

684
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:14,579
the CV number itself

685
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:18,579
and that, you know, we restrict access to who can monkey with that to some degree.

686
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,849
But for example, with, with the, with the DWF and with the new CV stuff,

687
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,609
we're looking at a

688
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,459
JSON format

689
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,540
that for example,

690
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,209
has a vendor section so that specific vendors

691
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:30,239
and products can have claims made against them

692
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:35,000
-- without sort of polluting the global description.
-- I love that idea. In fact, we

693
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,880
NVD used to do that.

694
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,239
I don't know if they still do,

695
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,050
-- but they would let vendors essentially add commentary to every CV E
-- ID.

696
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,439
And for example,

697
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:47,439
I've had some vendors bring up the case of where they

698
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:50,890
want to have CV SS scoring specific to their product because

699
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,670
for example, they maybe have better se Linux policies to harden it.

700
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,770
-- So it's not quite as bad
-- or CV SS scoring is very

701
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,849
environment dependent

702
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,930
where if you're using an application in this way,

703
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:07,770
it would drastically change the score versus using it in another way.

704
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,689
Exactly.

705
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,410
And some vendor ship things that are actually secure by default

706
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,869
or, you know,

707
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,280
default or

708
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,239
choice,

709
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,349
it's slowly happening very slowly. But yeah.

710
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:20,599
So anyways, the,

711
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:23,119
the reality is what I'm gonna do is there's gonna be essentially

712
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,119
the the data that is traditionally seen as high quality and good,

713
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,199
you know, which basically is the CV description text itself.

714
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:30,800
You know, this

715
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,630
product has this vulnerability and this version resulting in this impact,

716
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:39,430
you know, like buffer overflow, resulting in code execution, remotely whatever.

717
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:42,079
But yeah, then for specific vendors

718
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,969
and I don't mean just like for example, Red Hat and souza and Debian and Open BS D.

719
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:46,670
But I mean, like,

720
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,119
you know, this Chinese digital video recorder built by this company, you know,

721
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,099
is running a

722
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:56,750
web server with, you know, this vulnerable version of PHP.

723
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,839
So I want to add that information to, you know, that CV E about PHP,

724
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,209
right?

725
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,930
That's,

726
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,949
that's so crazy. I mean, I love this, I love this so much

727
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:07,920
but it's,

728
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:12,209
-- it's,
-- it's a, it's a problem space, you know, remarkably similar to, you know,

729
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:14,060
online ratings of, well, anything,

730
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,670
right?

731
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,109
It's, it's not an easy problem, but it is basically a solved problem. And

732
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,709
the beauty is, the reality is in the security industry,

733
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,750
the majority of people who behave rationally insanely are, you know,

734
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,979
reasonably well known.

735
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,550
They're not hard to identify, you know, when somebody comes to me and says,

736
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,709
I want to add this description,

737
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:33,500
I look at their email address of their Twitter handle and I'm like,

738
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,189
chances are I either know who they are or I can find out very quickly if they're,

739
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,339
you know, saying and rational

740
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:38,650
cyber

741
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,140
troll 1375.

742
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,430
Don't

743
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:42,310
listen

744
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:42,849
to that guy.

745
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,930
Yeah. So,

746
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,729
and you know, part of it is this distributive trust property, right?

747
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:52,339
So the way I'm, I'm really trying to set up the DWF with the CV mentor program is

748
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,270
I will be minting CV mentors like such as yourself and you in turn, for example,

749
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,780
when you go to SMU

750
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:01,530
on or whatever can actually start minting

751
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,729
other CV mentors that have specialties and

752
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:08,260
assigning CV S or maybe uh specialties in making assertions, you know, because

753
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,109
uh what was it?

754
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,280
Oh, remember back in the day,

755
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,489
there was that one developer for the Linux kernel who had like

756
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,079
one copy of what was it like every USB video camera ever made

757
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,109
and he wrote

758
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,680
all the drivers for them. Remember that

759
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,900
it was, I don't even know if he was an official Linux

760
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,760
developer. I

761
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:24,250
think

762
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,300
-- it was for
-- the longest time

763
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,829
was just this dude in France that,

764
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,270
-- that made everything work
-- and that's a perfect example of like,

765
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,930
as ridiculous as that is, it totally worked.

766
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:35,739
People.

767
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,069
I remember he had a web page and he was, he had this huge list of all the web cameras,

768
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,619
all the USB cameras he had.

769
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,989
And then it was basically was like, if you have a camera that is not on this list,

770
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,410
mail it to this address

771
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,890
and, and like, I'll write a driver for it if I can.

772
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,680
I remember this was similar back in the late nineties

773
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:57,250
with Ethernet cards as well where there was some,

774
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,089
yeah, the NASA guy

775
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,015
because I remember,

776
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:02,824
I remember emailing him.

777
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,005
-- Right. Right.
-- I remember,

778
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:07,055
well, well, so when I went to college,

779
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:08,655
like

780
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:13,655
Ethernet was a big deal and I remember like, I had a network at home and stuff,

781
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,495
so I didn't care, but they would only let you plug in

782
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,819
an Ethernet card you purchased from the university.

783
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,759
And I remember, I'm like, this is insane. I have a box full of these things over here.

784
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,599
Just let me use one of mine. Like, no, no,

785
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:27,618
you need yours. And I'm like, can I run Linux?

786
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,059
And they're like, their heads exploded.

787
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,447
And I thought all right, I'm going to, in fact,

788
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,728
I installed windows on my Linux machine.

789
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,728
So, and I had to bring it to them and I, like, I watched them do it because I,

790
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,060
I was very insistent.

791
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,010
I'd be there when they touch my computer because I,

792
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:44,668
my assumption was they were morons and I'm pretty sure that's not wrong.

793
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:46,168
But anyway, they,

794
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,110
they put in their special Ethernet card, which I had to use and they even had it.

795
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,050
So when you connect it to the network, it would verify the Mac address. So it was,

796
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,228
and it did a bunch of monkeying and I thought, you know, what,

797
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:59,810
use a stupid card and, yeah. Yeah, like getting it to work was in Linux

798
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:00,649
back then.

799
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,209
Yeah, Donald Becker, that's the guy.

800
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,040
He, I wonder whatever happened to him.

801
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,620
But yeah, no,

802
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:07,620
I literally would only buy cards that he

803
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:10,379
wrote drivers for because everything else was garbage

804
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,860
and it was crazy back then. It was, oh my goodness.

805
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,659
Why are we even talking about this anymore?

806
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,820
Well, because the reality is we're back in that situation, right? Like I need to buy

807
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:21,610
cables.

808
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:22,729
I and, and you know,

809
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,989
I'm plugging devices that cost 1000 bucks into these

810
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,489
cables and these cables cost like a dollar.

811
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,310
-- All right.
-- So let me ask, this is a cable that is known bad and will cook your laptop.

812
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,129
Should that get a CV E ID?

813
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,600
Is that

814
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,260
that?

815
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,879
Well, no, it's, it's, it's a violation of a state

816
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:40,840
property, right?

817
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,610
They stated that this cable is a USB C compliant, which means it has,

818
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,800
I think what is it like a 51?

819
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,270
Ohm resistor or something on PN seven or something,

820
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:51,010
you know, specific like that, right? To prevent it from cooking stuff

821
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,770
and, you know,

822
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,949
they're finding these things with like smaller resistors or whatever it is.

823
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,729
You know, I'm totally wrong on this,

824
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,129
but it's some detail like that that causes the physical damage

825
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,050
to me.

826
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,830
That is, you know,

827
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,760
obviously if you say that this cable meets a certain specification and

828
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,280
in failing to meet that specification, it causes actual, like physical damage.

829
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:13,600
Yeah, that's a problem. That's something I need to know about is, and I,

830
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,219
you know what happens if your local university purchases

831
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,870
1000 of these cables and hands them out.

832
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,189
All right. Well, here's

833
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,300
a

834
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:19,530
million

835
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:19,919
dollars and

836
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,100
let's make it even weirder

837
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,110
is what if the manufacturer of the cable

838
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,659
doesn't make claims about its USB C compatibility?

839
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:31,459
There are specific and implied claims.

840
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,030
So for example,

841
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,330
you can make a specific claim like you can imply or you can make a specific claim,

842
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,919
this product ships with the firewall that has these properties.

843
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:41,429
And if it doesn't clearly a CV is needed,

844
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:44,189
there's also implied claims. For example,

845
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,250
uh

846
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:48,060
like products not having a back door,

847
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:51,219
even if it's somewhat documented, that's still a problem,

848
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:51,870
right?

849
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,520
Because we expect products not to have back doors just

850
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,939
like I expect to be able to buy cables,

851
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:59,139
plug stuff in and not have it fry.

852
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,010
But if, if a cable doesn't claim to be USB C compatible,

853
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,679
but it has a USB C plug on the end is that implied,

854
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:08,360
I would say, yeah,

855
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:08,870
I

856
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:10,540
would kind of agree with you there.

857
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,199
You know what I mean?

858
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,580
Well, for example, I make a USB extension cable which has like

859
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,429
a signal booster into it, except that signal booster.

860
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:22,340
I, I sort of missed a couple zeros and it puts out the signal to say 1000 volts.

861
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,739
I think you can buy one of those for $50 now. So

862
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,659
clearly, like if, you know,

863
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:31,189
I have a cable that say boost the signal

864
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,360
and boost it way too much causing physical damage.

865
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,320
Even if I don't

866
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,040
make specific claims. Obviously, again, that's,

867
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:38,679
you know, that's a huge problem.

868
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,780
Um

869
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:43,169
You know, and then it gets into sort of what's intentional, what's not intentional.

870
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:43,360
Like

871
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:48,810
you have a power supply that catches fire one in 1000 times, is that a CV worthy issue?

872
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,610
I, I don't know,

873
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,409
you know, but if it, what if there's a specific flaw?

874
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:56,780
Like I, I've been watching a lot of these airline disaster films

875
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,459
and there are a great example was, um,

876
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,419
on this one model of plane, the, when the flaps come down and extend,

877
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,340
they could overextend. So they, the fix was to install a bolt

878
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,939
with some washers and nuts on it to prevent the flat from overextending.

879
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,100
But if during the installation of this process,

880
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,290
you didn't put the washer on properly,

881
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,739
the bolt is now small enough that it could actually go through the hole

882
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:28,340
and essentially go into the space where the sort of the, the action for the flaps is.

883
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,959
And so if it falls off into this space when the

884
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:33,129
flaps are extended and then pushed back in all the way,

885
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:36,229
it would actually push the bolt in and puncture the fuel tank.

886
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,060
And that's what caused that China Air

887
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:38,580
uh

888
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,149
airplane to catch fire on the ground a few months ago. Remember, or a few years ago,

889
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,379
it was a China airline flight that landed, they, they land safely, right?

890
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,189
Everything's fine. They're taxing off the runway

891
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,429
and all of a sudden,

892
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:51,360
you know,

893
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,830
it catches fire on the wing because it's like

894
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,419
spraying fuel out from a punctured fuel tank.

895
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,750
And luckily everybody got off, nobody died.

896
00:38:59,449 --> 00:38:59,459
Uh

897
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,290
and it was a 737 which, yeah,

898
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,810
it was a 737 which is why this is such a problem because

899
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,350
this is like one of the most common planes on the planet.

900
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:06,790
You know,

901
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,110
I've been on many,

902
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,870
-- many 737
-- so

903
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,939
uh whatever

904
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,929
and maybe it wasn't at 737 but I remember it was boring.

905
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:16,870
But anyways, so, you know, does something like that deserve a CV,

906
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,520
where the process of fixing this flaw,

907
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,030
there's a documented process that's easy to mess up.

908
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:25,110
And you know, if you have this washer missing, you, you have a big problem like you,

909
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,070
you're going to puncture your fuel tank at some point.

910
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,149
-- So
-- I wonder if the FAA has a similar identification system where you

911
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,600
directives, right? Maintenance directives. OK.

912
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,719
So, so that's the same basic idea as CV E, right?

913
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:40,159
Do this or your plane will break right? In a, in

914
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,179
a really bad.

915
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:46,810
-- And
-- I guess though CV E is less direct than that where we don't say do this or else,

916
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,780
but rather here's what's going on.

917
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:52,780
Well, we kind of say we try to say what the impact is, you know,

918
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,370
or else you will suffer a buffer overflow that allows

919
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,379
a remote attacker to take control of your system.

920
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,840
But we don't have the authority to

921
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,139
see. Part of the challenge is the FAA

922
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,729
and the N TSB are separate entities, right?

923
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,639
The N TSB does the investigations and recommendations

924
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,469
but the FAA does the actual enforcement,

925
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,219
which I think makes sense because you need separated.

926
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:22,260
But the N TSB can only make recommendations. They can't make law or rules. The FAA

927
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:22,929
is,

928
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:23,889
has to do that.

929
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,370
So there's been cases where the N TSB made recommendations that were not taken

930
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,320
and then you know, the problem crops up again later.

931
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,350
So eventually FAA is like, OK, yeah, we need to do that,

932
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,570
but that's totally like the current CBE universe where

933
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,310
issues are found, researchers find things,

934
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,689
they might suggest things and then it's up to the vendors and

935
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,409
developers to decide should I listen to this person or not?

936
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:48,760
True?

937
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,429
And what I'm hoping to do is make that data more

938
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:54,320
available so that customers can start pressuring people to make those.

939
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,780
And I totally agree with that because let's face it.

940
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,149
If, if there is a problem making airplanes explode

941
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,800
and the N TSB said,

942
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,360
you know, fix this or things explode. N fa was like, yeah, screw you guys.

943
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,159
I don't want to do that.

944
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,350
There would be like

945
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:09,100
a peasant.

946
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,719
No, no, that's happened before.

947
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:15,580
Uh, the DC, the one with three engines, the, uh, the cargo bay door wasn't

948
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,929
designed correctly and it had a latching mechanism where

949
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:19,669
you could forcibly close it and latch it,

950
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,090
but the pins were not engaged properly.

951
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,780
So the door would like blow out when you got to altitude.

952
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,219
And it basically happened once and the guy,

953
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:30,379
they managed to land the plane good for them.

954
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,179
You know, nobody died. There was a huge,

955
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,979
like it, it was so violent

956
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,649
that it actually, uh the, the floor inside the plane, you know,

957
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:40,600
broke and part of it got uh moved.

958
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,389
And so obviously, you know, once they figured out what happened,

959
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,479
they made these recommendations.

960
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:47,610
Uh The two main recommendations were to change the latching system so that,

961
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,310
you know, you could not engage the pins without the door being latched correctly.

962
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,199
And the second one was to have vents in the floor of the plane inside the plane.

963
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:57,995
So that if there is an explosive depression, the floor, it can vent.

964
00:41:58,004 --> 00:42:00,165
It doesn't, the floor doesn't get wrecked, like, you know,

965
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,354
in this case the floor was pulled like one or 2 ft out of

966
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:04,735
space

967
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:06,364
and there was a huge hole in it. Right.

968
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,675
They showed it and the pictures are insane like it.

969
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:09,125
You know,

970
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,504
this poor flight attendant had to jump over the hole to get to

971
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:13,824
the front of the plane where it was safer when they were landing.

972
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:16,695
And then the same thing happens two years later.

973
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:19,014
So,

974
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,814
you know, we've, we've sort of, well, look at the Challenger

975
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:24,215
Oing disaster. We knew that they were a problem.

976
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:28,520
Yeah. Yeah, they, well, some people knew.

977
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,939
Yeah. So I, you know, there's been cases. Um,

978
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:34,860
you know, this is a, well, I mean, back to your, you know,

979
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,320
industrial safety presentation, things have to get really bad

980
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,820
before people notice and start to take action.

981
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,840
You know, uh, Ralph Nader's unsafe at any speed. You know, how long did it take?

982
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:48,000
How long did it take for the car industry to put three point safety belts in

983
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:49,459
or airbags?

984
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,840
Totally, man. I mean, it, it took a long time and

985
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:55,699
it wasn't easy either.

986
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:56,560
Yeah.

987
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,100
So one of my goals of CV is twofold is to get better CV coverage.

988
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,879
So we have an idea of the scope of the problem

989
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:05,760
and two to change it from being such a negative thing to being, you know, yay,

990
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,189
this vendor has 100 TV S that they all fixed within a reasonable time frame.

991
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,760
That's awesome. That's the product I want

992
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,350
or more to the point, this vendor is responsible and, you know,

993
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,000
is maybe not fixing these things, but, uh,

994
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,899
is giving guidance about it or at least letting

995
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:22,860
me know so that I can take maybe action.

996
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:25,699
Yeah, I agree completely. I think that is

997
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:27,659
the future man and, and

998
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,919
this part of me is intrigued by this and part of me is terrified by this because I,

999
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,699
if it's done wrong,

1000
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,540
it could go very badly, but I'm hopeful it will go. Right.

1001
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,689
Well, ok, that's fair.

1002
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:41,840
You know,

1003
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,260
information security economics course. And

1004
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:46,449
uh

1005
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:48,949
I forget the guy's name, but it's the law of lemons.

1006
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,379
And it basically posits that when you have information asymmetry,

1007
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,000
that is the customers don't really know or can't know about the quality of a product.

1008
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,790
You can't actually build a high quality product and

1009
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,439
get people to pay for it because they can't

1010
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,699
verify that it is a high quality product.

1011
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,699
So they give the example of used cars, right?

1012
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,280
Used cars, generally speaking, don't get their value

1013
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,320
that they should,

1014
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,560
even if it's a high quality used car because people are simply not willing to pay

1015
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,649
because,

1016
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:17,129
you know, they have a belief that used cars, especially used car sales, people are,

1017
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:18,889
you know, kind of scummy and gonna rip them off.

1018
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:23,479
So even if, uh, you know, you could have a used car lot, which has, you know,

1019
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:28,330
uh super awesome mechanical inspection and only sells top of the quality used cars

1020
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,209
is that gonna work? Probably not.

1021
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,229
Right. Because the perception is that, you know, you're getting,

1022
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,070
you're getting ripped off on these things and, you know,

1023
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,929
and that's where we are with a lot of computer security software,

1024
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,399
especially not even just computer software but computer security software.

1025
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:46,889
For example, being antivirus vendors, there's, uh,

1026
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,540
what 56 of them on virus total.

1027
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,469
So there's at least 56 major antivirus vendors globally,

1028
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,729
which of these ones are good and bad.

1029
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:58,280
You know, if you look at Tavis, one of these work into antivirus scanners, right?

1030
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,879
-- He's finding horrendous flaws in
-- these things.

1031
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:04,310
I think, I think Tavis would tell you they're, they're all bad.

1032
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,189
Seems to be the consensus.

1033
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:07,389
Yeah. You know,

1034
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:11,550
so as a consumer, how do I choose a good antivirus product?

1035
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,800
-- I'm, well,
-- the answer is I actually cannot. It is basically impossible.

1036
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:18,969
Yes.

1037
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,530
Yes, it is.

1038
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,709
Yeah, for us.

1039
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,139
But with better CV coverage, maybe we can fix this.

1040
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:27,560
I don't know, but we gotta do something.

1041
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:27,600
I,

1042
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,649
I agree and I guess stay tuned everyone for

1043
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:34,729
the upcoming awesome changes to CV E for now.

1044
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:36,520
Just bask in your CV E

1045
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,909
10-K I DS

1046
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,959
that are going to be assigned for the next week or two

1047
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:42,860
for a few more weeks.

1048
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,159
Because, you know, as soon as like once January 1st hits, people are still

1049
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:48,100
bringing up issues from the previous year,

1050
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:50,239
about a

1051
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,479
month, maybe two months. Usually and then it basically Peters out.

1052
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:53,709
Oh,

1053
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:54,300
man,

1054
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,280
I can't wait.

1055
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:56,639
How exciting.

1056
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:57,300
Yeah.

1057
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:00,060
All right. Happy CV E

1058
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:01,270
10-K. Everyone.

00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:07,300
