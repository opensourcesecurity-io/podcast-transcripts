Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,079
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,850
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:12,760
Oh, we're back to crime again, huh?

4
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,810
Well, I think technically we might,

5
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:17,379
we're going to be borderline skirting with Libel.

6
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:18,079
And

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:18,959
are we?

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,579
But I,

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,309
I'm pretty sure what we're going to be saying is truthful.

10
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:25,299
-- So I believe the truth is a defense in Canada and the US
-- in

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,239
-- the
-- United States.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,100
As long as we classify ourselves as entertainment,

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,549
I think we can say whatever we want.

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,639
Right. Right. We're probably fine.

15
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:33,040
At

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,090
least I am

17
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,680
about that.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,799
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,209
Well, so, so the context here,

20
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,020
the Canadian Federal Government has a Canadian Center for cybersecurity

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,189
and it's run by the communications security Establishment,

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,750
which to put it bluntly is our version of the NSA.

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,319
So it's, it's a real organization. It's not

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,069
some

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,369
five guys in a room doing random reports. It's, it's a legitimate,

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,630
you know, really funded, well funded

27
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:04,720
government agency that occasionally does do some good public work

28
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,169
and occasionally does some really

29
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,769
terrible

30
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,910
wrong stuff.

31
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:14,870
So I wanted to preface this episode by also talking at sort of the high level of

32
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,169
I'm sure we've all been there where we

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,879
see something that's just fundamentally wrong and,

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,940
you know, you feel like you have to speak up because it's so wrong.

35
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,480
Like you see somebody punching a puppy

36
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:26,400
or pretty much any multilevel marketing

37
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:30,599
and, and I feel, and, and there's no money in this. There's no,

38
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,599
not a lot of benefit, but I, I think it's important on occasion

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,839
to call out something that is grossly wrong. And I,

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,319
and I really hope that this is wrong and not in like intentional lies.

41
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,610
-- Of course,
-- it's not intentional. It get on with it.

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,120
So

43
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,620
they talk about open source security,

44
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:51,330
-- security considerations when using open source software
-- except they

45
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:55,139
took the talking points from Microsoft in 2005.

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,419
Not even, they're worse than that.

47
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,949
I, it's, it's pretty, it's the usual,

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,730
everyone be afraid.

49
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,110
Well, yeah.

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,720
And the part I love here is they have a statement, you know,

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,179
78% of companies run open source software

52
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,779
that actually is probably, it's probably more

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,039
100

54
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,589
-- it's 100%. But
-- here's what I love, but less than half are managing it properly.

55
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,029
Well, yeah, nobody manages their software properly.

56
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,979
It's 100%

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,940
-- and seven companies are managing their open source properly. That's my
-- estimate.

58
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,580
What gets me,

59
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,720
look at all the software designed to help

60
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,339
you manage your commercial software and I don't

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,899
even mean esoteric stuff but just stuff to keep you up to date on Microsoft patches,

62
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,259
right.

63
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,169
How much effort and time do people

64
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:40,304
and patching their windows machines and fail at it,

65
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,294
as evidenced by all the ransomware attacks

66
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,384
that go stomping through these organizations.

67
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,214
I mean, even ignoring the ransomware,

68
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:51,195
there's various compliance standards that have requirements on reporting and

69
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,544
looking for missing software patches and things like that.

70
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:54,985
And

71
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,570
the first of all the systems that track this stuff

72
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,949
are atrociously bad and they're obscenely expensive and yeah,

73
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,229
everyone is basically just bad at this.

74
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,169
So

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,860
anyway,

76
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:08,720
open source is created through voluntary collaboration of software developers.

77
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,720
-- Uh
-- We'll give that 1 50% true.

78
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,270
That's sort of technically true of

79
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,419
-- all human activity. Not
-- necessarily.

80
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,240
-- I mean, well,
-- apart from slavery, everything is sort of quasi

81
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,820
-- technically voluntary like you could quit your job.
-- No, it's not. I'm getting, I get

82
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,876
paid to work. I'm not doing this for free.

83
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:29,285
-- Like if they make it miserable enough, you're going to leave. I
-- mean,

84
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,395
that's not voluntary though,

85
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:34,666
voluntary. Ah but you're conflating voluntary with being paid.

86
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,716
I think you're splitting hairs.

87
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:39,565
No, I'm not because this is kind of an important point later anyways,

88
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,565
the original authors license the code so that anyone can see it,

89
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,475
modify it and distribute new versions of it.

90
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:45,205
That's

91
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:49,195
-- generally
-- true. I'm OK with that. I'm OK with that.

92
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:52,535
This allows developers to extend open source code to create new stand alone product

93
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,022
or add new functionality to existing software products.

94
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,151
Generally true.

95
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,141
Os S is very common.

96
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,082
Yes, it's like the default.

97
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:00,632
Now folks,

98
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,602
you are probably already familiar with several open source

99
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,371
products like Google Chrome and Firefox web browsers.

100
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,352
Due to the nature of publicly available OS S

101
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,811
anyone can make changes to existing open source code.

102
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:10,011
Well,

103
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,861
and, and I hate statements like that because they,

104
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,302
yes, anybody can make changes to the code,

105
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:18,321
but it's not like those changes are going to be incorporated and used by anybody.

106
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:21,122
-- You
-- have to accept my back door because I'm giving you

107
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:25,117
-- pull request.
-- Yeah, exactly. This accessibility makes it easy to customize

108
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,476
OS to suit your business needs.

109
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:29,576
-- Sort of if you know how to build it and get it working
-- right in

110
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:33,677
the same way that owning a tree makes it easy to build a house.

111
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:33,927
Right.

112
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,106
Well, yeah, I mean, I,

113
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,566
I suspect we actually do have show listeners who have

114
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:42,117
built and run a copy of say Firefox or Chrome,

115
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:46,446
but I'm also guessing we can count them on one hand with my fingers making a fist.

116
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:49,207
It's pretty bad. I have built,

117
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:49,756
I have

118
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,093
Firefox from SARS more times than I wish to recount

119
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,653
and I can tell you now it's a terrible process.

120
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:59,044
I have access to a Napa auto parts. That doesn't mean I can go build a car. Actually.

121
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,334
That's a good question for a future, future thing to think about.

122
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:06,253
It's like, can you, can you build a car by buying parts from the auto store,

123
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,704
I doubt that they have engine blocks but an electric car

124
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,204
-- maybe, maybe, or the frame but
-- whatever.

125
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:14,493
Yeah, and then capabilities can be added removed or modified as needed.

126
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,104
-- Well, again,
-- the

127
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,394
same way owning a true

128
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,709
and no offense.

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,200
But if capabilities can be added removed or modified as needed that easily, I mean,

130
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,179
the whole software world would be a lot better off

131
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,619
regardless. So, I would say that they're about

132
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,109
60 to 70% correct on what open source is.

133
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,820
But they,

134
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,619
like you said, this whole, oh,

135
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm going to make a change to the software and everybody has to use it ha ha.

136
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,890
And then they talk about the risks and these are, these are just dumb. It's so bad.

137
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:45,100
Yeah. So risk before you implement OS S in your organization. Ok. Hint.

138
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,059
It's too late. You already have.

139
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,260
No, you are.

140
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
Ok. Here's the thing. Are you running windows?

141
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,220
-- Well, then there's open source embedded in windows.
-- Are you using a computer

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,100
-- that
-- you didn't hand build and wire it yourself?

143
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,470
If you did, it's going to be full of

144
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:05,100
open. I bet your firmware is probably running open source.

145
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,459
No, no, no, I'm talking about that guy that made a custom eight bit CPU on like a bunch.

146
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,739
-- Remember? It's like a room full of breadboards.
-- Did he build the whole CPU?

147
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,776
Which one are you thinking about?

148
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:17,085
The guy who used the Motorola 6502 to build his own, like custom a bit computer.

149
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:21,966
-- No,
-- no, no. This was, this is like a room full of bread boards.

150
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,126
It's

151
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:26,825
beautiful. It's, it's like all the spaghetti wiring in the world.

152
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:27,406
-- We'll
-- put it

153
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:31,446
in the show notes because I want to see this too. This is totally my game.

154
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:34,145
-- So I look forward to watching that
-- excessive access.

155
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:36,286
Open access means the code is available to all.

156
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,092
Well, ok, there is open source that's not accessible to all but whatever.

157
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,851
Let's ignore that

158
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:43,541
which creates opportunities for cyber threat actors.

159
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,631
-- I've actually never heard that term used like that.
-- I like it.

160
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,111
-- We should, we should normalize that term
-- to manipulate code maliciously.

161
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:55,451
-- Yes, they can manipulate the code maliciously.
-- Look, this point is just dumb.

162
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:56,631
My view on this,

163
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:01,507
my suspicion when I read that is this reeks of Microsoft the early

164
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:06,338
two thousands and my guess is whoever wrote this hasn't gotten the memo

165
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:10,958
that all of these claims have been debunked and shown to be ridiculous.

166
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,667
And more importantly,

167
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:15,858
I think history has shown us that closed source is

168
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,127
probably more vulnerable to these problems and open sources.

169
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,898
Well, if you look at this from the term of,

170
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,187
I think what they actually are maybe meaning is manipulate cold ma

171
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:27,884
means I can find and create a buffer overflow concept using OS S

172
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,584
can give threat actors opportunities to gain

173
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:30,704
access to your networks and information.

174
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:33,824
Well, that's true of commercial software. I mean again. Right.

175
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,343
I've worked with people whose job it was was to take Microsoft patch,

176
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:40,243
Tuesday bin Diff run it through all the DB G.

177
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:43,144
Do a bunch of magic and 24 hours later have a working exploit.

178
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,373
Ok. Number two is a great one. Lack of verification.

179
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,164
And I'm like,

180
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,523
does commercial software have a lot of verification because from what I've seen

181
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,790
anyway,

182
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,089
this is my, well,

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,290
see there are no guarantees that qualified experts conduct

184
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:57,420
proper testing and quality assurance throughout the development of

185
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:57,950
OSS

186
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,290
or that those who review the code thoroughly check its security.

187
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,250
Yeah, that's software. That's the software world.

188
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,290
This lack of verification can make your it infrastructure vulnerable.

189
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:10,769
-- This is true of all software on the planet and
-- houses, people build houses,

190
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:11,239
the building

191
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,903
passes the house and then the house falls down

192
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:15,703
the next week because they did something horrific.

193
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:18,872
There was a, there was a giant condo complex up in Fort mcmurray.

194
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:22,382
The whole thing was framed wrong and they built this thing and it

195
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:25,072
was around for a couple of years and then massive cracks started happening

196
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,673
and that they literally gave everybody something like an hour

197
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,292
to get out of the building and they were,

198
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,653
they were removed from the building for months

199
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:32,513
and the whole

200
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,275
because it hasn't fallen down or burned down.

201
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,775
The insurance situation is a complete,

202
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:38,825
but the point is this was a building something we're supposed to have

203
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:43,245
an understanding of how to build properly and it was completely screwed up.

204
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,935
And software is more complicated than buildings. And

205
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,635
we don't have software inspectors. No.

206
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:52,536
Well, we, we do, we have those automated code scanners that do a great job.

207
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,966
Oh, my goodness.

208
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,500
Don't get me started. So. Ok.

209
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,280
And then here's the third one I love because you and I both work for Red Hat.

210
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,119
So I read this. So I'm like, lack of support.

211
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm like, huh most Os S does not have dedicated support.

212
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,119
-- Well, but that's also true of software in general.
-- It depends what you're doing.

213
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,500
I mean, you can run, I mean, you can pay Red Hat for support,

214
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,710
you can pay Microsoft for support.

215
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,580
You can, you can run close source software

216
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,690
and not get support. I mean, that's io

217
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,940
-- this is dumb.
-- A perfect example.

218
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,770
Let's pick an app on your phone at random and try and get you support for it.

219
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:25,940
That's

220
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,559
let's say the Facebook app or the Twitter app.

221
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,280
Has anyone ever in the history of either of those applications gotten support?

222
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,719
-- The answer is
-- no.

223
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,260
And then the second sentence is just even stupider without a

224
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,190
support team updates and security patches may not be available.

225
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:46,070
-- So again, this is true like this is software,
-- this has nothing to do with support.

226
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,320
I mean,

227
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,130
there's plenty of companies with no security teams and

228
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,960
they never provide security patches to their stuff.

229
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:52,479
There's plenty of

230
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,145
open source, it never gets security patches to its stuff.

231
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:55,794
And, I mean,

232
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,645
this is a hugely complicated problem and there isn't

233
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:01,125
-- a good answer to it
-- and it's hugely complicated

234
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,174
across the whole software industry. Not just

235
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:05,405
-- oss,
-- it has nothing to do with open source.

236
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:10,184
It's just a hard problem for anyone who has to publish security advisories.

237
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,205
You live in a historical house and you basically had to effectively

238
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:16,005
fix the equivalent of some pretty major bugs in your house.

239
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,844
I literally replaced the foundation on my house.

240
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,520
Yeah,

241
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,070
like I've seen that photograph of a guy in a bobcat under your house driving around.

242
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,919
Yeah, like that sounds like some pretty intrusive bug fixing.

243
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,200
That's one way to look at it, I suppose.

244
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,030
-- So
-- if vulnerabilities are discovered in the software cyber threat,

245
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,719
actors can exploit these vulnerabilities.

246
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:35,890
Yeah,

247
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,099
that's how vulnerabilities work to gain access

248
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,599
to your organization's network systems and information.

249
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:41,119
I mean,

250
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,809
yeah, that's also true of your front door and the lock on it.

251
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,760
-- You know, the lock picking
-- lawyer, I think again, this comes back to the,

252
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,599
this sounds like a talking point for Microsoft in 2005.

253
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:52,909
Yeah,

254
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,310
-- basically, let's just
-- scare you by saying something that you can't.

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,870
Here's, I guess here's part of the challenge you can't really prove it either way,

256
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,991
whether it is or isn't true, which is, I mean, it's true of all software.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,911
I can prove it's true of all software by pointing at the CV database.

258
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:10,380
Especially by pointing out that the only commercial vendors

259
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,291
represented are ones that really want to be represented.

260
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:14,231
So it's survivor bias.

261
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,731
These are the guys that deeply care about security and

262
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,070
are pumping out hundreds of security patches a year.

263
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,401
The ones that don't care about security

264
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:25,651
-- CS are probably worse.
-- I have no doubt. I think that's completely true.

265
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,562
And then I love how they flip it around. Not all

266
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,252
oss carries the same level of risk.

267
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:29,742
In fact,

268
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,452
most commercial it security products have open

269
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,021
source components worked into their code.

270
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:33,651
For example,

271
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,411
consider companies that manufacture it security

272
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,262
products that offer cryptographic functionality.

273
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,062
These manufacturers embed the open source open and

274
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,762
sell cryptographic library in their product lines.

275
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,062
So all of a sudden somehow you can take open source,

276
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,692
shove it into a commercial product again.

277
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,271
Boop it's fine, I guess.

278
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,142
Right.

279
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:51,763
And that's what I really hate is not only are their talking points wrong,

280
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,603
their talking points aren't even

281
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,432
-- internally consistent.
-- No. Right.

282
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,672
I, well,

283
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:02,213
so documents like this and attitudes like this always

284
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:05,132
lack internal consistency because if they had some,

285
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:07,932
you couldn't make these talking points and look this.

286
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:08,533
Like I said,

287
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:12,223
every every time I look at this document and I look at it a lot

288
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,312
more than I should just because I don't know why I suddenly must have inner peace

289
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:16,804
and I need to rid myself of it.

290
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:18,203
But like every time I look at this,

291
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,033
it's just like it feels like Microsoft

292
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:22,304
wrote this where there's just inconsistencies,

293
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:25,153
there's fallacies, it doesn't make sense.

294
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:28,403
And anyone with even the tiniest hint of a clue

295
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,564
looks at this and is like this is ridiculous.

296
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:33,124
Well, but the problem is there will be people that don't have a clue looking.

297
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,164
-- I know
-- tons of them. Absolutely.

298
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,393
What also gets me is, is,

299
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:39,843
it's not like this report was say true 20 years ago and now it's not true.

300
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:43,385
No, this report was also wrong 20 years ago. It was all wrong.

301
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:44,255
And

302
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,125
this is what really gets me is,

303
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:49,255
I don't normally like to punch people metaphorically in the face and say

304
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,395
you're stupid and you should feel bad about this work you did.

305
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,104
But in this case, they are stupid and the work they've done,

306
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:55,395
I hope it's not malicious, but

307
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,825
-- it,
-- it's wrong. I want to be really clear here and they should feel bad.

308
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:01,054
I'm comfortable with that point.

309
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:04,025
Here's the worst thing they actually ran this by for sort of

310
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,705
public comments on a couple of mailing lists because this was actually,

311
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:10,025
this document was brought to my attention by a local listener who's like, Kurt,

312
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,046
have you this document.

313
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,375
It's bad and I read it and I'm like, wow, it's really bad. Have they updated it since?

314
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:16,116
Right? Because this is from July of 2020.

315
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:16,745
And he's like, well,

316
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,935
they actually ran it by on a one or two mailing

317
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:22,906
list and got a bunch of obviously hugely negative feedback.

318
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,495
And I'm like, oh cool. So is there an updated version?

319
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,995
He's like, no, this is what they ran with.

320
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,116
And so they, they chose to go with this, they chose to, you know,

321
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,945
coat the floor in slippery stuff and tell people to run on it.

322
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,806
-- So
-- here's, here's my suspicion.

323
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:37,705
Number one, not stupid. Ok.

324
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:41,750
I think it's really important to be careful calling people stupid because

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,599
I think this is an example of good intentions gone bad.

326
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:51,450
And my guess is somebody put together a document that gave them warm fuzzies.

327
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,789
I bet if you asked for sources to back any of this up, there's none.

328
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,359
-- Well,
-- yeah, there's no links to sources in this document.

329
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:57,599
Well,

330
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,520
we know there aren't any if there are sources they're

331
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,030
all going to link to like Microsoft blogs from 2005.

332
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,479
So there's no real sources. This is warm fuzzy

333
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:06,895
-- and my guess is they showed this to
-- people.

334
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:10,414
Well, it's not warm fuss, it's fear, uncertainty and doubt. It's classic fuzz. OK?

335
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:10,895
It is.

336
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:13,945
But whoever, but the person who wrote it probably was like, oh,

337
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:14,854
I've done a great thing.

338
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:15,724
Look what I did.

339
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:20,695
They showed it to someone their baby got called ugly and I bet they doubled down on.

340
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:21,914
No, this is right.

341
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:22,275
And the,

342
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,135
the fact that these stupid hippies won't agree with me

343
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,455
means I'm more right than I thought I was before.

344
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:31,869
-- That is my suspicion.
-- I mean, because the second page is basically all these awards.

345
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,780
It's things like considerations for using OS S blah, blah, blah.

346
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,070
Before acquiring new software,

347
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,900
your organization should determine the level of risk

348
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,330
that is tolerable and can be accepted.

349
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,809
That's true of all your, that's risk management.

350
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,130
-- That's true of buying lettuce like, yeah.
-- Yeah, you don't,

351
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,710
you don't buy the brown

352
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,510
-- squishy lettuce.
-- That's right. My lettuce is covered in manure.

353
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,909
-- Let's buy that
-- lettuce before installing new software.

354
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,979
Your organization needs measures to detect

355
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,479
and mitigate vulnerabilities such as logs,

356
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,479
audits and incident

357
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,205
processes. Yeah,

358
00:14:59,405 --> 00:14:59,414
I

359
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:00,844
like that.

360
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:02,195
You know, like when using OS S,

361
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,854
you should manage all Os S using the same

362
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,005
procedures and tools that you use for commercial products.

363
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:06,905
Yeah.

364
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:07,625
Like, I mean,

365
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,974
-- ok,
-- I think you're right in that somebody wanted to, yeah,

366
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:15,484
write something about Os S open source security and yeah, they got it really wrong.

367
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:19,275
So the other half of this, I bet is you and I

368
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:24,164
have a great deal of background in dealing with security people. And

369
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,429
I would be willing to bet a pint

370
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,640
that the feedback they received was

371
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,830
difficult to read. We'll say, I bet it was harsh and, and not wrong,

372
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,419
but it was probably, I mean, this is one of the challenge with it with humans, right?

373
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:45,549
Is if, if I show you something and you're like, that's the worst thing I've ever seen.

374
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,369
I'm not going to listen to you anymore. Yeah.

375
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,169
I'm

376
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:51,270
be like, well, I think Kurt's an idiot even though you might be right.

377
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm not going to listen.

378
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:52,739
Well,

379
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,859
they've done those studies that show that people who hold factually incorrect,

380
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,530
I guess opinions would be the word, whatever,

381
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,330
factually incorrect beliefs that if you hit them with actual facts,

382
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,500
-- like provable facts, they just dig in harder
-- and,

383
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,869
and what's even better is there is a number of studies that both

384
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,919
prove and disprove that point and you get to pick the one you like

385
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,280
based on the fact that this got published under, you know, their official flagship.

386
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,280
It's got like an its

387
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,630
APP number and all that other stuff.

388
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,700
This is part of their catalog of documentation

389
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,719
that they've published on their website that's official.

390
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:28,739
And now like we haven't been particularly kind to this document already.

391
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,799
And I guess here's the challenge now is let's say we run across this, which we did.

392
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,280
How do you possibly

393
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,489
open a dialogue with a group like this and say, let me help you.

394
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,250
And this is the thing they literally say need help or have questions,

395
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,460
want to stay up to date and find out more on all things.

396
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,000
Cybersecurity.

397
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,299
Come visit us at the Canadian Center for cybersecurity at cyber dot gc dot C A.

398
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,210
And did you do that?

399
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:55,130
Well, yeah, and it's, it's a government website, GC dot C A government of Canada.

400
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,890
I mean, good luck submitting a bug against their document.

401
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,390
That's a good point.

402
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,209
-- Actually,
-- there's a contact information and it is contact at cyber dot GC dot ca

403
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,589
and a toll free number and then a media relations link.

404
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:11,569
Good luck going in through the front door and trying to get them to understand that,

405
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:11,760
you know,

406
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,189
there's this grossly factually incorrect document on your

407
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,790
website that I think you should update.

408
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,140
-- So
-- actually, that's, that's a really interesting thing.

409
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,098
You just said, you said it's factually incorrect.

410
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:25,108
Could we prove it is wrong by providing alternative source?

411
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:25,608
This?

412
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,718
I believe so,

413
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,398
I don't think we can other than our

414
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,659
entertainment podcast posing as a security podcast potential.

415
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,529
You know what I mean? Like,

416
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:33,629
I think there's,

417
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,519
there are a lot of opinion pieces that talk about this,

418
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:41,958
but do we have actual research we could point at and say this is wrong because of this?

419
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:44,379
-- I think we'd struggle to find it,
-- we could point it.

420
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,509
So for example,

421
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,848
the CV database to point out that the closed source

422
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,379
has just about the same level of problems and,

423
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,918
you know, zero days as the

424
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,189
-- open source.
-- What do you point at though?

425
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,310
If I'm someone who doesn't know what that data is?

426
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,810
I can't say, oh, here's a data set of prose descriptions.

427
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:05,949
Go mine it and find out that you're wrong. OK. True. I mean, you can't do that.

428
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:11,640
Part of the problem is that kind of work and data would be horrendously expensive.

429
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,290
And difficult to do correctly.

430
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,339
Like what I keep coming back to is with this whole COVID thing

431
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:18,729
is we still can't figure out if vitamin D is really important or,

432
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,510
and it seems like it's really important.

433
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,089
But every study I've read that says it's really important is not super great

434
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:29,109
-- and perfect in the sense of like vitamin C and scurvy
-- in that context.

435
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,660
Usually a research paper like that in the medical field,

436
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,750
they'll spend like five years working on it,

437
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,900
-- right? COVID is like a year old.
-- Yes and no.

438
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,369
Because for example,

439
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,920
some of the studies have taken mass sampling of vitamin

440
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,219
D levels in patients and looked at hospital outcomes.

441
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:45,540
And is there a correlation, right,

442
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,790
have specific branches of statistics and math and

443
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,000
medicine to do that kind of data analysis,

444
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,030
correlation doesn't mean causation.

445
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,550
But there are specific branches of medicine

446
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,810
-- and biology and statistics to determine
-- that

447
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,449
whatever I'm not talking about COVID COVID is depressing and I hate it.

448
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:06,339
But the point is that in our universe, we don't necessarily have data either way.

449
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:09,030
-- I
-- would
-- say we probably don't have data either way because the

450
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,569
whole thing is just such a train wreck and tire fire.

451
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:12,349
And but here

452
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:17,800
thing is if you explain to someone that here are two products, one of them,

453
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,119
you can look at all of the source code and evildoers can find out what's wrong with it

454
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,000
and the other one is secret and the evil doers can't find out what's wrong with it.

455
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,579
-- Which one feels more right. You know what I mean?
-- Oh, yeah.

456
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:26,800
Well,

457
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,510
and especially if you don't have an understanding of

458
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,849
open source security or open source in general.

459
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:31,439
Exactly.

460
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:33,770
And it is a very difficult problem and, I mean,

461
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,449
you and I obviously are huge fans of open source and

462
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:39,160
we talk about open source security more than is healthy.

463
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,810
I wouldn't say I'm a fan so much of it as it's just,

464
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,170
it's an acceptance that like sidewalks and roads.

465
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,359
It's just how life is.

466
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,989
I am a fan of open source.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,760
-- I'm not even going to pretend I'm not,
-- it's like saying I'm a fan of electricity.

468
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,479
-- I'm also a fan of roads and sidewalks.
-- I love electricity. I love it.

469
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,729
I love it so much. Um, but anyway, that's, that's neither here nor there.

470
00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:00,130
I'm not talking about whatever bizarre hacking project I have in the basement.

471
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,890
But the point is we are very opinionated on this topic. And so we get riled up.

472
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,000
I guess I see this two ways.

473
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,699
There's the angle of how do we describe this

474
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,180
using data to prove our points or alternatively,

475
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,680
like open source one who cares?

476
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,530
-- Shut up. You know what I mean?
-- Well, that's, and that's a very valid point.

477
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,699
Open source is that is well past the tipping point,

478
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,540
like we don't have to fight for it anymore.

479
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,219
Microsoft is, oh, what did Microsoft announce they were shipping in windows,

480
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,099
-- everything,
-- basically.

481
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,780
I mean, I'm honestly in all seriousness, I am shocked they haven't

482
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,000
like open source windows at this point and then, like, screw it. There you go.

483
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,020
There's some, well, there's a bunch of legal reasons they can't, that could be,

484
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,949
that's probably fair.

485
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,280
You know,

486
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,589
there's a bunch of IP and patent and intellectual stuff

487
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,719
that really sort of prevents them from doing that.

488
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:50,680
-- And
-- I bet there's enormous quantities of code they didn't write because

489
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,709
-- they either bought or acquired from somewhere
-- more to the point.

490
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,030
-- Who cares?
-- Yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

491
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,489
They're not being super evil this decade and I can, I can live with it.

492
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,089
No. Really? Right.

493
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,650
Like they're, they're, I can't speak for them next decade,

494
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,650
but this decade appears to be on an upward swing for open source support.

495
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,390
I agree.

496
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,890
I've had,

497
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,229
I've had so many conversations about this where people are just every

498
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:13,189
now and then you'll run into someone and they'll be like,

499
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,630
oh, Microsoft Evil Empire.

500
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,530
It's like, actually

501
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,319
I know it's a sample size one but I am reasonably

502
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:22,699
happy running windows 10 on my main desktop and I am pretty

503
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,199
diehard Linux supporter fan, whatever you want to call it.

504
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,489
-- So,
-- well, it runs Linux

505
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,290
better than some Linuxes do.

506
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:29,618
Yeah.

507
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:30,637
Yes.

508
00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:31,708
Yeah.

509
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,628
-- Anyway, anyway, part of it
-- though,

510
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:37,177
I worry that if they got this something and I'm

511
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:38,887
not going to say simple because it's not simple.

512
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,988
But if they got something that is reasonably simple, this wrong.

513
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:45,708
It also makes me wonder what else they're getting wrong in their other documents.

514
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,248
-- Everything
-- look

515
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:50,338
just because it's a government organization and

516
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:52,697
just because they might be in theory,

517
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,797
the experts on a particular topic, it doesn't necessarily mean they're correct.

518
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,748
I mean, this is why when you read a research page,

519
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:02,686
the last 10 pages are links to other research

520
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,005
papers because if you don't provide your sources,

521
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:09,546
like, is it actually a researched paper or is this just some crap, someone made up?

522
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:12,875
And my guess is this is just some crap, someone made up? Yeah.

523
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:15,806
Well, like you said, it's recycled talking points from 20 years ago. Yeah.

524
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:18,836
And my guess is it was, I don't know, someone

525
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:22,885
who knows what the inception of this was, but absolutely, there's,

526
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,355
there's no data behind this.

527
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:26,206
This is nonsense talking.

528
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:29,423
And I mean, unfortunately, refuting this other than, you know,

529
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:35,244
whinging on a podcast is, is going to take enormous effort for zero gain.

530
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,423
Like, really and more importantly, let's face it.

531
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,274
How many companies are going to read this and be like, oh,

532
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,764
maybe I shouldn't run open source.

533
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,774
It's like, no, they won't. They'll be like, yeah, whatever. This is stupid.

534
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:48,963
-- Somebody is probably consuming this. I hope it's not many people.
-- I doubt it.

535
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:51,404
-- I seriously doubt it. Well, no,
-- no, no, I'm just thought experimenting.

536
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:51,514
So,

537
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:54,634
assuming people are consuming this and their technical

538
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:56,364
people are most likely going to say,

539
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,663
well, this is true of all soft.

540
00:22:57,741 --> 00:22:57,761
Yeah.

541
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:01,241
Like it's not specific to open source. And also that ship sailed.

542
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:04,541
And my thought on this is if somebody in management reads

543
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:07,332
this and then overrules their texts with respect to open source,

544
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,921
those texts were doomed to begin with.

545
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,472
I mean, I absolutely,

546
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:15,741
this feels like if someone said 50 years ago telephones are bad, stop using them,

547
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,702
we'd all be like you're an idiot.

548
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,041
-- No,
-- the letter will never die.

549
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:21,991
That's just what I feel like here, I, I don't,

550
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:23,901
I don't think anyone's going to take this seriously.

551
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:27,121
And my suspicion is this is going to make the group who's,

552
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,630
I've already forgotten in the Canadian government.

553
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,099
It's just going to make them look dumb and it's going to damage your credibility.

554
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,579
That's all this is going to do.

555
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,020
Yeah.

556
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,619
Yeah.

557
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:43,140
Yeah. It amuses me still to, to read topics like this just because

558
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,250
it is,

559
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,260
I have a feeling we're going to be talking about this

560
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,209
until we die and then the next generation will talk about this until they die and then

561
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:53,890
hopefully the machines take over and then we

562
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,380
just don't have to talk about it anymore.

563
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,057
-- We've still got, people won't wear their
-- seatbelts.

564
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:58,738
I mean, I

565
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:01,598
think I keep looking up, seatbelt compliance percentage wise.

566
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:05,907
Let me just pull this up. But in Canada there are some shockingly low numbers.

567
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,978
-- What do you mean by shockingly low?
-- Ok.

568
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:12,037
So the highest is, ironically, British Columbia at 96.9%.

569
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,937
So that means 3.1% of people aren't wearing their seatbelts.

570
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:19,437
-- And the lowest is if you go to the Yukon, it's 78.1%. I mean,
-- that doesn't surprise.

571
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:24,427
So, so many of our listeners probably don't know the geography of Canada. Right.

572
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:25,878
British Columbia

573
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:29,395
-- is British Columbia the most populous part of Canada.
-- No.

574
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:30,845
British Columbia is not the most populous,

575
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,666
but essentially the majority of British Columbia

576
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:34,625
lives in and around Vancouver metro area.

577
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:39,036
Yeah. It's the very west coast of Canada, very west as far west as you can go.

578
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:43,816
And, and most of them are very south west and south in that particular province.

579
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:45,446
-- Very close to the United States.
-- Yeah.

580
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,135
Well, cause the top half of BC is just mountains and trees.

581
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:52,526
Now the Yukon is, there's like, what, 30 people who live there?

582
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,495
-- Probably
-- no, no, no, Bob moved. So it's 31

583
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,609
but,

584
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,189
-- but it's, it's not populated hardly
-- at

585
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,800
-- all.
-- Well, there's white horse basically.

586
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,030
And then there's some people living out in the boonies.

587
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,500
It's definitely a low population level.

588
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,199
And now like,

589
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,810
I know people in so I live in Wisconsin and northern

590
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,069
Wisconsin we'll say is a pretty wild region of the country.

591
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,449
It's very densely forested.

592
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:15,780
Well,

593
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,310
and the Yukon is quite a bit larger than Wisconsin and

594
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,479
I just checked the population is like 36,000 people in total.

595
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,439
And if, and if you were to remove white horse,

596
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:25,133
then that would be pretty much most of them.

597
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:26,912
Right. Right. And, and the point is

598
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:30,782
I found when you have these very low population areas, like,

599
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,282
I have family members who live in northern Wisconsin

600
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,762
and they don't wear their seatbelts because they're like,

601
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:35,392
there's nobody here.

602
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:35,863
I don't care.

603
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:38,642
And it's like, I'm not going to disagree with you,

604
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:40,262
but you should still wear your seatbelt.

605
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:44,022
I remember being a child and they had that car safety thing where

606
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:48,343
it was like a car seat with the seatbelt and they put you in it and then they basically,

607
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,772
it went down a little ramp and slammed you into a stop bumper.

608
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,463
So you felt the,

609
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:52,262
it was simple,

610
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:54,566
like a five or six mile per hour

611
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:58,735
impact. It's simulated and holy, geez. Right. It,

612
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,296
that was a lot of force at five or six miles an hour.

613
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:01,536
You know,

614
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,786
they slide you down this 10 ft ramp basically

615
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,495
and just wham you stop and you hit the seatbelt

616
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:09,895
and it was a shocking amount of force to me as a child.

617
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:12,666
And, and I really took home the lesson of, yeah,

618
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:16,056
wear your seatbelt because if you crash a car at 3040 miles an hour, you know, and,

619
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,336
and the reason I'm speaking in Imperial is to

620
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,416
out of sensitivity for Josh and his people,

621
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,390
you know,

622
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:24,489
it's, yeah,

623
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,030
it's even a low speed crash is a shocking amount of force for that human body.

624
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,189
It is. It is. But, but people are bad at risk management.

625
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,589
And so people assume if I'm the only person on the road for

626
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,930
thousands of kilometers or miles or whatever.

627
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,270
Yeah, you can still drive into a ditch.

628
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
Well, I know that's the thing,

629
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,369
right is you're probably going to a moose is almost definitely more dangerous

630
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,150
than another car in that context because if you hit a moose,

631
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,079
you're going to stop

632
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,069
up abruptly.

633
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,150
Well, a few months ago there was that Moose that actually got hit by a car,

634
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,109
killed a bunch of people in it and then got hit by

635
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,500
another car and killed one or two people in that car.

636
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,390
-- And I was just like, these things are horrific. I mean,
-- they're enormous

637
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,359
until you see a moose. You don't understand how big a moose is. It is ridiculous.

638
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:11,140
-- Imagine a small minivan on
-- stilts. Seriously enormous stilts.

639
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,829
You could walk under the, it's like, it's completely ridiculous.

640
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,939
But anyway, anyway, anyway, the point is humans are bad at risk management.

641
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:21,430
People in an unpopulated area and they think, oh, I'll, I'll be fine. Right.

642
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,709
It's the same thing on the internet where people are, like, oh,

643
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,619
no one's going to find my computer.

644
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,800
I don't need to install those updates and then, oh, ha ha. Yeah, you did.

645
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,709
It's just human nature, man. And then,

646
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,199
and then I guess we end up in a situation where somebody writes

647
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:38,790
a report that has no data that can back it up but whatever,

648
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,949
nobody cares.

649
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,989
And, and I guess ironically now that this exists,

650
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,869
someone could point to it as an official resource,

651
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,319
you know what I mean

652
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:49,290
in some other report? Because now it's technically like real data.

653
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,510
It's,

654
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,130
it's like those people who update Wikipedia to point to a news

655
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,530
article at Wikipedia and then update the Wikipedia with the news article

656
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,680
to point out that this is real now.

657
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,560
Yep. Yep. I do. I remember that. Anyway. Anyway, we are, we are nearly out of time.

658
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:08,109
I will, as this is a Canadian report, I will give you the last word.

659
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,410
Be kind to each other, please. It's, you know,

660
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,589
isn't that just the Canadian way?

661
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,310
No.

662
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,530
-- Have you seen what we've done with our indigenous peoples?
-- Ok.

663
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,109
All right. That's, that's true.

664
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,229
That's true.

665
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,349
You've just smashed the image of friendly Canada for every

666
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:29,244
-- look up orange shirt day at school.
-- I maybe I probably don't need to do that.

667
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,594
I don't want to. I have enough bad news. All right.

668
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:35,805
Anyway, I'm calling it before we depress anyone else further. Thank you, Kurt.

669
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,214
Thank you for listening. Go to massage
