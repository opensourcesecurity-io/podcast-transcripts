Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast number 20 with myself,

1
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,289
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,090
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,770
It's, we're almost old enough to drink in America.

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:17,409
That's right.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,370
-- Awesome.
-- Or most of America.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,530
-- Uh So, yes. So we have, uh well, we have something, I think a little bit of fun today.
-- Uh

7
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:26,639
Santa.

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:26,750
Uh

9
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:27,040
No,

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,600
no,

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,170
not more fun than Santa

12
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:32,378
uh

13
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:33,058
all

14
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:34,729
way to bring it down.

15
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:40,398
-- No, the Santa episode was the, I think the best you've ever done.
-- True, true.

16
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:41,758
I have to admit I,

17
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:44,019
I'm actually really looking forward to wrapping my kids' presents.

18
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:46,069
I got them some sweet stuff.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,400
Make sure you play with it all first just to test it.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,250
You're testing. Uh

21
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,119
Yes. Yes. Yes.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,360
But, uh

23
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,830
yeah, so this, uh this episode we are going to uh throw P GB under the bus.

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,310
Well, we think it's dead already.

25
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,110
Well, you know what it is. I, I don't, I don't think it's dead personally.

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,989
I, I know it's pretty much dead because quite frankly,

27
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:11,019
um,

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,620
I, well, I, for the listeners out there,

29
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,610
I used to do CV assignments on the open source security man list.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,500
And I signed all of them so that nobody could, like,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,629
impersonate me with a fake CV assignment.

32
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,989
The only reason I cared about that was just,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,779
I didn't want to have to deal with people complaining to me.

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,139
There's no actual security thing really. It was just a convenience thing.

35
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:32,349
And so I signed my email religiously for like,

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,449
I think it was three years and then I stopped one day

37
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,589
and nobody noticed, nobody

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,800
knew

39
00:01:37,309 --> 00:01:37,540
well,

40
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,339
except for the three people who had been complaining about my

41
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,930
signed and encrypted email because it was inconvenient to them.

42
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,449
And I'm lucky enough to have one of them here with me today. Josh.

43
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,550
I don't,

44
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,610
I don't think I ever complained about your signing of email just because

45
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,260
-- the encrypting of it.
-- I

46
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,449
totally used to complain.

47
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,680
-- You used to encrypt email to me all the time, even email that didn't matter. And it
-- is

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,050
just a blanket setting.

49
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,599
So I have two,

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,160
two complaints about this on one side,

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,979
anyone who signs and encrypts, all of their mail has their key

52
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:12,529
two available,

53
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:17,440
right? Because in order to do this correctly, the key needs to be difficult.

54
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,460
Ok.

55
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,809
Which means, and, and let's face it.

56
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,860
I'm pretty sure because you were doing this before UB keys readily available.

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,929
You had a file on a disk which means your key is acquirable.

58
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:32,649
Ok.

59
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,020
We'll just

60
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:33,250
me.

61
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:34,649
Right.

62
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,589
I don't like typing in my

63
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:36,009
password.

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,460
This is,

65
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:39,110
this is part of my point.

66
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:39,800
OK.

67
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:44,529
So you made it too easy to get to. But then conversely on my side,

68
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,199
my key is incredibly difficult

69
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,630
to get a hold of and decrypt things. And so I was happy to decrypt

70
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,190
important messages,

71
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:59,360
but when it was like day to day stuff, it was a nuisance to me. And so I told you to stop.

72
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,720
And this is, I mean, so let's face it, right.

73
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,839
This is part of the problem with P GP is it is hard to use

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,919
correctly.

75
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,059
-- It's very
-- encryption

76
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,300
in

77
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,460
general.

78
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,660
-- That's
-- right.

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
I mean, with, with, well, let me rephrase

80
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,960
with public private key encryption.

81
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,880
Yeah, like you said,

82
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,490
the key needs to be

83
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,889
difficult to attack and, and quite sadly, that typically means it's also that

84
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,550
securing a key. So it's difficult to attack,

85
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,289
typically impacts the usability heavily. Um

86
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,789
You know, like at a minimum,

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,320
you should be putting it on like a sort of an HS MA hardware security module device,

88
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,970
you know, where it can't be easily exported.

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,470
Uh which then becomes the question of like, for example,

90
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,800
how do you back this stupid thing up?

91
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,419
-- I
-- could
-- tell you a story about that if you like.

92
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,139
-- Is it a happy story? No,
-- no. It's, it's what I do.

93
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:52,089
And, and part of the historically speaking, I've not been

94
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,929
open

95
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,970
talking about what I do with my P GP keys and

96
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,580
how I protect them and what I've done because obviously,

97
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,919
well, I'll say obscurity.

98
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:01,389
S

99
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,199
security.

100
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,660
While security,

101
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,809
that is a good word. S security that we'll make that one up.

102
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,839
But while security through obscurity generally doesn't work.

103
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,229
In the case of key management and your processes,

104
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,220
it's not something you want to talk about.

105
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,608
So anyway, here's what I've done in the past to deal with all of these problems and

106
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:24,648
I created the most ridiculous Rube Goldberg machine one

107
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:28,049
could possibly create for dealing with P GP keys,

108
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:28,368
right?

109
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:29,178
So first of all,

110
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,480
I have a computer, I have an old line

111
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,339
just to confirm these were your personal keys, right? These weren't like

112
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:40,899
right important corporate keys are like keys used for like nuclear codes or

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,649
-- signing software or anything like that, right? This was your personal set of
-- keys.

114
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,200
This is the Josh Bresser's P GP keys. You can download off of the key servers

115
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:52,179
like like this is, this is my stuff. Exactly. Just what you,

116
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,609
so first of all,

117
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,299
I have an old laptop

118
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
that I've removed the disc out of

119
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,440
and all it has ever done is generate and load P GP keys for me.

120
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,980
Now, I only, every time I need to do any sort of operations,

121
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:10,820
I burn a new CD live image of a Linux distribution.

122
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,429
I boot into this machine

123
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,829
with no hard drive.

124
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,829
I do my key operations

125
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,019
and then I load them. It's gonna get crazier. Don't worry,

126
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,609
no stupid

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,440
question. But where does this machine get entropy?

128
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,980
To generate good randomness from

129
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:25,359
no,

130
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:25,980
no

131
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,309
network

132
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,540
into a,

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,149
there is no network. That's right.

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,950
I boot into a, a graphical workstation and then I purposely like,

135
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,630
play solitaire for a little while,

136
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,230
like, like, like for real, you know, to build the entropy. Um

137
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,630
Right.

138
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,109
I told you it's gonna get crazier. I'm not done yet. So anyway,

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,459
machine, not connected to the network. No hard drive.

140
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,579
I do my key operations off a live CD. The live CD is then destroyed.

141
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:52,950
I never use it twice.

142
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,279
And

143
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,790
yeah,

144
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:57,000
seriously. And I'm not done yet

145
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:57,779
because

146
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,250
you burned a CD and said it. So it can't be

147
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,510
tinfoil tinfoil

148
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:02,959
hat

149
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,200
because

150
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,149
it's not about using it again elsewhere or anything like that.

151
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,260
It's not about writing to it.

152
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,600
It's the fact that if the disk somehow has some sort of secret back door on it,

153
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:16,579
I'm not going to use it for the next set of operations I might happen to do

154
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,950
with the keys. Right. Exactly. It's

155
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:19,779
in this

156
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,269
and for what it's worth.

157
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,200
Like, I, I literally sat down and thought, how could I tinfoil have this

158
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,880
to an 11? And I, I'd say I've probably done a good job.

159
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,000
So anyway, generate the keys on this, right?

160
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,790
And then I have my Yuba key now which I store them on

161
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,399
and essentially I load the keys into the UB key,

162
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,109
right?

163
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,190
-- Which is fine.
-- And what exactly is the up key for our listeners

164
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:42,540
who

165
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,940
-- that's fair.
-- It's, um,

166
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,609
it's a little device there on something called UB

167
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,670
four. It's,

168
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,709
it does Hotp for authentication.

169
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,390
It does, it stores RS a

170
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,910
private keys for things like P GP and I can, I, I store an sh key on there for logging in,

171
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,700
for example.

172
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
And it does you.

173
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,950
Yes, it's a USB device and it's just a super cool little

174
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,380
doggy. I'll put it in the show notes. A link to the UBQ

175
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,420
four, which if you don't have one,

176
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,359
you should certainly get one. They're amazing devices.

177
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,059
And for what it's worth these days, I basically use it for

178
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,140
my HOTP log in uh U two F for things like github and Google.

179
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,510
And then also

180
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,760
it does uh uh my SSH key,

181
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,359
which is obviously that way I can uh whatever devices I connect to.

182
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,559
I never have a key on desk and I can remove the, the key

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,470
and then I can log in or not log in, I guess if it's not in.

184
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:42,540
So back to my keys. Now things continue to get more bizarre is so

185
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,920
I, I obviously I generate keys on this special machine.

186
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,510
I load the keys into my UI

187
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,630
key, but I still need to back them up.

188
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:53,869
And so what I did is I essentially tar up the

189
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,559
uh GP G, what do they call it? A key store keying, keying. It's called the keying.

190
00:07:59,149 --> 00:07:59,850
And then

191
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,429
I have it encrypted with a password

192
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,730
that is

193
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,980
incredibly long. I'm talking about like

194
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,100
multiple lines long

195
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,160
and I don't know the password,

196
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,359
but I know how to generate the password because the password is

197
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:20,839
created from some physical objects by putting together the pieces of them

198
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,010
and, and certain, you know what I mean? Like like words

199
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:24,760
pages.

200
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,549
OK.

201
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,809
-- So
-- you're saying because there's physical objects

202
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,399
with words written down on them that you

203
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,510
basically,

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,679
I I

205
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,909
there are certain books in the world

206
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,869
that have between additions,

207
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:42,710
there are certain words, phrases and things in them that do not change.

208
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,659
Like for example,

209
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,890
let's say the names of chapters,

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,190
right? Of your book.

211
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:52,289
And so imagine this, I've basically taken a handful of physical objects

212
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,530
in, in my case books. OK?

213
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,650
I, I don't even care because like I don't use P GP anymore and I, we're,

214
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,729
we're proclaiming it dead.

215
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,650
So whatever,

216
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,659
essentially,

217
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,919
I've taken words out of books and put them together in

218
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,609
a certain way that I could not tell you the password,

219
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,429
but I know how to put it together and it takes about half an hour to do.

220
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,429
So it's like it is expensive for me

221
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,090
to decrypt my master keys.

222
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,960
And then those are obviously stored at a vault at the bank on

223
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:21,289
a USB drive which I never go get because I don't need.

224
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,200
And so

225
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:25,590
I suppose I, I should probably check on it every now and then just to make sure it's not

226
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,760
not going missing

227
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:28,469
but yeah, that's my,

228
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,479
that's my crazy G GP story.

229
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,830
Did you use have master keys and then you generated sub

230
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,000
keys that you actually used on a day to day basis?

231
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,760
Or?

232
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,070
In fact, I, I wrote a blog post about this.

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,260
I think about all the crazy things I did around the, the sub keys and whatnot because,

234
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,900
but again, I mean, this is part of the problem with P GP, right? Is

235
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,159
it's not obvious you don't like generate one key and use it.

236
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,330
You've got your master key, you've got your encryption key,

237
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
you've got your signing key,

238
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,190
you've got your authentication key and you're supposed

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,539
to rotate them every now and then one

240
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:56,710
key

241
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,650
now nobody does. And it's just, it's so

242
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,169
I understand the intent

243
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,780
because they wanted perfect.

244
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,840
-- But
-- yeah,

245
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:09,929
-- they want
-- perfect from, well, here's the problem,

246
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,070
I think they want it perfect from a cryptographic security point of view,

247
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,080
which is even more insane than a security point of view,

248
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,390
right?

249
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,510
Probably

250
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,630
because like let's face it, right? Like

251
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,869
for example, one of the challenges is, let's say, for example,

252
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,619
you accept encrypted email,

253
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,859
right? And your key expires at some point.

254
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,510
Well, you still have to keep that key around

255
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,599
to decrypt your old email and look at

256
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,780
it, right? Same thing with all these sub keys.

257
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,820
If you actually rotate your sub keys a lot,

258
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,609
you still have to keep them around.

259
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:40,739
So you can look at your old encrypted data, you know,

260
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,900
uh unless you, like, take all your old encrypted data,

261
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,219
decrypt it and re encrypt it with a current key and then keep

262
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,570
doing that every time you roll keys over which let's face it,

263
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,359
like nobody's like that, that would be a level of effort.

264
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,250
But, wow,

265
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:52,880
I just

266
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,260
think

267
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,210
about it. You heard my obscene story about key management?

268
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:59,289
Like there's probably somebody who does that. It's not me.

269
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:00,020
It's

270
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,000
see. And, and I think here's what to me is, I think

271
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,739
for most of what, and this is sad for most of what P GP was meant to be used for

272
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,210
it. It, it's, it's unusable, it's so it's effectively dead.

273
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:19,039
I mean, email being the primary example, right? If I want to

274
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:22,219
uh encrypt email to somebody, the first problem, I mean,

275
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,909
how do you find somebody's key? Right.

276
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,799
That's the first problem with P GP is they went with this decentralized web of trust,

277
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:28,580
supposedly.

278
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,770
And the idea being, you know, is that like people would get together,

279
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,039
sign each other's keys.

280
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,739
And so I would be able to say

281
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:40,450
I found a key for Bob Smith and Bob Smith's key was signed by Jane Smith

282
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,239
and Jane Smith's key was signed by Josh Presser and I trust Josh Presser's key.

283
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,219
So there's, you know, this transit of trust property except

284
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,809
I have no idea who these people in the middle are. Like I know who Josh is

285
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,090
and beyond that I have no clue.

286
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,650
So then to deal with that, you know,

287
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,080
they have different levels of trust when you sign a key, you know,

288
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,849
I ultimately trust this key like or I minimally trust this key.

289
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,010
But

290
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,650
as far as I know, there's no really good description of what that actually means.

291
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,679
No, it's never been clear.

292
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,369
Yeah.

293
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,820
Well, and then my favorite is when they do have key signing things, they're like

294
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,489
you should verify the person's identity.

295
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,280
Well, first of all, I don't know of any way to prove somebody's email address.

296
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,150
Like I, it's not on your passport,

297
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:23,890
right?

298
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:26,179
Like there's no piece of government ID that has your

299
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,020
email address printed on it as far as I know.

300
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:28,989
And more to the point,

301
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,690
I don't know how to validate

302
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:31,849
identification.

303
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,590
Right?

304
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:32,929
Like I don't,

305
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,710
I couldn't even validate my own driver's license or

306
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,580
passport that I carry with me all the time.

307
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,210
I, I vaguely know they have like a shiny

308
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,460
thing of a jigger on them that you can see in the light when you know, it reflects.

309
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:42,770
Right?

310
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,520
-- Yes, that's, and I'm pretty sure that can be
-- fake.

311
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,080
Very good.

312
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,239
II I could not pick out a fake ID

313
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:53,090
you could probably show up with, with something you drew with crayon. I would,

314
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:53,599
I would,

315
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,070
every time those, you know,

316
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,619
those door to door sales people come and they have like an ID,

317
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm like,

318
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,409
I, I don't know what ID for this company looks like.

319
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,419
Are you kidding me? Like,

320
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,429
you know, I know people that work for, like,

321
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,349
the cable company locally and if you ask me what their ID looks like,

322
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,780
I would have to guess that it probably has the corporate logo on it

323
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,770
and their name and that's, that's all I can write reasonably. Yes.

324
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,849
You know, but I would have no clue how to validate that ID

325
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:21,580
or where to phone, you know. Anyway. So, moving along.

326
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,840
So that's my, you know, that's my first big concern with P GP is it's

327
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,109
just right off the bat.

328
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:31,049
If I want to use it to like encrypt email to somebody, I have to go hunt down their key,

329
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,690
which means basically I'm gonna go download it from a key server

330
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,460
and have absolutely no way to validate it

331
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,250
really, you know, unless it's like,

332
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:42,400
unless it's an exceptionally rare well known key, like,

333
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,219
you know, some like Linus to

334
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,940
vault or something.

335
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,989
And the other thing I noticed is I, uh,

336
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,760
one time I downloaded my own key from the key server and it was signed by people.

337
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't know.

338
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,849
And

339
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,940
it's crazy.

340
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, and didn't,

341
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,039
isn't there a key somewhere that someone has, uh,

342
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,590
like, like an obscene asking picture

343
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,510
they've attached?

344
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,599
Yeah, somebody, uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,559
So what it was, was, um, in a, in a key signature,

346
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,030
there's like a line of text or whatever

347
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,710
and they basically signed their key like 50 or 60 times

348
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:17,780
generating like these custom signatures to, yeah, have an obscene, ask your art uh,

349
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,830
picture, which I guess

350
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,869
I guess we should link to in the show notes.

351
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:24,510
-- Are we allowed to do that?
-- I'm not going to,

352
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,270
ok,

353
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,070
you'll have to Google it yourself, figure it out. Um

354
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,940
But yeah, so anyways,

355
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:30,969
so

356
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,609
right off the bat, we essentially,

357
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm just downloading random keys off the internet that are, you know,

358
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,489
associated with an email address.

359
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,299
Hopefully

360
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,609
yi I do that all the time.

361
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,210
The the few times I've used it or I love when someone sends me an a an assigned email

362
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,109
and it asked me, do you want to download this key?

363
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,169
-- And I'm like, yeah, that sounds great. Download
-- the key.

364
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:51,539
Yeah,

365
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:54,900
and that always struck me as like the perfect way to insert your

366
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,010
key like for an attacker to insert a key into somebody's key ring,

367
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,570
right is just,

368
00:14:59,179 --> 00:14:59,500
you know,

369
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,659
email a whole pile of people as being from the victim you're wanting to intercept

370
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,739
and you know, get your fake key put in there.

371
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,500
The other problem is with the key signing is that like, you know, it's,

372
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,960
it's only in the last year or two that they fixed a bunch of problems that allowed

373
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,260
you to make what looked like.

374
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,150
Basically you could create keys with the same

375
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,750
short ID. So a key has a fingerprint and the full fingerprint

376
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,640
that they just told everyone to stop using the show,

377
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,039
they didn't actually fix it. They just, well, no, but in,

378
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,250
but in GP G, if I remember, right, they now default to using

379
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:34,570
the fingerprint rather than the short ID. I think anyways,

380
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,450
the point being is that, you know, you could,

381
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,799
you could force a key generation with specific key ID.

382
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:43,530
So you could have a key with the same key D as your victim's key

383
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:46,270
and you could do that for all the signing keys, right?

384
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,710
So you could create this key that basically looks exactly the same

385
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:50,619
from a signature point of view and everything and you know,

386
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,169
it would be very annoying and difficult to validate.

387
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,130
Um

388
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,299
Now, uh I know P gp.com used to do this and I don't know if they still do,

389
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,049
but they ran a service where you basically

390
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,840
could validate your key to a small degree where

391
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,840
you'd essentially submit your key to them. And they would email

392
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,039
the email addresses like on those keys saying, you know,

393
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,700
do you actually control this key?

394
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,479
And did you submit it for signing? And you would click? Yes.

395
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,849
And then they would sign your key,

396
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:18,429
you know, by the P GP global key signing key or whatever it was.

397
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,099
And they would email you,

398
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,760
I think every couple of months just to make

399
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,520
sure you still had control of that email address,

400
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:23,739
right?

401
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,950
And so if you look at like my one of my keys, for example,

402
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,460
you'll see there's like several years worth of that, you know, signatures on it,

403
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,419
which is kind of handy.

404
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:31,609
Um,

405
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,739
so that was kind of, well, basically, and that's the thing, right,

406
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,260
that basically boils down to like a domain validated SSL certificate,

407
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,049
right?

408
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,289
Where you just, you do a minimal amount of verification where it's like,

409
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,650
essentially you look like you control this email address and

410
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,849
for us to actually validate that you control this email address

411
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,469
properly.

412
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,989
We we can't really do that short of like coming out and beating you with a hose.

413
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,780
Um, because quite frankly,

414
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,719
if you can reply from that email address and

415
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:00,280
you can receive email to that email address.

416
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,789
How else do you validate that somebody

417
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,420
should or should not control that email address?

418
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,170
That seems pretty fair, right?

419
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,319
Like,

420
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,530
do you phone the provider and ask for personal

421
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,199
information of which they really shouldn't give you,

422
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:11,569
you know,

423
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:12,229
it's

424
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,130
right. I mean,

425
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,660
you know,

426
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,188
so, ok, well,

427
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,749
let's assume for a moment you've managed to find the other person's key.

428
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:21,318
Ok, hold on, hold on. Let's go. Let's back up one step though is

429
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,729
when you talk about this service from P gp.com,

430
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:29,009
which I just typed P gp.com into my web browser and it goes to Symantec now.

431
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,369
So I

432
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:29,999
assume that's no

433
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:30,749
longer the whole thing.

434
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,280
But anyway,

435
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:39,060
the kind of the intent behind all of this was to have no centralized authority.

436
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:44,739
And obviously, once you have this sort of validation system, which,

437
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,150
which I think we've reached the point, we kind of agree that

438
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,079
it is the right way to go,

439
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,530
which will probably get to let's encrypt at some point,

440
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,880
which is a great example of this.

441
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,819
But I, I think

442
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,739
there were legitimate concerns about some of this

443
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,780
back in the day when this was

444
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,380
when they were attempting to build this.

445
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,420
-- But I think we've reached the
-- point I think was also historically,

446
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,819
running a very large global scale service

447
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,280
was really difficult.

448
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,020
You know what I mean?

449
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,170
Like, I mean, like 1520 years ago running, say, well, for the sake of argument,

450
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,520
running a public database with say a million

451
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,979
entries that could be queried several times a minute

452
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,579
was actually a really difficult engineering problem

453
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,369
right now. Of course, you could do it for about $5 a month.

454
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,109
Well, ok, so I think there's two sides to that is you're right,

455
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,619
is it was difficult to do.

456
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,520
But I think there was also the concern about

457
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,109
what happens when

458
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,939
the service goes rogue.

459
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,670
And that is, that is always like

460
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,550
it has always happened and it will always happen.

461
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:53,780
You look at every service that is basically ever existed.

462
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,270
And at some point

463
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:59,689
they go up for sale or they get desperate or something happens

464
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:01,430
and they start making

465
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,109
terrible decisions,

466
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,829
right? Things that are designed to benefit themselves and damage the users.

467
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:10,650
And so

468
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,170
like, like in the instance of let's encrypt someday

469
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,489
they will become evil.

470
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,290
Ok.

471
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,530
Someday I'm gonna say that and,

472
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,439
and I will gladly accept the criticism that will come with it.

473
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:25,689
But I think we're also starting to recognize that

474
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,170
it's not that hard to change.

475
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,209
You know, remember when Source Forge is where everyone was hosting their code,

476
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,939
does anyone, you know, still host things on the Source Forge?

477
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,310
There's actually still a couple of things that are there by default,

478
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,790
but really, right. It's all github

479
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,619
now and someday this will happen at github

480
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,219
and we'll move to the next thing.

481
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,689
And I think that's part of the magic we're

482
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:53,270
starting to see now is the tools and the environment

483
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,630
are becoming

484
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,530
such that we can move around.

485
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,170
Whereas in the past,

486
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,449
I think the thought of moving away from some things was

487
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:07,119
completely out of the question and it was crazy talk.

488
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:08,170
I would agree.

489
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,829
I mean, if you look at the history for example of instant messengers, what was that?

490
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,430
Oh Jeez, I'm blanking. What was the name of that

491
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,650
cross application protocol?

492
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,000
Jabber

493
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,500
-- or X MP
-- P?

494
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:21,170
Yeah, whatever was

495
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:22,560
actually,

496
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:22,920
yeah.

497
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,380
So, well,

498
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,489
there was an actual low level protocol that was

499
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,689
supposed to be sorted by multiple messenger applications.

500
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,790
So that for example, like AOL could talk to Yahoo could talk to whatever else, right?

501
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,760
And of course, those things basically like, well, you know, became walled gardens.

502
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,410
And when I think about how many different instant

503
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,969
messengers we've been through over the last 20 years.

504
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:42,189
Like,

505
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,050
you know, does anybody actually remember IC Q?

506
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,010
I remember their website was like the biggest train wreck I'd ever.

507
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,170
It was so full of garbage. I remember

508
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,640
-- the color scheme was, yeah, I remember it was
-- pretty.

509
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:59,709
No, I do. I, I remember IC Q was hip when I was in college. That was the thing.

510
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,859
Everyone, because some people used AOL instant Messenger.

511
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:06,680
But those were like the old lame people. But the new exciting thing was IC Q

512
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,599
and of course I'm on IRC being like,

513
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:09,660
you

514
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:11,819
know, I'm way cooler than you guys, you know,

515
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,000
jokes on me.

516
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:16,270
-- You were cool before. It
-- was cool. That's right. That's right.

517
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:17,819
Exactly.

518
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:21,810
So anyway, so, and you know, that's the reality. We've, we've been through

519
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,040
a

520
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,010
dozen major

521
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:24,359
uh

522
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:28,069
instant messenger platforms. And I mean, a great example now is like signal,

523
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,890
you know,

524
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:32,489
uh signal is a new encrypted end to end,

525
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,170
you know, messenger app

526
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,369
uh that people are using and, you know, when it dies,

527
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,900
we'll move to something else most likely.

528
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,609
Um But back to P GP, I mean,

529
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,329
so the problem is you have this key

530
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,010
discovery and validation problem which,

531
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,410
you know, they, I

532
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,479
here's what frustrates me in the quest to create. Perfect.

533
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,859
They like just

534
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:54,540
didn't allow good

535
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,319
or, or near perfect to exist, right?

536
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,180
Um

537
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,989
So there's like no way at all to

538
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,859
in many cases get a real decent validation of this key.

539
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,020
Um or another great example is, you know, key expiry, right? Keys.

540
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,729
A lot of people set their keys to expire

541
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:14,180
and then the majority of P GP,

542
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,589
you know, apps and related

543
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,489
will then refuse to use that key once it's expired, right?

544
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,680
They'll refuse to decrypt stuff,

545
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,760
they'll refuse to encrypt stuff and you have to like

546
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:24,670
hit it with a hammer, you know, and get it into submission.

547
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,500
Um

548
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,540
So I actually remember a case where somebody reported a security

549
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,609
issue to us and they wanted to do encrypted emails.

550
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:31,979
So

551
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,869
I replied to them,

552
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,180
they replied to me and then the next Monday I

553
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,430
replied to them and my email client wouldn't let me

554
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:41,880
because their key had expired over the weekend.

555
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,349
Nice.

556
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,109
You know,

557
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:48,229
and so I was faced with a choice of either bludgeoning this thing into submission

558
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,540
or, you know, what, fine we're, I'm doing it plain text

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,550
and I imagine

560
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:54,390
you

561
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,810
did plain text,

562
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,369
-- right?
-- Yeah. Well, I mean, I just,

563
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:58,189
you know,

564
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,780
yeah, it's just, I mean, and obviously from, you know,

565
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,520
a usability and security perspective, it would be much better to use a

566
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,989
key that's been expired for 24 hours than to do clear text.

567
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,250
But, you know, in the quest for perfect, they decided that we don't want to,

568
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:16,560
you know, allow any potentially dangerous activity.

569
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,069
Uh So we're just gonna block it,

570
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:18,689
you know,

571
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,640
and in doing so they, well,

572
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,500
they make it very difficult to do something reasonably correct.

573
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,150
You either

574
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,170
can't do it at all or well, you can ignore it and do clear text, right.

575
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,189
Um, and, and there's a lot of other issues too, like for example, there's the, the,

576
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,189
the dirty little secret of all the key servers that we do have

577
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,989
where for example, if you're checking for key revocation,

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,750
which you probably should be doing right?

579
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,310
Because, you know,

580
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,839
maybe the person revoked their key over the

581
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:46,170
last day or two because it got compromised.

582
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,219
Well, if you check for key revocation every time you use it, you're now

583
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,689
broadcasting to the world somewhat that hey, I'm, you know,

584
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,630
I need to know if this key to this person

585
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,089
is working because I want to communicate with them.

586
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:57,369
So

587
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:57,699
what

588
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,020
is key

589
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:58,770
revocation?

590
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,680
-- So
-- key revocation is well and

591
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,599
Josh, you probably did this. But if you have a secret key

592
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,209
and it somehow becomes discovered or public or somebody, you know,

593
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:11,550
manages to get a copy of it,

594
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,930
you want to tell people to stop using that key.

595
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,219
And so you revoke it, you send out essentially a well,

596
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:21,390
it's essentially a signed copy of your key saying that this key is no longer valid,

597
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,560
right?

598
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,780
Which you know should be on the key servers. And

599
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,689
so when you check for that key,

600
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,219
you get this key that essentially has a special message saying, you know, hey,

601
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:31,900
it's don't use me, I've been revoked,

602
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,630
you know, it's like we do this with uh SSL and TLS certificates, you know,

603
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,660
in the form of the uh online certificate

604
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,630
status protocol O CS P

605
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,660
um and things like that.

606
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,160
Well, you want again.

607
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:43,500
So

608
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,099
I'll fill you in on some of my dialing up to an 11.

609
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:53,020
I have my revocation certificate for my P GP key printed out

610
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,020
at the bank

611
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,439
just in case I for some reason lose all access to the digital private key.

612
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,750
I have my paper copy that I can then OCR in

613
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,890
and then send it to the key servers.

614
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,780
See, and, and that kind of goes to, you know, when I think about this.

615
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,939
So like we're kind of lucky SSL and TLS is a bit easier in the sense of it's more,

616
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:16,420
you know,

617
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:19,150
temporal data and that it's data that

618
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:22,430
we're not gonna keep encrypted for a long, long time, right?

619
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,650
It's only encrypted over the network.

620
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Whereas GP G we're,

621
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,939
we're using for data that's encrypted at rest and may exist for years or decades,

622
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,939
you know, so that is a bit of a more tricky problem space.

623
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,079
Um

624
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,229
But let's assume for a moment, you managed to find Josh's

625
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,300
key and you've now sent him an encrypted email.

626
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,829
Uh You know, we we're still not done with the problems like,

627
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,119
you know, what do you do when the key expires? Right?

628
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,569
You go bug Josh for a new key except it's signed by an expired key.

629
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,020
So your software automatically by default doesn't really trust it that much,

630
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,489
you know.

631
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,130
Um

632
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,300
So again, you're stuck with kind of bashing it into submission typically.

633
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:58,010
And then, you know, if you're checking for revocation,

634
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,839
you're leaking metadata and,

635
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:03,380
and then there's the key management from the user's perspective, right? Like

636
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,849
every time every application I've ever seen that does email

637
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,329
signing requires me to sign and trust the key,

638
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,020
which means I now have to go get my private key out

639
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,369
so I can send you an encrypted email, right?

640
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,209
You know,

641
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,619
and of course, I end up

642
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:21,180
uh having to set the thing to full trust because I, I don't have a choice, right?

643
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:23,750
Otherwise by default, most email apps will be like, well,

644
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
you don't fully trust this key.

645
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,810
So I'm not gonna

646
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,119
email to this guy,

647
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,869
you know, and it's like, damn it,

648
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,290
you know, anyways, sorry for the language. But uh

649
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,380
I think from a, from a usability point of view P GP failed

650
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,579
for email terribly. Now,

651
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,949
what's funny is I'm actually looking at

652
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,930
uh requiring signing of the git commits for

653
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,770
all the DWF uh the distributed weakness, filing related work and

654
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,859
miter and the CV project

655
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,170
are also looking at considering this because

656
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,800
it's not that it's 100% secure,

657
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:01,640
but it basically means instead of the attacker, you know,

658
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,189
sending false kit commits,

659
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,239
they now have to compromise a person's workstation, at least,

660
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,780
you know, to send in fake CV. Requests and fake CV S and stuff

661
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,349
which let's face it, right? An attacker

662
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,199
able to do that will also just send a fishing email which, you know,

663
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:20,540
would you'd have the same end effect even if you're, you know, doing true,

664
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,719
proper key security.

665
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:25,599
So we're looking at doing that just to basically add like a significant road bump

666
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,959
-- uh for Attackers.
-- Now, here's what

667
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,040
we

668
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,209
have

669
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:28,489
to get

670
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,040
to, what you're doing

671
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:33,150
is you are

672
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,349
you have a central authority,

673
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,689
right?

674
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,969
And that's why

675
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,420
P GP

676
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,540
signing

677
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:41,099
with GIT

678
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:41,869
commit

679
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:45,770
is functional. Well, no, you do have a central authority though because

680
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,770
you have

681
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:47,430
the

682
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,699
right

683
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,739
github, you add users, users add their GP G key and then github

684
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,900
basically says, holy crap. Where did this signature come from?

685
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,260
I don't know anything about this,

686
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:58,189
right?

687
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,719
Well,

688
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,900
we won't be using github

689
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,829
-- strictly. But
-- yeah,

690
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:01,630
I mean,

691
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,109
so essentially part of it is becoming when you become involved with the CV project.

692
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,670
One of the things assuming we go with GIT signing is you'll,

693
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,780
you'll have to provide a key,

694
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:10,160
right? You know,

695
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,069
and

696
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,500
so we'll have a copy of key of the key.

697
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,750
So we don't have to deal with this discoverability, you know,

698
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,869
and, and part of what I'm thinking about is do we require keys to expire?

699
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,109
Do we say please don't use keys that expire because,

700
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,459
you know, let's face it, you know, this isn't like super secret squirrel

701
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:25,959
stuff,

702
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,790
but here's the problem and

703
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,089
I, I don't,

704
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,310
I have to think about this.

705
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,160
I can probably give you some really good advice

706
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,469
on this at some point in the near future.

707
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:33,750
But,

708
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,150
but the fundamental problem with P GP keys

709
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,160
is there is no method

710
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,000
to easily revoke them.

711
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:44,160
And so if you, if you don't have the keys expire

712
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,630
and the key is compromised, which is certainly,

713
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
and I don't mean necessarily stolen, I mean,

714
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:54,380
you lose your U key or you lose a USB drive or whatever.

715
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:58,630
And you are concerned that this key material is now in the universe.

716
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,160
What do you do if the key never expires?

717
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,660
We see and what we, what we can do,

718
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,780
of course is because we have a copy of your key in our system,

719
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,479
we can just sort of manually expire it.

720
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,390
Right.

721
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,339
But obviously this doesn't scale all,

722
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:16,209
this wouldn't work at global scale with everybody doing email, for example,

723
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:16,910
you know,

724
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:17,520
-- within
-- a

725
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,010
-- single organization
-- it'll work. You're absolutely right.

726
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,160
And you can just revoke it because you know what G

727
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,270
gets you something very similar to the Blockchain

728
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,150
because you can't go back in time and change things.

729
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,449
Not without monkey. Well, not without breaking all the signatures. Right. Right.

730
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,520
Exactly. Exactly. And so,

731
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,510
ok, yeah, as long as you have

732
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,449
basically everyone signing commits,

733
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,130
you will never have to worry about

734
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,449
the sort of like a replay attack where someone goes back in time mucks with your repo

735
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,329
with with say stolen key material?

736
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,530
-- Ok.
-- Well, see, and here's the secret, right? The dirty secret is, this is

737
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,810
simply about adding the requirement that then the attacker

738
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:01,050
has to compromise and break into a person's workstation

739
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,349
in order to monkey with our system.

740
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,800
Which essentially

741
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,670
do you know

742
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,829
what my primary reason for requiring key signing is

743
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,339
it solves the spam problems?

744
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:13,510
Oh,

745
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:13,650
well,

746
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,310
-- yeah,
-- that solves the spam problem.

747
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,069
Right?

748
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,709
I don't have to deal with wonky requests.

749
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,410
I just check if they're signed, if they're not signed properly, I ignore them.

750
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,310
That's, you know, what else actually is as you talk about this is

751
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:28,339
we're calling this the death of P GP and we're talking about the,

752
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,040
the ability and use of P GP.

753
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:30,719
So,

754
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,170
but, but not only that you've, you've created an artificial

755
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:37,609
uh barrier of entry.

756
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,140
So, you know that it's,

757
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:42,349
if someone is serious about working with you,

758
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,849
they're gonna learn what they need to know.

759
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:47,930
But if they want to just be one of your typical drive-by trolls, that's too much work,

760
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,489
which I guess will span.

761
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,150
Right.

762
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:51,359
Exactly.

763
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,239
Exactly.

764
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,689
Uh Part of it too is, yeah, I mean, like you said, I mean,

765
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:58,719
for people getting involved in the CV project, I want them to have at least, you know,

766
00:30:58,729 --> 00:30:59,849
you must be this high

767
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,520
to be involved, like to get on the right sort of so to speak

768
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,099
and, you know, being able to generate a P GP key

769
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,479
and use it minimally, like

770
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,560
to configure your g for signing,

771
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:14,069
you know, literally, if you are technologically incapable of doing that,

772
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,280
then chances are

773
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:17,589
you're not going to be a good fit for the project.

774
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,229
That's pretty fair.

775
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:20,180
So,

776
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:20,949
and like I said,

777
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:24,099
it basically solves the spam problem and sort of the trolling problem in that.

778
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:25,880
It makes it really easy to,

779
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,030
you know, if somebody violates community standards,

780
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,979
we, when we remove them, we it makes it really easy to, you know,

781
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:34,099
essentially filter them.

782
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,839
Right.

783
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,040
Sure.

784
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,479
Well, I guess so, here's the other thing that, that just came to my mind, right,

785
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:42,489
as you explain this and, and I'm thinking about it is

786
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:48,969
the, the kind of the benefit and purpose behind P GP was that decentralization

787
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:49,810
and

788
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,530
treating the user as the authority of themselves.

789
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:54,369
And

790
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,170
the model you're talking about is really a lot closer to kind of the,

791
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,010
the TLSC a model of.

792
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,609
We're, we're going to decide these people are in charge

793
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,239
and we're gonna put enough trust in them to just say what they say is OK is OK.

794
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,020
Right. And so fundamentally what you're talking about here is

795
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,589
I wonder if git has the ability to deal with like X 509 style signatures

796
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,959
where then you could do some crazy magic around

797
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:25,250
uh signature chaining or not signature

798
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,170
but certificate chaining and verification,

799
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,079
which could be really fun to research.

800
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,209
Uh Fortunately, I don't need to do that because I have solved that issue

801
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:40,250
in the DWFS process around how CV S are assigned and requested from subsidiaries

802
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:45,449
and, and this doesn't, this without question would be incredible overkill.

803
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:45,969
It's just,

804
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:47,010
it sounds fun.

805
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:47,880
So I try

806
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,989
to think about it.

807
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,270
Yeah.

808
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,449
But,

809
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,630
uh,

810
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,140
you know, and that's the thing too is I don't want to make this so painful that it,

811
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,290
you know, becomes

812
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,189
onerous

813
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,189
because II I don't want to have to deal with it.

814
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,089
So that is one of the advantages

815
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,949
that, that GP G brings

816
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,949
is you type literally like GP G, you know, what does it generate key?

817
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,310
And it asks you what four questions and you get a key.

818
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,430
Like that's cool, right? If you've ever had to generate a proper TLS certificate,

819
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:19,630
it's a nightmare unless you use lots of crypt,

820
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,520
right? But

821
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,069
that thank goodness like put all the horrible problems in someone else's bucket

822
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:29,910
and, and the people just have to wait. You run like one command and magic.

823
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,180
Yeah, it's a self updating Python script. That's pretty ugly.

824
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:36,979
-- But you know what it
-- works? Who cares, man? If it, if it works, it's great.

825
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,469
Well, that's, yeah, that's the beauty of it, right is,

826
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:42,390
and that's one of the things with security people, right? Like

827
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,349
a lot of security people will

828
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,310
are willing to give up usability in favor of like

829
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,280
perfect security and we end up with these systems that are

830
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,069
so unusable. You end up with an

831
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:52,780
unusable

832
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,329
-- from them because nobody
-- uses them.

833
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,239
It's not,

834
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,819
you don't give up usability for perfect security.

835
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:02,130
You give up usability and get crap. Like that's what happens.

836
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,020
Yeah.

837
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,520
Like, uh, many organizations I've dealt with, you know, I,

838
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,219
I kind of wish they would sign email because, you know,

839
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:10,840
we're sending around requests and,

840
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,739
you know, please do this, you know, sensitive things and

841
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,228
-- no,
-- no,

842
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:15,779
no, no.

843
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,739
You say that, you say that, you say,

844
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:21,259
I wish they would sign the emails because I'm doing these sensitive things.

845
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:21,628
You didn't

846
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:21,878
hear the

847
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,279
-- second part.
-- How many times is there a problem?

848
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:25,618
Well, exactly.

849
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:29,099
And so I wish they would sign emails in a way that was super trivial,

850
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,418
super easy to verify, super easy to manage.

851
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,458
It just doesn't exist.

852
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:34,428
But the alternative is

853
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:36,768
nothing and things are basically doing fine

854
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:38,349
-- so
-- well, except, you know,

855
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,839
when we get those phishing attempts trying to

856
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,089
get us to pay $10,000 invoices or whatever,

857
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,099
right to some dude and like

858
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,040
uh where was it? New Mexico or something?

859
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,850
Well, I guess this is where

860
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,489
depending upon what you're doing,

861
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:58,979
it kind of dictates how many, how you should position your checks and balances.

862
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,499
And in fact, there's a lot of compliance,

863
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:04,479
especially around things like uh PC I

864
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:05,549
and Hipaa

865
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:06,218
and,

866
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,888
and even Sarbanes Oxley to a degree where the very

867
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,858
sensitive operations have significant checks and balances in them.

868
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:16,259
But the things that are less sensitive, it's like, eh, good enough. Right.

869
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:18,259
And that's kind of the right way to think about it.

870
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,510
Well, the problem is you can end up.

871
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,149
Uh, so for example, there's a local college, uh, what is it? Northwest College

872
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,209
they put, they had an,

873
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,870
it guy who was allowed to essentially

874
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:31,520
expense stuff under $50,000 with no oversight.

875
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:31,949
Really.

876
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,469
Uh, so it turns out they're missing, I think it's $2 million.

877
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,669
Is that all 50,000 is a pretty,

878
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,679
that's a pretty

879
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,909
crazy ceiling.

880
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,669
Yeah. Yeah.

881
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,820
So he was, like, expensing, you know, uh, licenses for software that, you know,

882
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:51,620
from a company that he also owned, you know, things like that.

883
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:52,050
So,

884
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,699
you know, and, and again, that speaks to the, just the,

885
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:57,239
the ridiculous lack of financial controls because,

886
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:00,129
um, they didn't find out about this until there was

887
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,310
a,

888
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,139
essentially a privacy related issue.

889
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,580
Uh,

890
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:06,379
and then they, um,

891
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,469
you know, sort of found out about the accounting issues, right. So they had,

892
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:13,489
anyways, it was just, basically, it was lack of financial controls.

893
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,979
Like you read about the, there's been that spear fishing campaign,

894
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:17,290
I forget what they called it.

895
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,060
But essentially the bad guys are targeting like CEO S CFO S accounting departments,

896
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,739
you know, and, and getting them like,

897
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,820
and basically the two main things the tricks they're using, which blows my mind.

898
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,889
Number one, here's an invoice. Please pay it

899
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,659
and some of these companies do.

900
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:34,229
Right? Just to random bank accounts and stuff.

901
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,340
And then the second one is a little more detailed.

902
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,030
They go, you know, hi, I'm your existing supplier of X.

903
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:42,209
And our banking account details have changed from this to

904
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:45,110
this other bank account in like some other place with,

905
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,510
you know, much less law enforcement.

906
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,429
Uh ironically and so

907
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,389
people change the banking details and continue to pay invoices, you know, for,

908
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,189
I'm guessing

909
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,500
3060 whatever the uh payment terms are before the actual supplier goes.

910
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,750
Hey, uh where's our money?

911
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,169
You know, and then of course, the company goes, well, we've been paying you.

912
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,689
I can only imagine those are some awkward email threads

913
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:11,129
and it just blows me away that uh there was one

914
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,719
company uh we'll have to put in the show notes,

915
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:15,189
but I think they were taken for $68 million.

916
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,090
Oh man.

917
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,129
But, but so, so here's the deal, ok. Here's the deal with. This is

918
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,250
all of those problems could be avoided if somebody picked up a telephone,

919
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:27,969
if you

920
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,600
have a secondary. And, and this is part of this is the important part here is

921
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,290
if you're communicating with someone via email,

922
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,669
you need another way to contact them, that's out of band.

923
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:42,449
And that's where you don't use the phone number in the email.

924
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:46,250
You know, you go to the rolodex or the phone book, the phone book still exists.

925
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,489
But anyway, you know, you go, you find a way to contact them

926
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,330
that is out of band

927
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,800
and you can verify it. And that's,

928
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:56,889
that's the thing. A lot of people forget is

929
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,719
email isn't the only way to get a hold of people and let's face it.

930
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:03,760
Even if we had signed emails

931
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,379
and even if the bad guys manage to sign it,

932
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,590
that doesn't thwart a phone call.

933
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,250
Well, the problem is people would still, for example, you know,

934
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,860
because domain names change, for example.

935
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,550
So you get an email from company name. Hyphen

936
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,949
something.com. Well, you know, how do you know if that's the actual company or not?

937
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,810
Uh, you know, that's one of the dirty secrets of, you know,

938
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,669
especially things like SSL and TLS is

939
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:31,020
the majority of SSL and TLS certificates are sort of low validation.

940
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,379
They're like just the domain name is validated like this is walmart.com.

941
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:36,020
We don't know if it's actually Walmart,

942
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,530
right. It's just, it's walmart.com or it's whatever.com,

943
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:44,399
you know, and some companies, well, like say paypal.com, I know for sure

944
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,340
they have, uh, you know,

945
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,260
the extended validation certificates where they actually have to, uh, submit,

946
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,050
I think some business records or like a

947
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,100
done in Bradstreet business listing or whatever,

948
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:55,959
you know, to actually verify that we are paypal.

949
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:58,550
Uh, but then of course, that raises issues like, well, I'm sure,

950
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,570
you know, trademark lobbying what it is.

951
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,949
And, uh,

952
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:03,370
there's probably like countries in the world where

953
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,239
you can register paypal without too much trouble.

954
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,389
Well, but here's the thing too is EV, two certificates are also very expensive

955
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,360
and so a Cron artist is probably going to be less inclined to do that. However,

956
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,070
most people don't

957
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,729
understand the difference between a regular certificate and an EV certificate.

958
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,409
So I don't think that has

959
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,949
a huge,

960
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,750
I, I guess benefit

961
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,270
to the organization.

962
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,070
I think it's, uh

963
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,989
in many cases more about just shifting the cost of

964
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,070
fraud when there is fraud because then you can say,

965
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,399
look, we have an EV certificate, you went to the site that does not have one

966
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,459
too bad,

967
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,050
you know, you should have checked.

968
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,389
Um

969
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:45,840
Yeah, so anyways back to P GP, I mean, the,

970
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,969
the problem I have with P GP is it's actually, you know, it's good encryption.

971
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,810
Um

972
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,780
but it's pretty terrible usability,

973
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,689
especially when you want to talk to somebody you've never talked to before.

974
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:56,489
Yes,

975
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,679
which is

976
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:58,320
the

977
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:02,260
-- point of email
-- that's still a problem and even things like signal.

978
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,449
I mean, that's one of my biggest complaints about signal is I can't

979
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:06,689
easily

980
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,370
give someone contact details without handing out my cell phone number, which

981
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,219
I mean, in my case, I'm like, well, it's, if you want to call me,

982
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:16,909
it's not that hard to find, right?

983
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,949
I've given up on protecting my cell phone number,

984
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,090
but I know not everyone feels that way.

985
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,909
And so that's one of the challenges I think.

986
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,659
Yeah.

987
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,620
Well, and the thing is too, uh for example, there, I mean,

988
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:29,270
that's one thing I'm very specifically doing with the

989
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,889
DWO from the people that work for it.

990
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,600
You have to at a minimum register like a primary

991
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,350
working email and a secondary email because let's face it.

992
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,489
Right.

993
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,780
People's primary address sometimes changes, you know,

994
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,989
if people use their corporate account, people do change jobs.

995
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,219
Um,

996
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,469
and I'm actually thinking of changing that

997
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:50,229
and tying the identity more to something more permanent like a

998
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,919
Twitter account or a Facebook account or a linkedin account,

999
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:53,629
which let's face it.

1000
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,389
People get those and hold on to them,

1001
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,379
you know, that

1002
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:56,699
that's

1003
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,050
fair.

1004
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:57,620
Uh

1005
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,219
And then the second thing is beyond that, I don't care who or what you are.

1006
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:04,110
I just basically need that email address. So anybody

1007
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,550
with questions about what you did can, you know,

1008
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,580
contact you with relative ease,

1009
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:12,189
you know, for that transparency piece of what the heck happened.

1010
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,699
And,

1011
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,110
you know, so I've,

1012
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,389
I've essentially taken identity management and fixed it by not doing it

1013
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,139
right. And that's,

1014
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,540
you know, and, and that's not available to everybody, unfortunately,

1015
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,979
but for myself, luckily it is because I, you know, I looked into what it would

1016
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,550
take to properly do identity management. And

1017
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,800
I mean, basically,

1018
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,969
you're the only person that I would be able to actually verify and

1019
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:35,600
that's only because I've worked with you for like over five years,

1020
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:35,679
right?

1021
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,120
You know,

1022
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:38,399
you know,

1023
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,179
I just discussed

1024
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,090
identity management

1025
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,110
issues with, with who's going to be my future brother in law.

1026
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,409
This weekend we were at a Christmas party and

1027
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:51,189
of course we're sitting in the corner discussing identity management

1028
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,550
while everyone else is, you know, drinking beer and, and talking to each other.

1029
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,040
But

1030
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,629
normal.

1031
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:56,389
Right.

1032
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:00,040
We were normal for our area of the room.

1033
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:05,459
But it, it is, it's such a crazy, horrible, hard problem. And there is

1034
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,399
no good answer today

1035
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,090
to solving some of this stuff.

1036
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:12,610
Well, and even if you solve identity management, there's still a ton of problems.

1037
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,850
Like people's names change all the time.

1038
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,379
You know, they get married, they get divorced,

1039
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:20,510
they legally change their name for other reasons.

1040
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,939
You know,

1041
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:25,310
identity management is a crazy hard problem.

1042
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,530
It, I

1043
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,639
don't want to say it's impossible, but it might be impossible.

1044
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,229
I think it's one of those diminishing return issues

1045
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,080
where you can do it like well enough.

1046
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,100
-- Yes,
-- for most cases.

1047
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:39,719
Well, oh, you know what I mean?

1048
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,209
I just realized we're talking about P GP and the fact that the decentralization

1049
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:49,810
of it is what really is its downfall. And once we look at something like

1050
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,699
the way you're using signed G

1051
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,370
commits and now we have a central authority and it becomes usable.

1052
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,840
Identity management is not unlike that where today

1053
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,840
we are trying to solve a problem that is

1054
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:03,840
completely disjoint.

1055
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:07,639
But if we had some sort of central identity authority,

1056
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,879
which if I said it's the government,

1057
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:13,840
I'm going to have people send me tons of hate mail about how terrible that is.

1058
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,270
But you kind of get the idea,

1059
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:18,830
I think without a central authority it is an unsolvable problem.

1060
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,780
Well, the reality is outside of my small circle of people. I actually know.

1061
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:28,989
You know, and, and saying, you know, that whole seven degrees of separation thing,

1062
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,310
you know, once you get past two or three degrees of separation, it's, uh, you know,

1063
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,270
it's really hard, like who's that guy in Guatemala?

1064
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,310
I have no idea,

1065
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,379
you know,

1066
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,790
and the reality is, like I said,

1067
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,429
part of it is I'm looking at it from just a pragmatic point of view is

1068
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,810
see, for me,

1069
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,790
it's less about knowing who they actually are and it's

1070
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,189
more about just tying it to an identity to an entity

1071
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:50,590
and essentially saying,

1072
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,550
look as long as they do good work and don't violate the community rules,

1073
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,449
I'm happy with them.

1074
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:57,820
And if they violate the community rules and do bad work, we kind of, you know,

1075
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,649
talk to them

1076
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,429
and if they keep doing it, we boot them out.

1077
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,120
Yes. Right.

1078
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:02,669
So it's,

1079
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:04,899
I actually care less about their actual identity

1080
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,729
and more about just identifying that this identity is

1081
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,469
like

1082
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,469
this identity.

1083
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,409
And like I said, I'm, I'm seriously considering

1084
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,320
moving from my previous mindset,

1085
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,489
which was like email address was sort of your primary identifier online

1086
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:21,969
and moving to these more social networks like Facebook, Twitter, linkedin,

1087
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:22,550
whatever,

1088
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:23,179
you know,

1089
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:26,179
like I said where people tend to get an account there and they tend to hang on to it.

1090
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:28,250
Yep. Yep.

1091
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:30,560
I would agree completely.

1092
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:31,439
And you know,

1093
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,590
the dirty little secret there is essentially what it

1094
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,389
boils down to is URL S as identification,

1095
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:36,709
right?

1096
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:38,540
Twitter.com/kurtz

1097
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:41,770
Fried or twitter.com/whatever Bib

1098
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:42,350
Bob.

1099
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,770
I, I think though, you also have the advantage of,

1100
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,689
you have a very tight scope

1101
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:55,010
and so you're not trying to boil the ocean, which I think is

1102
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,739
when you have a clearly defined problem,

1103
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,520
you can create a clearly defined solution for it, right?

1104
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,419
Is we're seeing that in action here. And

1105
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:06,379
I think that's probably also one of the other problems is

1106
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:09,760
everyone tries to solve the world's problems.

1107
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,899
They don't try to solve their problems

1108
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,120
when they get to something like identity management

1109
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,270
and, and even even P GP kind of fell into this of

1110
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,840
instead of solving one nice problem, let's solve all the problems.

1111
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:26,139
Well, I think basically they, they didn't solve any problems.

1112
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:29,040
They built a framework where it's possible to solve these problems.

1113
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:30,879
Maybe

1114
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,520
you're a freaking genius.

1115
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, but um they didn't, I mean if you look at it given,

1116
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:39,239
well, let's say for example, P GP with no key servers

1117
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,300
you have now really the only people you can

1118
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,669
exchange email and stuff with are people that you're,

1119
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,459
you have a phone number for or meet in real life.

1120
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,949
Uh You know, I remember P GP with no key servers is.

1121
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,389
In fact, some of my first uses of it were

1122
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:55,290
via bulletin board systems

1123
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:56,429
where

1124
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,389
we would con uh in,

1125
00:45:57,399 --> 00:46:01,590
in this was obviously we were setting ourselves up incorrectly to begin with.

1126
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,300
But it's essentially, hey, I'm Josh, here's my key, you know, hey, I'm, I'm Bob.

1127
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,560
Here's my key and then we could start sending each other messages.

1128
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:10,570
Now, granted,

1129
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:15,550
given it was a local small bulletin board in, you know, Northern Wisconsin,

1130
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:21,199
there was a probably limited trouble of, of anyone really getting in the middle, but

1131
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,050
it would not be out of the question for a malicious sis

1132
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:24,189
a

1133
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,280
to have done that.

1134
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,340
And I, there's no way we would have known and this is someone I've never met in person.

1135
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,050
It's just we happen to be

1136
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:37,149
on the same bulletin board and we happen to need to have a private discussion.

1137
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:39,860
Yeah. No, I mean, these are very difficult problems to solve and

1138
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't wanna say they're unsolvable,

1139
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,959
but I don't think they're solvable in an economically viable way

1140
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:49,189
and more to the point. I'm not sure these problems need to be solved.

1141
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:54,120
Um, for example, your bank, once your bank is legally established who you are,

1142
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,679
you know, they sort of let you do what you want with your account, especially online,

1143
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:57,830
right?

1144
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,409
Anybody that has your password and secret questions

1145
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:02,070
could log into your account and do whatever

1146
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:06,010
and essentially they've done what they have to do legally.

1147
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,510
Uh, yeah, it's Oh man, this is such a crazy problem.

1148
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:11,360
So, I mean, for example,

1149
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,830
I love now that I can email money to people and all I

1150
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,550
need is their email address and then I have to get them,

1151
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,469
you know, the answer to a secret question

1152
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:23,290
which I typically send them by email because I have no real other way to contact them.

1153
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:25,830
So

1154
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,389
yeah, I mean, but you know, it's convenient, right? And

1155
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,030
I'll take convenience over

1156
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,350
completely while not having anything,

1157
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,510
-- you know, to pay my bills.
-- That's,

1158
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:38,939
you know, I think that's kind of the lesson here. Right.

1159
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:41,879
And this is, you should probably get this wrapped up at some point. But

1160
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,590
it really comes down to

1161
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:46,709
convenience, outweighs security

1162
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:47,669
every time.

1163
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,199
And that's really almost always

1164
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,320
-- every time
-- there are things I just won't do because they are, I can't do them safe.

1165
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:57,429
You won't, I will never go base jumping.

1166
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:03,159
That's not convenient. Kurt, like base jumping is less convenient.

1167
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,629
That's another conversation

1168
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,580
for a different day.

1169
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,560
But I think so.

1170
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:10,649
-- So
-- I guess in general,

1171
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:15,139
-- I would agree 99.8% of the time over
-- the course of this discussion, we

1172
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:17,030
declared P GP dead.

1173
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,399
And now it's not because we're using it with G,

1174
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,270
but I, I will agree that I think for private communications,

1175
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,570
it is certainly a less than ideal

1176
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:26,429
solution.

1177
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,719
And I'm glad to see things now like signal coming out that are making this much,

1178
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:32,669
much easier

1179
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,550
to solve.

1180
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:35,080
Well, and more to the point.

1181
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:38,969
Right, is we, if we really want to solve these problems,

1182
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:42,110
we can't just solve them for people who are technologically competent

1183
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:45,149
because that is a really tiny subset of humanity,

1184
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,629
you know, even within our industry. Like,

1185
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,110
I, there's so much stuff I don't know about how to, you know,

1186
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,820
I'm now at the point where I know what, I don't know. And it's like, it's a lot.

1187
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:55,439
That's

1188
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:55,689
right.

1189
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:56,409
Um,

1190
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,959
and things like signal, you know, it's like you just need the person's phone number,

1191
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:00,560
end of story.

1192
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,310
Now, it's going to be encrypted, end to end.

1193
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,919
All right. Well, with that, let's, uh,

1194
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:07,639
let's call it quits for now

1195
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,169
and we can all think about P GP

1196
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,840
and, and the terrors that come with it.

1197
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,000
And I guess until next time, Kurt,

1198
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,360
thank you very much, everyone.

1199
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,040
Uh, open source security podcast.com, check the show notes

1200
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,360
and until

1201
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,000
that's right, hashtag Os S podcast,

1202
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:27,159
you can, we'll, we'll keep an eye on it and you can chat us up on Twitter

1203
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:29,770
until next time. Everybody. Thank you much,

1204
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,439
Merry

1205
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:32,139
Merry

1206
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:33,100
Christmas.

1207
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,040
Bye bye.
