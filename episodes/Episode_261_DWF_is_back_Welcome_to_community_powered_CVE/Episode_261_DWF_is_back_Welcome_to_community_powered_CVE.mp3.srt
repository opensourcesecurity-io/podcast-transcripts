Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:15,960
-- and my partner in shenanigans, Josh Pressers. That's
-- right. DW F is back baby.

2
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,489
-- The
-- distributed weakness filing project.

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,540
We should probably start at the beginning because I'm sure

4
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:23,579
there's lots of people who don't know what this means.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,209
But Kurt and I are super excited and this is like

6
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,120
the first real time we're talking about this in public,

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,079
but it's something we've been working on for a really long time.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,440
So Kurt,

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,340
why don't you give us the history lesson and

10
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:35,240
then we'll talk about what we're doing today.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,840
So the DW started quite some time ago.

12
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,689
I've basically been involved with CV for going on 20 years now, you know,

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,340
things like notifying them of duplicates or asking for clarification

14
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:48,110
on CVS ever since it was handcrafted and still is.

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,770
And what I started working at Red Hat, uh obviously, Red Hat is big into CV S.

16
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:54,819
Uh They do pretty much exclusively open source

17
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,459
and they very aggressively have a policy of,

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,139
is it a security vulnerability if yes assigned CV

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,909
or make sure it has a CV, assigned,

20
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,120
which I think is great because

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,860
it just makes tracking these things a whole bunch easier

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,339
and,

23
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,040
and aggressive to the point where there was about

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,550
two or three cases a year where I'd assign

25
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:13,599
a CV right away and then it would turn out actually not to be a security flaw.

26
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,419
But anyways,

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,449
one of the issues was the

28
00:01:16,669 --> 00:01:17,500
Red Hat

29
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,540
ships,

30
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:21,970
mostly other people's software by volume, right?

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,389
Because they ship open source, right?

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,660
They, the Linux kernel, they, they contribute very heavily to the LINX kernel.

33
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,169
But obviously,

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,800
there's far more other people doing the Linux kernel than just red hat.

35
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:34,040
Same thing for, you know, all the user space Apache blah, blah blah.

36
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,400
Now, as an aside on that point,

37
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:38,720
Red hat did this

38
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,199
a long time ago. Everyone does this today.

39
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh Yeah, everybody ships all the open source now like your dependency chain,

40
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,910
set that out there for everyone to think

41
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,379
very few people actually care about CV.

42
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:51,819
So

43
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,220
we'll

44
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:52,550
get to

45
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:52,720
that.

46
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:54,419
So

47
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,050
anyway, so it was part of my job at Red Hat was getting all these CV S

48
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,819
and to put it bluntly, the CV system was built in a different time

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,410
and it kind of has a culture and technology from 1999.

50
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,740
And so, well, I, I basically kind of tried to

51
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,770
push them along a little bit and that didn't work.

52
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:15,244
So I basically help metaphorical gun to their head and started the DW project,

53
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:16,333
which is CV,

54
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,363
one CV,

55
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,843
plus one. So if you take the letter C, what,

56
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:23,824
-- that's the letter after CD, what's the letter after V
-- VW

57
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:24,843
E? Right.

58
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,203
There you go. So it's CV

59
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,024
edw

60
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,863
F so I basically started assigning DW

61
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:30,514
IDS

62
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,033
and,

63
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,904
and CVS because, well,

64
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,824
we needed these CV identifiers like we had to have these numbers, right?

65
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:41,033
We were, we were drowning in vulnerabilities with no CV. And we still are. Yeah.

66
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:41,623
Well,

67
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,727
absolutely. I did two things that I'm very proud of. Number one was, I got a

68
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:49,098
JSON data format and number two, I got them into github.

69
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:49,858
Now see,

70
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,908
the way CVE traditionally works and still does is

71
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:55,067
miter has this internal database at their end.

72
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,667
That is the true source of truth.

73
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,548
-- I
-- have a suspicion calling it a database is a,

74
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,647
-- it's
-- a text file or at least it used to be a text file.

75
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:02,427
It's probably a database.

76
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,867
-- Now,
-- I don't know, I would not be surprised if it's, I don't

77
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:05,438
even know

78
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,048
and I was on the board and I don't even know they

79
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,927
never really told us or made it clear what it was.

80
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,067
And so my

81
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,111
hope was number one to get a better data format

82
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,311
because the way CV data was published was either,

83
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,212
you know, a CS V file, an XML file or

84
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,662
like a text file

85
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:26,111
or, you know, web pages, right? So processing that with a computer was kind of a pain.

86
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:26,662
And

87
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:31,951
JSON, I think strikes that really perfect middle ground of very human readable,

88
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,442
like super human readable and machine pars

89
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:37,311
very easily and more to the point. Most of the

90
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,511
JSON parcels are not full of security flaws like the X

91
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,035
parcel

92
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,505
that is 100% correct. You know,

93
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:46,645
because that was one of my other questions people kept asking me, why don't use XML?

94
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:49,796
And I'm like, OK, go go search the CV database for XML versus

95
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:50,065
JSON.

96
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,636
-- Not
-- just that look, I've done

97
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,305
an enormous amount of XML parsing.

98
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:55,505
I mean,

99
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,595
I wrote an XML parser in C a long time

100
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:00,026
ago when I worked at a company called Progeny Linux Systems

101
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:06,276
-- and parsing XML is a terrible, terrible task.
-- It's true and complete.

102
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:09,955
-- It's self modifying. It can
-- be, it's, it's a nightmare. Jason is loving

103
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:13,080
-- because of its
-- simplicity. If it's on the back of a business. That's right.

104
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:16,890
-- That's right. OK.
-- So anyway, so and then my hope to get them into github

105
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,678
was also to open this up a bit and get it a bit more of the public involved

106
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,380
and get a bit more transparency, right?

107
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,559
Because I'm a really big believer in transparency

108
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,179
because part of the challenge with fixing something is to fix something,

109
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,200
you have to understand how it currently works, correct.

110
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,640
I mean, you can sort of blindly try fixing it. But

111
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:35,989
uh

112
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:39,399
yeah, good luck on the first count of the Jason

113
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:40,644
basically

114
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:44,803
succeeded and then it failed because essentially the format got modified a bit

115
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:47,623
into a way that basically they were trying to turn it into XML.

116
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:52,364
The current format is hideous, would be my polite description of it,

117
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,403
-- but
-- it's better than nothing.

118
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:55,164
I will agree with that. Yes.

119
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:57,914
And it's certainly better than just being pure XML. Yes.

120
00:04:57,973 --> 00:04:59,194
And as far as getting them into github,

121
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:02,894
that was a complete failure in that when you contribute something to the CV list

122
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:03,773
repo in github,

123
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:04,653
that CV list

124
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:08,414
repo is the actual repo of the CV data. You basically push data

125
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:08,884
it

126
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,339
and then Miter takes that data, shoves it into their magic back end

127
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,109
and then spits it out of their back end, back into github

128
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,350
-- and actually commits it.
-- Right. It's a strange two way process.

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,429
Well, it's essentially, they're not using

130
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:22,320
github as a G

131
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,420
repo, they're using github

132
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,540
as a text publishing platform.

133
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,850
-- Right. Right.
-- The other challenge too is, is I failed to change

134
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,160
the culture of CV, right. That stuff is still handcrafted.

135
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,890
They still overly rely on the human readable descriptions to the point

136
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,369
where it's now comical a bit because some of those descriptions,

137
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,630
I don't know if they got mangled or dropped

138
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,269
or something like a computer dropped some text,

139
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,040
but you've seen some of them, right?

140
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:47,799
-- Yeah,
-- I post them on Twitter all the time. There's some absolutely hilarious ones.

141
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,970
They don't have version numbers, they're just like

142
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,869
this package has a vulnerability and is affected

143
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,549
like that is literally word for word,

144
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,309
some of the descriptions.

145
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,920
Right. Right.

146
00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:01,309
Or I love, there was, there was one I just posted the other day that was like,

147
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:01,820
it was,

148
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,209
it was an XML problem and it was like a xxe

149
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,200
flaw and it's like the worst possible type of flaw.

150
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,519
It's like what? That's ridiculous.

151
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,464
So the problem with CV is that it's still overly relies

152
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:16,195
on humans to generate the data and to consume the data.

153
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:18,755
And that, that is not a long term winning strategy.

154
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:23,704
-- And
-- now I want to, before we, before we start getting into some of the problems,

155
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:24,875
I want to also clarify.

156
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,595
So Kurtz started DW F and Miter even blessed DW

157
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:29,315
F.

158
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,505
But it was almost exclusively a one person

159
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,464
operation where you'd go to a website called Iwant

160
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:38,589
tove.org and would fill out a form and it would end up in a spreadsheet.

161
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,950
And then Kurt did

162
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,000
the work of the people by taking the spreadsheet and turning it into DWD.

163
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,440
There's an embarrassing thing there.

164
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,420
I actually wrote a little 30 or 40 line Python script

165
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:53,149
that turned those once the CV entry was basically vetted,

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,109
I ran it through this Python script that literally constructed sentences.

167
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,700
It was straight up machine written text, that was very simple

168
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:02,184
-- and you know what? It worked great because it had all the facts. Right.
-- Exactly.

169
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:03,364
And, but anyway,

170
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:08,005
so you did all this, you did all this work and obviously no one was supporting you mier

171
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,825
wasn't supporting you, the community wasn't supporting you.

172
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,174
It's like the time zone thing, right?

173
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:14,315
Everybody uses it but nobody really thinks about it.

174
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:17,385
And like the DW was an official CV numbering authority.

175
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,744
-- So
-- this is one of the challenges I

176
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:21,614
think though is because you were official authority.

177
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,065
You also had to conform

178
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,790
-- to miters, artisanal
-- rule. Yeah.

179
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:30,779
The CN A guidelines which are actually rules but they're called the guidelines,

180
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,279
right?

181
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,799
And they're, they're like many things in life. They have good intentions but

182
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,799
they're,

183
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,670
they're from a different time. Yes, I agree. That's,

184
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,589
and I think that's the biggest problem with CV is that it's the world

185
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,779
we live in now is nowhere near the world we had 10 years ago,

186
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,149
let alone 20 years ago, like just the volume of vulnerabilities, right?

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,220
Even though the majority of vulnerabilities are not

188
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,250
really all that actively exploited in use.

189
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,489
I mean,

190
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,480
the numbers I've seen are like two or

191
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,649
3% of all the known vulnerabilities actually get

192
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:56,970
used.

193
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,670
And I'm assuming it's actually less than that because that

194
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,799
was two or 3% of cds were getting abused.

195
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,720
I assume it's actually like, I know people in the pest

196
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,769
community and they're constantly finding stuff right

197
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,640
now before we continue down this path.

198
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:12,089
-- Why don't we explain like, what are we doing? Why are we talking about DW F
-- today?

199
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,579
I looked at was I being very effective or useful on the CV board?

200
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,290
As far as helping CV, in the community.

201
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,549
And the answer was no.

202
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:22,739
So I resigned on January 8th of 2021 because where I had

203
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,339
been effective in moving CV Fords was as an outsider as essentially

204
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,119
a well intentioned person who kind of did things.

205
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,500
-- That's it, like went and did things
-- and that's OK.

206
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,440
That's the most important part of this whole conversation.

207
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,940
I want to focus on that for just a second and explain it.

208
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,530
I have a blog post,

209
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,539
I've talked about at length on this

210
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,690
podcast which is kind of committees versus communities

211
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,809
writer. And CV E are a committee.

212
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,929
Committees don't get things done.

213
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,369
Committees write white papers and waste time and consume money,

214
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,719
communities get things done.

215
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,210
CV E is a committee. DWF is a community.

216
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,489
Yeah, like I'm,

217
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,849
I'm thinking of uh there's a couple of projects I was involved in with them,

218
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:06,450
but

219
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,960
-- as far as I can tell, I've never moved forwards.
-- Committee.

220
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,159
It's all committee stuff. It never will. Committees don't get work done.

221
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,559
And what's interesting is the board kept getting

222
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,729
-- larger and of course
-- it did committees.

223
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:20,979
-- That's what committees do.
-- I'm not really clear on why, but

224
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:21,429
committees

225
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,520
because it's a committee.

226
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,844
Well, in fairness, part of it was getting some more viewpoints from the outside,

227
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:29,054
like different stakeholder views, which is important

228
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,815
because that's one thing CV has been infamously terrible at is actually

229
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:36,284
engaging with the community and even knowing what the community is,

230
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:37,005
I agree.

231
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,705
But getting four more people on the board isn't going to do that.

232
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,655
So, basically what we're doing

233
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:42,705
is,

234
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:46,174
uh, well, simply put, go to, I want to cv.org, fill it out

235
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,669
and you get your CV,

236
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,340
end of story because here's the secret about a CV. You know, what makes VA CV?

237
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,140
And everybody's like, uh, uh, because miter signs it, I'm like, well, no,

238
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,419
miter doesn't actually assign most of these.

239
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,719
That's the CV numbering authorities. They're like, oh

240
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:58,919
it's in the database.

241
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,760
So I'm like, well, it's, it's nice to have it in the database, but

242
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,799
most CV ES get published publicly and then end up in the database. So that's not it.

243
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,940
And some things, you know, LA by weeks or months in some cases,

244
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,760
mostly that's, it's gotten better. But

245
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,039
what makes VA CV?

246
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,349
And the simple and short answer is

247
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,460
because somebody you trust says it is, that's it.

248
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,619
And so like the traditional version of that is, you know, Microsoft says this is CV.

249
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,440
Foo. Well, that makes it CV foo,

250
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,619
you know, a red hat. We actually had the case of, I think it was uh what was it like?

251
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,599
I forget which company it was.

252
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:37,619
But they, they literally typo a CV E number and stole one of ours

253
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,770
from our pool, right? Accidentally.

254
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:41,750
And I was like,

255
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,859
you know, and, and so Miter contacts me and they're like,

256
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:44,900
why are you assigning the CV?

257
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,849
For this, you know, not your product. And I'm like, what are you even talking about?

258
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:49,359
And they're like, oh, let's go ask them

259
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,429
and they straight up, made a typo

260
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,780
and we hadn't used the number. So it's like, ok, cool done.

261
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:59,440
And that's the thing. So it basically is a CV. Is a CV. Somebody you trust

262
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:00,750
says it's a CV.

263
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,989
-- And you believe that, but
-- there's an even more important part of this story.

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,390
DWF isn't a committee. DWF is a community.

265
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:09,299
Yeah, it's a github

266
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,109
-- repo that everybody can go poke up.
-- There's, there's kind of two parts to this.

267
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,359
There's the DWF list, github

268
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,650
repo, which is where the actual CV E Jason will live.

269
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,799
And then we also have the tooling we're using to drive all this and

270
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:29,359
the intent is like our goal is no humans and we're not there yet.

271
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:32,940
Obviously, we have work to do come help, please. We love your help. But

272
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,320
this is the biggest part of this is that the

273
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,020
tooling is public and how it all works is public.

274
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,349
There's no secrets here and anyone can suggest whatever they want.

275
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:42,760
Well, see,

276
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,900
and that was a big reason I wanted to move them into github was public issues.

277
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,979
Poll requests.

278
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:48,530
Yeah.

279
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,659
And if you go look at the CV, if you go to github.com/cv project,

280
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,109
which is the quote unquote official miter

281
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,780
CV organization

282
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,289
slash CV list, you can't even file issues against

283
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,200
it. For example, if you want to, if, if you find a problem with the CV,

284
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,400
you have to go to their web form and fill it out and,

285
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,080
and then it just disappears into a black hole.

286
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,760
No, that's it.

287
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,520
And again,

288
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,099
I was on the board and I didn't even know what the

289
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,270
status of this stuff was or even more to the point.

290
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,109
I, I wasn't even entirely sure how, like, what was the process that was handling it?

291
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,039
And again, back to transparency and openness,

292
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,950
it's really hard to get involved in something

293
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,710
when that something is a building with locked

294
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,380
doors and security guards who essentially tell you

295
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,140
write it down on a piece of paper and

296
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,369
I'll see that something is done with it

297
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,789
probably.

298
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,969
But I agree.

299
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:39,130
And I think when you're dealing with these, I guess,

300
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:42,500
identifiers that need to be in the public space,

301
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,059
it is, this should be a public project,

302
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,150
this should be a community driving this effort.

303
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,239
This shouldn't be

304
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,140
some weird committee that no one understands.

305
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,380
Well, again, it's historical, right? The Department of Homeland Security Paid

306
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,059
-- Meter to do this and Miter does a lot of good work.
-- Oh, absolutely. Meter

307
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,340
is a great organization.

308
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:04,806
-- 100% problem
-- is this was built 20 years ago and it hasn't significantly changed.

309
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:09,736
And again, the world has changed so fundamentally in the last 20 years, like,

310
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,125
like literally the first

311
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:15,205
way that CV S were done is they were initially assigned as a candidate number

312
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,195
and then the entire board

313
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:22,645
would vote on each candidate whether or not to make it a proper CV E.

314
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:26,825
Now, that will absolutely work if you have about 10 to 20 vulnerabilities a year.

315
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:27,486
Right.

316
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:31,296
-- Well, now we have about 10 to 20 vulnerabilities an hour.
-- Do we?

317
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:34,471
-- Actually, I mean, so this is, this is part of the story, is
-- my,

318
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,831
my back of the envelope calculations for English written software are

319
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,971
1 to 10 million cvs a year for stuff that matters.

320
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:44,952
Oh You mean you mean that should be because right now there's 16,000 divided by,

321
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,271
let's say 365 is,

322
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:49,622
-- yeah,
-- it's, it's a comically low number 40

323
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,312
three C vs a day.

324
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,731
Yeah, but still too much for people to vote on. Oh, no.

325
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:57,611
Right. And this comes back to that whole trust thing. Why is VA CV?

326
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:00,091
Well, part of what the board did is said, look, you know,

327
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,351
if the vendor says there's a CV in their product,

328
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,190
we're going to trust them because

329
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,750
who else knows this better?

330
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,109
So what happens when a vendor decides it's not a security issue? But

331
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,700
I was gonna say that's the flip side of this is conversely

332
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,750
if a vendor says it's not a CV in their product,

333
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,229
unless you can really somehow prove.

334
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,179
Uh and there is an appeals process that ultimately ends up with MI

335
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,270
R as the sort of Supreme Court of CV, where you can argue for and against a CV.

336
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,989
But ultimately, unless you can really prove it's a CV, like,

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,510
I guess you would have exploit code or something.

338
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,510
The, the vendor basically gets to say no.

339
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,140
And that's a big problem now is because the majority of,

340
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,030
of CV numbering authorities that are vendors

341
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:41,539
realized by being AC N A, they get to control the message.

342
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,099
Yeah. Yeah, 100%

343
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,919
they get to control the supply of CV. S. For example, the vast majority of them

344
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,219
no longer assign a CV for internally found issues, they just fix them.

345
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:54,080
Microsoft has done that forever and I don't, I don't, I don't agree with it at all.

346
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,580
Microsoft oracle. All

347
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,729
them HP has gone so far as to say,

348
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:00,750
essentially this product contains a forced like auto updater.

349
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,030
So there's nothing actionable from a CV perspective.

350
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,000
So there's never going to be a CV for this product.

351
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,830
-- Again,
-- it's worth pointing out that D

352
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,669
WF won't fix that problem because if,

353
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,229
if only HP knows about it and they don't want to sign a CV,

354
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,820
like there's just no way for anyone to even know,

355
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:20,369
but there is a lot of stuff that comes out in public later after the fact and it is sure

356
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,539
useful to give that stuff.

357
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:23,799
CVS because here's the thing that really makes me

358
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,299
angry is one of the cornerstones of CV is

359
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,669
that we want to provide an actionable data feed

360
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,809
so that you can do something about your vulnerabilities.

361
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,840
Yeah, that's the big one for me.

362
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,260
People keep forgetting that one of the things you can do

363
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,119
is to stop using it and replace it full stop.

364
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,150
Like I'm going to call out Google here.

365
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,239
I'm a Google based kind of guy, both personally and professionally.

366
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,330
I no longer fully trust Google, to be honest, not to kill off Google works suite.

367
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,700
I know

368
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,119
like I, I literally look at it and I'm like,

369
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,219
they probably won't.

370
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:59,200
-- But
-- Google's core competencies are selling ads and killing products.

371
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,130
-- Like
-- that's exactly.

372
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,359
And so I literally am at the point where I,

373
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:05,119
I'm making plans to transition to office 365.

374
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,309
Like, and I am a diehard Linux sell it. And it's like anyways,

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,739
it's just, it's,

376
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,820
the world has changed in 20 years so fundamentally and it continues to change.

377
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,260
And that's the other big problem is it's I, I tried to drag CV forwards,

378
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,559
kicking and screaming, made a bit of progress.

379
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,630
But there's been like,

380
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,809
if you look at the CV list repo and the workflow and everything,

381
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,080
it hasn't changed since day one.

382
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:28,640
And

383
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,520
-- you know, here's the way I like to describe
-- this.

384
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,919
It's, it's essentially, it's a legacy system at this point.

385
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,109
It's completely legacy. I mean, imagine you're in a boat

386
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,479
and you're paddling,

387
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,570
let's say one kilometer an hour

388
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:42,760
upstream.

389
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,559
But if the river is flowing three kilometers per hour downstream,

390
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,520
you're not going forwards.

391
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,090
Yeah, basically we're doing DWF, we're giving out CV identifiers

392
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,830
and most importantly, we're actually doing it

393
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:58,289
in the open. You can file issues against us, you can,

394
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:03,369
-- and you will get a response from us. You can
-- come, help, come, help, don't file issues

395
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,300
and, and chances are

396
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,329
Josh and I will argue with each other.

397
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,180
-- We, we argue with each other nonstop and we'll
-- do it in public quite

398
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,500
happily.

399
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,729
It's going to be marvelous.

400
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:17,358
-- I'll
-- be blunt, me and Josh, we're not as bad as the legacy CV system,

401
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:21,770
but we do have our biases coming from, people come from, you know, the vendor side.

402
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,969
And so that's another big aspect of this is we want other men

403
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,195
of the community involved so that we don't end up

404
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,656
with cameras that don't see anybody who's not pearly white.

405
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,306
-- Right.
-- Right. There's, there's so much room to grow here.

406
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,036
Like one of my,

407
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,786
one of my favorite examples and you and I have

408
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,456
talked about this in public more than once is Mia

409
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,015
refuses to assign CVE

410
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:41,536
I

411
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:45,145
to documentation where let's say you have example code in

412
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:48,086
a in a in docs and the example code,

413
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:52,635
not even example official do this to make the product work code, right?

414
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:53,875
Or configuration, right?

415
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:57,401
Like copy and paste this and then it'll connect to our database

416
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,391
and do queries except it's got a SQL injection bug in it,

417
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:00,592
right?

418
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:04,982
Like what the heck? That's ridiculous. I mean that totally needs

419
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:09,381
some sort of identifier so people can recognize, don't do this, you know.

420
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,501
Well, and again, back to the action, ability point part of this too.

421
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,741
Part of that action is educating people 100%. Yes. Right.

422
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:19,822
Not just, and I don't mean just kind of a loosey goosey like, oh,

423
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,161
we'll teach everybody about SQL injections.

424
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:27,098
But for example, this specific book has a flaw but, and here's the workaround,

425
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:27,968
-- that's part
-- of it.

426
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:30,907
-- Absolutely
-- right. It's raising that awareness of these issues.

427
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:35,047
There's another super important point related to this that I want to talk about.

428
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,287
And I will put

429
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,767
a graph

430
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,647
in the show notes.

431
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,958
If you graph the number of CVE I that have

432
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,807
been released there is we have clearly hit a plateau.

433
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,988
And my suspicion is this is just as many

434
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:51,828
as meter can do using their artisanal legacy internals.

435
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:55,614
It's actually worse than that because the plateau also reflects

436
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:59,193
the CV numbering authorities and there's essentially on boarding CV,

437
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:02,313
numbering authorities is horrendously slow and complicated to the

438
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,624
point of there's barely 200 of them right now.

439
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:08,573
So I actually just got an email earlier today at the time of recording.

440
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:13,073
-- I think it's 156.
-- Oh jeez. OK. I thought it had gone higher, but apparently not.

441
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:13,793
And then

442
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,713
the other challenge is again,

443
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:20,553
many of these CV numbering authorities are incentivized against assigning CVS

444
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,874
unless it's like a truly a public issue which again,

445
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:24,104
we can't really fix that.

446
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,949
Well, we can fix that because we are fixing it. It's called DWF.

447
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,910
And we're giving the power to the community.

448
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,900
We can't fix the incentive structure for these companies.

449
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,859
Well, we don't have to.

450
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,859
-- Well, exactly, that's the beauty of
-- this. We can make it better.

451
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,959
And part of my hope is to normalize cvs because people

452
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,810
still have this thing where CVS are bad and it's like,

453
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:45,550
no, these are good.

454
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,959
these are public health warnings.

455
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:47,510
These are,

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,359
but they're mature enough to have slapped a yellow warning label that saying, look,

457
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,739
if you open this up and stick your hand

458
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,650
in the electricity in here will kill you slowly,

459
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,150
it will hurt.

460
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,099
-- Right?
-- And it's, it's a sort of situation. Zero, CVS and 1000

461
00:19:59,202 --> 00:19:59,521
CV

462
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,411
are the same problem.

463
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:04,781
And here's the thing, if we actually had good CV data,

464
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,291
we could track the velocity of them.

465
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:09,452
I want the vendor that has a million cvs that are all fixed in 12 hours.

466
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:10,222
That's true too.

467
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:13,661
And that's not, I mean, that's something that's difficult to track as well.

468
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,062
-- No,
-- it's

469
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,802
not because if it's in a public repo and they update it.

470
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:20,141
-- Well, no,
-- it is today we're fixing it. Yeah,

471
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,432
exactly.

472
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,302
And so

473
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:22,862
like,

474
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,682
I know what the numbers were sort of internally

475
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,852
at Red Hat for fixing CVS and getting them

476
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:27,494
door.

477
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:28,843
They were actually pretty good.

478
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,404
Red Hat does a great job and Red Hat publishes all of this data.

479
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,904
They put out like a CV report every year. It's awesome.

480
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:37,484
The Bugzilla entries go public and you can look at, ok, this

481
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,063
bil entry was created on, you know,

482
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:42,093
day one and by day three people were like running

483
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,203
around screaming with their pants on fire and then,

484
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:48,264
you know, day seven or eight or 12 or whatever, you know, that the packages,

485
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,443
the Red Hat security advisory went out.

486
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,043
-- Yeah.
-- Which is, which is amazing.

487
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,504
And that's, this is the beauty

488
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,345
when you have to work in public.

489
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,816
When you know you're working in public, it changes the way you work and it makes you,

490
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,676
I think, pay more attention to certain details.

491
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:05,786
You can just sweep under the rug when it's

492
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:08,326
-- all hidden behind a curtain and
-- even better.

493
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,145
One of my hopes is there's a lot of security flaws that just aren't that

494
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,965
important and if they take six months or a year for the developer to fix.

495
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:17,776
-- Yeah. Fine. Who
-- cares? I agree. And you know, what else is driving me nuts right now?

496
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:22,385
Is there's like sneak is one of the, I think worst offenders for this sneak will find

497
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:26,907
bunch of issues. Some are bad. Some aren't like if they vary in quality greatly, but

498
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:30,437
they don't get cve ids, they just have these sneak ids.

499
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:34,137
And then I've got, so I basically, I get a report from Sneak.

500
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:37,508
That's like, oh, your program is vulnerable to these dependencies.

501
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:39,748
And I'm like, oh, crap. Like, what does this even mean?

502
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,947
And then you've got to go track them down and then

503
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,078
look at their website and you know what I mean?

504
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:46,758
It's just so much more convenient when there's one

505
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:49,078
source of stuff I have to go look at,

506
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,067
it's so nice

507
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,729
and I think that's a second problem that might

508
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,829
hopefully get solved when I worked for eyesight.

509
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,479
And I defense,

510
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:58,949
I remember we had a couple of customers that said your data is wrong and we're like,

511
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,959
huh, what do you mean wrong?

512
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,280
And they're like, it doesn't all have CVS and we're like, yeah, no, it doesn't

513
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,119
because you know, we cover 800 vendors and they're back in the day, there's like 60

514
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,770
CNAs. So

515
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,900
do the math. One number is bigger than the other.

516
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:17,109
And these customers literally wanted every single vulnerability to have a CV.

517
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,280
For the simple reason that the same reason every database admin in the US

518
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,920
expects everybody to have a social insurance

519
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,849
number because I need that primary key.

520
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,219
-- Yeah. Yeah, sorry social security number in the US,
-- right?

521
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:28,069
And,

522
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:28,849
and

523
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,530
it it makes it easier. Now here's another example that that really drove me nuts.

524
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,729
So sneak released a they

525
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,959
they released a CV E and the description was wrong. They had the version range wrong.

526
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,380
So obviously some customer of mine was like, oh,

527
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,099
you're vulnerable to this horrible issue.

528
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:45,800
And I'm like, no, I'm not because we're fixed like,

529
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,650
oh but the description says this and I'm like the description is wrong.

530
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,699
And so I remember I sent a note to Miter and it was like, hey,

531
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:52,739
this description is wrong.

532
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,489
It should be this.

533
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,900
And they replied to me with, oh sneak owns that you have to go talk to them.

534
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,859
And I was like, no effing way.

535
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,020
Like I've already done more work than I should have to hear.

536
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,579
Like screw all of you people.

537
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:08,180
-- And the reality is now, I could just submit a pull request and it'll be fixed,
-- but no,

538
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:08,900
even better.

539
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,540
Now. There's a place to have that conversation that too. Yes. Right.

540
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,484
And see, that's the biggest thing that really frustrates about the CV,

541
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:19,305
current ecosystem that this legacy ecosystem is that where

542
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,505
do I talk to these people about this?

543
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,915
Oh, go fill out the CV form? OK. And then what?

544
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:25,805
Well, I don't know, man, like, and I'm on the board and I can't even tell you,

545
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:26,444
I'm sorry.

546
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:28,204
And that's, that's a really poor answer.

547
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:31,175
So, like I said, I quit because it was just clearly not working out. Right.

548
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:35,285
And that's the biggest thing is you have to give like, where do you go

549
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:40,474
to complain or talk about or improve or to help with this nowhere. And

550
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,310
that place has to be in public and archived. It's a community.

551
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:47,729
So yeah, there will be good conversations that

552
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,839
like there's been some really good

553
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,000
email threads on the CV. Board list that are sort of archived but

554
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,170
nobody else can interact with them.

555
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,670
You can maybe read the archives, but that's it.

556
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,540
And then if you have a great idea,

557
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,420
I guess you could have emailed one of the

558
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,650
board members directly and asked them to post it.

559
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,829
Right. Which is ridiculous.

560
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,300
This is artisanal legacy handcrafted process from, you know, 20 some years ago.

561
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,859
And that doesn't scale and back then it made sense. Back then.

562
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,739
It absolutely made sense. But again, we're here.

563
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,849
It's 2021 guys and girls and everybody else

564
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,010
people. Yes, it has to change because we're

565
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,510
and vulnerabilities and open source one, you know,

566
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,300
your supply chain whether you like it or not now is at least a couple 100 things,

567
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,760
if not a couple 1000 things.

568
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,469
And,

569
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,349
and the thing that's driving me nuts is now there's

570
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,239
all these scanners and they all have their own freaking ids

571
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:42,839
and you know what, you know what really just burns me is when I find like, OK,

572
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,140
so this company has this ID and it has a CV and it has a github

573
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,750
ID. You know what I mean? Like I have, I have

574
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:53,089
trees in my internal elastic data set which will go public someday,

575
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,739
mind you because I believe that's important.

576
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,410
But like it's got like six identifiers in

577
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,250
it cause they're all the freaking same thing

578
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,359
and it took me probably an hour to put that together and it's like Oh,

579
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,770
this is ridiculous.

580
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,479
It's infuriating to me.

581
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:10,160
-- Currently,
-- CVS are, have to be perfect handcrafted artisanal entries because,

582
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,420
-- except
-- they're not,

583
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,160
well,

584
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,469
they have to be because they had no database. They had no mechanism to push them up.

585
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:17,079
CV.

586
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,130
Yeah, that's true too.

587
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,489
Back in the day CV S were published and done, they were never updated.

588
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,099
It was very, when they were updated,

589
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:27,989
everybody ignored the updates because there was no process to, to, to notify them.

590
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,619
Like we literally, I built a script that downloaded the CS V file D it

591
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,119
and, and then mangled the diff a bit to turn it into something human usable.

592
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,760
There was no tooling around this. There were no scanners, I mean, whatever.

593
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,910
And for example, by putting it in git

594
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,589
and using git properly, it's trivial to see. Oh, these, these files got updated.

595
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,180
-- I care about these files. All right. All right.
-- So we are nearing the end of our time.

596
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:56,939
And so I want to end this by just explaining what will happen

597
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,579
if you go to. I want

598
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:03,050
ad.org today because it's not completely,

599
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,300
we're working on the web page is hideous if you have any web design skill.

600
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,979
Like please please help us. I am begging you. I did all of the web design

601
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,489
and as you will see, I think calling me a web designer would be

602
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,709
-- a incorrect statement.
-- Honestly, you did a better job than many.

603
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:19,339
Would you at least move the tool tips out of the way. Thank God for that.

604
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,969
And I did move the tool tips.

605
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,280
So anyway, you go to, I

606
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,479
want

607
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:23,719
cve.org

608
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
and it's going to make you log in with

609
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:26,670
a github

610
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,670
id. This is a nonnegotiable step.

611
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,750
And the reason being we need to attach a request to

612
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,209
some entity,

613
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:38,709
right? We don't want people like spamming the system. Obviously, if you get a github

614
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:43,310
ID, that is a certain bar you have raised up to

615
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,040
that we feel like is acceptable for identifying humans.

616
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,060
You log in, then you go to the form and it's got some things to fill out.

617
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,739
And this is very free text today.

618
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,355
We're going to make this easier where if you start typing in company name,

619
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,975
it doesn't like try to prefill in or guess what you're doing like it

620
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:02,776
is very dumb today and I'm sorry for that and whatever it is,

621
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,776
this is how this is how communities start though is we don't,

622
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:07,056
we don't start with perfect.

623
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,656
We start with something functional.

624
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:13,296
And so this is very much a if you, if you can help us, please do, we want help.

625
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:16,156
This is not Josh and Kurt, this is a community, right?

626
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,015
So you fill this out,

627
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:21,336
you hit submit and what's going to happen then is it's going to open a bug

628
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,365
in a github

629
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,095
repo

630
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:24,696
and it's going to send you there

631
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:27,052
and it's opened by the DWF bot

632
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:31,161
in that repo. Then you'll see, there's all of your data

633
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:35,602
and the DWF bot will, then it runs about every 10 seconds. Give or take.

634
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,671
It's, you know, computer magic. It's going to look for all the brand new issues.

635
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:44,871
It's going to commit the data into the DWF list repo, but here's where it gets,

636
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:50,602
here's the stage we need to discuss a lot more is if you are on the allow list,

637
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,911
you get a CV E immediately. If you're not,

638
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,680
you're going to get a candidate ID.

639
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,699
And the purpose of this is we don't

640
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,319
want people like submitting trash or submitting tests.

641
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,760
Well, and also to put it bluntly submitting A CV the first time,

642
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,660
like almost doing anything the first time,

643
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,489
you're probably going to make a mistake for the first time.

644
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,900
And then,

645
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:11,949
well, we'll help you out and, you know,

646
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,260
gently and show you what's wrong with it or what

647
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,099
needs to be updated and then you'll be like,

648
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,500
-- oh duh, ok, I get
-- it right.

649
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,520
And if you're competent, we're going to add you to the allow list.

650
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,229
Like that's the plan

651
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,119
then then, so what happens now, let's say you have a candidate,

652
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,160
someone on the allow list which is just curt and myself as of this moment,

653
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,910
someone on the allow list will look at what you've done

654
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:36,199
and then they just add the assigned or the, what's the label called?

655
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,530
Accepted approval?

656
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:39,244
You prove this man. I know it's been,

657
00:28:39,494 --> 00:28:40,135
you know,

658
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,444
I know, I know or professionals I

659
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,295
approved the approved label, right?

660
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:48,744
It's literally I so far most of the tooling I think is my fault.

661
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:50,395
So blame me for how terrible it is.

662
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:53,635
But anyway, at the approved label, the bot sees it, it says great.

663
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:58,114
-- It's a CV E and it bumps it over to CV E and like
-- that's it. And more importantly though

664
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:01,074
by submitting CVS that get approved,

665
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:04,055
-- basically that gets you on the approved list
-- probably.

666
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:04,885
Well, it doesn't automatic

667
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,689
-- but I think no, no,
-- not automatically.

668
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,709
But essentially if you do three or four good CVS

669
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,479
OK,

670
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,510
-- we're
-- going to trust you because we don't want, we don't want to do any more work.

671
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,430
You get to help in long term.

672
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,670
Once we have a nice corpus of data,

673
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,699
we will just automate the crap out of all of this because

674
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,069
in theory, it's going to be pretty easy to look at the data.

675
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,310
I had already done that with my spreadsheet. It was very simple.

676
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,189
I would scan the spreadsheet and if it was like missing entries, well, OK,

677
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,170
that you know, you need to put a version number here.

678
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:36,844
So the beauty of it is the web form makes you fill it in now.

679
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:37,125
Yes,

680
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:42,925
I know you can cheat and use like weird little html magic in the just fill in garbage,

681
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:43,805
right? Whatever.

682
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:48,104
But in theory, assuming you're like doing this honestly, the web form would be like,

683
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,824
hey, you forgot a field, fill it in,

684
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:50,525
which is,

685
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,724
-- that's great
-- because the number of people I've met

686
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:56,555
that can actually properly request a CV with about,

687
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:59,545
I don't know, maybe 4 to 5 minutes of instruction

688
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,869
is essentially everybody that can find a security flaw.

689
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,160
Like literally the Venn diagram of people who can find a security

690
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,160
flaw and people who can request a CV is essentially a circle.

691
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,709
Like it's a, it's a single overlapping circle.

692
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,270
And that's part of the challenge with the Legacy CV process is cool.

693
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,689
You found a security vulnerability like good luck.

694
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:23,300
Like it's to the point where it's so difficult and frustrating that I hate to say it,

695
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,989
-- but the majority of people I've met have given up on it and I
-- don't blame them at all.

696
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,380
-- I think it's, it's
-- atrocious.

697
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:28,689
Well,

698
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:30,739
and part of the goal here is to grow the community

699
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,359
-- because right now there is no CV E
-- community is now.

700
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,849
So we're going, it's time, it's time to go.

701
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:40,270
We've, I know we could talk about this for like hours and hours,

702
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,650
but I won't subject anyone else to this.

703
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,819
So here is

704
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:46,219
the call to action at the end there is go to, I want

705
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,810
a CV e.org

706
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:53,060
and that has, that can get you to the DWF project on github.

707
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,819
Please let us know what you think.

708
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:59,959
There are public repos, we open issues have discussions.

709
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,060
This is,

710
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:03,839
this is something Kurt and I hope will

711
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,599
leave us at some point and take on a life of its own because I think this

712
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:10,170
is a super important problem and it is

713
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,390
something that is holding back the entire industry.

714
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,199
And so I, I have no doubt this could turn into

715
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:21,479
something amazing, but only if the community makes it amazing.

716
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,060
Yeah, I just,

717
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:25,819
I look forward to this being so much more efficient and painless because

718
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,839
the number of people I've met that have written off CV

719
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,410
-- is essentially all
-- of them. It's a lot. Yeah,

720
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,290
except what, 100 and 56 companies.

721
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,680
