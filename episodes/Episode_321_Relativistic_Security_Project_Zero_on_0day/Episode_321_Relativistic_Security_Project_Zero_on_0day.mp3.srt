Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,800
and my partner trying to figure out what the hell's going on. Josh

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,420
Reser.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:12,840
I,

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,510
no, I gave up trying to understand what's going on a very long time ago.

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,290
I, I think for me, it's,

6
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:23,200
I've actually become much more selective of what I'm trying to figure out.

7
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:24,950
I think that's fair actually.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,920
-- Yeah.
-- And I think part of that is that that comes with age

9
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:29,920
because not only do I have the potential to

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,240
understand what actually going on in certain situations,

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,979
but I actually understand now for myself,

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,669
understanding which ones are valuable and which ones are not valuable. Like

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,770
I was actually just going to write an article about SB

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,740
and Se Linux and maybe having like some sort of manifesting of

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,479
like this library touches these files and listens to these parts.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,139
And I realized

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,819
no,

18
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,430
that that's why we did containers, right?

19
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,659
We just shove a single privileged level into a container

20
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,389
and if we need a different privileged level,

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,259
use a different container and talk over the network basically,

22
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,529
right? And so I'm going to write that article

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,529
and basically say this is why

24
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:05,650
a, my idea is bad and b why my idea, even if it was good would never work.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,550
And based on the fact that here we are, I'm right.

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,510
Well, and that feels like it falls in line with the cloud security alliances,

27
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,849
kind of pushed towards, you know, 00 trust.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,970
And I mean, zero trust is fundamentally just heavy resource,

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,730
uh

30
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,410
what not, not exclusion.

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,260
Um What do you

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,150
think that

33
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,459
I'm going to correct you? I think you're actually thinking of SDP software

34
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:31,440
perimeter, which is a subset of zero trust,

35
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,349
which is zero trust is the overall idea. And SDP is one way to get there.

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,639
-- OK? I accept
-- that

37
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,430
it also ties into SDP and ZT AC

38
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:41,769
T A

39
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,080
-- zero
-- trust and I forget what the A stands for.

40
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,879
Sweet.

41
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,519
I'm glad that's recorded

42
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:48,220
to

43
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:48,849
Alpha.

44
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,360
Nope.

45
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:50,389
Oh,

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,069
here we go. Here we go. Oh

47
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,290
sweet zero trust architecture.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,629
It's one of those like systems or,

49
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,220
you know, it's a useless word.

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,129
Might as well be Z TT zero trust.

51
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:06,459
-- Anyway,
-- before we, before we start accidentally talking about zero trust,

52
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,389
we're here to talk about zero day, which is

53
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,259
maybe more exciting. I don't know.

54
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,710
So I remember when zero days were, you know,

55
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,309
two or three times a year massive thing.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,725
And now it's like, well, what does this report say?

57
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:19,035
I

58
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:24,395
want to clarify before we start? So, Kurt and I are going to say zero day a lot.

59
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:27,964
And some people call this O day. I feel like it's an age divide.

60
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:32,335
I feel like the young hip kids call it O day and us old fogies call it zero day.

61
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:37,404
So if you prefer O day, just think O day, every time we say zero day.

62
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,820
So there you go,

63
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,860
Josh. And I are. In fact old.

64
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,820
Did you see that Twitter thing? What's like was the first Linux you used ubuntu?

65
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,509
And I'm like,

66
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:47,339
no

67
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,240
Ubuntu didn't exist

68
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,899
actually. What was the first Linux? I used, technically it was Red Hat Linux,

69
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:57,699
but I, a friend installed it. I didn't like it.

70
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,550
I installed Slackware and then I used that for a very long time.

71
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:05,470
Which one? The, the, the 52 disc image Slackware, 1.1.

72
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,130
-- No, I, my first slackware came off a CD. I know that
-- because,

73
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,169
well, La di da,

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,779
I purposely, I,

75
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,949
I bought a CD drive to install slackware and then I bought

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,940
a book that had the Slackware CD in the back of it.

77
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,139
So

78
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,330
I made 52 floppy disk copies off a friend's set

79
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,229
of slackware that he downloaded because he had a 9,

80
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,610
600 odd dial up link.

81
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,360
Did I, I did install

82
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:33,550
some Linuxes off of floppy disks because I had some

83
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,960
computers in the house that didn't have CD drives,

84
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,639
but it was extremely painful and I only did

85
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,740
it a couple of times because it was terrible

86
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,279
-- floppy disks were and are terrible
-- and you needed 7 million of them.

87
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:49,309
Like, even now, I think Debian's what, like 60 C DS or something.

88
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:50,389
I mean,

89
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,600
anyway, Zero Day Google Project Zero

90
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:58,839
released a blog post that they titled

91
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,639
The More, you know, the More you don't know.

92
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,639
Well, wait, they actually spell out Project Zero.

93
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,889
What do you mean?

94
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:09,360
Spells it out as Google Project zero.blogspot.com. So, therefore,

95
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,320
Zero Day, at least according to Google, that's the way to say it

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,369
or they would have said Google Project O day,

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,488
you know what, just tweet at Kurt,

98
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,579
which is right.

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,869
That's easier. I'm not having this discussion. I literally don't care.

100
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,779
We'll run a poll. I don't care. I literally don't care.

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,510
Anyway,

102
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,190
see, this is what's wrong with security.

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,739
We obsess over these ridiculous pointless details that don't even matter at all.

104
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,899
You're even a little bit

105
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,420
but whatever. OK.

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
So they release this report, the more, you know, the more you don't know. And

107
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,600
the, the I guess the headline, the lead as,

108
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:47,260
as they would say in the industry for this report is there

109
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:51,679
is a graph of the in the wild zero days detected by year

110
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,269
and the graph kind of looks a little bit like a U from 2015 to 2020

111
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,019
then 2021 is an enormous spike,

112
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,739
more than double

113
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,690
the next highest like it is significant. And so the obvious question becomes

114
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,420
-- why
-- I suspect part of it is better detection.

115
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,839
I suspect a lot of it is

116
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:18,450
a combination honestly of actually more zero days in use,

117
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:22,350
but they're in use for a shorter period because of better detection

118
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,089
maybe.

119
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,369
-- I mean, so, ok, well,
-- because like, like citizen labs,

120
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,089
like the stuff citizen labs are doing, you know,

121
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,019
like here's the real,

122
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,850
if you monitor, let's say the top 1000 journalists globally for shenanigans,

123
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,019
you're absolutely gonna run zero days now. It's not a

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,179
like, it's like nso group and all that, you know, the

125
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,269
like the, what is it? The is it the Pegasus spyware?

126
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,089
The one that was found in potentially like the British government,

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,059
the French government,

128
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:46,679
you know,

129
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,799
like this is no longer a oh it's a movie plot threat.

130
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:54,040
It's like, no, no, somebody went out paid for that and dropped it on a government.

131
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,760
So, so Google asks these questions.

132
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:57,920
They, in fact,

133
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,700
directly beneath this graph and obviously I'll put a link

134
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,480
to this in the show notes for anyone interested.

135
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,170
They say is software getting worse? Are Attackers using more?

136
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:11,390
Zero days has our ability to detect and disclose zero days increased. And

137
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,630
I mean, that is a question. So you like, let's just start, is software getting worse?

138
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,720
I, I don't think it is. However,

139
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,809
maybe

140
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,720
I would say that

141
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,179
software in our security

142
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,029
mitigations we're building into software

143
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,510
haven't gotten drastically better in the last couple of years.

144
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,279
I think they probably spiked three or four years. Ago,

145
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,779
I would say it's not that software is getting worse.

146
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,959
It's that software is not as improving as quickly

147
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,489
as the volume and size of software is increasing.

148
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,890
So even if you do

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,500
twice as good a job on security, if you generate four times as much software,

150
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,059
you'll have twice as many vulnerabilities. And

151
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,359
I think that's where we are,

152
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:57,529
especially with things like just the size of these libraries and what these like,

153
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,260
like you look at the N PM ecosystem or

154
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,739
you look at all.

155
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,350
I just think of every Microsoft Tuesday now or every I Os and Apple update and it's

156
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,910
like how many gigabytes of stuff?

157
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh, did you see that last oracle patch? Tuesday? It was like 100 and 50 CV ES.

158
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:15,660
That's,

159
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,100
it's always been 100 and 50 CV S quarterly.

160
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,709
-- It's always 100 and 50 to 200 CV S quarterly.
-- Is

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,380
-- it always
-- that much?

162
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,899
Well, OK, that could be, I, I don't pay that close of attention.

163
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:27,690
-- It's been like that for years.
-- So anyway, no, no, I, I want,

164
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,179
I want to dwell on what you just said because

165
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,380
I think it's really important and I think it,

166
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,619
it feels like I'll call it relativistic security

167
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:41,470
where we often like to think about problems in this kind of stationary position.

168
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,890
And the reality is

169
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,700
all of the software world around us is growing, the Attackers are growing this,

170
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,730
what we're doing with it is growing like everything is growing.

171
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,109
But I think some of our security process and ideas are stagnant and

172
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:58,970
when you're in an environment that's growing and you're not growing too,

173
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,350
you're actually shrinking compared to the overall environment.

174
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,589
I mean, that's why we've had to do the global security database.

175
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,730
You know,

176
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:09,320
a perfect example if you go to the common weaknesses and exposures database,

177
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,109
which is essentially a list of software and hard now also hardware

178
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,579
in the last year or two of like flaws like buffer overflow,

179
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:16,320
buffer underflow,

180
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,329
there's basically zero representation for Blockchain and smart contracts.

181
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,070
Now you go to R

182
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,190
dot News and look at their leader board

183
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,920
and there's at least a couple times a month, you know,

184
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,119
a $100 million plus hack

185
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,150
like and the, and the fun part is most of these vulnerabilities are,

186
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,000
are sort of quasi known but just not well known in the,

187
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,750
in the Blockchain world or the smart contract world.

188
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,969
So they get to

189
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,049
make all these mistakes again

190
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,719
except here they matter because like $611 million goes missing.

191
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,979
Yes. Yes. OK. So anyway, I don't want to dwell on this point. I think

192
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,969
I'm happy to say that the state of security is

193
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,479
it's very relative and I think we're not

194
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,640
expanding our mitigation technologies fast enough.

195
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,039
And I'm skeptical many people would disagree with that.

196
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,200
It's not just the mitigations, but it's the, the actual response.

197
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,919
It doesn't matter. Well, No, no, it does matter.

198
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,760
Because if you have twice as much stuff, basically, your,

199
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,640
your cattle herd got twice as big

200
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,890
-- and you're still phoning the vet to come by once a month.
-- Are,

201
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,109
are you suggesting though that like you mentioned something about monthly?

202
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,466
Are you saying that like monthly, patching is

203
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:26,866
insufficient in this universe or are you suggesting something else?

204
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:31,486
I am saying that patching is now like having a roof on your house.

205
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:35,986
It's, it's just something you have to do as a bare minimum to keep the rain off.

206
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:39,385
-- I don't think that's controversial.
-- Like basically if you can't patch,

207
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,625
if you can't patch, you probably don't have inventory management.

208
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,166
And if you don't have inventory management,

209
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:46,185
how can you possibly secure all this stuff?

210
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:48,226
So to me, patching is now like brushing your teeth

211
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:51,791
daily. It's the bare minimum. Not. Oh, good. You patched.

212
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:52,572
Ok.

213
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,091
Yeah, this is III I don't think anyone's going to disagree.

214
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,692
I want to move on to the meat of this discussion because I don't think this is.

215
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,661
So

216
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,302
there's the question are Attackers using more zero

217
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,192
day exploits and I have a suspicion.

218
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,442
The answer is yes.

219
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,012
Well, and there's a simple metric for this, the value of them,

220
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,081
what people pay for them.

221
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,812
That's exactly what I was gonna say. There, there's a book by

222
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:12,072
Nico Nicole Plot.

223
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,531
This is how they tell me the world will end.

224
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,059
I, I know I talked about this at length and I, I gush over this book all the time,

225
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,159
but it really is that good.

226
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,760
And if you haven't read it, you should read it

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,919
because it goes in depth

228
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:26,030
on this whole, like exploit black market.

229
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,479
And it's fascinating and terrifying.

230
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:28,750
Well,

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,840
-- I
-- like when I worked at eyesight partners and

232
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:33,309
we were the first company to start buying exploits.

233
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,000
And it's funny because we bought the exploits and

234
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,130
immediately went to the vendors and told them because,

235
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,320
like, we, we didn't want to sit on them. We weren't like the NSO group making spyware.

236
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,280
We just wanted to get stuff fixed,

237
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,059
but by buying them and telling our

238
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,789
customers first and hopefully there's a mitigation,

239
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,590
you know, our customers love us and pay us more money

240
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,669
-- and, and that is covered in depth in this book at the beginning
-- of it.

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,510
And like

242
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:57,400
that is a very good metric of what does the market price this exploit at

243
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,580
is like, what is the value

244
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,880
and not only are exploits worth a lot more money now,

245
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,469
but,

246
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,349
well, like, as we've seen, you know,

247
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,989
the NSO group is churning them out at a pretty quick rate.

248
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,989
Well, no, they're not churning them out. They're buying them at a pretty quick rate.

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,020
Well, yeah, that's what I mean, like, they're, they're,

250
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,369
they're going from like a guy found or a person found an exploit to,

251
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,469
it's actually being used to compromise journalists, phones and governments.

252
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,739
Yeah. Right. They weaponized it

253
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,140
-- to an amazing degree.
-- Well, not just weaponized it but they deployed it.

254
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,099
They took the risk of attacking the government.

255
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,179
Right. Like you and I would never do that because we're not,

256
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,979
it's just, that's too risky. It's insane. Right. And what would the benefit be?

257
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,820
I would end up in the river

258
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,979
and I don't mean swimming in the river.

259
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,090
Yeah.

260
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,630
So

261
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:48,729
again, I don't think this is a controversial point in any way, which of course,

262
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,330
I think adds to this number to a degree.

263
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:52,989
But

264
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:56,549
the thing Google calls out in this report and the thing that

265
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,900
I also suspect is true is that we are getting better at detecting

266
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,859
many of these zero days. And I think there's a variety of reasons for this.

267
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,580
And now the one thing, the 11 of the

268
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,929
most interesting things they call out in here is

269
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,539
they mentioned the vendors who self identified the zero days

270
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,859
and there were only two on their list, Microsoft and Google.

271
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,020
And this does not surprise me in any way because both of those companies have

272
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,549
security teams bigger than the total employee count

273
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,489
at most other companies on the planet.

274
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,919
Well, I would, I would like to think Apple is doing this but Apple of course,

275
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,880
is always doing the soft shoe a um what is it?

276
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,340
They'll credit it to an anonymous researcher and say,

277
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,659
quote, Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,

278
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:46,219
period.

279
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:46,820
End quote.

280
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,520
Right. They're super

281
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:51,630
-- weird about this.
-- They're waffly. But

282
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,719
I, I think a big part of it too is, is as we get other mitigations

283
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,780
and as more importantly,

284
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,090
like I said, if you monitor to the top 1000 journalists globally,

285
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,580
there's 100% chance one of them, uh,

286
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,330
probably more than one of them is going to be

287
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,510
attacked using a zero day in the next year.

288
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,200
-- Yeah. Oh, the next month, I bet.
-- Well, it's just now we know where to go hunting.

289
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,280
And what really blows my mind is I'm looking at these Apple advisors for last month.

290
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,750
There's about five of them that have this, you know, waffle talk about zero days

291
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,760
and there's the usual suspects. Ok. There's like, you know, the I OS 15.41

292
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,109
running on iphones and ipads. Ok. People attack that.

293
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,559
I get that and there's one for, I watch,

294
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,669
like, watch Os.

295
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,380
So people are actually attacking pe, yeah, I know. Right. Watch Os 8.1

296
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,799
released October 25th, 2021. Yeah, like, but I guess people wear watches,

297
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,530
I mean, yeah, they're every, they're everywhere now.

298
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:47,200
I mean, and not only that, it's not just that they're everywhere,

299
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,619
everyone has them everywhere they go.

300
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,280
Like an easy example is so my son has an Apple watch and he uses it for exercise.

301
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,640
Tracking primarily is his, his goal in having it.

302
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:57,830
And so,

303
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:58,309
like,

304
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,190
he'll leave his phone at home and just go out with his

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,719
watch because it can do what the magic it needs to do.

306
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:06,000
And so, even though if you were just watching his phone, you'd see it at home.

307
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,909
But if you're watching the watch now

308
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,330
-- you've got, you've got some details, you know,
-- and it's got a microphone,

309
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:12,909
like the watch has a microphone.

310
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,169
It could be recording it and I don't know how much storage is on the watch,

311
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,770
but I assume enough to record a low bit rate MP3 for a couple of weeks.

312
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,369
Yeah, probably.

313
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,239
I know he can store over an hour's worth of music on it because the thing also you

314
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,169
can like upload your music just to the watch

315
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,270
and then stream the watch to your Bluetooth headphones.

316
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
It's like this is,

317
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,760
-- it, it's wizardry, it's
-- a computer,

318
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,500
-- it's a
-- computer. I mean, you can even get one with the cell phone chips that built in.

319
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,929
-- It's
-- a better computer than I probably had 20 years ago.

320
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,489
-- Like the screen
-- is far better. I love the screen on this thing.

321
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,049
-- So,
-- so the next really interesting data point that's in here

322
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:48,140
is

323
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:55,409
of the 58 0 days, 39 67% for, for people who aren't good at math like me

324
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,799
were memory corruption vulnerabilities.

325
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,049
And it was 17 years after free six out of bounds,

326
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,260
read and write four buffer overflows, four integer overflows.

327
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,390
And this is one of those things like

328
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,049
we have been

329
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,640
and by we, I mean, like, the security industry has been harping about memory safety

330
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,330
as long as I can remember and we clearly have not solved it and

331
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,900
I know we've done some amazing things to make it harder to exploit this,

332
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,570
but it clearly isn't enough.

333
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,830
Well, the problem is fundamentally if you're using C or C++ or whatever,

334
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,960
if you're using a not memory safe language,

335
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,590
then there is 100% chance you have a memory corruption bug in your throat.

336
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,429
Yeah, probably more than one

337
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,640
like and it's, and, and that's it. That that's my TED talk. Thank you for coming.

338
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:40,059
And even if you use a memory safe language like Python or Rust or, or pearl,

339
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,770
the underlying platform has flaws sometimes, right?

340
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,359
Like Python has had memory corruption bugs. So as per

341
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,890
you know us now, but the beauty here is

342
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,909
I can fix Python

343
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,409
and boom. I fixed it for everybody using Python who upgrades.

344
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,530
Whereas if you're looking at specific applications,

345
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,429
well, now you need to patch like a billion specific applications,

346
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:01,549
you know.

347
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,250
And so I this speaks to remember your talk about, you know, moving security,

348
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,090
the the oas pop 10 list, essentially it's all handled by

349
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,419
sort of three or four classes of issues that are handled by

350
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,809
frameworks and just use a framework to fix all of them.

351
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,880
And I mean, this is even true of memory safety.

352
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:20,315
I think like a lot of web browsers, for example, are still written in C++ and

353
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:21,255
C++.

354
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,385
Obviously, we're seeing it,

355
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,054
it's notorious for having memory corruption issues

356
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,575
and this is where there's things like rust

357
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:29,744
that don't suffer from these problems.

358
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,625
And in fact, there's,

359
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:35,215
I think I'm seeing more and more efforts in the wild where organizations

360
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,929
are trying

361
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,619
to move things over to rust. Of course, this is going to take time,

362
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,739
but I have a strong suspicion.

363
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,859
It's, it's the only way forward is we can't, humans can't manage the memory.

364
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,969
It's just it, it can't be done. There's,

365
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,219
we've tried it for 50 years, it hasn't worked.

366
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,909
But what's interesting is you can't rewrite all the code.

367
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,440
But what you can do, for example,

368
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,409
like the Linux kernel is a great example of if we could do device drivers in rust.

369
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,330
Well, device drivers are a lot of the attack surface.

370
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,589
You know, file systems are a lot of the attack surface.

371
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,199
That's the stuff Attackers can talk too easily.

372
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,848
And if you can secure that,

373
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,579
then you don't have to rewrite the whole kernel and

374
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,098
Rust just kind of the bits that Attackers talk to.

375
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,598
And same thing with web browsers,

376
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,890
you just brought up a really interesting point is there's

377
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,608
an effort going on right now.

378
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,949
It's part of the open SSF it's not like widely distributed at the moment.

379
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,939
It, it may be more widely after this episode goes out. I don't remember for sure. But

380
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,219
the point is

381
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:33,759
they're, they're starting to look at like, what can we maybe rewrite and Rust?

382
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:37,718
And they're taking a very pragmatic approach of saying things like these

383
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:41,318
are the libraries we're seeing are being attacked on a regular basis

384
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,529
that are written in c what if we start with some of

385
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:47,558
these and rewrite them in Rust like the portion of them?

386
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,409
Because one of the, the, the reason Rust is obsessed over by,

387
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:53,048
by security nerds just for everyone listening who might not know

388
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:59,319
is it's trivial to write code and Rust and then call it from C and so you can

389
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,239
basically just start like replacing shared libraries with Rust

390
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,599
and you get all these benefits of memory management,

391
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,099
but it's also usable by the larger C program.

392
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:10,770
Whereas many of the other languages, while technically possible to do that,

393
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,119
it's very difficult.

394
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,199
Generally speaking,

395
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,260
well, it lets you do a gradual cut over.

396
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,079
And that's

397
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,479
like if you try and do a, a single cutover,

398
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,920
you're 100% gonna fail because you're gonna encounter at least

399
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,989
one bug that breaks something bad enough that it's unusable.

400
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,170
Whereas this, you can gradually start flipping it over.

401
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:29,979
The other thing I find fascinating is because

402
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,839
we've talked about this in smart contracts where

403
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,439
one idea for smart contract security is that you write the

404
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:37,869
smart contract in say two or three totally different languages,

405
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,520
ideally, or if it's the same language, you write it differently

406
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,030
and then you essentially have the contract vote and, you know,

407
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,790
two out of three have to agree.

408
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,380
So that way, if an attacker finds a vulnerability in one

409
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,319
in contract version A,

410
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,280
it's unlikely that that input will also trigger a vulnerability

411
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,630
in contracts B and C because they're written differently.

412
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,709
Right.

413
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,569
And so because there's some contracts out there that are only a

414
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,160
couple 100 lines of code that are handling billions of dollars.

415
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,439
Yes, absolutely.

416
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,859
And so

417
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,369
I, I suspect that will never take off.

418
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,310
It's just too much work and it's too technically sophisticated

419
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,810
and you know what's gonna happen?

420
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:14,609
Someone's just gonna write like a stupid auto converter

421
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,150
that's gonna auto convert the bugs between language.

422
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,770
You know what I mean?

423
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:18,819
Well,

424
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,189
you

425
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:20,400
know,

426
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,250
part of what they talk about is in the research they did is the more differently,

427
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,800
you write the code, the more robust it is right that the,

428
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,819
the two have nothing in common and ideally you

429
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,030
have like two different teams with two different languages

430
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,000
-- but, you know,
-- no one's going to do that. But anyway,

431
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,060
but that's not gonna happen.

432
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,109
It's just not gonna,

433
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,390
what I'm saying is this is not a realistic solution

434
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,790
outside the Blockchain world and even within the Blockchain world,

435
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,910
it's not gonna happen

436
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:42,770
anyway.

437
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:43,229
But

438
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,949
it's something where if you tell me

439
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,109
you can start replacing your C code in little Drips.

440
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,709
Oh, I, I can do that

441
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,270
and I think that's part of it is these technologies have to not just do security,

442
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,510
but they actually have to have like a deployment

443
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,260
strategy of how are we going to actually

444
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,630
like, like EV cars are a good example. EV cars are relatively simple in that.

445
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
Ok, you buy an EV car, you have to install a charge circuit in your garage. That's it.

446
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,920
There's no step three.

447
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,890
Like for example,

448
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,140
I just ran a new circuit and remembered that my electrical panels full.

449
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,050
So if I buy an EV car, I will have to buy a new electrical panel and

450
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,550
you know, get my entire electrical service upgraded.

451
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:23,890
But ok, so anyway,

452
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,760
here's

453
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:25,219
the

454
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,239
point is it's, it's, I know what the path to success is.

455
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:29,359
Ok.

456
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,979
Yes. But, but there's a big, but here

457
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,180
there has to be an economic incentive for a business to do this.

458
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,719
And I think that's one of the challenges is generally speaking,

459
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:43,699
if you look at the economic incentives of security,

460
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,250
they don't exist.

461
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,530
There is

462
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:47,010
you,

463
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,910
you could potentially make the argument that let's

464
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,829
say Google takes the android down this path and

465
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,430
they start replacing tons and tons and tons of

466
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:55,540
pieces with rust and then they can claim,

467
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,780
oh, we're more secure than I OS.

468
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,550
And that might be true.

469
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,280
And maybe that would get apple to kind of, you know, start a, a,

470
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,000
some sort of arms race in terms of who's more secure.

471
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,270
But

472
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,079
I think generally speaking,

473
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,250
the vast majority of organizations are never going

474
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,250
to find themselves in a situation like that.

475
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:13,719
Well, to put it bluntly,

476
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,239
your security has to be absolutely terrible for me to switch for security reasons.

477
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:23,739
Like I am firmly entrenched in the Apple world and Apple is inc, like

478
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,140
they're nice but abusive in some ways and,

479
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,459
but they're gonna have to be incredibly abusive for me to leave

480
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:31,260
that Apple world because I've tried the Android world and it's worse

481
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,979
-- for me and my kids. Yep.
-- Yep. Now, now on that point

482
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,780
on, on this particular,

483
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,630
I am glad I get to transition in almost a reasonable way.

484
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:45,579
One of the questions they ask is do some vendors have no known in the

485
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,469
wild Zero days because they've never been

486
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,260
found or because they don't publicly disclose.

487
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,099
And that's a really good,

488
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:57,380
I would say yes to both in that there are software vendors that are small enough,

489
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,739
nobody cares to target them.

490
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,380
But if they were targeted, it would probably take a few hours to find a zero.

491
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,310
If they're not targeted, then they don't have an in the wild Zero day.

492
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,219
But there are vendors small enough that

493
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,900
in the wild zero day, but they don't have the capabilities to know.

494
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,199
Well, every PHP library ever, every wordpress plug in ever.

495
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,810
Right. Right now. And on that note,

496
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,829
there are also going to be companies that learn about a zero day

497
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,810
and they silently fix it

498
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,959
and they never tell anyone what they found because they're

499
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:33,739
concerned about the reputational damage it would do to them.

500
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:34,619
Well,

501
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,780
the legal issues.

502
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,680
Right. They're worried about their customers suing them or, or getting all snarky.

503
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:43,680
And, I mean, we can confidently say yes, 100% because

504
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,780
we have found out after the fact, like,

505
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,599
look at the way ubiquity handled their breach.

506
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,119
Right. There's companies that have tried to cover this up.

507
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,819
And so I think it's,

508
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,380
and, and more to the point, nobody can argue with us because there's no data.

509
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,719
There's, or rather there's not a lot of data.

510
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:00,880
There's a few people who tried to cover up and got caught with their pants down.

511
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,959
But in general, by definition, if these companies do that, there's no data.

512
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,040
Well, and even if they get caught,

513
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,489
what really happens,

514
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,989
usually not much.

515
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,520
Yeah.

516
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,339
You know,

517
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm just reminded every time I watch the lock picking lawyer where he's like,

518
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,130
you know, if you want to break into something, just here's the set of, like I said,

519
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,040
he sells a set of what it's like seven or 12,

520
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,619
it's the most common keys for like everything.

521
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,219
You know, he's like, instead of, you know, just like, because there's like a what,

522
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:32,329
10 or 20% chance you'll just click, click or was it like Honda?

523
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,339
I think it was Honda. They all used for the radio frequency fobs.

524
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,040
They all use the same code.

525
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:37,739
I

526
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,339
remember something.

527
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,920
There was something weird about that that made

528
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,640
it really easy to crack the Honda radio

529
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,469
security, whatever that's called. But no, II, I think

530
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,439
it's an interesting point is there's no incentive

531
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,880
generally speaking for companies to disclose now.

532
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,949
-- Sorry,
-- Honda doesn't use a rolling code.

533
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,510
-- Uh ok.
-- Just record it and replay it. That's what

534
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,160
it was right

535
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,719
now.

536
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:03,640
We're seeing things like, for example, in the United States, the sec,

537
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,810
the Security and Exchange Commission is starting to

538
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,319
tell companies if you have a breach,

539
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:09,640
you must report it.

540
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,880
It's not an option.

541
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,439
And so like that,

542
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:16,160
I think is an interesting aspect of this because now

543
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,000
there is a cost to not reporting a breach.

544
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,160
And the, you know what, you know,

545
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,699
what the best way to not report a breach is don't get breached.

546
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:26,319
So they're, they're gonna see organizations willing to invest

547
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,569
in security,

548
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,979
not as some insane cost center, but as

549
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,699
like something you have to do.

550
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:35,699
That's part of the cost of doing business, which I guess is kind of a cost center.

551
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:36,810
But you get the idea right?

552
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,305
There's an obvious return on that investment.

553
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,655
Yeah, I mean, every sec

554
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,564
10-K filing has that mine safety report, like even Red Hat,

555
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:46,584
you know, and it just says it doesn't apply to us because we don't own a mine.

556
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:50,324
But like mine safety was bad enough that every company

557
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:53,064
to this day still has to report on mine safety

558
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:54,395
in their

559
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:55,314
10-K filings.

560
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,535
And, and I have

561
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,464
a I would be very interested to see

562
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,550
like vulnerability disclosure fall under this umbrella

563
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,560
where if you have a vulnerable,

564
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:04,849
I mean,

565
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:07,770
granted this is going to be difficult because you think about like we just

566
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,010
mentioned oracles 100 and 50 CV E like how do you report that?

567
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,229
You know,

568
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,000
the filing is gonna be a phone book

569
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,910
maybe, I mean, and maybe that's like an old

570
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:18,489
phone book, not a not a modern phone book. Those things are skinny nowadays.

571
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:19,729
But,

572
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:22,930
and, and II, I don't, I don't know the answer. Right. This is

573
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,959
we're in new territory here,

574
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:31,369
but I think we can all agree that the way things are working today is unacceptable.

575
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,410
Well, there's also a new elephant in the room

576
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,489
and I'm gonna go there. It's the whole Russia thing because

577
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,770
Russia is grumpy

578
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:39,839
and

579
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:43,400
Russia could do a lot of damage to us by say, taking down some power grids now.

580
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,130
Like it's not gonna be the end of the world, but

581
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,369
like I remember the Northeast blackout like that

582
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,170
has a significant economic cost and impact.

583
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,569
Right. Right. To the tunes of billions or tens of billions of dollars.

584
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,250
And,

585
00:25:57,819 --> 00:25:58,780
well, that's,

586
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,829
you know, we're not going to see a Cyber Pearl Harbor like we used to predict,

587
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,030
you know,

588
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,020
with like what North Korean cargo planes dropping paratroopers over the Midwest,

589
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,709
like in um,

590
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,130
you know, Wolverines. What's that damn movie called? Oh,

591
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,050
Red Dawn,

592
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:11,280
I've never seen,

593
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,969
you know, I've seen like seven movies. And does it have spaceships in it? No.

594
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,689
Does it have wizards in it? No, I haven't seen it

595
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,349
-- anyways.
-- But,

596
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,410
and that's part of the thing is like it, like, again,

597
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,020
we've gone from zero days being like, oh, yeah,

598
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,920
that's a thing that could possibly happen to,

599
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:29,160
like, you look at the crypto world and

600
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,119
sim swapping to gain access to people's accounts

601
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,770
that that happens all the time now, you know, uh people sending out fake Tresor.

602
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,709
I think it was Tresor

603
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,439
hardware Waltz with like another USB chip soldered in

604
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,770
that. That's like there are the pictures online.

605
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,339
You know, what happened is somebody breached treasure and,

606
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:52,209
-- and got their customer list and started mailing out wallets to people
-- wild man.

607
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,010
That's wild.

608
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,229
I mean, nothing surprises me, whatever it is what it is. Um

609
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,219
So anyway,

610
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,170
that's kind of the gist of this report.

611
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,089
I think we've hit on the, the things I wanted to discuss that were very interesting.

612
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:08,040
Now, I want to bring up one last point before we, we are out of time, but I don't care.

613
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,930
I bring it up anyway.

614
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,770
So the, the NSA, there's a joint report that just came out with the what CIA, the NSA,

615
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,670
the FBI,

616
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,449
a bunch of other

617
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:21,560
security agencies spread across the world. Like New Zealand's in here.

618
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,569
There's the U K's in

619
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:22,750
here.

620
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,630
Yeah. Right. Right. Can

621
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,969
Canada's in here

622
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:26,890
and

623
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:31,280
they, they just say the 2021 top routinely exploited vulnerabilities.

624
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,310
And I, I love these sort of reports,

625
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,189
not because I think it's going to necessarily change anyone's

626
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,810
behavior drastically.

627
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,719
But I think it's helping surface all of this to the top and it,

628
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,939
it makes it harder for us to ignore them.

629
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:46,250
But the,

630
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,680
the interesting part of all this and I'll link to the report in the show notes,

631
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:53,140
but nearly every one of these vulnerabilities they point out

632
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,750
have a 2021 year in the CV ID,

633
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,229
which I think is that is telling to me

634
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,959
because it means the Attackers are definitely paying

635
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,060
attention to what's going on and they're definitely

636
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,829
focusing on the newer vulnerabilities rather than some

637
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,000
of the super old crusty horrible stuff.

638
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,400
And

639
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,699
the reason I think that's important is

640
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,739
there there,

641
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,640
I think used to be this prevailing attitude

642
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,510
in the security industry where it was like,

643
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,619
oh, you've probably got some time to patch this.

644
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,329
Like, the Attackers take a couple of months to develop the exploits.

645
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,540
And I think that's probably less true than it used to be.

646
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,770
I just remember like back in eyesight and I defense we had a guy

647
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,930
who every patch Tuesday they picked what

648
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:34,520
they thought was the top vulnerability and they

649
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,589
basically put him in a room with a pizza and a couple of computers

650
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,430
and then he walked out of there 24 hours later with a proof of concept

651
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:42,780
pretty much every month.

652
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,599
Yeah. And you think

653
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,280
a decade ago,

654
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,030
you, you'd have to work for someone, like, you know, I defense

655
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,469
and they'd pay you probably well under what you're worth

656
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,770
to do this sort of work.

657
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,280
And now if you can do that,

658
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,540
you could create an exploit and then you could go to

659
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,030
one of these exploit brokers and probably make a year's pay

660
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,310
from one of them.

661
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,630
I mean,

662
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:04,510
that's,

663
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,010
that's something, you know,

664
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,359
I, I think I,

665
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,619
I keep coming back to the fact that either you're patching

666
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,349
in a reasonable time frame being days or weeks or effectively,

667
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,510
you're not patching.

668
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,380
You know, it's like people who say, oh, I'm,

669
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,719
I'm dieting and they cut their caloric intake by 10 calories like, no, you're not.

670
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,810
Don't mock me, Kurt

671
00:29:23,189 --> 00:29:25,109
anyway. Well, it's ok. Ok.

672
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,109
So here's the parting thought I have on that because I think it's easy to say, oh,

673
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,170
you need to patch and no one's going to disagree with that.

674
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,510
You should definitely be patching.

675
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,589
You should definitely have some sort of patch cadence. However,

676
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,719
I think

677
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:39,680
we need to create an environment

678
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:45,964
that is less hostile to the blue team in this context where like, for example,

679
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:48,685
Google Chrome had a sandbox and when it came out,

680
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,395
it neutered an enormous number of vulnerabilities.

681
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,314
And it's obvious now that the Attackers have

682
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,954
figured out how to get around the sandbox

683
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:56,765
with,

684
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:57,645
we'll say a,

685
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,435
a certain amount of ease just given

686
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,334
this particular report we've been talking about.

687
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,435
Yes, thank you.

688
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,665
And I think we, we need

689
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,390
another level and I don't like the technology doesn't exist.

690
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,189
I can't say what it's gonna look like because I don't know,

691
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,709
I don't think it's sand boxing because we're doing that

692
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,699
now and it's less effective than it should be.

693
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,660
But we need some revolutionary thinking in the security industry

694
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,430
to bring us to the next place because as defense,

695
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,015
we need to get ahead of this

696
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:31,594
and cut the knees off of the Attackers. And that is what we really need to do.

697
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:32,994
We don't need to just say, oh,

698
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:36,214
just go pat your stuff because I think that's oversimplifying the problem.

699
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:39,515
-- I'm going to say, I don't think that's possible.
-- Well, it's not possible yet.

700
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:42,645
Someone has to invent it. Go invent the future. People come on, get with it. But,

701
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,010
well, but,

702
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,810
but it's an arms race. Right.

703
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:46,750
And I think I,

704
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,849
I suspect that defense will never be so good that

705
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,410
the Attackers can't win with a reasonable amount of effort.

706
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,790
Oh, no, no, no, they never will be.

707
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,010
I think the Attackers are too far ahead right now and we need to do some catching up.

708
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,069
Oh, it's too easy. Yes, it is.

709
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,219
Well, but, and that's why I'm actually going to disagree. Subtly.

710
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,469
I don't think patching

711
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,719
is something we should beat people up for,

712
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,109
to me patching again.

713
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,420
It's like putting a roof on your house and actually making it waterproof.

714
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,500
It's just, it's part of your basic

715
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,729
it

716
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,300
strategy. Like having electricity

717
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,810
or having keyboards.

718
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,180
Well, you should also have patch management. Like that's just,

719
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,219
-- it's not
-- a, I agree. I agree.

720
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:29,069
But we need the defense of technologies to buy the patcher more runway.

721
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,180
That's all I'm really saying here.

722
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,329
I don't think they have enough runway,

723
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,180
like they can't get the plane off the ground right now.

724
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,050
Well, and I, I hate to say it, but obviously I'm biased.

725
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,829
I work with the Cloud Security Alliance, but I think a lot of that goes to

726
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,339
outsourcing this stuff to the cloud where, for example,

727
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,760
you have Amazon and Microsoft doing hardware

728
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,910
security co processors on their equipment because

729
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,750
they

730
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,599
can't just take down their virtualization stack to patch it

731
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,270
and, and maybe, maybe that's part of the answer.

732
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,390
-- Like maybe it is, well,
-- especially I think for smaller organizations because,

733
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:03,040
you know, well, I'm just reminded of all the, uh, restaurants I go to,

734
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,969
they're kind of, uh, I don't know what phrase to use.

735
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,709
It's younger people like hipster people running these

736
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,979
and they're invariably it's a square payment terminal

737
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,589
and they've also got the square

738
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,209
payment terminal integrated with their online store

739
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:14,420
and everything and it just works and it's perfect and beautiful and it,

740
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,750
I,

741
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:15,410
I agree.

742
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:15,969
I agree.

743
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,160
Versus, you know, these people that try to cobble together their own garbage.

744
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,989
No, the answer is you just pay square.

745
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:21,319
Yeah,

746
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,439
I, I agree. I agree. I, I think,

747
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,020
and, and maybe that's it. I don't know. I guess this is one of those instances.

748
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,160
We're just gonna have to wait and see what the future is. It, it,

749
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,599
it's interesting. I'll say that.

750
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,040
Well,

751
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,770
I think there's one important piece is

752
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,550
that the level of technology and competency needed

753
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,949
to keep the Attackers out

754
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,079
and even respond to them once, you know,

755
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,160
they're in is growing like the level of sophistication needed

756
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,270
to run a modern network versus like 20 years ago.

757
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,109
And I think like many things, it's just, it's getting out of,

758
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,000
it's not even being priced out,

759
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,310
but it's just not possible for these smaller businesses to even find that talent,

760
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,609
those people all have jobs.

761
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:04,630
Yeah, it's, it's the relativistic security problem.

762
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,589
I mean, that's, that's what this is, it, it's all expanding

763
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,949
and we're not.

764
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,890
-- Yeah. And
-- I think part of the solution here is to radically,

765
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,560
like, outsource your problem as much as possible.

766
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,040
Like that's what I've done at the CS A

767
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:20,040
and it works

768
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,209
for not for everybody. Right.

769
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:24,920
Let's be like if you're on an oil platform in the middle of the North Sea,

770
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,849
I don't know that that's going to work very well for you. But

771
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,290
I, I don't see any

772
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,619
realistic solution for a lot of these

773
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,160
small and medium businesses moving forwards maybe.

774
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,079
I mean, you're, you're framing it in the context of what we have today and,

775
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,479
and II I don't disagree with you though.

776
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:43,459
I think it's, it's an easy solution to some of these problems.

777
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:46,750
So, anyway, we're out of time. I'm calling it. This has been, man, this one.

778
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,640
It feels like we started talking seven seconds ago. It's, I love it.

779
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:52,630
