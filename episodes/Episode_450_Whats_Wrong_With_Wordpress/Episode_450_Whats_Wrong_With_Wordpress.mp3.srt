Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:11,199
which uses wordpress to run its blog with myself,

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:11,960
Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,470
-- and Josh Pressers,
-- not your partner in Thought Crime or something.

4
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:18,370
We do use wordpress.com and

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,170
I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I would i it's not gonna go away,

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,979
but there's definitely some,

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,952
it, it weighs on my mind more than I wish it did.

8
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:31,542
I'm going to take and this is not the stance I'm taking,

9
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:35,062
but I'm going to point out that the vast majority of entities using

10
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:37,143
wordpress.com are using it because they just

11
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,222
want something that works basically well.

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:44,833
Well in that, that's how we got there. Is we originally used blogger? I think,

13
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:45,983
I think blogger,

14
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:47,476
I have no

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,476
-- idea.
-- I don't, I don't remember. I'm pretty sure it was blogger way back in the day.

16
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:54,015
It was the Google one and then they screwed something up.

17
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:57,655
-- I don't remember the details.
-- Well, I think they took it away like they canceled it

18
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:58,925
-- as Google
-- does.

19
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:02,936
It might have been that and then I moved to wordpress.com and the only

20
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:07,216
reason I picked them is because they had like an import plug in thing

21
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:12,800
that let me just automatically import the blog and back then we, we were in like 100

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,339
some episodes maybe.

23
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,529
And I just manually went in and fixed the

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,230
broken links and stuff because it wasn't that huge.

25
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:22,279
And now we're at 400

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,790
something. So, like the thought of having to migrate.

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,949
I know. Right.

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,430
It hurts my brain. I don't,

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,830
I don't want to.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,790
Yeah, I think so. This is going to be an interesting discussion. But I think

31
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:36,760
part of it is we're in a bubble of people who care very deeply

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,169
about not just technology but some of the ethics and morality about

33
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:40,360
it.

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,389
And I'm going to,

35
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,730
I'm going to offer a theory which is

36
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,110
the vast majority of companies paying for wordpress.com.

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,410
Don't really care about the ethics or morality of anything.

38
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:50,339
-- So
-- they,

39
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:54,260
this is a good question because they don't care about the ethics of the morality,

40
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,589
but they don't like chaos and unknowns.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,790
-- And that's a, that's a different topic though.
-- It is a different topic.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,349
But I think it's heavily related because I know you

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,489
have been insistent in talking to me over the last,

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,559
since this whole debacle started of like, oh,

45
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,750
most companies don't care and I think most of them didn't care until now.

46
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,330
But you're assuming that they even know about it.

47
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:17,589
I have not seen any real coverage of this apart from a bit in the register,

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,300
but this is not like going to make

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,630
the national news as like

50
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:24,880
-- Microsoft or something.
-- No, no, of course not.

51
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,899
But here's my counter argument to that is if you are a marketing person,

52
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,839
this is in your circle somewhere. So like

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,830
my example to you was the marketing person I work with is like, hey, what's going on?

54
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,000
Do we need to freak out?

55
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,220
And I was like, we don't need to freak out yet, but we should be prepared to freak out.

56
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,389
Well, here's the other thing, if you're heavily invested in wordpress,

57
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,740
which by definition of views in wordpress.com, you kind of of

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:50,899
our,

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,089
what's your alternative?

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,210
This is like this is like when people

61
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,000
dis windows and Microsoft saying Microsoft did terrible,

62
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:57,610
terrible things.

63
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,369
-- Yes. Yes, they absolutely did.
-- OK?

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,690
No, I'm going to bash you for this because you always say this like, oh,

65
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:03,970
what's your alternative?

66
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:07,259
And here's the thing, the alternative always exists.

67
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,649
It just depends how much pain and suffering you're willing to put up with. Now,

68
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,229
in the case of wordpress, what's your alternative? There are alternatives.

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,470
There are many alternatives you could self host, you could use WP engine,

70
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,699
you could switch from WP engine to wordpress.com.

71
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,389
You can migrate your website to a different technology.

72
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,029
I meant more in the sense from moving

73
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,509
from wordpress to some entirely different technology.

74
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,470
There are, there are options all have pain.

75
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,589
And what happens though is you always like to say, oh,

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,789
what's the alternative in your snide snarky way.

77
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,210
But the reality is there is always alternative

78
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:43,850
and eventually

79
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:50,690
this will reach a temperature where any alternative is better than the status quo

80
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,720
and we're not there yet.

81
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,330
But if things keep going, the way they're going,

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,369
the alternative,

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,279
whatever that may be is going to be less chaotic

84
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,145
and less painful than dealing with what we have now

85
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:05,675
thought experiment for a moment.

86
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:09,345
Let's say wordpress.com goes full evil 100% full evil

87
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,705
and like, chokes out like pretty much all the major paid plugins.

88
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,434
Like, what was that most recent one they did was automatic fields

89
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:19,005
-- forms. I always get the sorry, automatic custom fields,
-- right?

90
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:21,385
Which they renamed and we'll cover that in just

91
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,505
a moment because that whole thing is nuts.

92
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,464
Well, and let's say they go full evil on all that

93
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,880
again.

94
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:30,100
I suspect a lot of wordpress.com people,

95
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:34,329
like users of wordpress.com will just carry on, right.

96
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,950
I've seen the same arguments made against Red Hat. Red Hat's evil.

97
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,359
And I literally would ask people like, what specific evil thing did Red Hat do?

98
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,359
And they're like, well, it's just evil and I'm like,

99
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,260
I'm like, do you mean the one time we shipped,

100
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,679
like close source software?

101
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,299
Like, yeah, yeah, that and I'm like, ok, well,

102
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,839
what happened there is they acquired a company,

103
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,220
the

104
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,994
VM and they, you know, had a Windows, binary blah, blah,

105
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:54,765
blah and they actually in the next version got rid of it and manage to open source.

106
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,315
So, apart from that one, technically evil thing they did for a little while.

107
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,625
Give me one and, and nobody could ever come up with one.

108
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:03,684
Now, what's interesting to me is I'm not sure.

109
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,404
I'm, I'm wondering about the legality of this too because automatic custom fields,

110
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,445
like, like they forked it to secure custom fields

111
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:11,785
and essentially

112
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,450
hijacked it.

113
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,019
They totally hijacked it.

114
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,309
What the difference is normally you would fork the code

115
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,309
and then people would choose to use it

116
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,119
of their own free will.

117
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,029
But in this case,

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,140
that's not what wordpress.com is doing.

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,709
They're going to be flipping people over from a CS to

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,329
the,

121
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,970
from automatic custom fields to secure custom fields.

122
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,269
And I mean,

123
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,239
I seem to remember a company called Microsoft being accused and Google

124
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,410
being accused of all sorts of monopolistic practices of using like their search

125
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,549
or their web browser to push their search engine

126
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,459
and so on and so forth. And this sounds a lot like that.

127
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:47,420
It might be.

128
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:47,679
I mean,

129
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,010
I don't know if there's that sort of involvement from the antitrust regulators.

130
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:52,920
I hadn't even thought of that.

131
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,529
-- Honestly,
-- they, they're literally using their market position to say like, yeah,

132
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,809
you don't get to use AC F anymore.

133
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,750
We're swing you over to SCF Yes. Pray I don't alter the deal further.

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,049
-- I mean, kind of
-- how is that not exactly monopolistic behavior.

135
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,529
Here's the other piece of this though.

136
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,119
Kurt, I think you're not considering is you say, oh, if they went

137
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,785
on evil, like, what are you going to do?

138
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,515
Here's the thing. So

139
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,484
it's never like one thing.

140
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:20,424
It's not like when, when Anakin goes and murders all the Jedi,

141
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,855
like it's never like that.

142
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,994
Right. That's not how companies turn evil.

143
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:27,184
What companies do is they erode trust and sometimes they

144
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:29,815
erode trust quickly and sometimes they erode trust slowly.

145
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:34,515
But as you erode trust, you are hollowing out your customer base.

146
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:38,100
And in the case of wordpress, they had this whole community behind them,

147
00:06:38,109 --> 00:06:40,890
which is almost certainly damaged beyond repair.

148
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:41,649
At this point,

149
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,899
they have their customers of wordpress.com, which has its own set of problems.

150
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,940
They have WP Engine who

151
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:53,239
in all normal sane universes would be the villain of the story. But they're not

152
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,260
because, because like the whole thing is beyond nuts

153
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,170
and the reality is, it's not about what are you gonna use?

154
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,605
It's not about, oh, companies don't care about being evil.

155
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:06,774
It's about the fact is like if a disruptive technology,

156
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,325
if someone showed up at my door and said, hey,

157
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,605
we have a different web hosting platform that

158
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,045
isn't wordpress and we can import your site

159
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,994
with minimal errors.

160
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,285
And I, I don't even care if it'd be more expensive. I'd be like, holy crap.

161
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,755
We're in like, I'm down, get me out of this madness.

162
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,915
And again, I'm not in favor of this position,

163
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,325
but I'm going to point out wordpress is a lot

164
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,375
more complicated than that because it's not just my content.

165
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,394
It's my plugins.

166
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,630
No, I, I get that. I understand.

167
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,579
I'm saying though,

168
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,269
if someone could show up and say we

169
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,299
can migrate you off wordpress with minimal disruption,

170
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,200
I wouldn't even think about

171
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:40,399
it.

172
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,929
It would be a done deal because this is chaos and stupidity,

173
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,910
which is the worst two combinations.

174
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,309
Yeah. Well, and I mean, that's, that's literally like WP Engines business model

175
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,929
is

176
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,869
we'll do it slightly cheaper than wordpress.

177
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:57,160
And that's literally WP Engines business model is we'll do

178
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,799
it slightly cheaper than wordpress.com because we don't put any

179
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,290
as much resources into the engineering and the hosting of the plugins and blah,

180
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:03,760
blah, blah.

181
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:04,559
Right.

182
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,489
And they let you run like whatever dodgy plugins you want,

183
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,450
which is the other reason people love them.

184
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,779
But, um,

185
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,149
the thing is people wordpress sites are rarely just the content.

186
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,750
It's those plugins and that,

187
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,350
-- that plug in ecosystem is why wordpress
-- one. No, I get that. I understand.

188
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,429
And it doesn't matter whether it is or isn't the

189
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,260
plugins at this point because of the chaos and stupidity.

190
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm certain a significant number of people would gladly abandon it if they could.

191
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,910
They can't yet,

192
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,400
but I'm sure they would.

193
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,570
Here's a thought question is,

194
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,130
are the alternative platforms anywhere near in

195
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,450
terms of plugins and ecosystem support?

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,840
-- There are no alternative platforms.
-- Well, no no

197
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,849
one massive benefit of wordpress is where's the number

198
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,530
wordpress powers? 43.5% of all websites is their C MS. Sure.

199
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,309
Around 478 million websites are built on wordpress,

200
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,289
which means if I need to go find a wordpress developer or admin,

201
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,929
I literally could like, shout from my front yard and probably find one.

202
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,969
-- Yes, they're easy to find. I agree. Right.
-- And that's one massive

203
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,210
thing that I love about. Wordpress is like if I

204
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,250
there's just so much talent

205
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,419
and it's like it's versus, you know, these so m

206
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,659
uh these more niche solutions for

207
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:17,960
sure,

208
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:18,559
findings.

209
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,809
And again, like if even if you want to switch and kind of get

210
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,559
away from this risk and this chaos, I'm not sure the alternatives are,

211
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,570
are that much meaningfully better for.

212
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,119
There isn't an alternative yet

213
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,809
yet is the key.

214
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,789
They have opened the door

215
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,450
to someone with a good idea

216
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,770
and the willingness to be flexible to disrupt Wordpress. Yeah,

217
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,609
that is one of the things now let's talk about.

218
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,280
I want to start the actual like meat of this conversation with a question for you.

219
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,650
-- Is this a supply chain attack?
-- So I would say

220
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,559
yes,

221
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,059
in the sense of if it walks like a duck and talks like

222
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,849
a duck and the duck catches fire and burns my house down.

223
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,280
-- Yes, it's a problem.
-- It has Giaan

224
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,609
energy.

225
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:08,119
The, the, the challenge is attack implies intent

226
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,239
and

227
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,440
I honestly, in this situation,

228
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,909
don't care so much about the intent as I do about the outcome.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,059
And the outcome is, for example, I have two sites running wordpress,

230
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,530
one on wordpress.com and one off wordpress.com.

231
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:24,330
Because fun fact getting zap your automation to work with wordpress.com.

232
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,059
I

233
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,559
in theory, you can get it working,

234
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,169
but you have to like poke a bunch of holes and allow IP S and

235
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,549
basically it's, it's,

236
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,150
it uses the XML R PC call stuff, which is like all security lockdown. And

237
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:34,809
so

238
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,469
I literally just run a light sale instance for six bucks a month

239
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,099
with the, I think it's the bit nay,

240
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:40,590
I

241
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,219
think Amazon ripped off the bit nay

242
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,349
apps for their, you know, like you want wordpress, click 11 click install, right?

243
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,840
And so yeah, I use that, but in

244
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:54,049
this case, I don't care about intent so much as like, I'm pretty sure he's in like

245
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,030
to put it bluntly

246
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,869
WP engine did the classic thing of we're going to free ride

247
00:10:59,409 --> 00:10:59,890
on an open

248
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,979
-- source
-- project to a degree. Yes, for sure, for sure.

249
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,210
That part I'm ok with,

250
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,070
yeah,

251
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,020
but the part that becomes a problem is they also free road on wordpress.com

252
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,770
infrastructure.org

253
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:13,479
dot org,

254
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:13,900
which is,

255
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:14,780
and I mean,

256
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,020
we can pretend that wordpress.com and wordpress.org are different things,

257
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,260
but they're not

258
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:23,140
-- like let's be real.
-- They are technically different things on paper, but

259
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:27,020
-- these are two different fingers, they're
-- just attached to two different fingers.

260
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,799
You have more than one finger card.

261
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:30,799
Yes, I hope so.

262
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:31,650
It would

263
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,320
be very

264
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:32,609
awkward.

265
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,760
If

266
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,739
I can see,

267
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,250
I can see multiple fingers. It could be

268
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:35,530
-- a,
-- I

269
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,059
-- count them.
-- That's right.

270
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,500
Why do you have 12 fingers?

271
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,690
Yeah, but that's the thing right is so I'm,

272
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,830
I'm ok with them using open source and not giving back or even so many go

273
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,710
bug report. That's fine. That's how open

274
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,669
-- source usage
-- works. An unfortunate aspect of open

275
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,260
-- source. Yes.
-- However, running the wordpress plugins distributions.

276
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,927
Well, yeah, I mean,

277
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,017
they kind of maybe get to say who plays and who doesn't get to play with them.

278
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,447
Twitter, for example, Twitter has filtered all the Amazon

279
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,887
two IP S as best I can tell from even

280
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:08,606
like remotely connecting to the site for scrapers and stuff.

281
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:08,817
Yeah.

282
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,677
So I have that thing that like checks what your Twitter

283
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,947
web page is and it's hooked up to a VPN.

284
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:17,146
So it goes through um I want to say like Nord VPN or somebody

285
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,794
use an IP address that Twitter essentially hopefully can't

286
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,934
block because so many people used to actually access

287
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:22,674
Twitter

288
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:24,054
but they can't block it.

289
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:27,403
Yeah, apparently the real way to do this is to use the mobile IP space.

290
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,794
So you get a bunch of SIM cards

291
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,713
because like they don't want to block mobile

292
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,033
clients because those are people with money,

293
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:32,754
but back to this.

294
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,763
So I would say this is one of those beautiful.

295
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:39,283
They are technically correct in being able to do what they did.

296
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,981
I don't know if they are actually.

297
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:41,341
So,

298
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,890
but morally and ethically the second order and third order implications of

299
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:48,820
what they did was a really bad idea because now we're talking,

300
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,601
I'm going to point out now we're talking about it on the podcast,

301
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,010
which means you've done fed up.

302
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,551
I, I would agree with that.

303
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,221
Like, generally speaking, if you're being featured on podcasts such as this,

304
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,190
like nothing good has happened.

305
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,221
But so here's the thing, here's the thing.

306
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,900
So first, let's just explain kind of what happened.

307
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,700
And there have been this, there's this crazy timeline.

308
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,479
I will link to the wild timeline in the show notes.

309
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,859
But is this the one that also includes like the, the venture private,

310
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,280
the private equity fund?

311
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:16,330
And

312
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:16,979
it's

313
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:17,440
good

314
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,750
because that's something most people are ignoring on this is like

315
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:23,619
private equity firms are involved in this. So it's like, it's not as cut and dried.

316
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,070
-- It's actually kind of messy, right?
-- And so I'll just run over that quick, right?

317
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,659
2005. Automatic is founded 2010

318
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:31,153
WP Engine is founded

319
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:32,624
in 2011.

320
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:33,804
Automatic,

321
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,513
made an investment into WP Engine

322
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,703
in 2018.

323
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,723
Apparently, they divested that investment,

324
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:43,263
which I assume they made a bunch of money in that at that point,

325
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,823
they'd be idiotic not to.

326
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:47,283
Well, they sold it to private equity and private equity is infamous.

327
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,874
For over paying for stuff and then trying to strip mine the value back out. Yeah.

328
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:51,343
Right.

329
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:55,903
But then, so July, mid July of this year 2024 it says

330
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:59,018
the wordpress Foundation was granted the

331
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,528
trademark managed Wordpress and hosted wordpress,

332
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:02,588
which, all right.

333
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,937
-- Weird. But, yeah,
-- it's

334
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:04,588
-- a
-- little,

335
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:04,918
I

336
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:09,828
-- feel like it's a little late in the game for that.
-- I mean, kind of, but I don't know.

337
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:13,528
And, and anyway, so it says September 20th, uh Matt Muller

338
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:17,588
sends extortion like messages shortly before his talk

339
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:21,487
to go. He says he's gonna go scorched earth nuclear uh

340
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,072
September 21st.

341
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:30,372
There's um he Matt post an article that WP engine is not wordpress on wordpress.org.

342
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:36,341
And then we kind of have this just like back and forth madness until pretty much now,

343
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:37,831
which is what mid

344
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:42,312
Oktober. And what happened is wordpress

345
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:48,512
has a plug in called advanced custom fields that I think that I don't know if WP engine

346
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,325
is the primary author,

347
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:54,796
but it is a, it is a four page plug in in the wordpress ecosystem.

348
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,995
It's like pretty much of the default one if you're using forms

349
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,356
to take in data and email it or put in the database,

350
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:00,666
like

351
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,315
I even use it

352
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:03,426
like it's,

353
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:04,455
we do not,

354
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,875
but I'm, I've, I've heard of it, right.

355
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,515
And so then

356
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:09,515
there's, let me,

357
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:14,676
let me just pull up the actual blog post from the wordpress people on October 12th.

358
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,835
They say that they have,

359
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,960
they have forked advanced custom fields into a new plug in,

360
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,039
called secure custom fields.

361
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,440
And here's the thing,

362
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,109
it says SCF has been updated to remove

363
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,820
commercial up cells and fix a security problem.

364
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,809
And the security problem is the angle they seem

365
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,890
to be focusing on to justify their actions.

366
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,309
I found the security problem, they fixed.

367
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,989
We'll, we'll get to that in a moment.

368
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,150
But here's the thing.

369
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,000
So

370
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:46,789
the other piece of this is there's something called 0.18

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,469
in the plug in directory guidelines.

372
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,210
Now I'm going to read these to you and I would like for you

373
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:56,750
to tell me if you think anything we have talked about or seen so far

374
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,390
kind of falls under this.

375
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,609
So it says 0.18 we reserve the right to maintain the plug in directory to the best of

376
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,460
our ability seems sane our intent is to enforce

377
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:08,330
these guidelines with as much fairness as humanly possible.

378
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,549
We do this to ensure overall plug in quality and the safety of their users.

379
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,710
To that end, we reserve the following rights

380
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,950
seems reasonable

381
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,890
for number one

382
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,020
to update these guidelines at any time. Very low. Right. Fine.

383
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,809
Number two to disable or remove any plug in from the directory,

384
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,960
even for reasons not explicitly covered by the guidelines.

385
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:27,469
Ok.

386
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,349
-- Well, because
-- somebody will find something new to do. Right.

387
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,549
Sure. Sure, for sure.

388
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,750
And I agree with that. And that's probably the line that was used here

389
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,695
three to grant exceptions to allow developers time to address issues,

390
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,114
even security related.

391
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:39,994
OK.

392
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:45,164
Then to remove developer access to a plug in in lieu of a new active developer,

393
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:48,875
I mean that's a good one. Honestly, we've seen issues with N PM there

394
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,875
and then lastly, it says to make changes to a plug in without developer consent

395
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,710
in the interest of public safety.

396
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,450
Now, now here's the kicker in return,

397
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,650
we've promised to use those rights sparingly and with as

398
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,930
much respect as possible for both end users and developers.

399
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,118
So can I just summarize what you just said?

400
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,959
Which is

401
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,368
we own all the plugins? You submit?

402
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:16,868
-- Basically.
-- No, not, basically we own all the plugins you submit.

403
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,329
-- I mean,
-- that is, well, that's on the, the hosted plugins directory.

404
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,194
-- No,
-- no, but we own them in the sense of like we have control and we own them, own them.

405
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:31,635
Like let's not like we'll pretend that you have ownership and control

406
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,515
but

407
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,645
-- you don't.
-- Well,

408
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:36,564
that's what happens when you host a registry.

409
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:37,224
Like

410
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:37,564
same

411
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,594
thing with N PM N PM

412
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:42,354
owns everything on N PM functionally.

413
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,530
And yet we somehow play this game of pretending like

414
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,770
they don't like somehow the developers have final ownership.

415
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,229
I don't, I don't think it's a game.

416
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:54,760
I think if you look at like how it has worked historically,

417
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,709
it has generally been the developers do their thing

418
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,760
and then they submit things to the registry

419
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,209
and then the registry publishes whatever the developer did

420
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:06,260
this historically has worked because everybody actually does make

421
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,489
a good faith effort to behave reasonably well.

422
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,584
Wordpress has not broken any laws. They probably haven't even broken any rules.

423
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,244
-- Well, especially when the rules are, we can do whatever we want basically.
-- Right.

424
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:18,935
And I don't think

425
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:19,694
this is,

426
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,094
I don't think they're going to stop down the

427
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:23,145
path they're on because they have no reason to,

428
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:23,625
you know, there,

429
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,385
it's conceivable there would be enough community push back that they might have to,

430
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,905
but I suspect not because I don't think they care.

431
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:31,935
Well, the the challenge too is like,

432
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:36,285
OK, for example, let's say all the paid plug in developers go OK?

433
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:40,219
This is a potential problem because like it turns out press can just yoink all of our,

434
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,959
I'm sure they've all done that already.

435
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,439
But the thing is what can they actually do

436
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,839
the OK. So this comes back to your snarky. What are you going to do?

437
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,719
It's not meant to be snarky. I'm just genuinely asking.

438
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,959
-- No,
-- no, here's so here's how this works, right? This is

439
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,089
any time you are existing in an ecosystem, this is true of like,

440
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:01,449
let's say the Windows Universe.

441
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:06,189
A great example is how many times have there been some sort of

442
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:10,165
product or add on to like Microsoft Windows or Os X or whatever?

443
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,135
And then one day Microsoft or Apple are like, oh,

444
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:15,145
we're just going to add that functionality right into the product.

445
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:17,135
Actually, you just used the word ecosystem.

446
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:20,405
This isn't an ecosystem, this is like a managed ecosystem.

447
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:22,795
This isn't like a free market ecosystem.

448
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:26,214
With this is a managed like owned by somebody ecosystem.

449
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:26,625
Well,

450
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,694
but that's different because like open source is an ecosystem in the sense

451
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:33,935
of I can download Linux from a million places and I can install

452
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,729
hell, I don't even need to use GNU, right?

453
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,739
I could use her.

454
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,099
But this is not that like ultimately, we

455
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,140
just owns all of this. This is like

456
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,550
this is like calling a forest a forest when it's one of

457
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,650
those forests in Germany where all the trees are 10 ft apart,

458
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,890
like perfectly spaced.

459
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,369
That's not a forest. That's a tree farm.

460
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,119
I, I think you are correct. Oh, a tree farm. That's a really good analogy.

461
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,709
-- I think that's exactly it.
-- Right.

462
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,410
And like apple like, yeah, they, they added,

463
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,209
they made the password manager first class

464
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:09,093
-- application in IO 18. Now, thankfully, finally,
-- that's a great example.

465
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:12,774
Like that's going to hurt the existing password managers,

466
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,803
the organizations for sure. Unquestionably.

467
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:16,833
Now you,

468
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,374
I think you raise a very good point with

469
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,213
the tree farm analogy because I think historically,

470
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:24,254
when we exist in a universe,

471
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,333
be it like Apple or Wordpress or Microsoft or Aws or whatever, like look at,

472
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,764
look at all the Aws products.

473
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:30,303
I mean, Amazon

474
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:33,287
has notoriously murdered competition because they were like, oh,

475
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:34,017
that's a good idea.

476
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:37,108
-- We'll build that
-- well, but that's how that's their cultural DNA of.

477
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,378
Like I literally remember buying

478
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,718
No, no II I want you to.

479
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:41,937
That's not the point. The point is

480
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,228
that I think we as

481
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:47,547
like tech practitioners

482
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:51,608
have failed to recognize the difference between like

483
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:54,848
an open source or just truly free universe where you

484
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,397
can kind of do what you want and have your things

485
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,891
available versus

486
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:02,761
the I am living inside someone else's sandbox. Like video games are a great example.

487
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:04,832
If you're not publishing on Steam,

488
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:06,251
you don't have an audience.

489
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:07,192
But at the same time,

490
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:10,442
Steam gets to tell you exactly what to do and they get to take 30% of your,

491
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,222
your money and what are you going to do about it?

492
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:15,261
-- You can't do anything about it because you're living in their sandbox
-- well,

493
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:18,362
and this comes back to the whole like these sort of social

494
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,241
contracts and systems work when everybody behaves well and nobody kind of

495
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:22,635
used

496
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,865
to grab too much money, too fast,

497
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:26,735
but then they start to fall apart.

498
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,595
And we're seeing that in the real world where, you know,

499
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:31,895
wages have stagnated for the majority of people,

500
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:35,625
food prices have gone up quite a lot and the rich are much,

501
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:37,056
much richer than they used to be.

502
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:37,776
And

503
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,755
I am now seeing the social contract fall apart in Canada like

504
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,895
and one extreme example is Quebec and I thought this was Beaverton.

505
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:44,186
But no,

506
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:48,556
it was a CBC article where the Quebec government is literally advocating that

507
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,680
healthy people don't need family doctors.

508
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,510
So like

509
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,199
if basically, if you're generally healthy, you don't get to have a family doctor,

510
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,040
you can go use emergency when you need it.

511
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,849
And that way there will be more family doctor resources for 60 months.

512
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,880
And of course, all of us are like, but that's kind of how you stay healthy

513
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,099
anyway,

514
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,859
I digress

515
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,959
but this is showing that this kind of whole like as long as wordpress.com

516
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,260
in return,

517
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,079
we promised to use these rights sparingly and with as

518
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,199
much respect as possible for both end users and vs

519
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,430
like when they take out some like Chinese backdoor thing, everybody's like, OK,

520
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,569
yeah, that's reasonable.

521
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,469
Or you know, a developer throws a tantrum and refuses to fix the security bug.

522
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:26,680
And wordpress is like, well, we're fixing it anyways when you calm down,

523
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:29,449
come back and we'll talk or else you're gonna this to somebody else

524
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,130
again. Everybody's kind of like, OK, that's,

525
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,810
that's better. But in this case, it's kind of like, whoa

526
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,119
pause because I think a lot of it, it's, it's like

527
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,540
people

528
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,160
ignore that these things are possible until you kind of

529
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,180
shove it in their face like the car hacking thing,

530
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,020
like until reporters in the car and the

531
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,609
car accelerates while their foot's on the brake,

532
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,380
they're like, oh,

533
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,390
and I think that's what's happening here

534
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,630
is people are getting more and more examples

535
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,079
of these PP and N PM ecosystems having to do these things

536
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,380
or doing them because they want to, in the case of wordpress.com.

537
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,069
And I think they're beginning to get a little

538
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,099
nervous because they realize how little control they have.

539
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:04,329
I

540
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,260
-- mean, that's fair. That's fair.
-- Again.

541
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,520
I, I don't say this to be snarky but I'm like,

542
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,010
well,

543
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,890
what's like the alternative of building it all and rolling

544
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,229
it all myself so that I have that control.

545
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,300
That

546
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,339
is a lot of work and introduces risk because I'm not necessarily as good at this as

547
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:23,170
-- like 100 for
-- sure,

548
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,420
for educated professionals.

549
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,079
Now, now here's a better question than,

550
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:28,699
than mindlessly discussing what we can do about it,

551
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,579
which is virtually nothing right now.

552
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,339
But does every ecosystem

553
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,180
eventually bend

554
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,760
into this space or eventually the ecosystem ha does something incredibly

555
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,619
stupid because they just quite frankly lost touch with reality.

556
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,218
-- I
-- think the first step is you haven't ecosystem that represents value

557
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:50,108
because there's, there's like people use the ecosystem because there's value in it

558
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:51,098
and you

559
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,758
try to capture that value because they want to pay their rent and not do it for free.

560
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,718
That is also true.

561
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:58,008
Like you work for a commercial open

562
00:23:58,128 --> 00:23:58,677
source company.

563
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,917
Yes, that is correct. You guys could do this for free.

564
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,078
Uh We give away a lot of stuff we do

565
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,978
-- and you'd also like to be able to buy food
-- for. I do

566
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:08,887
-- enjoy eating food.
-- Yes.

567
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,708
Because, sadly, that's how capitalism works.

568
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:12,598
And

569
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:15,566
I would argue we are much better off with Anchor

570
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,235
being a commercial company offering a good,

571
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:18,906
like,

572
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,375
high quality commercial product and being able to put

573
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:23,916
a lot more resourcing into the open source side

574
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:28,015
because you, you guys are paid enough money to eat food and, you know,

575
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,725
-- that's how
-- it works.

576
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,115
But people forget that.

577
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,926
Like, if you had to do this as a hobby,

578
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:36,656
you might only spend five or 10 hours a week doing it, whereas it's your job.

579
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:41,255
-- So you can spend 40 hours a week doing like with
-- 40 hours a week. If only.

580
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,203
So, then people forget this, right?

581
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:45,744
Like there's a big difference between five or 10 hours a week of kind of

582
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:49,274
sometimes work versus this is my short time job and I get resourcing and,

583
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,173
and help and they send me a laptop and,

584
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,514
well, look,

585
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,453
this is part of the Wordpress story as well

586
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:57,573
without automatic funding all of the wordpress developers.

587
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:01,274
-- There basically wouldn't be a Wordpress today.
-- Wordpress was ok

588
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,453
before them,

589
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:06,104
but wordpress after them was like, it just works

590
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,713
like it's so easy.

591
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:08,473
And

592
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,004
I remember looking at,

593
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,192
I was hesitant to buy wordpress.com.

594
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:14,362
So I was like, oh, I don't want to spend money on this. And then I did the math. Ok.

595
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:18,192
It's $300 a year. That's less than three hours of my time.

596
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:20,491
I pay like $50 a year for our site.

597
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:23,472
But I have the cheapest possible option, which is the other challenge. Yes.

598
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:27,651
I can't even run a vps for that amount. Not counting my time. I know. Right.

599
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,761
That's why I did that because it was obvious and makes sense.

600
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:32,011
Well, and more to the point,

601
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,062
how much value can I really add to patching a

602
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,881
server running wordpress and doing a bunch of other stuff?

603
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:36,651
And the answer is none.

604
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,031
Yeah. Right. Right.

605
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,599
Oh, and that's the other reason I use, uh,

606
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,079
my lights sale instances because I needed to do

607
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,180
something that wordpress.com didn't want to let me do.

608
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,089
That's fair.

609
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:47,550
And then I got rid of it. Turns out I didn't need it, but

610
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
I ended up using tax.

611
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:49,829
So, which is,

612
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,530
it is a taxonomy plug in for wordpress that puts all your

613
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,209
stuff into a taxonomy and it makes it really easy to,

614
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,680
um,

615
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,349
basically it takes everything intelligently which makes it,

616
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,500
I get that nice word cloud and I can navigate my stuff,

617
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:03,530
you know.

618
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,459
Well, if you have a lot of like this thing, I have, you know, I generate 30 posts a day.

619
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:07,839
So

620
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,849
if I ever want to find them again, good luck. Got you. Got you.

621
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,880
But back to this, I think the challenge is, it's like a,

622
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,800
to use a parasite as an analogy.

623
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,880
If a parasite latches onto a host and, like, just sips a little bit of blood

624
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,459
and it's a little itchy.

625
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,040
Ok. Kind of annoying. But, you know, whatever,

626
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,479
not the end of the world.

627
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,300
And maybe it does something useful like those birds that eat the bugs off of hippos

628
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,050
or whatever.

629
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,849
-- Like, I don't think they're parasites though.
-- They're symbio.

630
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,770
And that's the point is you can also be a symbio

631
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,119
where, like wordpress.com for the sake of argument.

632
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,739
Offering the,

633
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,140
the plans at 50 bucks a year or 300 bucks a year is cheap enough that it's actually,

634
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:47,569
well, it's just, it's, I'm financially better off paying them than doing it myself.

635
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,829
And if you do a lot of that, you'll, people will be generally happy with you, right?

636
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:54,410
But then you start turning the thumb screws and like

637
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,189
trying to squeeze out that last bit of juice,

638
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,329
like a perfect example.

639
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:57,589
Ok?

640
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,449
This blows my mind because Windows is primarily

641
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,569
a corporate platform that also ships to consumers because

642
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,339
they make a lot of money.

643
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,130
And also they want to hold the gaming market

644
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,869
and some other stuff considering the value of Windows

645
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,400
licenses in the corporate world especially and to some degree the consumer world,

646
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,609
the fact that they're trying to shove advertising into the consumer version,

647
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,449
there's no way it's making enough money to make it worth the

648
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:24,430
backlash and yet they keep doing it like it blows my mind.

649
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,290
That's a really good example I think. And that's probably part of this is,

650
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,589
let's say

651
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,109
Wordpress did manage to

652
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,180
ma make WP engine look bad. Let's say like, what's the, what's the end game here?

653
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,939
-- Are they trying to get their customers? Are they trying to shut them
-- down?

654
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:43,239
Like half a billion dollars a year in total revenue?

655
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,569
-- Like it's
-- a, you're not going to capture it all because you know what I mean?

656
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,900
And I think the windows example of putting ads

657
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,010
in the operating system are another good example where

658
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,670
this feels like a very short sighted behavior

659
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,709
that if you actually like graph it out for, let's say a couple of years,

660
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:05,109
you're going to be like, this is incredibly stupid and no one should be doing it.

661
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,109
-- Do you
-- know much junk?

662
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,119
I've had to turn off in the windows interface to get like

663
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,150
it kept showing me random NFL results on the task bar.

664
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,099
I literally quit running windows because I'm just like I'm done.

665
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,270
And you know, it's funny,

666
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:16,962
I used to run it for games.

667
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:20,182
So I just switched to Linux and I'm like, I'm going to figure out if wine works.

668
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:23,041
There is a thing available now called the Heroic launcher,

669
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:27,151
which will launch like Epic Games and Steam Games and some other a bunch of, well,

670
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:28,962
Steam runs pretty well these days.

671
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:30,682
So I don't, I don't use it for that, but like

672
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:34,112
this thing is top notch and like per game,

673
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,962
it has very specific settings for like wine and proton and things like that.

674
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:38,332
Like

675
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:40,703
I'm like, holy crap. I don't need windows at all anymore.

676
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:45,413
And I, honest to God have not run windows in over a year now, which is marvelous.

677
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,443
I suspect windows 11 will be my last windows.

678
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,833
Although it sounds like it will be the last windows for everybody.

679
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:53,394
They've said that like five times

680
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:53,884
and,

681
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:58,284
but the thing is the Mac hardware is finally fast enough and cheap enough

682
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:01,083
that I wouldn't have to spend like 20 grand to get the equivalent hardware

683
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:03,083
as I can get in a PC for like

684
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:03,416
towards

685
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:04,416
the cost.

686
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:07,586
Like I just bought a new Mac mini and that eight extra,

687
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:10,885
like I went from eight gigs of ra M to 16 gigs of ra M because I'm not a maniac.

688
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,015
That makes a big difference.

689
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,365
That was 240 bucks,

690
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:18,265
240 bucks for eight gigs of ra M versus I just bought about 100 and 28 gigs of ra M.

691
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:19,635
It's

692
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,026
-- 200
-- and 70 bucks.

693
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:24,595
-- Now, the game makers just need to support Mac
-- Os.

694
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:25,715
Well, the

695
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,186
apple silicon.

696
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:28,989
That's true. That's true.

697
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,650
That's a big difference.

698
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,500
But this is,

699
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,040
this is why

700
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,280
the work steam has been doing or Valve has been doing

701
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,449
with the steam deck and things like that is amazing.

702
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:40,109
And thank goodness, even though I don't have a steam deck,

703
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,530
I benefit from their hard work.

704
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,579
So thank you Valve for working with Linux.

705
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,819
So, but back to the Wordpress thing.

706
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:49,729
What do the one thing that really amuses me is wordpress

707
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,150
uh WP Engine sorry is kind of the

708
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,280
like they're just

709
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,760
a free rider and all this whatever kind of not the nicest people,

710
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,530
not the worst people.

711
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,949
They should be the villain in this story

712
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,250
and they,

713
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,630
they managed to not shoot themselves in the foot and keep

714
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,089
their mouth shut and not end up looking like complete jerks,

715
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:09,489
-- which I applaud them because
-- they probably listen to their lawyer.

716
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,290
I promise you if the Wordpress lawyer hasn't quit.

717
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,760
Like I can only imagine the number of emails and voicemails.

718
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,670
Well, not emails, they wouldn't send emails. But

719
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,199
yeah,

720
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,369
I can't imagine

721
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:24,290
so. Yeah. No, this whole thing, like again, I don't mean to be snarky but literally

722
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,050
the thought of having to, uh,

723
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,750
moving all the content is relatively

724
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,410
places have gotten good at that.

725
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:34,390
-- The challenge is all the plugins. I want all my plugins to work.
-- Yeah.

726
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,650
You keep saying that we know

727
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,310
we get it.

728
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,400
That's plugins.

729
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,189
And the thing is the thing that's compatible with all the Wordpress plugins is,

730
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:42,540
well, Wordpress,

731
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,089
-- that's correct.
-- And

732
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,130
if you built something completely compatible with

733
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,780
wordpress to run all the plugins,

734
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,300
it would be probably a lot less work to just fork,

735
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,959
Wordpress and maintain your own fork of it.

736
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,349
Maybe I'm actually surprised no one has forked it yet.

737
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,819
I feel like a Wordpress fork has got to be imminent

738
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,890
just due to everything going on.

739
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,119
It's,

740
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,969
-- yeah, I'm
-- not saying it'll work. I just feel

741
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:07,199
like, well, it's, it's,

742
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,680
I feel like a fork is one of those classic things where people think it

743
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:14,199
a, they think the fork will accomplish things that it won't accomplish.

744
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,979
And b it's actually a lot of maintenance and work more so than they thinking.

745
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,130
Yeah,

746
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,439
there's not a lot of forks that have

747
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,599
-- been particularly successful because
-- here's the thing.

748
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,400
You don't just have to fork wordpress.

749
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,319
Well,

750
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:26,989
you also apparently now have to fork

751
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,430
all the freaking wordpress plug-in stuff because they're

752
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:29,890
gonna block

753
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,900
you and lock you out of it.

754
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,500
That

755
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,069
infrastructure is easier than it used to be. I will give you that.

756
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,550
Like, it's still hard though.

757
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,939
But compared to 20 or compared to 15 years ago when they started, like, for sure,

758
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,229
like you and I could build something like 10% of pipe pie in an afternoon.

759
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,489
I don't know about that.

760
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,280
And it would suck, but it would be, it would, but it would ship a lot of packages.

761
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,040
Right. Whereas 20 years ago we couldn't even,

762
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,599
-- I could
-- run a web server with packages on it.

763
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:57,969
-- But I don't know,
-- years ago we couldn't even dream of it.

764
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:58,869
Uh

765
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,280
-- Like the fact that it's even possible now is kind of amazing to me.
-- It is. It is. So,

766
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,959
I

767
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,109
man, I don't know, I feel like this is just

768
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:12,530
this whole story is bananas. I don't know. Where this is going to go.

769
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,599
It is from my perspective, as a a human existing in this space,

770
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:21,959
I feel like this is a left pad style incident.

771
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,030
I would suggest my closing thought is there's a lot of in theory,

772
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,219
benevolent dictator for life is an open source.

773
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:29,479
You know, Leis

774
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,150
Torvalds, Guido Van Rossum.

775
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,540
And we generally don't hear about them unless they either do an

776
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,810
-- exceptionally great job like Linus Torvalds or Daniel Steinberger or
-- no,

777
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:42,050
we never hear about Linus doing good work.

778
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,380
We only ever heard when he was a massive a hole.

779
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,020
-- Ok.
-- Well, he's doing a lot less now.

780
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,619
And I was about to say that the second part though is we'll

781
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,819
ever hear about them when they massively mess up and say stupid things

782
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,010
or

783
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,010
make some decision that everybody hates,

784
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:00,979
which there aren't very many of those. I can't think of too many

785
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,079
man of decisions. Everyone hates from Python or Linux

786
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,329
or even like curl, nothing springs to mind.

787
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,300
-- They've
-- done a reasonably good job of not annoying people,

788
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,800
which at internet scale is pretty magical

789
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,979
because, you know,

790
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:16,150
I could say I like vanilla ice cream and somebody

791
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,800
listening to the show will take offense to it.

792
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,630
-- Vanilla ice cream is like the worst one, man.
-- Come

793
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,680
-- on.
-- It's my favorite. It's good.

794
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,630
But, um,

795
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,349
I think in this case, I'm hoping

796
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:27,800
that kind of like

797
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,060
a lot of situations where the company might reel in the

798
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,560
CEO a bit because that has been a common truth.

799
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,770
I don't think they can though Matt's too,

800
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,170
he, he, he is automatic,

801
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,000
-- but
-- that's what I'm kind of wondering here.

802
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,030
Is, is there anybody who can stand up to him?

803
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,709
-- I
-- don't
-- think so. If they could, they probably would have by now.

804
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:48,329
Well, I'm sure his lawyers would have told him not to speak about this in public.

805
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:50,140
You don't have to listen to your lawyers though.

806
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,969
If you don't have a board or anyone that can hold it over your head, you know.

807
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
So, I don't know. I don't, it'll

808
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:59,151
see. Here's the thing, here's the thing, right?

809
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:03,582
This is, I think how I'm going to end this show is every week.

810
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:07,982
This feels like it crosses a new line of, like,

811
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:10,342
dumber and weirder than I could imagine.

812
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,342
The word you're looking for is normalized deviancy.

813
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,701
Like the Challenger disaster where they kept launching

814
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,491
in kind of colder and colder weather and then

815
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,781
-- one day they,
-- that's fair went, boom.

816
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,862
-- That's true.
-- That's exactly what this is.

817
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:24,141
And II, I feel like next week some,

818
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,782
I think even weirder is going to happen. I'm actually glad.

819
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,752
So, Kurt and I are recording this on the same day.

820
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:31,652
I'm going to release the show, which I haven't done in a really long time.

821
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,302
So, like, I have several hours of,

822
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:36,632
a lot of work ahead of me right now to actually get the show out quickly.

823
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,472
But hopefully the thing doesn't explode

824
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:39,272
-- and that's
-- just it.

825
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:41,873
I'm like, if we would wait a week to put this out,

826
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:45,862
this whole conversation would be completely invalid by the time it came out,

827
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:46,452
I suspect.

828
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:49,042
And there's nothing more terrifying than being in that

829
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,742
sort of situation and it's just like no one,

830
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:52,032
like

831
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:56,385
I have enough stupid crazy stuff going on right now all around me.

832
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:58,285
Like I don't need wordpress the word.

833
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,756
-- Like
-- the whole reason I use wordpress is like, I turn it on,

834
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:04,555
I shove content into it

835
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,966
and people read the content and I don't have to spend

836
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:10,085
time fixing or maintaining it and it just freaking works.

837
00:35:10,095 --> 00:35:11,006
-- And that's all I want.
-- I

838
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,285
know

839
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:16,486
-- it's anyway,
-- you know, that's all I want from most of my technology. Now.

840
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:19,926
That's all I want from everything. Like I want everything to be born.

841
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:24,538
Everything should be boring. Like the excitement of my life should be watching

842
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:28,637
like a, a, the deadpool movie or something. That should be my excitement.

843
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:30,897
But it's not, that's the most boring thing.

844
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:32,187
Yeah, I, I hate that.

845
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,887
That's why I have a pluck server is because

846
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,617
stuff goes randomly missing from streaming services or youtube.

847
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,577
And my poor son is like,

848
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,498
where's Pink Panther? And I'm like,

849
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:43,498
Reed Hastings killed him, son.

850
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:44,738
That's where he went.

851
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,847
But anyway. All right. All right. I'm like

852
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,669
this whole thing. I don't,

853
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,110
I don't even know what to say.

854
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,389
I'm just gonna end the show because I don't think there's anything

855
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:57,540
good we can even say here other than just like madness.

856
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,110
Well, I think part of the mature thing for me is to accept that as,

857
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,889
as bad as the Wordpress situation gets.

858
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,199
It's probably still better than me trying to do it all myself.

859
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,949
And that's sort of the reality of it. Like there's burritos are a good example.

860
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:15,199
What

861
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,260
I can make a good burrito. I,

862
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,050
there's like most of the burritos in Edmonton are terrible.

863
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,110
They taste like wet cardboard. They are not good. There's like,

864
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,939
there's like three good Mexican ish restaurants here that

865
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,679
serve a decent burrito and it's not cheap.

866
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:29,860
And so I just kind of have to accept that my choices

867
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,379
are either pay a lot of money for a good burrito.

868
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,540
I no longer buy the cheap burritos because they,

869
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,409
they literally just don't taste like anything.

870
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,239
And

871
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,590
I can't be bothered to make the burrito myself because to make a good burrito,

872
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,459
you know, you're talking seven or eight fillings.

873
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:42,610
-- That's
-- a

874
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:42,959
lot of

875
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,120
work.

876
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,860
It's a lot of work,

877
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,179
right? I'm literally gonna make a Mexican meal tonight. I'm making rice.

878
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:54,189
I'm reheating some corn. Um uh Flautas, the little, the little like micro to,

879
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,060
I love those things and I'm going to cook. Um

880
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,459
God, forgive me, I'm gonna make some chicken fingers.

881
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,820
Your Mexican food.

882
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,340
I know, right? Because I realize I have nothing else meat wise in the freezer

883
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,260
and

884
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,949
it's not going to be great, but you know, it's food,

885
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,310
it love salt on it.

886
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:15,409
-- That's fine.
-- You live in Canada and you're, you're German, like

887
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:15,969
right

888
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:17,500
next,

889
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:20,024
I'm gonna give you a link to put in the show

890
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:24,145
notes that is totally topical and also fits into the,

891
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,784
the package arriving for you.

892
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:28,385
You have to, no one knows what any of that means.

893
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:32,195
Oh, sorry. So, about once a year now. Kind of a tradition before Christmas.

894
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:34,425
I mailed Josh a package of food

895
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,000
of like weird stuff I can't get in the

896
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,300
-- United States and
-- it's not just Canadian stuff like,

897
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,280
uh, one year it was cheesy and Coffee Crisp.

898
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:41,300
Uh,

899
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:47,610
another year it was um, uh, Italian Rio tuna packed in oil and like a German like

900
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,800
Renee uh fish, which is my favorite brand because

901
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,209
I,

902
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:52,489
I actually been to the Island of

903
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,010
Rugen.

904
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,810
It's a very nice island, very cold water.

905
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,229
You gotta get this story.

906
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,610
Uh, I sent

907
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,489
Josh this year a package of, um, cup of soups from Cnor

908
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,649
and from a Dutch brand who I can't even remember the name of. But

909
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Kor has a recipe website,

910
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,070
including Mexican recipes.

911
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,629
I mean, of course they do.

912
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,760
No, no, no, but there's, but you don't go to the American website.

913
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,550
You go to the German one and the stuff that they sort of say is Mexican food.

914
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,229
How exciting

915
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,320
-- it, it's just mind blowing
-- like it's just so

916
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,360
off the walls. Insane.

917
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:25,540
That

918
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:25,780
sounds

919
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:26,600
-- amazing.
-- I love

920
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:26,850
it.

921
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,409
It's like

922
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:30,060
bratwurst tacos or something like it's just

923
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:34,860
we call that fusion, it's fusion cooking.

924
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:37,610
