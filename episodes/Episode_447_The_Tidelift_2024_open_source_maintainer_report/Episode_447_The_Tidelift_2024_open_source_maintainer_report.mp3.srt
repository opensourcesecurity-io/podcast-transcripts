Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself. Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,250
and my partner in trying to help make things a little bit less worse. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:16,180
Do I make things less worse?

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,350
No, I said we try.

4
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:20,959
-- Ok, I'll accept
-- try. I didn't, I didn't say we're accomplishing it.

5
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,760
II, I try, I do try to

6
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,000
make things better wherever I can. I'll agree with that.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,559
-- Oh, no, no, no,
-- I better would be. No, no, no, I'm not going to go that far.

8
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:33,165
I'm going to go less worse. Like, let's be achievable.

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,994
Sucks less. Let's set realistic goals.

10
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,354
Ok. Ok.

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,944
-- Whatever, whatever,
-- like my yard, I mowed my yard for the first time in a month.

12
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:43,915
So it's less worse. It's not better. It's just less worse

13
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:44,715
a month.

14
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:46,075
That seems like a long time.

15
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,314
It was really hot for a while and then it rained

16
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:49,794
a bunch and then it was hot and it was like,

17
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:50,994
never a good time to mow it because

18
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,305
it was too hot

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,250
or the grass was wet, you know?

20
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,599
-- And when the grass is wet, like
-- anyway, all right,

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,139
I'm not gonna ask you too hot is because you live in Alberta?

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,419
30 it was up to 3035.

23
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:02,369
We had,

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,889
we had five days, over 30

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,459
Â°C in September. Like that's never happened. Very

26
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:07,349
normal.

27
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:08,900
-- Oh,
-- totally. Totally.

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,160
All right. All right. We're gonna talk about

29
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:15,855
the, I'm gonna pull up the tab, so I get the actual title. Correct.

30
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:20,845
It's the 2024 tide list. State of the open source maintainer report.

31
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:24,044
-- That is its official title. We'll put a link in the show notes, of
-- course. Ok.

32
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:26,154
And so let's just clarify two terms.

33
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,705
One open source means exactly what you think it means here.

34
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,625
What does

35
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:33,044
-- maintainer mean? I because I forgot to
-- check to Ashley.

36
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,864
It's the people who took the survey.

37
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,690
You know what? That's actually a good, that's actually the correct answer.

38
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,709
I know it is because I've taken this survey in the past and it's like,

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,169
am I a maintainer kind of

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,529
here's what drives me nuts is, yeah,

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,080
they say in mid 2024 Tide Lift fielded its third

42
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:52,250
survey of open source maintainers plural over the phone.

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,059
See, that's what kind of always confuses me. They use the singular in the title.

44
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,500
And I'm like, there's like the one person like we're just,

45
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:02,005
it, it's like the guy. It's like that little stub in the XK CD comic. It's that guy.

46
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:06,276
-- It's
-- like the royal we herd. Ok. I want to start this

47
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,015
conversation by preface.

48
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:11,776
We have not reached out to Tide Lift nor did we invite them on the show.

49
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:12,695
And I thought about this.

50
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,235
Actually, I thought, oh, I should because I, I know a bunch of those guys.

51
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:19,526
I worked with them at Red Hat, but I don't, I don't want to talk to them yet about this.

52
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,145
Maybe in the future, like tide lift.

53
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:24,322
-- If you're listening, you know, get in touch with,
-- we will talk about it and then they,

54
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,231
they can correct us.

55
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,352
They, they will hopefully correct us.

56
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,932
But more importantly is just the fact that I want Kurt and I to have a

57
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,632
very raw and honest conversation about this report

58
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,531
versus Tide Lift is going to will say,

59
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,942
be a little more polite than, than I suspect we will be.

60
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,602
And so

61
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:44,421
Tide Lift, you are welcome to come and talk about this, but not yet.

62
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:45,822
No, we

63
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:46,031
uh

64
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,100
yeah, they're probably more polite than we are.

65
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,570
All right.

66
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,369
I want to start by just asking you, what was your very first kind of takeaway?

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,839
Like one sentence?

68
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,910
Take away when you saw this report,

69
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,759
-- you mean
-- like when I saw it come out or when

70
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,320
-- I actually kind of flipped through it
-- when you read it,

71
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,809
whatever?

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,729
-- Ok.
-- So

73
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,669
essentially one sentence,

74
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:08,089
car things are probably worse than this report leads us to believe.

75
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,169
Oh, that is an interesting

76
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,537
and I agree with that.

77
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,957
And my first thought was this all feels like for anyone

78
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,216
who's been kind of paying attention for the last year,

79
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:19,136
it's the no fuck

80
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,977
shit report. This is not new

81
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,216
and I feel like it's also not getting better.

82
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:28,266
Well, actually, I would say it's in many ways getting worse.

83
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:31,156
And, and, and what's nice though? Is this actually quantify?

84
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:34,246
Well, I'm going to say quantifies it even though technically,

85
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:38,904
well, there's 400 respondents. So that's statistically relevant, right? It is.

86
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,544
But I mean, obviously the numbers in this report are not perfect,

87
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,093
but with 400 respondents, they're probably close enough.

88
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:44,904
Yes.

89
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,944
But on a sort of anecdotal data slash qualitative data,

90
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,203
there are a lot of common themes that

91
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:54,184
match with what I know

92
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:57,904
to be true. So to quote Stephen Colbert, you know, the truth in us, it feels true.

93
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:58,304
I wanted to

94
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,850
true.

95
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,470
It reaffirms my biases and beliefs. So I like this report.

96
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:07,570
Now, I I want to here, here's one thing though I would say in terms of like bias

97
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,901
it, I, I just had, I define the number 19% of the respondents are paid by tide lift.

98
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:18,071
So that's a, I'm sure they reached out to all of the people they work with.

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,351
And we're like, hey, we're doing a survey. Can you please fill it out?

100
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,351
So, my suspicion

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,740
is

102
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,500
that kind of lifts some of these numbers up a bit and makes it look less dire

103
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,359
and maybe it, it really is.

104
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:35,140
Well, there's a, there's a couple of, in my mind, there's a bunch of key takeaways,

105
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,140
which is in some ways things are getting worse.

106
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,619
And a good example of this is the XZ

107
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,445
uh thing that happened.

108
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:43,704
-- Yeah,
-- they have like a huge section just on that. Yeah.

109
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:49,204
-- Well,
-- because it, it has led to people being less willing to just blindly like,

110
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,684
oh you want to come into the project and be an admin?

111
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,204
Sure. Cool. Or oh

112
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:56,644
yeah, this pr fixes a bunch of stuff that's important, you say? Sure, cool. Like

113
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:57,234
they

114
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,450
without mentioning current events,

115
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:06,940
there are threat actors that we know to be active in the open source space

116
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:10,709
and you can no longer like 2025 years ago.

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,399
If somebody came to you with a device driver for the links kernel, you'd be like,

118
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,459
yeah,

119
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,109
sure put it in or if somebody came and it's

120
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,559
like I want to rewrite this device driver entirely.

121
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,920
Sure, whatever man do it.

122
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,079
Like go ahead.

123
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,179
No really like oh Kurt,

124
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,679
you want to take over the PHP open ID plug in because you say you want it to work.

125
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,850
OK. Go for it.

126
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:33,100
Statistically, you can probably still blindly accept a lot of people

127
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:37,619
because the amount of like legitimate activity vastly outweighs the amount of,

128
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,059
you know,

129
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,739
naughty bad activity.

130
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,859
But the problem is,

131
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,410
you know, it's kind of like that goalkeepers dilemma.

132
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,290
If you don't like dive to save the ball, everybody's going to look at you and be like,

133
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:46,829
what are you doing?

134
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,869
Like why didn't you try.

135
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,549
Right.

136
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,049
And so you, if you are to be trusting and let people in

137
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,799
and something bad happens, you're going to get yelled at and conversely,

138
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,980
they're also stating the problem now is, is if I do be a little bit more suspicious,

139
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,739
I'm driving a lot of people away. So I, I like that. This report

140
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,690
really quantifies a lot of, oh, it's not just me,

141
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,220
there's other people worried about this,

142
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,320
there's other people that are having this problem.

143
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,149
And I think that for that reason,

144
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,399
this report is invaluable because it validates

145
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,679
a lot of what's people are dealing with

146
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,239
and they, at least now they know they're not on their own.

147
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,730
Like there's other people suffering the same problems.

148
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,470
So I want to start with what I think is the most dire statistic in this report.

149
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,519
And it was basically, I believe it was exactly the same last year.

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,290
Yeah.

151
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,750
60%

152
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,750
of maintainers have quit or have considered quitting

153
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,809
their maintenance work. 60%.

154
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,790
And in fact, on the report this year, I don't know what the number was last year.

155
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,299
Well, it says 58%

156
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,070
but anyway, it was 22%. Yes, I have quit. 38%. Yes, I have considered quitting.

157
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,619
Yeah, that is dire

158
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,140
and I, I don't want to, like, try to spin this in a positive way,

159
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,739
but like that is a scary number.

160
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,019
Yeah,

161
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:09,250
I mean, there's a lot of software I depend on that. If it goes stale, probably be ok.

162
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,119
But there's some stuff that it probably won't be ok and there will be problems.

163
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,649
And what gets me is economically like this system, it's like let's encrypt.

164
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,049
If you even charged a penny for it, it would

165
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,912
cripple usage because you'd have to have a credit card and payments and everything.

166
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,622
And so being that it's free and licensed appropriately,

167
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:29,113
open source has enabled the modern software industry full stop.

168
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,882
Like there's no more arguing.

169
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:33,113
Like 20 years ago, we were saying, oh, open source is doing well.

170
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:36,173
It's gonna help out it's gonna be good. Close source has a place but now like

171
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,572
like straight up WSL hyphen hyphen install on a windows

172
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,002
system and you get a choice of Linux distro,

173
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:43,773
like the world

174
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,686
is so much more efficient. It's,

175
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:49,615
it's kind of like the US in the colonial days of like basically

176
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:53,805
stealing all the patent data from Britain to jumpstart their economy and industry.

177
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,325
And that's what like open source has enabled,

178
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:58,696
not just the modern software industry,

179
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,805
but the software industry has enabled everything.

180
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,325
Everyone who listens to the show knows this.

181
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:07,605
Well, I I don't think a lot of people really think about it. Like

182
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,925
without this open source being this cheap and available,

183
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,260
we would be 10 or 15 years behind.

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,450
Sure. Sure.

185
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,140
Like the cloud revolution wouldn't have happened without open source.

186
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,290
That is correct. Right.

187
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,290
Or rather the cloud revolution would have happened and it

188
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,619
would look like what oracle and VM Ware are offering,

189
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,809
which would not be pretty.

190
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,690
-- So,
-- based on the, the graph

191
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,700
I just mentioned 60%. Right.

192
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,330
There is another kind of picture,

193
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,957
image graphic. I don't recall it,

194
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,789
but they've got paid versus hobbyist open source. Right.

195
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:42,388
And this where this has my, my, my brain wondering,

196
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:47,008
61% of unpaid hobbyists are solo open

197
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:50,578
source projects versus professional and semi professional.

198
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,679
Only 26%

199
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:53,729
are

200
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,158
single. Yeah.

201
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:55,758
And

202
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:00,919
two or more is 53% in that bucket. But in unpaid hobbyist, two or more is only 20%.

203
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,809
So, like 60% have considered quitting.

204
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:08,809
And I also feel like 60% are running their own projects. I have a strong suspicion

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,570
that Venn diagram has an enormous amount of overlap.

206
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,890
It's probably an oblate spheroid,

207
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:15,770
right?

208
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,450
-- With like a little
-- big

209
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:17,650
words.

210
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:18,690
I mean,

211
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,969
-- the thing that always gets me.
-- Well, hold on one more, one more. The graph above. Then

212
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,840
I'm, you'd think if I was smart,

213
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:28,229
I would have taken some screenshots of these prior to us con conversing.

214
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,640
But no, no, I'm not smart.

215
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,650
Then above that, 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.

216
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,650
So I feel like that 60% keeps showing up over and over

217
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,924
-- in this report, they're
-- unpaid for that work. Right.

218
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,544
They probably have jobs, I hope.

219
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,875
Yes, they, they almost certainly have some other

220
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:45,695
sources

221
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:46,744
and not all of them

222
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,114
because there were some famous cases of people who are literally like I'm broke.

223
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,755
I don't have a job and I'm still maintaining this project.

224
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,244
Can somebody send some money?

225
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,905
Like we've seen that happen?

226
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,034
Right. Right.

227
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,955
But hopefully the vast majority of them do have

228
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:01,205
a day job,

229
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,494
so to speak.

230
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:04,344
Yeah, I don't know. I,

231
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,989
I just, I keep coming back to part of the impossibility of this is

232
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,450
the scale of it.

233
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:11,690
Like we're talking

234
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,020
hundreds of thousands of people, the developers

235
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,010
-- and no,
-- we're talking about 400. That's the thing.

236
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,090
Well, and, and what I was about to say though is

237
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:26,169
of that 420% work with Tide Lift and get paid.

238
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,729
So the real numbers are,

239
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:29,200
well,

240
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,409
-- it's probably more than 60%
-- Tide Lift is probably paying

241
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,570
less than 1% of open source developers is my guess,

242
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,989
definitely less because there's literally millions of open source developers

243
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:40,570
uh

244
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:41,869
depending like

245
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,969
there's a lot, I don't think it's millions, but it's well tens of thousands,

246
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,510
hundreds of thousands, probably.

247
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,799
-- No,
-- I've, I've kind of a pack of the envelope looking at things anyways.

248
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,609
It's the the thing to remember is there's

249
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,780
millions of open source projects and developers,

250
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,809
but how many of them are actually used by somebody else

251
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,330
as a dependency or like as a popular plug in?

252
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,330
And that very funnels quickly.

253
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,770
Yes,

254
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,760
a perfect example of this funnel is you look

255
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,400
at how many people are involved in this project

256
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,250
you have the data you've run where it's like one person or less, uh,

257
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,869
90 something percent.

258
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,450
And by the time you get to, like, what three people it's, you know, that the, it's,

259
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,460
-- it's vastly squished.
-- I

260
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,789
wouldn't call it a curve. It's just one giant spike at one

261
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,780
-- and then it falls off
-- very good. It goes like 23

262
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,559
to

263
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,299
not zero but close to zero.

264
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,479
Every, the, all of the other numbers are zero

265
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,770
because they're functionally rounding errors compared

266
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,280
to the single maintainer number,

267
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,679
which is in the millions.

268
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,190
Yeah.

269
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,909
Yeah. There's not many Linux kernel projects or Apache Maven projects or Curl.

270
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:49,190
No, no. And and it's OK. So tide lift draws many conclusions. But I want to

271
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:53,150
kind of this is something that I feel like comes up all the time

272
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,950
where a lot of people listening to the show are gonna know this, you and I know this

273
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,210
but like the Linux kernel is not normal, right?

274
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,840
Curl

275
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:02,010
is not normal.

276
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,359
They are well used and also well maintained.

277
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,729
There's so much else going on here.

278
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:12,729
And I feel like when most people think of open source, they think of the Linux kernel,

279
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,390
they don't think of the six

280
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:18,283
100 N PM packages maintained by 12 people that

281
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:21,422
they're using to basically prop up their entire business.

282
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,773
So like I'm on the STF board to and look at these projects

283
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,103
stf the Sovereign Tech Fund, right?

284
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:31,333
So they're the German entity that is, you know, funding open source work.

285
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:35,572
And a great example is one of the recent ones was, uh Express Js which,

286
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:38,195
uh, yeah, I think you would agree is widely used.

287
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,575
Yes. Yes, it is.

288
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,276
And part of, for example, they want to do some stuff, like,

289
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:45,335
have a scope on N PM and get all their projects under scope

290
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:48,716
so that people know they're actually getting the real Express.

291
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,116
Yeah, that makes sense. Right.

292
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,036
And I'm like,

293
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:54,075
oh, yeah, they haven't done that because I'm like, yeah, when you start, like,

294
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,755
I want to install Express, like, where the heck is it?

295
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:57,700
And

296
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:01,719
Express is a wildly successful project. Like it is.

297
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,729
I don't even want to guess how many

298
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,859
percent of websites and traffic go through Express.

299
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:10,659
Right. Well, into the double digits. It's a lot for sure. Yeah,

300
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:13,450
they have a ton of people working with them and for them

301
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,030
and even they are struggling or another good one is Apache.

302
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,130
They want to do some stuff.

303
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,619
And I was looking at, I'm like, well,

304
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,469
why can't the Apache Software Foundation fund this?

305
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,679
And then I looked at the Apache Software

306
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,489
Foundation's financial reports for the last three years.

307
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,799
And I'm like, oh, yeah. Yeah. No, they can't fund this at all. Not even a little bit.

308
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,559
-- Yeah. It's like a one or 2 million only
-- isn't just a hair over 2 million

309
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,599
of which about 1.3 million is spent on infrastructure. Right.

310
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,978
Which doesn't leave a whole lot of money for

311
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:41,278
like paying a pile of developers to do work.

312
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:46,788
-- Like it's, they're a very lenient, like they're very lean. Like
-- most of the open

313
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,288
source foundations are, the open

314
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,297
source foundations are not flush with cash

315
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,497
well, and they're not paying their top people millions of dollars.

316
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:57,018
With kind of the notable exception of Mozilla, if you look at their financials,

317
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,528
their people get quite a lot.

318
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:01,247
But the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla

319
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,377
Corporation are different things as well.

320
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:06,057
But again, I think this is another example where like people

321
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:06,466
at Mozilla,

322
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:08,226
they look at the Linux Foundation, they're like,

323
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:11,536
oh look at the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars here.

324
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:15,906
Open source foundations are doing great and it's like, no, no, just those two.

325
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,406
And I think part of the challenge is,

326
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,705
is that a lot of the stuff that people actually use and interact with

327
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:21,585
is

328
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:24,036
by definition wildly successful otherwise they would

329
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,426
not be using and interacting with it,

330
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:25,625
right?

331
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:27,116
Like the Linux kernel one

332
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,786
Firefox did well.

333
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:32,426
And there's, but there's all the kind of underpinnings and dependencies, you know,

334
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:35,505
like on master when I ask like, how big is Chrome or Chromium or whatever

335
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,164
guys? Like

336
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,893
one guy answered with, you know, it's this millions of lines of code or whatever,

337
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:43,893
but like that some of that is just headers and not the actual stuff I'm like, oh,

338
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,323
so it's bigger and I think that's part of the problem is that there's a

339
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:51,083
lot of bias here because people don't use those like little tiny foundational NP MS.

340
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:53,273
They pull in something that uses it, like

341
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:58,273
going back to this, those things need to be maintained and, and well and improved.

342
00:14:58,403 --> 00:14:58,953
Yes,

343
00:14:59,283 --> 00:14:59,934
because

344
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,244
like we talked about last week,

345
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:04,953
there's a whole bunch of who is libraries and probably a bunch of them could be

346
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,702
from some updates to assume that the who is server might be more.

347
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:08,512
Sure.

348
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,361
Sure. Ok. Ok.

349
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:12,892
I want to move on to another interesting data point that I have a,

350
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:15,432
I have a hunch about but, but I'm, we'll see.

351
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:19,252
So it's on page 17 of the report and it says maintainers are spending

352
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:23,151
three x more time on security than they did a few years ago.

353
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,581
And they go into, they talk about like the open SSF scorecard,

354
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,252
which I don't have a lot of nice things to say about.

355
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,161
-- Like there's old episodes.
-- I think the problem is

356
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,361
the OS the open SSF scorecard is not good,

357
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,070
-- but there's not even anything close to an alternative.
-- No,

358
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:42,659
there's not. But that doesn't mean we should just use the open SSF scorecard though.

359
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:46,309
-- But the problem is people again have to be seen to be doing so
-- anyway, I don't want,

360
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,950
I don't want to dwell on

361
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:50,265
openness of scorecard right now. So here's the thing. Here's my suspicion.

362
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,645
Developers are spending three times more

363
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,135
on security I have a suspicion.

364
00:15:55,145 --> 00:16:00,205
The reason this is, is because so uh tide lift asked us in 2021

365
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:04,604
I think 20 yeah, 2021. And they haven't asked it again until this year.

366
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,179
And so the three X numbers from 2021 to 2024 not 2023 to 2024.

367
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:13,450
And in 2021 the world was very different.

368
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,599
You didn't have depend

369
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:14,809
aot

370
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,900
you didn't have all of the crazy free utilities,

371
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:21,679
github offers. We didn't have all of the security things N PM has been doing

372
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,059
like the Python, the PSF when you're using

373
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,780
PP,

374
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,119
they're doing a lot of like two factor off and things like that.

375
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,669
And so I think

376
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,460
the universe has moved on. And so the thing I wonder

377
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,419
is our developers doing three X more time on security because they

378
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,039
want to or are they doing three X more time and security?

379
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,219
Because they have to,

380
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,159
I think it's a combination of two things.

381
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,380
One, they're having to do things like two fa and M fa

382
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,739
either setting it up or using it that, that eats up your time,

383
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,840
right?

384
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,239
And number two,

385
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:53,559
they're

386
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,559
doing a lot of compliance driven security.

387
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,140
The old pan SSF scorecard being a prime example of it

388
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,729
because there's what else can they do?

389
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,699
-- Like they're gonna make their own security program that would be worse
-- probably.

390
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,290
Well, they don't have the manpower. So, so

391
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,300
one thing I have seen happen is if you're a project, people will say like, oh,

392
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,579
your scorecard score is bad or this is bad or this is bad or an auditor said this and

393
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,868
sometimes even though you don't like or want to do

394
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,520
whatever thing it is they're claiming you should do,

395
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,630
you just do it to make it go away.

396
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,670
I mean, I do this all the time when I'm dealing with security reports at work

397
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,530
where it's like, all right, I've just justified this finding, you know,

398
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,310
10 times to 10 different customers.

399
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,910
Like I'm sick of it. It's stupid. Like let's just deal like let's fix it

400
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,119
even though it's just paper mache

401
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,410
over the hole.

402
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,699
I don't care. I'm sick of justifying this.

403
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,869
A great example is Jackson data bind has, you know,

404
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,390
lots of remote code executions in its

405
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:50,770
deser

406
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,790
it used to,

407
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,150
they fixed it kind of.

408
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,439
But anyways,

409
00:17:55,449 --> 00:18:00,140
um satellite version five or six shipped it but did not use that never has never will.

410
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,199
-- Elastic,
-- did the same thing in elastic search

411
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,239
and customers would complain. And I'd be like, we don't use that code.

412
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,839
We will not use that code. We,

413
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:10,119
there's like no way for us to use that code. Like it doesn't do anything

414
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:10,959
and

415
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,319
it got to the point where you like, yeah,

416
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,680
we just need to update this so that they stop bothering us.

417
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,500
Yeah, we did that at elastic all the time.

418
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,089
We didn't use the, it was the, the polymorphic deser

419
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:21,520
routine

420
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,239
and that's a mouthful.

421
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,609
But I, I like, I will be,

422
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,270
I'm gonna be like old and senile someday and just saying the word polymorphic

423
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:29,599
deer,

424
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,530
it'll be like the guy can't say any other words,

425
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,430
but he keeps saying this one for some reason, he's

426
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,550
having flashbacks

427
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:37,339
for

428
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:37,670
Jay.

429
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,469
But, but the point is like, yeah, that was, that's a great example.

430
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,540
We get reports constantly saying, oh, you're,

431
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,439
you're vulnerable to these critical CV ES.

432
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,300
And it's like we're not using the code and like, can you prove it?

433
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,589
I'm like, actually I can because you have to

434
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:55,631
use these functions to be vulnerable, which if you search the source code,

435
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,112
they're not there.

436
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:00,531
And so the problem is you like we at Red Hat then

437
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,852
waste time upgrading and doing stuff we don't need to do.

438
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:08,421
But on the flip side, if you have 100 customers all wasting a couple hours

439
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,712
dealing with this because you just don't fix it,

440
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,011
then the answer is you just fix it because that's what

441
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,112
customers are paying you for is to make problems go away.

442
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,751
And so like, I'm of the mind where

443
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:21,553
Red Hat is paid, they should make their customers' lives happy.

444
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:22,234
But an open

445
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:23,953
source project that you're using for free.

446
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,034
No, they can do whatever they want. They can ignore you.

447
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:29,413
They, they can't though, rather they can ignore you. But then there's,

448
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,354
they get like harassed.

449
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,874
-- Yes.
-- And that's let me, let me find the graph. Uh

450
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,423
I'm, I'm dumb Kurt.

451
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,024
Yeah, honestly, even if I took screenshots,

452
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,614
I just would end up taking screenshots of every graph and had a document,

453
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:41,813
I still couldn't find anything in.

454
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:44,303
So let's I know what it looks like. Here it is

455
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:44,864
uh P

456
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,946
page 38.

457
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:50,026
It says not being financially compensated, blah, blah, blah,

458
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:52,355
top things maintainers dislike about their work.

459
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:55,895
Obviously not being compensated is number one unsurprisingly.

460
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:58,135
But then you've got number two is feel

461
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,676
underappreciated or like the work is thankless.

462
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:04,776
Adds to my personal stress, asked to comply with requirements.

463
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,826
I don't have, I mean, this is literally all the things we just talked about, right?

464
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:12,186
Users are too demanding and expect too much of me. Like,

465
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,209
although I will say I find it amusing that um

466
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,420
coming in at what 33% is reviewing codes

467
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,339
submitted by others with a narrow self interest.

468
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:26,300
-- Which,
-- well, but what else the users like? Why?

469
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,770
What is my economic incentive to make to add to this project?

470
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,459
-- Well, it's to fix any problem. I
-- have something I care about. Exactly,

471
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:33,800
you know.

472
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:34,910
Yes.

473
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,469
OK. I'm just gonna say it again at the STF.

474
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,060
We had a project asking for money and one of the

475
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:43,339
things they want to do is long term support releases.

476
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,910
And it's clear that essentially it's

477
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,119
two or three big companies that are involved in this project that essentially want

478
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,650
the STF to pay for LTs versions because they don't want to fund it.

479
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,300
Of

480
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:54,469
course,

481
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,859
it's just, it's pretty obvious that that's what's going on here

482
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,650
because, like, these are some major, like,

483
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,089
top five it companies,

484
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:03,449
you know,

485
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:06,050
guess which three they are?

486
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,760
-- Well or two in this case,
-- it's, it's hilarious to me sometimes how, like,

487
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,219
utterly penny pinching and cheap.

488
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,099
These, like Mega

489
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,439
Corps are that use all this over

490
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,385
sometimes.

491
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:16,555
And like, they want

492
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,265
an LTs version of this product because they're clearly using

493
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,535
it in production and they want it to just work.

494
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,515
Cool. Well, they can pay for that. Why? No, like,

495
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,954
nobody outside of them legitimately would want this

496
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,594
because the people running this for like,

497
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,760
or

498
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,609
it's cheaper, it is to try to,

499
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:38,089
to bike, to bamboozle the stf into paying for it.

500
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,130
Right.

501
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:40,609
And so that one, like, went

502
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,599
to the second last one and I actually, that's when I'm gonna, like,

503
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:44,819
die on that hill of like,

504
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,000
this is not a project that should be funded

505
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,520
but back to this. Yeah. I mean, why,

506
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,109
why would I get involved in a project to make the world a better place?

507
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,790
Like, there's like all,

508
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,319
there's very few people that are like that

509
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,180
and they're already involved in open source.

510
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:03,180
I don't think you can make that assertion that there's very few people,

511
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,310
I think the vast majority of people do want to make the world

512
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,310
a better place and they do things in an attempt to do so.

513
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,790
Granted, there are some people who probably don't,

514
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:15,579
although maybe it's just because their idea of a better place will say is the end,

515
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:15,939
a

516
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:18,400
modern society and maybe that's what it is.

517
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,020
But I think virtually every person I know is happy to volunteer and is happy to help.

518
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,170
Well, but also, I mean, maybe to make it a bit more nuanced, for example,

519
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,280
if they are paid,

520
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,810
their boss is not going to pay them to work

521
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,920
on features that their business does not need or want.

522
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:33,069
And that

523
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,599
often happens,

524
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,550
-- you know.
-- Well, OK, I I want to take AAA little diversion here on that note. And I think

525
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,880
when a company does open source, right,

526
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,170
that act like what the company wants

527
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,569
and what the open source project does.

528
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,500
I think if done correctly are the same thing and I'm going to use Sift

529
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,089
and Gripe at Anchor of this is we have these two pretty widely used projects,

530
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,069
Sift and Gripe Sift is an S bomb generator.

531
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,609
Gripe is a vulnerability scanner and we have purposely erected a firewall between

532
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,609
the enterprise side of the house and the open source side of the

533
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,650
house and the open source side of the house is allowed to do

534
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,182
their thing the way they want to do it.

535
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,741
We are but a community member in their community where we can file bugs.

536
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:21,871
Granted we can talk to them a little easier than others. Can.

537
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:27,802
But the view is that whatever like this team does we say for the community

538
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:31,121
and put community in air quotes like that is what is best for us.

539
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,302
And that is generally held true.

540
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,832
Well, can I offer a subtle,

541
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:38,112
you're essentially cheating and letting the market speak?

542
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:38,322
And,

543
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:41,261
but I, I think Red Hat was really good at this.

544
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,673
Also, back in the day

545
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,443
is they would just hire open source developers

546
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:47,333
And generally speaking,

547
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:50,313
they were told to develop an open source.

548
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,803
And there was not like, oh, we need this one feature granted.

549
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:55,673
Sometimes it was like, we really need a thing like help us out here.

550
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,994
-- But a lot
-- of those features were actually

551
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,634
-- reasonably good ideas.
-- Yeah, I agree.

552
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:02,994
But corporations did actually need

553
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:05,923
or there were bug fixes where there would be large

554
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,874
scale users of the software at Red Hat that,

555
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:09,874
you know, they're like, oh, like once every 50,000

556
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,215
operations, this thing like does a weird thing,

557
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,206
you know, that normal people won't run into.

558
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:17,526
And one nice thing is when you, when you hunt down and fix those bugs,

559
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,975
you invariably find a whole bunch of easier bugs

560
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:23,196
as well while you're looking through the code and solve those and, you know,

561
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:25,125
generally improve the software for sure.

562
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:28,715
I think part of this is is letting markets speak.

563
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,715
But also a good example of this is one reason I love wordpress

564
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,946
is because there's like three bajillion wordpress.

565
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:38,446
Developers and administrators. It's true, right? Like

566
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,790
I can literally throw a stick out my

567
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,140
front door and probably hit a wordpress developer.

568
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,579
Yes.

569
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:46,910
You know,

570
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,660
whereas if I build a framework or I do something in house,

571
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,880
well,

572
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,750
there's like those three people that understand how it works.

573
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,329
Yeah, for sure. For sure.

574
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,229
A lot of companies I think go into open source with we want this,

575
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,579
this and this and it's like, no, actually you don't want that what you want

576
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,390
and the way to do it is this, this and this and it will have like a very long term payoff.

577
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,099
But a very

578
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:12,295
like wordpress is a great example of like, yeah, it's 30% of the world's websites.

579
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,175
Yes. Yes. That's

580
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,275
even if they lose like 90% of their customers,

581
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:19,905
they'll still be limping along in 200 years,

582
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:23,295
-- didn't
-- they? They're the ones who are selling the 100 year domains, right?

583
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:23,844
Yeah.

584
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:24,214
Yeah.

585
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:25,535
But I mean, that's the thing, right? Like,

586
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:29,204
even if Wordpress shrinks by 90% that's still 3% of

587
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:31,714
the world's websites that's enough to run a business on.

588
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,689
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, a lot of free users but whatever, you know, whatever

589
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,569
I want to keep going, I wanna keep going.

590
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,329
So

591
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,890
we mentioned XZ A while back and they have some graphs about XZ actually,

592
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,329
which are on page 43.

593
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,530
So

594
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,910
I, I found the first graph they have,

595
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,640
it says I'm less trusting a poor request from non maintainer contributors or

596
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,170
feel the need to vet them more carefully and the agreement is 66%.

597
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:58,250
But here's what I find funny about that, the JIA

598
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,410
Tan character who infiltrated XZ spent years building up

599
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:06,359
of horror with the, the author.

600
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:13,670
And so I, I ironically, 66% again, sixtyish percent who keeps coming up Dell,

601
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,670
people are gonna be like, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna investigate this,

602
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,569
this pull request that came in out of the blue versus

603
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,489
I have someone who's been working with me for three years and I'm going to trust them.

604
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,229
That's a tough one, you know.

605
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,310
Well, that, and that goes back to like we can't like if a project is like, Kurt,

606
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,540
I'm gonna need to see government ID to validate who you are.

607
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,459
I'm gonna be like, no,

608
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,569
I'm not going to participate in this or

609
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,750
like when Google had their insane blog entry about having a real name policy for open

610
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,089
developers. Like

611
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:46,760
that's, they're literally, that will have secondary effects.

612
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,619
Like there will be people that get killed or die because of that. Quite possible.

613
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,609
That's assuming that policy is even legal.

614
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,650
Like I'm pretty sure GDPR is gonna have harsh words with Google.

615
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,630
I'm pretty sure they aren't friends already. So

616
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,689
there's a lot of stuff that people propose as a solution or as a way to deal with this,

617
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,359
but

618
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:10,089
it's not that it won't work. It's that it's not physically possible. Right.

619
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,949
Like, and it won't work as well. Like it won't do what you want to do.

620
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,599
Right. Because

621
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,760
standing up sock puppets and making fake people is easy.

622
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,189
Like I just did it again yesterday for a project.

623
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:25,550
I'm not going to ask any questions about this. And

624
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,670
we're gonna,

625
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,739
anyway,

626
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,959
standing up a sock puppet and putting a one or two or three year history on it.

627
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,890
Especially now with the help of A I, like you can do this so efficiently it

628
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,140
is easier.

629
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,420
Well, remember the t-shirt thing where, uh,

630
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,349
what company was it that gave away t-shirts if

631
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,349
you got an open source pull request accepted,

632
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,560
I think that was Digital Ocean for Hot

633
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:46,910
HTO.

634
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:50,185
Yes, that's what it was. I remember all these open

635
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:53,344
source people are like, I'm getting flooded with BS poll requests

636
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:58,135
and Digital Ocean is like, oh, well, we'll make it so you can opt out and it's like, no,

637
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,295
that's not how this.

638
00:27:59,305 --> 00:27:59,755
No.

639
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:00,045
Right.

640
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,194
Well, now you have to opt into

641
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:02,555
Heber

642
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:03,364
fest.

643
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:03,915
But

644
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:07,094
yes, like when things like that cause problems,

645
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:08,415
you think you can

646
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,400
do something to keep a nation state out. Well, you can't like,

647
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,449
you just can't

648
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,000
for sure, for sure.

649
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,910
And so I think that's part of the challenge here is we need to look at what is

650
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:23,349
like, what can we actually physically do to make things better then?

651
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,560
Will it work or not? And will it have like worse secondary effects.

652
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,829
Like, yes, we could.

653
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:30,550
My favorite always is like, people like you can check ID and I'm like, cool.

654
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,579
How do I tell if your ID is real or fake? I don't know what a real US passport looks like.

655
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,949
I think it has an eagle on the front.

656
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:39,984
-- I have one and I couldn't tell you.
-- I don't even know what color it is. It's,

657
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:40,844
it's,

658
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:42,175
yeah.

659
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:43,005
Right.

660
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:43,285
Like, oh,

661
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:45,505
the new Canadian passports just came out and when I first saw

662
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,214
them I thought it was like a mock up like a,

663
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:49,204
like a meme because it was so hideous.

664
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:52,704
And I'm like, oh, I'm glad I have the old one because the new one just looks stupid.

665
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:56,604
-- Does it have a maple leaf on it? Please tell me it has a maple leaf on it.
-- Oh, it's just,

666
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:57,925
uh, it's beyond,

667
00:28:58,334 --> 00:28:59,954
-- um, we'll put
-- a link in the show

668
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:00,525
notes.

669
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:03,525
There's R slash passport porn. Of course, there is.

670
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,689
All right. Anyway, we're going to keep going.

671
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,310
So I wanna, I wanna kind of close this out here because we,

672
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,040
we've gone on and on about this.

673
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,560
I don't feel like we've said anything particularly dicey.

674
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,530
Well, I want to say some things where I think things are going to get a lot worse.

675
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:19,729
Please do.

676
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:22,959
And this is a two parter. So hold your question until the end.

677
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:24,520
The first part.

678
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,530
Is that

679
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:28,709
A I is here and A I generated poll requests and

680
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:31,239
A I generated bug reports and A I generated blah,

681
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:31,569
blah, blah.

682
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:34,260
-- The thing at the bottom about that
-- there's a ton of noise

683
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,500
but there's a second problem which is

684
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,010
in using A I, there's a huge generational divide where

685
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:44,849
the older people and I've, I've experienced this, like I see this in like, you,

686
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:45,329
you are like

687
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:46,099
a I ra ra ra ra,

688
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:52,489
no, no, I'm not against A I, I use it all the time. I'm against you. Selling out to A I.

689
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,729
There's a difference.

690
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,119
I, well, I view A I as like the next spreadsheet.

691
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,560
It's just, it's a massive tool that's,

692
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,420
you know, you don't

693
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,520
anyways.

694
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,885
So the problem is is that I don't want to call them Attackers, but in this situation,

695
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:05,064
we'll call it Attackers and defenders.

696
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:07,444
So the people using A I to generate poll requests and

697
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:10,285
all this other stuff are going to vastly overwhelm the,

698
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,305
the humans.

699
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:15,805
And maybe if these humans refuse to kind of use technology to help them,

700
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:20,234
they're going to get clobbered by poll requests by just all sorts of stuff.

701
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:25,005
And I fear that a lot of older maintainers are going to

702
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,479
potentially leave sooner rather than later as this

703
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:32,239
kind of coming A I tsunami happens.

704
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,079
Are you done because I can answer this?

705
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:36,930
OK. So first of all,

706
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,689
there is a graph about the age of maintainers and there's an age graph,

707
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:42,880
it's towards the bottom.

708
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,530
I've got to be, this is a big report. It's 63 pages. Like, ok, the, the age 58

709
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:50,579
there's those, those bell curves that are,

710
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:53,522
yeah, there's, they show the three Belker and they keep going.

711
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:54,493
They're, they're,

712
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:55,652
they're shifting.

713
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:59,142
And so first of all, most open source is old people.

714
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,383
So you can see there's a generational divide,

715
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,322
but I would say the more concerning generational divide is just the fact that

716
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,383
open source developers continue to age while

717
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:08,062
new people aren't getting to open source.

718
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:09,463
It's a population pyramid.

719
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:10,233
It

720
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,623
-- is,
-- it, it's a population pyramid, right?

721
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,262
Like I don't think it is because

722
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,613
if you look

723
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:20,365
and this is my suspicion. I asked um tide lift about this actually a long time ago,

724
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:24,316
if you look at that, their graph is shifting to the right?

725
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:25,975
Because when you and I were young,

726
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,985
it felt like all the open source people were my age now that I'm old.

727
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:31,625
It feels like all the open source people are my age. Like

728
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,755
I don't think that's a population graph.

729
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:38,026
I think open source is more popular with our particular age

730
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:40,875
group because we grew up in a time when it was

731
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,810
exciting and new and fun.

732
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,119
-- And
-- we've talked about this too, but like a lot of the,

733
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,530
it's hard to join a lot of these

734
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,500
big projects because they're so technically complex.

735
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,359
It can be. We did a whole podcast episode in this, didn't we?

736
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,680
I actually have data for this?

737
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:58,489
This is a recurring theme in the STF applications where about a solid half

738
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,099
or more of the STF applications are like who's going to do the work.

739
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:05,010
And it's us the core developers because this thing is so like there was this one,

740
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,520
it was um particle flow modeling, computational fluid dynamics, right CFD.

741
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,619
And they're like,

742
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,810
yeah, there's like three of us, we all have phd S,

743
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:14,229
we're the ones that are going to do the work

744
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,189
because

745
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,010
there's three of us that have phd

746
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,260
and we wrote the software and like, we're the ones that can do the work. Like it's,

747
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,150
I want to go back to your statement though about A I, OK.

748
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,000
So, first of all, everyone's old,

749
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,829
we're getting older and yes old people generally have trouble

750
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,790
accepting new technology that is like a well known,

751
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,589
I mean, Douglas Adams has that quote, right? Like not new. We all know this.

752
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,270
Now,

753
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,020
here's the thing with open source though is if a project

754
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,920
starts getting flooded with pull requests or bugs or something from,

755
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,869
from A I or whatever, they're just gonna,

756
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,709
they're either gonna quit or they're gonna turn it off.

757
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,750
That's what's gonna happen. There's no, like, secret option

758
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:55,694
where it's like, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna hold hands and sing and adopt a, I like,

759
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,385
if they don't want to, they won't,

760
00:32:57,395 --> 00:33:00,314
and it's either gonna kill their project or they'll just turn it off.

761
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:05,755
And there's actually, uh, there's a podcast. I just listened to, I don't remember

762
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,545
which podcast it was, but it was, it was titled

763
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,750
Open Source, Not Open Contribution. And it was with,

764
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,520
I can't remember the project even now the guy was talking about it. It's not bad.

765
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,810
I will find a link and I will put it in the show notes

766
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,640
because it was, it's worth listening to. But like

767
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,010
this is like we the SQL, well, the, the SQL light,

768
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,250
the episode we've not yet released which everyone will hear at some point.

769
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,520
And Kurt's looking at me like, yes, Kurt, that's right. It hasn't gone out yet. Uh

770
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,859
-- We recorded it a while back.
-- I don't, did we ever talk about SQL Light?

771
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,229
Oh, don't actually they have this exact conversation.

772
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,650
It was on the change log, I think is the name of the podcast. Anyway,

773
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,180
there are open source projects that like, I want to do this work.

774
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,420
I want it to be open source,

775
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,420
but I am completely unwilling to take pull request

776
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,439
from other people because I just don't want to,

777
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:51,459
I can't be bothered

778
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:53,050
and like there's nothing wrong with that.

779
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,689
-- That's still open source and you can do that
-- well,

780
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,130
and you can fork it and have your own version.

781
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,089
And a perfect example is,

782
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:02,609
is YT downloader didn't fix a bug or rather they sort of fix the bug and get,

783
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,150
I feel like we need a Bingo card and YT downloader because I every episode Kirk.

784
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,270
Well, but this is a good example of,

785
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,139
they've now gone something like two years with the software being broken.

786
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:14,139
And so youtube downloader is

787
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,570
the fork replacement of it that's very active and very

788
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,458
well maintained now and everybody moved on to it.

789
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:19,620
That's

790
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,399
great. That's how open

791
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,139
source work. You know,

792
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,560
it's not ideal, but

793
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,899
I am able to download entire youtube channel

794
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:29,665
easily for my son and also to back up the CS A stuff

795
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,083
anyway. Ok.

796
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:31,804
Ok.

797
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:35,264
But back to the, but the thing is I think it's more subtle than just poll request.

798
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:38,125
It's things like comments and issues or it's things like

799
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:41,083
it's essentially the problem is as a human developer,

800
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:43,063
you have at most 24 hours in a day.

801
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:44,185
I think people

802
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,199
feel tricked and feel cheated when they interact with an A I thinking it's a human,

803
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:49,449
right?

804
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,899
Like if somebody submits a poll request or submits an issue that was

805
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,770
like A I generated and is maybe not of the highest quality.

806
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,800
The reality is humans have a very finite amount of time and it's going to eat it up. And

807
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,169
the maintainers are already vastly saying that like, I don't have a ton of time,

808
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:04,679
I don't have a ton of energy.

809
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:04,959
I,

810
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:07,560
I'm struggling, I feel like quitting.

811
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,530
And a great example is I'm not going to say the name but the person

812
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,850
who submitted that bad pandas CV E request where pandas can read etc passwords.

813
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,300
And it's funny because I was having this discussion with other Josh

814
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,520
and I was like,

815
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,219
etc password is a CS V file except with full Collins instead of Commas.

816
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:27,699
And he's like, what I'm like, go look at it and he's like, oh,

817
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,399
yeah, it is. I'm like, and if I was going to open a big, etc, password in Python,

818
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:34,219
I would use Pandos

819
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,350
because

820
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:35,969
it's

821
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,129
the library to open big CS V files.

822
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,679
And so

823
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,489
I don't think this person was malicious.

824
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,429
I don't think they, I think they honestly,

825
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:46,389
I suspect what happened is they found that issue in a context

826
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:49,229
where it looked like a security issue and didn't realize that.

827
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,709
Well, in that context, it could be a problem. But

828
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,110
as Pandas is meant to be, it has to read files and if you can read the file,

829
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,870
you can read the file,

830
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,149
um, because they deleted the get repo with the,

831
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,270
the vulnerability and all that stuff.

832
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,110
-- I
-- think, II, I think I forked it just because I was like, this is going to get deleted.

833
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,510
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. If you iii I would appreciate a copy of that.

834
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,070
Actually, I, I'll check, I'll check if I still have it.

835
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,590
But this is a good example of like,

836
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,370
what if people start using A I to generate a ton of CV E requests?

837
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:19,169
And that'll like, that'll crush the CV project and it's

838
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:22,139
all right. We're, we're, we're off in the weeds and

839
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,179
I want to end this on a hot take. Ok?

840
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,050
You brought up a really good point

841
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,790
and you're talking about overwhelming developers,

842
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,560
they're already overwhelmed.

843
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,280
And the reality is most people start open source projects because it's fun.

844
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:36,939
Right.

845
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,219
-- Well,
-- or they need to scratch an itch.

846
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,219
Right. It. Right.

847
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:44,280
Uh Well, it, and it's fun to solve problems, right? Like engineers solve problems.

848
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,639
That is what engineers do.

849
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:49,379
I'm going to say that a big reason this

850
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:52,520
has become so hard and people aren't having fun anymore

851
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,929
is because of github.

852
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,879
And the reason being

853
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:59,719
when open source was a CS V repository,

854
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:03,479
I was hosting off of some website at my university.

855
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:06,909
I had a Readme file and in the Readme file,

856
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:10,239
it said if you have a problem or a bug just send me an email.

857
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,739
No one sent emails because it was hard and annoying.

858
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,239
And I didn't want to opening an issue in github.

859
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:21,919
Very easy, sending a pull request, very easy. So that is my

860
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,919
hot take

861
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,320
on all of this.

862
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,120
I want to add a comment to that, I think because it's in github,

863
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:32,120
-- it looks every project looks much bigger and more professional than it is
-- also true.

864
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:36,790
Yes. And people have that expectation that this is kind of a corporate capable like,

865
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:39,879
well, and that's just it like random project in my github.

866
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,959
And I have like hundreds of github

867
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,000
repositories,

868
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,320
half of which are like started and not working open source projects in some way

869
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,459
versus,

870
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:54,100
you know, some sort of like Apache Foundation project or Python or something.

871
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,580
Linux, the Linux kernel

872
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,500
that is a real actual project with people running it.

873
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:00,760
They are not the same.

874
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,479
All right, I'll give you the last word on this one. Make it quick.

875
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,199
I think open source maintainers need to start putting their foot down

876
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,969
and actually, maybe not quitting, but you know what,

877
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:13,199
maybe quite quitting and just preach it.

878
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,959
Not, not be so nice and not be so accommodating

879
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,550
because quite bluntly, if a large company actually needs to use your software,

880
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,370
they can fork it and maintain their own fork.

881
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,229
And if that's too expensive and too much hassle for them,

882
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:25,939
then

883
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,070
that's too bad

884
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:27,870
for them.

885
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,709
-- That's not a you problem.
-- Agreed. All right. Thank you, Kurt.

886
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,620
Thank you everyone for listening.

887
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,379
Go to social security podcast.com of the show,

888
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:37,540
