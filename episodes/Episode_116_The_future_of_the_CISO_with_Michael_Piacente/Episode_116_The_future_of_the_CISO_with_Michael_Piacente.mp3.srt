Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 116

1
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,960
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,989
I almost feel bad for, for making you.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,879
You show up as, as everyone can hear, Kurt clearly has a cold.

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:21,950
I'm actually over and I feel fine.

5
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,700
-- Yeah,
-- that sounds like a lie.

6
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:26,909
But anyway, we have a guest today which is why I forced Kurt to,

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,569
to come in and talk to us.

8
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,229
But we have,

9
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,250
we have Michael

10
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:33,970
Piacenti from Hitch Partners. Why don't you say? Hello, Michael. Hello, everyone.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,259
Awesome. And why don't you tell us what hitch partners does?

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,549
I'm actually really excited for this conversation because it's going

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,830
to be a bit different than we usually have.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,680
Absolutely. Thank you for having me. First of all.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,990
Yeah, Hitch Partners is a boutique executive search firm.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,689
Uh We handle most of the US and we are

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,779
really focused in a very particular niche which is in the

18
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:59,209
executive search area for C OS and heads of security,

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,740
particularly in those areas where companies are

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,309
looking for their modern version of their co

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,870
in what most people call these days. DEVS CS or security engineering

22
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:14,949
where the emphasis is less on infosec and compliance and more so on

23
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:19,169
protecting the assets in the clouds. So that, that's really the main,

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,260
the primary focus of the company.

25
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,910
We are a small group, uh kind of spread out throughout the United States and

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,069
handle about uh anywhere from 6 to 8 searches at a time. Give or take

27
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,300
that. That's awesome.

28
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:34,739
And, and the thing I'm really excited about here is we met at RS a last year

29
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,339
and, and you were really talking about kind of the modern co and,

30
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,029
and how the rules have all changed.

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,379
And that,

32
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:44,059
that made me so excited to talk to someone about that because I often feel like

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,169
we, we still have that old mindset in many ways.

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,839
So why, why don't we like, what, what is the, let's compare,

35
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,099
what's the old cio and what's kind of the, the new modern Cio?

36
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,889
-- What, what should we be talking
-- about? Just to make sure what is the co again

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,319
chief information security officer,

38
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,440
which there and lies half of the challenge because the eye is what's going away

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,040
some from a nomenclature perspective

40
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,979
and it's being shortened to a chief security officer or a CSO. But see, so

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,660
ciso is the more common nomenclature that uh is sort of,

42
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,270
it's sort of like saying a Cio would be the uh the common language in the it world.

43
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,889
So that's what a CIO is.

44
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,449
And that this is the person that would run

45
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,649
the leader that would run the teams and the compliance, the information, security,

46
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:35,009
application, security and, uh, as of late, um,

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,910
or the cloud security functions and product

48
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,860
security functions depending on the company.

49
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:39,399
Awesome.

50
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,899
So, ok. Ok. So back to my question now,

51
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,979
what is, I guess,

52
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,399
what did it used to be like?

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,119
And, and what, what is changing?

54
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,399
And I guess why it would be, I'd love to hear about the why?

55
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,059
Because I suspect you see things most people don't.

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,910
Yeah. And I'll give you a little bit of history.

57
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,740
It just sort of ends up being my history.

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,220
But when I first started in executive recruiting, I was in it for about 13 years,

59
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,649
mostly tech ops and I was a storage architect or storage,

60
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,020
storage engineering before that.

61
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,350
And, uh, what we noticed, um when I first got into executive recruiting,

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,289
we were doing cio searches, um, heads of it and cio searches and

63
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,619
the CIO, the head of security was always kind of a deputy under the CIO

64
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,729
and this had been going on for a decade or so

65
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:29,220
where you had a chief security officer reporting under a CIO.

66
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,360
That was a pretty common

67
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,539
organizational structure. Right around 2011, 12, we started noticing

68
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,000
that the, the chief security officer started not reporting under the CIO

69
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,639
and then it became by 2014, 15, it was pretty common that, uh

70
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:49,029
in, in at least smaller to mid size and growing companies

71
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,889
still is the case for enterprises that ac O reports under the CIO.

72
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,300
But in most of the other population, it has moved

73
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:58,500
into other areas.

74
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,350
In fact, you know,

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,770
at the beginning of the year we had eight

76
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:04,679
chief security officers reporting to eight different functions in,

77
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,289
in in the executive level um from board level to

78
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,839
CEO CFO coo so on and so forth, but almost only one of them reported to a CIO.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,399
And so that's, that's where we started seeing the change um from,

80
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,420
you know, what was a chief security officer to

81
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,980
what is now a modern version. And the thing that, of course, uh like many other

82
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:29,029
trends in technology, uh technologies that have changed,

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,390
it was really the kind of move from VM to

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,220
the cloud or VM to open source um containers, microservices.

85
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,320
And even before that,

86
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:43,459
just moving the data that you're trying to protect into the cloud

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,809
and we can get really deep into that what that means.

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,619
That's really where we saw the change in the

89
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,019
uh existing co definition versus the uh the modern,

90
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,940
what you had was um you had an emphasis

91
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,109
on for maybe 1520 years for a chief security officer

92
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,519
that was really protecting the network perimeter.

93
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,570
And uh what we would commonly call information security.

94
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,660
There was also a pretty strong uh focus on compliance and

95
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,239
regulatory depending on uh the the industry that the company was in

96
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,470
and then we started seeing uh the introduction of apps E

97
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,230
and, and by the way, I should mention that these nomenclatures and these,

98
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,579
these terms um

99
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,329
change from one company to another, which makes

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,589
the challenge, right?

101
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,519
And that's one of the things we, we do on our searches,

102
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:31,000
we come up with a common language first that the com the company can,

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,670
can use when they go out to search. But that's, that's later in the conversation.

104
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,290
But the, the network perimeter is really what we were trying to protect.

105
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:41,859
Um, trying to keep the, the company from doing irresponsible things

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,760
uh internally and try to keep the bad guys from coming in uh to the, to the fortress.

107
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,980
Um When the cloud came about now you have a totally different

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,149
uh mode of software development

109
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,380
where

110
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,299
you now are putting, uh, you know, your, your,

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,109
your crown jewels in the cloud from the developers and the product uh teams,

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,019
uh engineering, um are really driving, you know, much stronger,

113
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,760
faster products into the cloud using, utilizing the cloud,

114
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,410
which is wonderful. Um But, um, the hygiene piece

115
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,829
uh, that we didn't quite get in original CSOS carried over into the cloud and, and,

116
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,230
and in fact, has gotten worse.

117
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,489
And so really the modern day co um, the way I would define it

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,750
is really more about adversary hunting and, and really, and,

119
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,959
and being able to define that for your company.

120
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,420
So it's not just so much about protecting the network assets

121
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,769
and the network perimeter.

122
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:42,970
Um But it's really more about what, why, how, how do I as an executive leader

123
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,380
focus on um educating, guiding,

124
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,730
not often telling uh because developers don't necessarily

125
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,380
listening for that.

126
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,029
Um But really partner, I would say partnering with them politically,

127
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,940
with the developers to say, you know, here,

128
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,019
here are a group of controls that we would like to

129
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,019
make sure that you see in your application in your product.

130
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,730
And um you know, we don't need, we don't need to be perfect here.

131
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:10,489
Um But, but this is the reason why you need to put this,

132
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:13,000
these, these best practices in place or these,

133
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,750
these controls in place because this is exactly where the adversaries are getting

134
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,160
in and they can get in using your code as the vehicle,

135
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,140
you know, Mr and Mrs developer.

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,440
And um so having the uh having the developers really understand

137
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:32,929
those motives um and how they're, how they're going about that, in my opinion,

138
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,690
is the difference right now

139
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,640
between what was AC O and what is currently ac So this

140
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,339
this common language,

141
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,899
uh this understanding of how systems and data work within the cloud really

142
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,119
differentiates um the modern day co and being able to have that conversation,

143
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,670
being able to,

144
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,690
being able to go through and,

145
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,480
and um really guide the rest of the company and the product,

146
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,700
the product side of the company, the engineering side that,

147
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,910
that's really the key issue right now and this is why it makes it such a unique, um,

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,829
probably one of the hardest searches

149
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,510
technology has seen and most companies

150
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,100
are really struggling with that, which we can get into.

151
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,589
Yeah.

152
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,220
Oh, man,

153
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,309
definitely one thing I've seen obviously working with the cloud security lines,

154
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,089
you know, is, is security has definitely gone from sort of a, well, let's be blunt,

155
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,750
gone from a third class citizen to a second class citizen.

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,140
And now security is being, you know, a first class citizen. Right. It's something

157
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,600
we have to do because, you know, the age of, oh, I might not get attacked is gone.

158
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,809
Right. Everybody gets attacked.

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,179
And one thing I'm still kind of not quite understanding with our industry is why,

160
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:38,698
why do you think we sort of still have this security is very much

161
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,578
split, I don't want to say separate, but it's sort of, you know,

162
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,539
we have a cio and a cio why

163
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,289
something I've never understood is why isn't the cio

164
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:50,388
also, you know, doing the duties of the CIS or does it need to be split?

165
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,258
Is there sort of that,

166
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,879
you know, protect attack,

167
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:55,979
-- adversarial piece that needs to be split or something like that or
-- that,

168
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,059
that is a fantastic question.

169
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,568
And there's a lot of his,

170
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,059
I, I believe that there's a lot of history in this so

171
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,840
we watched and this won't be a very popular statement,

172
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,349
but we sort of watched the demise of the CIO S

173
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,390
scope over the course of the last 15 years or so

174
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,590
where they were, you know, at one point managing infrastructure.

175
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:19,219
Um when we had actual physical assets and data centers, that's the world I came from

176
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:23,380
to the business applications which at one point were managed by the CIO.

177
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,070
And now a lot of times the business certainly

178
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,030
drives that. And then when breaks, they come to the CIO,

179
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,900
they were running governance, they were running compliance,

180
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,210
they were running security

181
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,559
and slowly the CIO s role.

182
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,450
And, and again, I'm,

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,090
I should probably qualify this by saying this is a kind of a mid size

184
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,599
some larger.

185
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,330
But, you know, again, the, the, the,

186
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,320
the Fortune 500 fortune 100 probably still have the more traditional

187
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:53,359
model for the most part. Um What I'm referring to is this sort of mid size company.

188
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,619
They, they really do have

189
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,609
a challenge in that their CIO is no longer

190
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,059
managing some of these key functions that

191
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,809
the CIO would be responsible for protecting

192
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,150
the, for instance, the CIO is for the most part,

193
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,549
not managing anything in the cloud that's usually handled by DEV

194
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,150
ops or in, in security terms, Dev

195
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,309
se

196
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,690
ops the leader there.

197
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,570
Uh the head of cloud operations uh is very different than the CIO.

198
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,099
And so you have this sort of uh divide in skill sets and,

199
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,609
you know, whatever it may be

200
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:28,609
that this really divide, I would say in scope, that's where,

201
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,799
that's where it came from.

202
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,479
At least that's where we believe it came from.

203
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:36,049
Uh Again, very rarely do we see C cells even reporting to cio S now.

204
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,049
And when they do, as soon as the cloud piece comes up,

205
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,099
they have to figure out how to embed it into engineering.

206
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,250
And that's just, that's kind of an allergic reaction.

207
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:50,150
So therefore, the CSO tends to be on, on their own and build their own organization.

208
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,489
Sometimes they're embedded within product or engineering,

209
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,229
sometimes they're a separate unit, you know, reporting in, directly into the CEO.

210
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,859
Um There's just so many different combinations

211
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,270
but that, that's, that's sort of the history behind it.

212
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,030
I, I do think that we need a separate function.

213
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:09,280
Uh I know in our searches when we hear that the CIO will report into the CIO and,

214
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,669
you know, essentially security reporting into it.

215
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,739
Uh for what it's worth,

216
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,760
we are fine with that as long as um

217
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,909
they understand that that if they're developing products that are

218
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,250
going to be put in the cloud or they're

219
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,679
developing software that will be delivered via the cloud,

220
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,080
that there's a, uh there'll be a time where the

221
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,979
cell will need to split off from it and uh remain independent

222
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,000
and there may be some really tough conversations to come.

223
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,739
No, I, I like that.

224
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,219
And in fact,

225
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,960
this is something Kurt and I have talked about more

226
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,900
than once is no company has a Chief electricity officer

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,539
and they, they probably did at one time, right.

228
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,520
Whereas

229
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,679
kind of the, the thanks to the cloud,

230
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,390
the traditional view computing is changing quite a

231
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,820
lot where it's becoming really a commodity service.

232
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,200
And now it's more about using that commodity to add value versus it,

233
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,640
it kind of existing in its own.

234
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,119
Right.

235
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,869
Well, simply put there are entire companies and

236
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,320
well, I won't say entire industries yet, but

237
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,559
there are definitely entire companies based in the cloud, you know, Netflix.

238
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,429
Uh there's a couple of banks now, you know, the cloud security lines. We,

239
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,869
the first thing I did when I took over uh it director

240
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,549
uh eight years ago was I made sure we had no servers, you know,

241
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,260
I made sure everything was cloud based because

242
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:19,770
no,

243
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,570
I used to have servers and they would fail at three in the morning and I'd have to wake

244
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,020
up and drag my butt down to the colo to fix them and I don't care for that,

245
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,929
to be honest.

246
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,710
Um And yeah, as you said, you know, like

247
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,440
people, yeah,

248
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,359
I think we're definitely moving to a trend of people

249
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,250
just buying the services and the systems that they need

250
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,900
rather than, you know, building everything in house.

251
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,729
And so I, like, I'm really wondering, is there just a generational?

252
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,150
It's like there's almost like a different language

253
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,979
or a different culture with this whole,

254
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,859
you know, comfort of outsourcing to the cloud, you know, sometimes what are very,

255
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,890
-- the things that support very much the core business.
-- Right.

256
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,049
Absolutely.

257
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,159
I, I think that's part of the challenge is um there's a nomenclature channel,

258
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:01,869
there's nomenclature difference, there's a cultural difference.

259
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,440
There's a,

260
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,510
um

261
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,190
there's, there's just an age difference, um just to put it out there.

262
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,890
I mean, you know, we have um a majority of cloud based

263
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:17,530
um developers um kind of in the, you know, millennial category and maybe Gen X, um

264
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,909
you know, where I might be uh that are, you know,

265
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:25,650
trying to work through um sometimes their counterparts and security,

266
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:26,570
sometimes not.

267
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,510
Um sometimes, you know, the engineering and product teams uh

268
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,969
definitely have a different technology or

269
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,229
a different conversation or different language.

270
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,390
And that's part of the challenge is that you

271
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,669
really need to have someone as a head of security

272
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:45,059
today. Not, not that network uh perimeter security or infosec and

273
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,049
traditional info

274
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,960
compliance are any less important. I should really stress that. Um

275
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,039
I think the challenge with the position

276
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,229
now is that everything has become important,

277
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,409
the position has gotten so large from a scope perspective

278
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,729
that really uh in the, in the recruiting world,

279
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,270
we call it the Purple Squirrel and it's just, it's just not obtainable.

280
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,409
Um Sometimes we're having to guide our customers with,

281
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:07,690
you know, what you want,

282
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,609
what you need and what you're going to see and

283
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,309
what you're going to get are actually 33 different things.

284
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,940
And uh and the reason why is because now you have a whole,

285
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,369
a whole different to your point.

286
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,140
Kurt, you have a,

287
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,169
you have a whole different understanding language nomenclature around dev

288
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,369
se

289
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,780
ops or security engineering or product security.

290
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,820
I see those terms as interchangeable.

291
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,080
Uh Some might disagree but from a recruiting perspective

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,309
that that's really the skill set. That is a totally different language.

293
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,849
It's a language of how do you speak to your developers.

294
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,979
And at the same time, how do you take what dev

295
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:39,140
secs

296
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,659
is doing and then explain it to your executive team.

297
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:46,960
And oh, by the way, how do you explain that to your audit team and to your board?

298
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,119
Um And, and essentially, it's all about prioritizing the work. Um

299
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,809
If the work is coming out of um

300
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,659
if the work of trying to chase the bad guys is happening

301
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,700
um at a, a DEV ops level,

302
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,090
um then you need you as the executive leading security need to try to

303
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,849
find a common language to explain that to every different faction of your company.

304
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:10,539
Um That is a,

305
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:16,289
that is a skill set that is very difficult to learn. Uh It means that the candidates

306
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,679
that we work with would have to have been exposed

307
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,969
at a scale that would have been a cross functional

308
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,849
and they would have had to work on projects that are cross functional.

309
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,969
They would have had to work at executive level developer level.

310
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:30,000
It's, it's really a fascinating challenge right now.

311
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,210
We, we're building an entire company based on it, but it's,

312
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,369
you know, how do you build apps um

313
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,150
that are defensible at the same time,

314
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,099
how do you communicate and how do you do

315
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,719
that to different walks of life within your organization?

316
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,590
Everyone has a different experience and everyone

317
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,820
has a different definition of security.

318
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,039
I would say, um we have a process uh within our

319
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,630
uh our discovery process, it's very intrusive.

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,080
So we'll spend a few days on site and we'll

321
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,809
sit in product meetings, we'll sit in engineering meetings,

322
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,289
we'll interview all of what we call, interviewing the interviewers.

323
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:02,809
I mean, just, you know,

324
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,890
short meetings to get an understanding of

325
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,090
what everyone's definition of the security is

326
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:07,989
partially,

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,169
we do this to come up with a common language so

328
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,340
that when we go through the search and let's say,

329
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:16,099
Kurt, you're the, the candidate for CISO, you're going to hear from the CEO,

330
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,289
they're looking for an

331
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,049
infosec leader.

332
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,140
But yet, uh Josh is the head of engineering and he's talking about Dev

333
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,659
ops and then the candidate comes away from the interview saying I,

334
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,700
I don't know what they're looking for, really, they are looking for the same thing,

335
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,109
they're just using a different language.

336
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,409
And so, um it,

337
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,489
it really helps us get a better understanding of

338
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,729
what that company's um IQ is around security.

339
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,880
Um, but everyone has a different experience.

340
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,239
It's, it's, it's a fascinating time for security and, and it really has come from,

341
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,130
uh, a second class citizen to, you know, what?

342
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,849
We go to the back room to the boardroom almost instantly over the last few years.

343
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:51,510
-- That's, uh, it's wonderful.
-- That's awesome.

344
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,989
So, I guess let's, let's ask like a, a slightly more direct question, let's say,

345
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,609
let's say I'm looking for

346
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,250
security talent.

347
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,090
What I, I guess

348
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,489
what, what would you

349
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,959
say are some of the more important qualities today specifically?

350
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,430
Because I know you mentioned things like being able to talk to the board

351
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,390
and be able to talk to developers and like those are two drastically different

352
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,310
skill sets, right?

353
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,348
Mhm.

354
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,560
Do you, do you,

355
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,520
do you have like a ranking of which

356
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,160
particular things are more valuable than others maybe?

357
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,920
Or, or am I just talking crazy?

358
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,800
No, not at all actually.

359
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,050
Um What we find is that the, now again, I'm going to qualify this,

360
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,390
um if a company is delivering their service or product

361
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,400
via the cloud, which it seems that, you know,

362
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,479
majority of companies in the majority of industries are moving towards,

363
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:47,599
it may, may not be their mainstay product or main main all the way there.

364
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:51,050
They may be running in a hybrid environment um or private

365
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,420
gated cloud versus public cloud um using AWS or TCP or

366
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,030
Azure

367
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,579
and they may not be all the way there.

368
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:00,459
They may not be all the way into microservices or running

369
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,609
goer neti they again, they may not be all the way there.

370
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,400
But the, the key differentiator

371
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,420
is this ability, I'd say the number one priority when I look at um

372
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,189
you know, why did this client pick this,

373
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,449
this candidate over this one? It's, it's, it's,

374
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,150
it's how the candidates, how the cio leaders were able to explain

375
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,140
this very complex challenge of

376
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,969
the adversaries or after my code,

377
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:26,569
how do I teach everyone in the organization

378
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,050
um how to protect against that from writing the code to

379
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,849
dealing with controls to the audit process, everything.

380
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,890
And that, that's probably the number one priority right now.

381
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,560
Again, in, in the, in the small subset of clients that I work with, which are

382
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,619
small to medium businesses running. Um

383
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,969
And these are everything from start ups to multibillion dollar companies,

384
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,510
but they're, you know, they're not the largest companies in the world.

385
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,630
And these are, uh you know, this is,

386
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
this is probably the biggest differentiator if you can find someone

387
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,569
and everyone has a different definition of what that is.

388
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:57,160
That's either

389
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,739
someone that's currently writing code all the way to,

390
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,339
I've been there, done that.

391
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:06,010
Uh C so that is just able to explain it in a way with a really strong command

392
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:10,239
and control that everyone believes in and, and there's, there's trust.

393
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,150
Um but that,

394
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,790
that's probably the number one priority a after that

395
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,020
um I think really having a very strong and,

396
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,310
and by the way, this is tied to

397
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,609
the general principles of a really strong uh co is is having those builds blocks from

398
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,140
kind of more traditional infosec the understanding of how the internet works,

399
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,650
understanding how networks work,

400
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,849
um how to protect both physical and cloud based perimeters.

401
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,849
These are, these are areas that probably would be, you know,

402
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,359
definitely a second priority if not right there up at the top, it's really having

403
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,180
such a great recipe for security hygiene at

404
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,459
a, at a growing organization.

405
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,550
Um And that stems from just uh kind of the been there done that in the infosec world

406
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,219
and an

407
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,219
AEC world again that these are terms are kind of interchangeable in some,

408
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,209
in some cases.

409
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,530
So those are the big ones, the, the, the other ones that we see that the,

410
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,170
the two others are,

411
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,849
like you said, the ability to communicate at,

412
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,489
at the executive level and this is everyone from board level.

413
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:13,310
Um We have had positions that report directly to the board CEO level,

414
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,939
communicating with the CFO so that they understand what level

415
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,780
of compliance and governance they need to uh drive.

416
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,750
That is a big one for sure. That's uh some candidates tend to fall.

417
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,270
We, we call that, you know, they're not a finished product yet,

418
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,459
still working through,

419
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:27,910
you know,

420
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,540
their executive gravitas and a lot of it's just because they haven't been exposed

421
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:32,589
to that level.

422
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,010
And quite frankly, they, you know, they've just been dealing with major

423
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,930
complex technical problems and may not have presented more than once

424
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,260
or twice to a board or something along those lines.

425
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,560
So

426
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,689
we try to let clients know this is,

427
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:47,579
this is what you're going to see if you want the emphasis on DEV

428
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:47,709
SE

429
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:48,359
S,

430
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,319
you might have to give up a portion on the gravitas

431
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,915
piece and it takes a little while for that to happen.

432
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,314
The other, the other key area is sales enablement.

433
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:01,655
C OS have always been sort of the, the, the, the front runner,

434
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:04,484
Cio S and C OS for the most part have been the front runner to say, let,

435
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,405
let's get on the phone with partners,

436
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:07,234
get on the phone,

437
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:09,435
with clients be out there at conferences and talk

438
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:12,354
about what XYZ is doing within our security.

439
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,020
Um That makes people feel comfortable and confident about their ability to,

440
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:21,609
to make this product uh whole or secure. Now, more than ever with

441
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,560
a SAS, you know, with

442
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:26,530
SAS being the predominant um architecture or methodology.

443
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:31,489
Uh We, we've seen CSOS being hired in companies of 50

444
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,250
um whereas before they were first being, you know,

445
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,829
the first time you would see a CSO in a company is when they hit, you know,

446
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,619
500 or 700 people

447
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,599
at 100 million. Now you're seeing a totally different dynamic which is

448
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,109
now the CEO is being not only,

449
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,869
not really used as a sales engineer but to really say we have major, you know,

450
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,550
you take a small SAS company and

451
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,670
of course, if they're going after enterprise clients,

452
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,030
they almost immediately need AC O when they're making the sale.

453
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:02,589
Um The first one that's going to be asking the questions

454
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,180
about whether this SAS space application that's running in the cloud

455
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:10,199
is, that's, that's, that's holding my, my crown jewels and my

456
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:13,420
and my um my treasure trove of data.

457
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,670
I want to be on the phone with the CEO of that of that small software company to ensure

458
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,859
that they have the right methodology and the right recipe.

459
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:24,630
So that I feel my, my, my uh data is protected, my company's data is protected.

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,410
So the sales enablement piece is becoming a um or has become over the last few years,

461
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,469
a major decision maker. In fact, we've seen some CSO searches

462
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:38,589
that are really focused on that alone. In other words, the technical pieces are,

463
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,140
you know, we just need you to understand well enough,

464
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,140
but really we need you to be customer facing and out there

465
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:50,079
again, not as a sales person, but really, I need you to be instilling confidence

466
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,540
that our applications that our products are

467
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,239
are sound and uh you can get it by the litmus test of a of a Fortune 500 co.

468
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,719
So those are the kind of the main areas

469
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:01,280
that's one of the things I've been wondering about,

470
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,380
you know, from my work with the CV project is

471
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,270
how do companies signal security maturity?

472
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:08,010
Right.

473
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,680
In their process and conversely, you know,

474
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,030
what actually does security maturity look like?

475
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,550
Right. Because there's a lot of companies that

476
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:17,420
I've heard about and I'm like, oh, I've, I've never heard of them.

477
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,430
I don't know what the heck they're doing in the

478
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,160
security space and it turns out they're doing really good

479
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,390
things and then there's other companies that appear to be

480
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,069
doing really good things in the security space and then,

481
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,760
you know, they get hacked really badly.

482
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,069
Um, so it sounds like that's definitely, I mean,

483
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,680
it sounds to me like with, without ac, so number one, I mean, yeah,

484
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:34,869
how can you be expected to have sort of a secure maturity response

485
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,819
if you can't even put enough value on it, you know, to hire somebody to lead it? Right.

486
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:39,410
Correct.

487
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,829
I would say most of the time that we are called in again, keeping in mind that our,

488
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,880
our primary targets are these fast growing, either start ups or, uh, you know,

489
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,459
pre pre IP O or even post IP O.

490
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,709
And, uh, but a lot of them come to an, uh, oh moment, you know,

491
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:58,209
that is that they have a very technical, um, a fantastic team running

492
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,079
and probably embedded in engineering or the product side that's running DEV

493
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,270
Sec

494
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,410
ops. Um, they're part of engineering,

495
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:05,959
they're part of the product team.

496
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,770
And uh at some point,

497
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,560
the sale cuts to the point where they're no longer just managing RFP requests

498
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,060
and responses.

499
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,930
It's now, uh we need to speak to your co and uh and by the way,

500
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,890
the VP of engineering is not going to cut it or

501
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,219
the head of product is not going to cut it.

502
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:21,599
And some of the

503
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,079
discussions, you know,

504
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,579
despite best efforts, putting a DEV

505
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:26,500
ops engineer

506
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,479
on the phone with a Fortune 500 co just won't cut it. And so

507
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,859
that's when the uh oh moment comes and they say we, we, we really need to bring a,

508
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,079
a professional co on board.

509
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:41,420
And uh and those quite frankly are some of the tough researches because you have to,

510
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,550
you know, this is a, this is a candidate pool

511
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,010
that probably in my experience is the amount

512
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,910
of pummeling that they get from vendors,

513
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,719
from recruiters, from people trying to sell them things is, is just,

514
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:53,699
it's off the charts.

515
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:57,910
It's probably more so with security officers than, than any other single,

516
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:01,479
even more so than CEO S if you think about who's trying to get in touch with them.

517
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:01,920
And so

518
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,579
if you have to really make a compelling

519
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:07,209
argument or narrative from that company to say,

520
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:10,739
this is what's interesting, this is what's challenging about our security story

521
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,000
and this is why we want you to join.

522
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,530
It's a pretty fascinating thing we,

523
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,290
we actually started doing last year we started doing these, uh ciso dinners

524
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,680
and, uh, we, we call it a sanctuary because we don't pitch to them. We don't sell them.

525
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,630
We don't allow sales people to come in.

526
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,459
And what we found is that the C

527
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,489
OS are almost like numb to being invited to, uh, to events because of course,

528
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,630
when they get invited, they're getting pitched to or

529
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,089
someone want something from us.

530
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,930
So we, we just say, you know what, let's just get together.

531
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,739
We're gonna, we're gonna co-host a dinner

532
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,170
and you just, you just get to know each other and we're, we're just here to listen,

533
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,930
you know, selfishly, I want to get to know you.

534
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:47,089
So when I call you, I'm not a stranger, but other than that,

535
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,689
I'm not really selling anything to you.

536
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:49,869
What else I found is that C

537
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,369
OS are pretty horrific networkers.

538
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:54,959
They're, they're, they're very bad at reaching out

539
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,569
and they're great at reaching,

540
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,469
they're great at reaching out when there's a problem.

541
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:03,180
They have, they have wonderful ecosystems to um to use. They're,

542
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,310
they're really, you know, the, the White hat mentality of helping one another is,

543
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,790
is pretty fantastic and it's a very community spirit.

544
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,709
But when they just get together for networking,

545
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:14,619
I've had so many people come up to me these dinners like this is great.

546
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,839
You know, we, I never really knew this person over here. And now I know and, and

547
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:18,300
that,

548
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,760
that's kind of what we need to create for the cio community because they just said

549
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,290
they're being pummeled by marketing messages and um it's it's kind of tough to see.

550
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:27,959
-- Totally.
-- Alright. Alright.

551
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:33,040
So we're we're kind of nearing the end of our chat and let's let's assume

552
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:36,920
I make poor life choices and decide I want to be ac O

553
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,660
do you have some advice for me?

554
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,099
Just from kind of a career and personal development perspective of some

555
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:45,969
of the things I should be focusing on or paying attention to?

556
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,709
Well, first of all, I think that is a wonderful career choice because I,

557
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:54,959
I think that uh and, and I'm not just being selfish about that comment, but it's,

558
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,489
I think really the see, so is the amount of growth that we're seeing

559
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,489
at that level right now and the amount of growth in that particular position,

560
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,719
it's something that I would recommend for everyone. And again, I'm, I'm extremely,

561
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,150
I'm extremely biased uh clearly,

562
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,560
but I also see this uh just having been around technology a long time,

563
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,219
I see this as a fantastic place for people to come in.

564
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,520
I I think that the the base the best advice I would give you,

565
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,609
you need to find a couple of mentors,

566
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,650
one that can help you with technology uh challenges and you know,

567
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,089
the proverbial bat phone

568
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,829
and then the other one would be more on the executive layer.

569
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,160
You know, here's a problem. My company came to me with how do I solve this?

570
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,109
This is not a technical problem. This is uh

571
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,890
it could even be political, but it, it's something that you need,

572
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,859
you need a couple of people that are really in your corner that you can reach out to,

573
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,560
that will um that will really tell you what, how you need to approach it.

574
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,619
And the other thing is uh I would find

575
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,520
a really good set set of recruiting professionals,

576
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,349
you know, that, that you can,

577
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,689
that you can focus on because they do know a lot, you know, they,

578
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:59,589
-- they do know a lot and um you know, find out how you can partner with them
-- effectively.

579
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,930
Yeah. No, I, I actually, I, I do agree with that.

580
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:04,819
Having, having good recruiters makes

581
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,390
an enormous difference and

582
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,479
awesome and, and obviously,

583
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,189
uh we'll put links to hitch partners in the show notes.

584
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:15,500
If anyone's looking for an executive recruiter named Michael,

585
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:16,469
they can, uh

586
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,750
they can go to, they can go there to check it out.

587
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,260
Well, the thing that always gets me is, you know,

588
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,500
like with cars or houses or other big ticket items,

589
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,069
sure you can buy or sell one yourself.

590
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:24,479
But,

591
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:29,150
you know, maybe hiring somebody who does this literally 10 times a day

592
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,880
is a better choice than, you know, doing it yourself when you like,

593
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,260
because honestly, most companies should not be hiring AC O like once a year, right?

594
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,550
That should be once every couple of years that they do this thing ideally,

595
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,189
you know, and so I, I see a lot of internal hiring that goes kind of sideways because,

596
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,709
yeah, they only do this like, once a year

597
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,280
and, you know, like it'd be like me selling my car.

598
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,189
I would, I would end up naked in the street

599
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,510
with all my money gone

600
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,459
at the, yeah, at the same time we,

601
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:58,530
we appreciate when companies come to us after they've attempted to, you know,

602
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,239
manage their searches on their own because they have

603
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,400
a great appreciation of how intense this network is.

604
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:03,650
And,

605
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:04,569
and, you know,

606
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:04,839
you know,

607
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,180
people hire an executive recruiter specifically us because we

608
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,900
have a very defined network across the United States,

609
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,770
some parts of Europe that are the, the, the, you know,

610
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,099
the kind of the cream of the crop.

611
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:18,869
And we, we spend so much time developing those relationships every day,

612
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,260
even when we don't have some, some position to manage, you know, we're, you know,

613
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,599
just educating them and, and being there helping,

614
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:27,239
I just helped someone on an offer yesterday had

615
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,959
nothing to do with any one of my searches.

616
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,569
You know, we're just, we're trying to be there as a, as a guide.

617
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:35,390
And, um, you know, this is a, this is a long, this is definitely the long play.

618
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,449
This is not a short,

619
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:40,930
a short uh relationship. These are 1015 year relationships that we've had.

620
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:42,079
So it makes a big difference and I

621
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,699
think the clients hopefully recognize the value there.

622
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,900
-- That is
-- awesome.

623
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:46,660
All right,

624
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,780
this has been

625
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,770
a marvelous conversation.

626
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,369
So I guess thank you so much, Michael. It is.

627
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,199
It's always fun to talk to you and I really appreciate you taking the time.

628
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,280
So for I guess audience members, you can go to open source security,

629
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,729
podcast.com and hit up the show notes

630
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:05,390
which will contain a link to probably a couple of things about me.

631
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:05,510
I

632
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:10,199
don't think we touched on a whole lot outside of hitch partners and you, which is,

633
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:10,959
which is great though.

634
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:15,219
And then you can use the Pound Os podcast hashtag to hit us up on Twitter.

635
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,709
-- And yeah, I mean, Michael and Kurt, thank you guys so much. Have a great
-- day.

636
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,689
Thank you. Get some chicken soup for you, Kurt.

637
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,459
Seriously,

638
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,239
the
