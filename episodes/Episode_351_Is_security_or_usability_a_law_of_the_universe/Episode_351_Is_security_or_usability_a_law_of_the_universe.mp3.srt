Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:10,539
Kurt Seyfried and my partner in not

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,819
having private conversations and Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:15,279
That's right. But before we get to the topic of the day,

4
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,340
I have very exciting news.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,639
-- Victorio is on the switch. I learned this like three days ago.
-- How do you?

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,059
It's like when somebody did a Starcraft challenge with only the mouse and like,

7
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,760
you know, this was a good player

8
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:34,080
-- and playing Starcraft with only a mouse is like, it was like five A PM.
-- Ok.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,599
So look, here's the thing. It sucks. Right. I'm totally willing to admit.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,200
Does it like have, like at least snap to focus or something?

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,459
-- There's a snap to focus. You can, you can turn on?
-- Ok.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,119
Because I'm like, if it doesn't do that, like

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,560
rights, you have to focus or you can turn on like a little cursor,

14
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:51,189
you can move around with one of the sticks

15
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,659
and it's terrible and it's hard to play.

16
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:57,459
But here's the thing, the fact that I can take Factorio, like anywhere I go now

17
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:04,138
delights me in Factorio is generally low key enough that I don't have to have, like,

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,580
super quick reactions.

19
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:05,930
Well,

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,519
because you're not doing those speed runs like that

21
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:09,790
German guy who's down to 124 and change.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,680
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,940
Like I can, I can take all the time I need and I'll just go, like, turn the machines off.

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:19,199
-- If there's too much coal coming out or whatever.
-- Can you sync the games?

25
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,449
Like, so can you basically start on your switch? Move it to your PC and vice versa?

26
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,949
You know, I haven't

27
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,900
looked to see if I can do that. I don't think so.

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,860
I haven't seen anything that suggests I can and not that I necessarily would.

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,720
-- But
-- because I'm trying to think because I think Factor like doesn't it,

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,160
you can save because hearts of Iron, you can save to the cloud Factor or can you save?

31
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,110
-- But
-- that's, that's steam, that's

32
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,709
Steam thing, isn't it or is it? I don't play Hearts of Iron. But I know most of my same

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,169
like cloud things is just steam.

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,849
I would assume it's, yeah, you know,

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,959
it probably is a cloud service because every game is

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,110
not going to build their own back end storage network.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,319
That would be,

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,180
I guess one other, one other fun fact for video games is Little Inferno,

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,139
which is 10 years old, just released DLC like a couple of weeks ago,

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,760
which I just found out about literally

41
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,720
-- yesterday from recording and I'm very
-- excited.

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,940
I have no idea what that is.

43
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:05,419
It's

44
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,500
unexplainably odd. That's what it is.

45
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,199
You either love Little Inferno or you don't get it.

46
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,210
It's not a game calling it a game is

47
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,600
an incorrect description of what Little Inferno is.

48
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,309
Is it a multimedia experience?

49
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:18,160
-- Sure.
-- We'll

50
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:18,440
-- call
-- it

51
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,169
-- that.
-- See.

52
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:20,800
And that's one thing I've always wondered, like, like,

53
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:24,089
because remember when Mist came out and people were like, is this a game or just like,

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,759
are you messing with people?

55
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,139
-- I
-- mean, Mist had puzzles,

56
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:28,289
I

57
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,990
guess. Little Inferno technically has puzzles.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,639
So maybe you could call it a puzzle game, but it's a very unique experience,

59
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:35,199
we'll say,

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,520
-- and you burn a lot of stuff, which is fun. This is
-- weird. So it's made by two Kyles.

61
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:39,539
Uh

62
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,419
It's, is it two

63
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,960
-- K? It's a tomorrow corporation, I thought, yeah,
-- it's Kyle,

64
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,539
it's Kyle Gabler and Kyle Gray. So it's like producer KG

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,240
designer

66
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,500
Kyle Gabler and Kyle Gray

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,360
artists, Kyle Gabler and Kyle Gray. Writer Kyle Gray. Composer Kyle Grable.

68
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,339
I mean,

69
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,130
I love it when people do that when they put

70
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,309
their name like infinite number of times in their,

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,779
their game or whatever they did.

72
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:03,570
There was, there was one thing I played, I forget what it was now,

73
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,070
but it was like one guy did it

74
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,080
and he had like 300 jobs in the,

75
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:12,220
in the credits at the end and his name was in every one of them.

76
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,119
It was so good.

77
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,350
Anyway,

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
we have a real topic as much as I'd love to yammer around about Factorio or something,

79
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,869
which maybe we'll do some day, but not today.

80
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:21,690
Freaking those biters and that

81
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,660
whole. Right.

82
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:23,289
Oh, yeah.

83
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,830
Whatever. I love Factorio. It's so good. Actually, it was really funny.

84
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,039
So, one more story

85
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,175
I help out with the first robotics team. Right.

86
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,054
And

87
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,895
one of the other

88
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,975
mentors makes a comment about Factory. I'm like, oh, Factoria, I love that game.

89
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,544
He's like, oh you play and he got

90
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:40,824
no, no, no.

91
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:43,375
Like I have a family and a job.

92
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,735
I don't play very often.

93
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:46,445
And

94
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:47,505
yeah,

95
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,054
and anyway, he got slightly less excited and one of the kids is like,

96
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,014
what's Factorial?

97
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,300
And we explained it to him. He's like that sounds like the dumbest game ever

98
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:56,070
-- maybe. But you
-- get

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,130
-- to
-- learn process optimization.

100
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,779
It kind of is and it's very funny because

101
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,779
this kid was just like you guys are weirdos like

102
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:05,789
we

103
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,360
are

104
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:08,889
anyway. Alright. Alright.

105
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:09,190
Topic,

106
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,570
-- topic of the day encrypted messages
-- is even encrypted messages.

107
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,100
I don't think encrypted messages is even the right term for this because there's

108
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,600
multiple terms, there's end to end encryption,

109
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,329
there's encrypted messages,

110
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,989
there's private messages

111
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,070
and these are all very subtly different things,

112
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,450
right?

113
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,549
We'll start why we're going to talk about this today.

114
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,529
So anyone paying attention at this point is familiar with the

115
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,109
just everything happening around Twitter

116
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,970
and there's been a an obvious migration to Mastodon,

117
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,929
especially by security goons and

118
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,059
sa

119
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:43,470
and, oh

120
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:43,959
my

121
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,190
goodness.

122
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:49,149
-- So we are not going to comment on any of this stuff
-- yet.

123
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,130
I'm a Canadian.

124
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,519
I got nothing to do with us

125
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:51,869
c

126
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,109
but anything we record

127
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,720
in two hours

128
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,600
old and irrelevant because I'm like, I can't even keep up. It's also bananas.

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,209
I, I stopped, I,

130
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,589
I like, basically I'll, I'll, I like, I stopped looking for

131
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,380
the Twitter

132
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,589
catastrophe. I don't even know what to call it. The catastrophe, whatever.

133
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,309
Because yeah, it's clear at this point like, OK, I've left Twitter.

134
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,769
I deleted all my tweets. I'm,

135
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,209
it's done

136
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,369
anyway. Anyway. So here's the thing,

137
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,809
ads, people come to Mastodon, they keep pointing out

138
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,600
-- that you have to trust your server admin
-- that,

139
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,839
that right. That, that Mastodon D MS aren't encrypted

140
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,290
and server admins can read them

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,470
and yeah.

142
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,989
Yes, that's generally, that's how servers work.

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,079
When you put data onto a server, the person who runs the server can read the data. I

144
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,070
-- think
-- you're being a little harsh because I think

145
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:47,910
that

146
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,209
the problem is we've existed in this kind of corporate social media

147
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,279
environment for so long where things like this just weren't acknowledged.

148
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,049
And there was this,

149
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,170
-- I guess
-- all access to that data is strictly controlled and blah, blah, blah,

150
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,799
you know, blah, blah.

151
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,559
And then it turns out some like teenager whacks

152
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,609
into the Twitter Twitter dashboard and takes over the,

153
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,000
you know, a bunch of accounts

154
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,600
and could read their stuff

155
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,079
but, but the point is, I think there's some value in

156
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,369
just discussing the various things going on.

157
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,920
There's a lot of moving pieces in this and there's everything from signal which

158
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:24,000
does most things. Right. But not quite everything.

159
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,890
And then you've got Mastodon where you have, like,

160
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,079
literally you're on someone else's server who is not a

161
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,049
-- company and not regulated
-- unless you're on your own server.

162
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,049
Well, that's true.

163
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,660
But even that doesn't really matter because you're

164
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,609
sending your messages to somebody else's server.

165
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:41,200
Right. Right. It's, it's definitely

166
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:46,690
-- a very odd and unique way.
-- No, it's just email. Well, it's exactly an email.

167
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,329
So

168
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,359
it's, this is what drives me nuts. Everybody's like, oh Federation Federer.

169
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,369
This is, I'm like,

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,589
yeah, we reinvented email. Like,

171
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,519
like, because it, it's just,

172
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,540
it's got a slightly different message publishing model where

173
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,299
you can actually pull as well as push,

174
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,579
but that's it activity.

175
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,339
And so to be blunt, like, like email,

176
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,589
the common model is your connection to the server is encrypted http S

177
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,399
easy.

178
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,549
And then

179
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,070
while the data is in clear text on the server and hopefully

180
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,910
you trust the server man and whatever platform they're running on because,

181
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,309
well, yeah, they can look at your data

182
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,269
and they kind of have to be able to look at your data because for example,

183
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,399
they need to route it

184
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,269
or

185
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,829
if you post a public tweet

186
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,070
with a hashtag people want to be able to search for that.

187
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,489
Hashtag Well, they have to read your message.

188
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,989
And so I also, I, I'm not sure dm like

189
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,660
message is the right term because the way

190
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:36,790
uh

191
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:37,450
masone

192
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,619
works is right is you can,

193
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,470
you can do a message. Um What is it publicly? Followers only

194
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:46,000
or uh mentioned people only, right?

195
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,529
And unlisted, which is public but like search engines stuff don't pick it up.

196
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,890
-- Right. Right.
-- So to prevent like, like a search clutter, I don't know.

197
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,290
-- So
-- let's think about this

198
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,209
like AAA sliding scale, right? Let's put Mastodon

199
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,329
on the right

200
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,690
and let's put

201
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,640
P GP all the way on the left and I'm going to use P GP.

202
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,329
This will make sense.

203
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,029
IP GP as the most control and Mastodon as the least control when we're trying to,

204
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,299
I'm sending Kurt a message and I would put email basically

205
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:21,609
-- next to Mastodon probably
-- about half a millimeter sig over.

206
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,230
They're touching

207
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,589
-- on the diagram
-- and, and,

208
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,269
and much like it like so um we're also going to ignore you running your own server.

209
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,480
Yeah. Yeah,

210
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,010
that is not the common case.

211
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:35,979
That's right.

212
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,270
So in the case of something like email or Mastodon,

213
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,349
there's

214
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,940
an understanding,

215
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,880
we'll say this is amongst technical people because I think normal

216
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,119
people assume much more privacy than exists in the system.

217
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,599
Like I'm the super

218
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,950
admin in my Google Ords

219
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:56,210
orgs. I like I can break into your account and look at all your stuff.

220
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,590
That's just how that works. And I don't

221
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,859
because

222
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,450
professionally and ethically and morally that would

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,849
be really wrong and also very illegal.

224
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,239
Right. Right. Well, that's just it. There's,

225
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,960
when you're in a situation of working for a company, for example,

226
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:14,349
there is like legal obligations and if you go off

227
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,169
the rails and start reading everyone's email or something,

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,580
they're going to take legal action against you.

229
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,979
Well, without some very direct and prescriptive,

230
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,239
like you need to do this because there's an investigation or something.

231
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,989
But again, corner case, we can ignore that.

232
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,559
-- But
-- now, but here's the thing,

233
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,179
I don't think we can ignore that because I think it's an important point.

234
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,380
If someone at Google goes off the rails and starts reading gmail

235
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,119
emails or messages or whatever,

236
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,619
there, there's organizations like the FTC

237
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,340
in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,659
that is going to find Google.

239
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,700
In fact, Twitter got in trouble for this and are currently under

240
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:50,859
some sort of,

241
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,369
I forget what they call it,

242
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,140
but basically they have to send reports to the FTC on a regular basis,

243
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,809
which I'm sure they're not doing anymore.

244
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,049
But you get the point right now. If that happens on a Mastodon instance

245
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:03,049
that's hosted in Germany, you're probably sol, right?

246
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,869
The FTC is not going to help you. There's nothing you can do

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,929
and that's fine.

248
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,510
We just have to acknowledge it. I'm not saying it's bad.

249
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,340
This is a, I mean, this is a, like uh, just a quick story.

250
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:15,849
Like, I, uh, saw a journalist, I know move to Mastodon

251
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,140
and then 24 hours later I was like, what happened to their account?

252
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,679
Like, because it's weirdly grayed out or whatever.

253
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,289
I was like, oh, they moved to a Canadian server?

254
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,409
Oh, yeah. Oh,

255
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,210
yeah, that makes sense. Like Canadian journalists should be on a Canadian server

256
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:30,940
and, and I noticed, like, all these Canadian journalists went over to MST,

257
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,140
what is it M STD N dot C A or whatever?

258
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:37,080
And I'm like, oh, that, yeah, that's, that's probably a lot better than being on some

259
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,890
Lord knows where it is instance.

260
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,719
Yeah, I, I agree with that.

261
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:42,750
I mean, but ok, so there,

262
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,469
there's way on the end and then I want to go to P GP way on the other side of the spectrum.

263
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,830
And the reason I say P GP is the

264
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,669
most controlled

265
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:56,849
is as the user, you generate the key, you store the key,

266
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,849
you decide when to encrypt and decrypt messages

267
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:03,359
and you decide the, the transfer mechanism of the messages, right?

268
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,840
So now all of that is why P GP also sucks

269
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,210
-- because nobody can do it
-- right. There's more than that. There's key backups.

270
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:15,955
You get a bunch of email and it's encrypted and you decrypt it. Great. That's great.

271
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,635
Now, but then you lose the key a week from now and you can't access any of that email

272
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,395
and, and this is the challenge with things like P GB and the,

273
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:27,914
I think one of the fundamental problems like, let's skip ahead a bit at meta,

274
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:31,344
the more control you give the user,

275
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,395
the more responsibility you're putting on the user.

276
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,979
That's right. Like key generation is a great example.

277
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,659
OK?

278
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,000
You want to securely generate the key and as people are pointing out

279
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,010
with all a lot of these like claimed end to end things,

280
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,359
it's like,

281
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,309
but you're generating the key using a piece of software

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,640
downloaded from a website that it's this binary blob like,

283
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,059
you know,

284
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,789
and, and we'll get to that in a minute.

285
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,429
But what I'm trying to point out is the slider is not

286
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,140
just oh we can move it to privacy and that's good.

287
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,960
It's no as you move it to privacy,

288
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:58,150
you also move the slider for what the user has to deal with.

289
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,739
That's right. There's like many variables and they all change.

290
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,900
So you can't say I'm in increasing privacy

291
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,159
and also increasing

292
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,200
usability because you probably aren't it.

293
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,039
It's, it's a very difficult equation, right?

294
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,650
It's very hard.

295
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:12,739
It,

296
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,179
it sometimes feels to me like one of the best ways I had

297
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,090
relativity explained to me on some youtube video is think of like speed

298
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,609
on one axis

299
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,489
and like distance on another.

300
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,059
And you can basically, you have a finite amount of,

301
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,659
of, of energy, I forget what they call it. But basically, you know what I mean? Like

302
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,770
as speed goes up, distance decreases as distance increases, speed goes down.

303
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,539
Like there's nothing you can do about that.

304
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,200
It's just the, the law of reality. And I think

305
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,960
all of this encrypted everything

306
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,400
is the same story.

307
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:48,280
Like there are tradeoffs all over the place and

308
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,809
anyone claiming to have solved it all is,

309
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,960
is just lying.

310
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,330
And that's the thing I've seen even with all the clever math around like zero

311
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,039
knowledge proofs and all this other stuff which to be clear,

312
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,849
like things like perfect forward secrecy are very important.

313
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,429
But again, a great example, perfect forward secrecy is a great example because oh,

314
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,039
now every message is encrypted with a different key,

315
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,270
right?

316
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:11,909
Uh I'm going to keep those where

317
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,710
OK. Well, let's use a key

318
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:17,549
derivation scheme or derivation. I don't know how to pronounce that word.

319
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,750
So, but again, like just things get horrifically complicated and,

320
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,159
and you still have these underlying problems of

321
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,750
like the user at some point has to like

322
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,489
maintain control of and back up this key and people are terrible at stuff like that.

323
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:29,900
Right?

324
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,890
Well, so here's the organizations are OK,

325
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,510
but people are terrible at this

326
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,200
and that's the other problem too.

327
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,000
People confuse like, oh, but my company does this and it's not so bad.

328
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,330
Well, yeah, but your company is like a full time people of

329
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:44,169
like a full time team of 10 people to, to do this.

330
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,109
I'm just a person like I, I got, like,

331
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,510
I actually have all my physical UB keys here

332
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,190
on my desk right now because I was updating my

333
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,539
logins and I have to schlep one over to the bank and put it in the safe deposit box.

334
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:55,270
So it's off site.

335
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,530
Yeah. Such a pain in the butt.

336
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,929
Yep. Yep. So let's, let's, I want to pick on signal now

337
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,700
because signals kind of a little farther up the scale from

338
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,030
P GP. Well, way up the scale from P GP

339
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,609
in terms of usability,

340
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,599
it's, it's much easier.

341
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,390
So if you, if you pay attention to the world of signal,

342
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,909
you're going to hear people complain at length

343
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,359
that you have to use a phone number. That the only way to assign names to

344
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:24,859
signal users in the app is to give it access to your contact list.

345
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:29,099
You're gonna hear complaints about the way it stores the messages on the devices

346
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,619
and there's all these very legitimate complaints. But here's the thing.

347
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,659
So I think signal is at a place where they've created

348
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,140
pretty good

349
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,340
privacy

350
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,130
and relative use.

351
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,969
It still has some drawbacks by all means.

352
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,010
But I think

353
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,330
it again, you have to make these tradeoffs. And like an example is with signal,

354
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,770
there is an encryption key stored on your device.

355
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,070
But if you're using a, like a, a phone, which I guess you need a phone to set it up,

356
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,609
the key to decrypt, your key is stored in the,

357
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,809
the the, the enclave or whatever they call it on the particular device.

358
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,270
You have a secure enclave,

359
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,530
-- which is cool and that does its
-- job until your phone breaks.

360
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,020
Well, right, that's just it.

361
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,979
If your phone breaks,

362
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:16,130
you can reclaim your signal account but you lose all

363
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,369
the old messages and all the people you're connected with.

364
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,570
Get a message saying like Kurtz, what do they call it? Um,

365
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,559
some, some number.

366
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,080
Let me look, I,

367
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,380
I have someone who actually has a message for me that just changed phones.

368
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:26,820
Um

369
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,539
The safety number, they call

370
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,250
safety number. That's the one safety number in signal.

371
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,289
It'll say someone's safety number has changed

372
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,780
and then the intent is out of band. You ask them what's going on.

373
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,460
The idea with signal is obviously you've got,

374
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:43,960
let's say Kurt has a message, he sends me his device encrypts a message

375
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,679
the message is sent over the internet through the

376
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,179
signal infrastructure which signal has no way to decrypt this

377
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:53,530
and then I get a copy and my device decrypt it

378
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,140
now like one of the challenges here is

379
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,760
we're still using signal infrastructure and signal apps.

380
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,750
If signal decides to go rogue,

381
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,109
they could almost definitely start shipping those keys back home.

382
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:07,460
I get like so many signal app updates on my desktop like

383
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,359
at least one or two a week and I just hit restart signal

384
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,169
because what else am I gonna do?

385
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:12,530
Yeah.

386
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,809
Well, then on desktop especially, I don't like on my desktop,

387
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,200
I have a pretty old desktop.

388
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,700
I don't have any hardware backed, anything, storing those keys,

389
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,369
they're just all sitting on disk,

390
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,690
you know.

391
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:28,929
So, I mean, that's an example of where signal is actually very weak in that regard.

392
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,460
But, I mean, if you want to have it on a person's desktop,

393
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,309
yeah. I mean, like, my desktop is a bit locker encrypted for work. But

394
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,690
again, most people are not going to do that and you can't really force them.

395
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,340
-- That would be insane. I
-- can't do that because my, my motherboard is too old.

396
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,289
And I mean, and this is one thing that I think Apple gets right with, at least,

397
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,859
even if it's just the pin number, like on your phone, at least your, your disk,

398
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:52,570
I say discs, I'm old, your chips.

399
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah, let's go with chips.

400
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,469
Your chips are, the data on the chips is encrypted, you know,

401
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,260
via the secure enclave via the pin, via the magic blah, blah, blah.

402
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,130
Yeah. Right. Right. Ok. Ok.

403
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,979
We're, we're going to run ourselves out of time before we get to all this. But

404
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,098
so here's the thing,

405
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:05,540
right?

406
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:05,900
We,

407
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,260
we've put a ton of trust into the signal

408
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,489
organization and their infrastructure to route their messages.

409
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,118
And now in the case of signal because like Moxie Marlin Spike runs it

410
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,219
and the people who work on signal are

411
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,979
extremely vocal about privacy.

412
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,500
I have no doubt

413
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,239
that

414
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,020
we would know if shenanigans began. Right. That, that's part of the,

415
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,520
well, I feel like Moxy Marlin Spike, like, would tweet about it.

416
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,349
And now it's like, oh,

417
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:31,780
that's not going to age. Well,

418
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,609
I wonder if he's un master on yet. I need to look anyway.

419
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,910
But here's the thing.

420
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,060
Now, let's kind of move ourselves up and you get into some of these other services.

421
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:43,020
There's like, I think, what is it? It's whatsapp and Matrix and

422
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,020
there's a handful of other services that offer.

423
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,219
They,

424
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:49,189
they claim they have end to end encryption and some

425
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,900
of them do an OK job from what I've read,

426
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,739
some of them don't.

427
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,390
Perfect example, you can have end to end encryption,

428
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,920
but we're not saying anything about who has the keys.

429
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,599
Like it's just end to end encrypted.

430
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:03,969
Like a perfect example of this email, my connection to gmail SSL or TLS encrypted

431
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,189
their connection to the next email server TLS encrypted. Great, but it's not. And

432
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:09,270
so it's,

433
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,579
it's not technically end to end encrypted.

434
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:15,310
It's, it's like a bunch of armored conduit along the way.

435
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,439
But the, you know, the message itself is not encrypted.

436
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,229
But even if it, the message itself were encrypted

437
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,569
again, like I could do P GP and give Google my keys so that they can do spam filtering.

438
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,369
And that's a perfect example too is there's,

439
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,119
there's big usability tradeoffs with end to end with what

440
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,640
-- you can't do content filtering apart from on the end device now,
-- right?

441
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,589
That's right. And but at the same time giving Google your key

442
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,150
obviously now severely negates the security you were getting

443
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,030
with

444
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,510
end to end encrypted email, right?

445
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,410
And this, I mean, this is one of my complaints about so like key base,

446
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,540
which I haven't brought up yet,

447
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:52,069
key base I would say exists somewhere between signal and P GP probably.

448
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,969
But like one of the downfalls is key base will

449
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,130
give you the ability to basically like protect your key.

450
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,880
Well, it's like, well, if you have my freaking key, it's not protected.

451
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,310
I, I don't know if they've changed this. I haven't looked at key base in a long time.

452
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:01,520
You know,

453
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,829
they gave up when they tried to make that weird

454
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,400
swap to being a messaging app and I get it,

455
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,800
they had to like make money.

456
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,030
Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,380
But, but you get the idea like this is really hard to do and there's

458
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,040
any time you try to create usability,

459
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,979
you almost always end up decreasing security.

460
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:23,239
And I don't know if this is like a law of the universe II, I would like to think it's not,

461
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,800
-- but I think it might be,
-- I think it is

462
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:30,849
to a degree. So uh a segway money is a great example. Why do we use banks?

463
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,209
Because moving Sheep is hard.

464
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,750
Like I have to go to the bank to get my money.

465
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,290
But on the other hand, I don't have to store a pile of cash in my house and guard it.

466
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,219
And I'd also like to go out for dinner once in a while

467
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,010
and again, it's back to that whole, the more responsibility,

468
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,925
like the more control have, generally speaking, the more responsibility I have.

469
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:51,984
And I mean, I'm even looking at this in terms of cloud where this, we're going.

470
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:52,025
Um,

471
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:55,145
I'm trying to push us from a shared responsibility model

472
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:58,625
to a shared responsibility and capability model because for example,

473
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:02,375
I can't necessarily have a responsibility if you don't give me that capability.

474
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:05,525
So, oh, you know, I'm going to be in control of my key. Great. How do I back it up?

475
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:06,665
Oh, that's my problem.

476
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:07,864
Great.

477
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,104
Right?

478
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,380
Like that for

479
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:15,369
OK. Now what like, oh like print some stuff out and put in your safe deposit box. Cool.

480
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,420
I'm privileged enough to be able to afford that. Great.

481
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:20,390
Most people on in this planet don't have access

482
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,489
to a bank with a safe deposit box nearby.

483
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,750
And I think this is a fundamental law of

484
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,880
nature as you get more security and more responsibility,

485
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:31,729
you get more responsibility, you know, you have to do more stuff yourself.

486
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:32,510
And I think that's

487
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,130
one of the big

488
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,540
things holding this end to end back because like, I don't want to have to deal with,

489
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,790
you know, I want to be able to filter my messages for spam

490
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,280
and like not me do it. I want to be able to,

491
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,750
well, I want to be able to read my messages in two years.

492
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:47,160
You know, how many, how many P GP keys have we lost between us or destroyed?

493
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,030
I mean, well, we, we burnt our current keys.

494
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,239
I actually haven't gone through that many keys because remember

495
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,660
the insane episode of how I protected my keys,

496
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,890
but like I've lost old keys or just, you know, it's like I've lost track of them like

497
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,989
they're still valid and they're maybe floating around in a backup somewhere.

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,270
But man, I'd have to go through so many files to dig them out.

499
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,280
Whatever. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

500
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,550
-- The point is,
-- well,

501
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,569
it does when that is like your will and it's

502
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,449
encrypted and your next of kin want to read it,

503
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:13,719
-- but
-- no

504
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:14,819
-- one's
-- gonna do that.

505
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:18,250
Like the point of having a will, you actually have to register the will publicly.

506
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,180
Well, ok. Will was a bad example. But

507
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:22,550
-- ok, your Bitcoin wallet,
-- I mean,

508
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,270
oh, I should, I should make sure that still works

509
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,849
-- while it's still worth some money.
-- Bitcoin will survive, I think.

510
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,560
But that's kind of another topic

511
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,709
because Bitcoin is the foundation of crime.

512
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:37,609
So it's money laundering,

513
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,170
-- literally,
-- it's money laundering and transfer of value between criminals.

514
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,199
-- It absolutely
-- has to

515
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,449
not today, not today, not today, encrypted messaging apps.

516
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:48,390
So, so anyway, there's this huge gamut, you know,

517
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,089
I'm I'm imagining in my mind the scale of all these apps,

518
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,099
they all fit in all these different places.

519
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,689
And

520
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,750
I think normal people think virtually all of them are safe. Right. Like

521
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,130
you can send a message with Facebook or Twitter

522
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,430
and theoretically their employees could look at it.

523
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,650
-- Like, will they probably not because they have,
-- like, not theoretically, they

524
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:07,810
practically,

525
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,689
well, it's, it's more complicated than that though because they, well,

526
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:11,380
I shouldn't say that

527
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:12,589
they should

528
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,660
have various controls in place that if someone looks

529
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,989
at a message it gets logged in a certain way

530
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,170
and then

531
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,329
action is taken if they weren't supposed to be looking at that.

532
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,319
And there's like a lot because you hear about this every now and

533
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:29,810
then where someone was looking at some celebrity photos or messages or whatever.

534
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,229
Well, and the thing to remember too is like,

535
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,670
sometimes companies have to look at it because if I hit report message, well,

536
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,469
now somebody like hopefully an automated system deals with it at some point.

537
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:38,689
But

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,339
at some point, you know, might have to get kicked up to a human,

539
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,300
which for example is where Mastodon is right now.

540
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,439
Like if you hit report

541
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,010
me

542
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:45,959
or user,

543
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,400
it kicks it into the moderation queue

544
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,099
or notification queue or whatever it's called.

545
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,800
And the Mastodon admins get poked and like

546
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,349
they have to go look at it to deal with it because what else are they gonna do?

547
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,410
Well, yeah, exactly. It's literally how it works.

548
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:01,900
So anyway, now in the encrypted messaging universe,

549
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:06,109
there is services that will encrypt the or, or rather

550
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,030
I I they'll, they'll keep the key for you, for example, in their service.

551
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,540
And so while the message is encrypted, the key is near the message. And so like

552
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,369
is how secure is that?

553
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,199
Now, you have to think about securing the key and securing the message.

554
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,390
There's no good answer to this. And I, I

555
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,930
find it infinitely frustrating

556
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,689
that

557
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,530
Mastodon doesn't have a better message saying like literally like the, the,

558
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,160
the wherever this message is going, they can read it,

559
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,849
which again

560
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:38,219
is technically correct. The reality is it's not going to happen in most cases.

561
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,670
And then there's also the instances of

562
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,550
when,

563
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,489
when a service is storing a key in a way that maybe isn't as secure as it should be.

564
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,089
They're just like, oh yes, we're and, and encrypted, everything is fine,

565
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:49,609
everybody.

566
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,410
And it's like, no, you're not signal, stop pretending you are.

567
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,849
And it's very, and how do people even figure this out? You know what I mean?

568
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,989
Well, it's also opaque, right? Because some,

569
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,109
oh a great example,

570
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,979
there were some various add ons for like send mail and P GP where

571
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:08,189
you could encrypt outgoing email to that person using their P GP key,

572
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,209
discovering, using Dane DNS.

573
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,270
Dane as a protocol to put your P GP keys into DNS and discover them and blah blah blah.

574
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,310
So now you don't have end to end encryption but for example,

575
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,670
it's like I send an encrypted message to

576
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,400
the server, the server decrypt it, the server

577
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,459
encrypts it to everybody.

578
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:25,260
And if it, you know, because we were on that list, right?

579
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:26,339
And um,

580
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,869
so it's like quasi

581
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,000
end to end with that decryption step in the middle.

582
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,199
But if it's done reasonably well and properly, you know,

583
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,520
there's nothing left around for an attacker to find

584
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:35,719
after the fact,

585
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:36,920
like if the attacker sitting on the

586
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,630
server watching everything and watching memory,

587
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
then obviously they would see every message coming in.

588
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,280
And that's the other thing people forget is

589
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,439
what are you protecting against? Are you protecting?

590
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:50,719
Like, are you, are you shipping nuclear secrets that like just cannot be seen?

591
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:52,479
Or is it like this is data

592
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,030
that we don't

593
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,239
want people to discover later and decrypt and read?

594
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,979
But like, you know, if they break into the server and they're reading it right now,

595
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:01,790
that's bad.

596
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,420
But we can serve like we can kind of deal with that,

597
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,979
but we don't want somebody to find this trove of 50 years

598
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,060
worth of documentation and just decrypt the whole thing and read it.

599
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,819
And again, it gets very complicated, very quickly of like, what's the threat model?

600
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:13,939
What's the attack model? What

601
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:15,359
I think

602
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,979
that's the key, right? What you just hit on is how the show has to end

603
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:24,109
is like, if I'm sending you a direct message in Mastodon,

604
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,099
there's a 100% guaranteed chance that if you copy

605
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,390
and pasted that message and stuck it in public,

606
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,780
I wouldn't care at all because

607
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:36,939
I'm not going to use Mastodon messaging for anything even remotely useful

608
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,599
because I understand what it is right

609
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,089
now.

610
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,160
If I use signal,

611
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,280
like I trust the signal people enough that I don't think my

612
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,770
message is going to leak and the person I'm talking to,

613
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm still going to be mindful.

614
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,400
They could obviously copy and paste or screenshot or whatever.

615
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,239
And so it depends who you're talking to right there is or, or your instance where you,

616
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:56,469
you just mentioned the the email server where

617
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,229
you encrypt a message to the email server,

618
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,270
the email server un encrypts, it re encrypts it to all the people.

619
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Like that's an instance where the untrusted parties

620
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,329
are the email providers for the users,

621
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:11,310
which was the case and the person who owned the email server was very trusted.

622
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,660
And so there was no concern there. The concern was where the email was going to go.

623
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,869
And so that was an instance where

624
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,229
obviously kind of the,

625
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:23,310
the the usability concerns were taken into account

626
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,709
and this was the solution to make this happen

627
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,510
and thrown out the door.

628
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,739
No, no, not at all.

629
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:35,069
Because here's the thing, the way this, the way it could have worked is

630
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,150
I have everyone's P GP key in my key ring,

631
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,270
I address a mail and then also encrypt it

632
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,859
individually to every single key and then send it

633
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,280
-- and that would be ridiculous. Well,
-- no P GP can do that. Couldn't.

634
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,250
I thought P GP could do like encrypted group

635
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,550
anyways, it doesn't matter.

636
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:56,040
You can encrypt to multiple people at the same time in one message.

637
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,390
But you have to obviously say like all of these people get encrypted to

638
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,280
and it's a pain in the neck

639
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,880
but no back to this. So, so what it boils down to is

640
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,239
your messages on Mastodon are not

641
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,199
in any way, shape or form encrypted.

642
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,619
There is work being done on end to end

643
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,859
encryption and Mastodon like the scaffolding is there.

644
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,239
-- But
-- so here's what I'm going to say about that because I've been thinking

645
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:23,040
about this a lot since I was reading some of the proposals.

646
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,390
If you give people true end to end encryption,

647
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,069
they're going to be real happy until their computer crashes and

648
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,209
they lose their key and they can't read their old messages.

649
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,119
I don't think that's the issue at all though.

650
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:36,800
I think Mastodon apps on a phone have the potential to do this

651
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,839
correctly because you can store the keys in enclaves and things like that.

652
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:43,170
But Mastodon as many of us use it is a website.

653
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:47,930
There is literally no good way to store that key on a website

654
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:51,329
that the server can't just slurp it up off of your machine.

655
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,430
And now that there, there are API S to work on some of this,

656
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:58,160
but they're not as good as they should be.

657
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,369
And so I think that's going to be the challenge of Mastodon running in browser

658
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,050
is you're still not really much better off than saying I have to trust the instant

659
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,170
app

660
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,270
because that's where you land

661
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,020
even with end to end encrypted. And of course, OK, run your own instance, whatever.

662
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,420
But the reality is no, most people can't do that

663
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,439
well. and you know, there's a great thread about this.

664
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,640
I think it was on Twitter where basically somebody tore into

665
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,530
end to end encryption and why it's so darn hard.

666
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,719
And

667
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,130
you know, even if you do this perfectly through a webinar face.

668
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,420
Well, where's that webinar face coming from? You know, where's that

669
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,439
executable blob coming from blah, blah, blah. Like people can't

670
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,810
-- be auditing this code every time it downloads to their browser.
-- Absolutely not.

671
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:37,729
And, and here's the thing,

672
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:41,880
even if the key is protected using whatever the fancy new web API S

673
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,969
are to store keys locally in enclaves and all this at some point,

674
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:47,979
the message is presented to the user

675
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:53,964
and that is when it can be stolen. Like there's just, it is such a hard problem to do.

676
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:56,694
And this is again why we come back to that sliding scale

677
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,755
of why P GP is way down on the end in the,

678
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,685
-- in the dumpster
-- and nobody uses

679
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:01,944
it

680
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:05,224
and it's terrible and like it, it's theoretically

681
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:06,645
perfect security.

682
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:09,045
-- But humans,
-- I think a great example of this,

683
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:12,604
the P GP commercial encryption product that does P GP encrypted email.

684
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:13,564
What does it do

685
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:17,265
when you send the email to a person with no key? I assume it just doesn't encrypt it.

686
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:22,635
Well, no, it does. And what it does is it sends them a link to log into a web portal

687
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,500
to view the message encrypted.

688
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:27,910
-- Oh, yes. I've seen this actually.
-- Yes. And that's it.

689
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,420
-- Like, because what else are you going to do though?
-- Nothing.

690
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,180
There's nothing else you can do.

691
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,560
And so I,

692
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:34,989
yeah, I think

693
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,449
end to end encryption.

694
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:40,589
I'm not against it, doing it properly so that people keep access to their data

695
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,349
is a lot harder than I think most people even begin to think.

696
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,339
No, it, it's kind of that, that whole ii I hesitate to call it even Dunning Kruger.

697
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,060
But it's, it's what, what? There's so much we don't know, we don't know.

698
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:58,500
And like, I'm even willing to admit that when we start getting into the math,

699
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,819
my knowledge drops off very quickly and there's all kinds of

700
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:04,339
new technologies now that I'm not even that familiar with that.

701
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:08,790
I, I was reading a whole bunch of them before this and like it's easy to say,

702
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,530
end to end encrypted is impossible or too hard or we can't

703
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,189
do it or whatever and have a very doom and gloom attitude.

704
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,869
I think there's a lot of good work happening.

705
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,329
And I think we are always getting better in this space.

706
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:23,180
And I think it's important we try

707
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:26,849
and we fail because every time we fail, we learn something new.

708
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,040
And I think this is one of the challenges, especially in the crypto space.

709
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,949
Oh I can't say crypto anymore.

710
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:33,099
This is

711
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,939
especially in the encryption space.

712
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,890
-- Well,
-- not after last week, even

713
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,609
the crypto space, holy cow.

714
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,250
But in the encryption space,

715
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,000
there's,

716
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,030
there's often this attitude of perfect or nothing and

717
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,099
sometimes it's very justified because like for example,

718
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:52,150
my my open S SS L running my web browser that better be perfect.

719
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:52,930
But

720
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,390
there's always room for change and growth.

721
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,060
And I think that's kind of the takeaway here is yes, it's hard.

722
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,619
Yes, Mastodon has no security. There are smart people working on it

723
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,500
and you can complain

724
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,180
and tell them they're dumb for trying or

725
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:08,875
go freaking help like,

726
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:09,625
-- you
-- know,

727
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,074
or run your own instance and only allow

728
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,175
trusted people and then have someone you trust,

729
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,155
run the server.

730
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:16,295
But even then I'm

731
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:19,385
OK, I'm running it in the cloud. Do I trust my cloud provider?

732
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:20,795
Like there's, oh my goodness. It's

733
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:23,104
so let me get this straight. I can run a Masto

734
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:25,864
on instance in my basement bunker

735
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:30,265
on hardware I control uh oh crap. I have to use the public internet.

736
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:35,150
So I mean, we're back to the people running their own email server still.

737
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,489
Oh, that's true. That was that,

738
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,859
that was last week, that was last week from when this goes out. Um

739
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,280
And it's funny because actually we put it in the, the, the, the toot, I guess from,

740
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:44,920
from Mastodon.

741
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,839
But we recorded that episode

742
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:51,140
before like Twitter and Mastodon and everything happened and I'm like,

743
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,849
oh my goodness.

744
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:52,329
And, and part

745
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:56,724
of this now I will say I'm rethinking some of the whole,

746
00:31:56,734 --> 00:32:01,555
like Federated community driven everything, which I think we took a,

747
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:04,974
a kind of anti doing it yourself view in that episode.

748
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:07,795
And I'm going to have to rethink that in the context of Mastodon,

749
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:09,255
but I'm not willing to

750
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:13,275
-- say anything about it yet.
-- It's not that I'm against doing it yourself. But like

751
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:16,550
there's a reason I pay taxes so that we can have roads.

752
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,719
I don't want to build my own roads.

753
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,270
And granted that's really too hard.

754
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,310
Running a mass on server is definitely doable. But

755
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,400
the thing is

756
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,060
everybody forgets there's that operational ongoing cost.

757
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:31,339
This is literally a puppy that grows into a dog and you can't ignore

758
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,579
-- it for a week because this
-- is why if you're a Mastodon user,

759
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,699
I would highly encourage you to

760
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,750
go on Patreon and give your instance or the Mastodon project money.

761
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,420
Like they'll take a freaking dollar a month,

762
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,760
which for most of us is probably what it's worth.

763
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,900
Maybe it's slightly less. But

764
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,319
like this is, we're not the product anymore.

765
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:51,199
We have to start paying for the product and I

766
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:53,770
think that's probably a topic for another day as well.

767
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,060
But anyway, Corey

768
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,810
Drako, uh,

769
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,709
we should put that in the show. He just wrote a really good article about that.

770
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,910
How, even if you're paying for it,

771
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,800
you're probably still the product in a lot of these things

772
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:04,145
that could be, I should read that. I have not read it.

773
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:04,944
But anyway, all right,

774
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:08,665
I'm gonna cut us off because we're hilariously off topic as always.

775
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:10,214
