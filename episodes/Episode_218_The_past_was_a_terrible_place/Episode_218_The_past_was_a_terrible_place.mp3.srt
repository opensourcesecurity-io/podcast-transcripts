Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,149
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:10,739
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,649
Yeah. So I'm pretty wound up today

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,090
and this week's bias is anchoring.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,600
The first thing you judge influences your judgment of all

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,540
that follows and it applies to what we're talking about.

7
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,750
-- This week.
-- Last week's bias was anchoring. Well, it might not even be last week.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,309
I don't know when this episode's coming out.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,360
Yeah, because I just edited it a couple of days ago.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,440
Yeah, I did

11
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:29,760
that.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,680
It can't be anchoring again.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,990
Let's, uh,

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,000
we are a completely professional podcast for any new listeners.

15
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,950
Hang on a second.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,349
Here's the better. No, here's the one I actually wanted. Whoops.

17
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,860
Ok. Let me restart.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,779
No, I'm not. I'm not letting you restart

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,970
-- the
-- bias. I actually wanted. Sorry, was the decline is

20
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,119
you remember the past is better than it was

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,490
and expect the future to be worse than evidence suggests

22
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,173
will be

23
00:00:59,562 --> 00:00:59,983
like that.

24
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,243
Sorry, I spaced out. Yeah, because an

25
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:06,163
anchoring was on top because my goal was to have the ones we've used on top of the pile.

26
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:07,413
So I don't use them again, but of course,

27
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,492
I anchored on it and I was like this one.

28
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:13,252
So yeah, so this is um well,

29
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:16,252
I was gonna say this shows inspired by a hacker news posting,

30
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,013
but it's something that we consistently see every month or two.

31
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:21,002
-- Somebody complaining about.
-- Totally

32
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:25,185
let you explain because you sent me the story. So it's, it's yours.

33
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,265
So essentially there's this like issue in github

34
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:32,625
for Docker and the person replies, sorry, I missed your comment.

35
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:36,136
As of many months ago, I no longer build software. I now make furniture out of wood.

36
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,435
The hours are long. The pay sucks.

37
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,986
And there's always the opportunity to remove my finger with a table saw.

38
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:43,685
But nobody asked me if I can add an RSS feed to a DB MS. So there's that,

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,919
of course,

40
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,319
then there's this huge hacker news thread about

41
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,720
basically how I guess to summarize it,

42
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,260
the old software industry was good and the new one is bad.

43
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,919
I think that is a completely accurate description. Yes,

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,910
-- and
-- it's completely wrong and stupid. Of

45
00:01:59,059 --> 00:01:59,260
course, so

46
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,260
-- many reasons. That's
-- why I'm so wound up about this one.

47
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,080
-- I know
-- where

48
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,319
-- to
-- even begin with this. So

49
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,800
well, you know, reread

50
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,160
the bias. You just read

51
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:08,820
decline

52
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,070
is,

53
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,830
you remember the past is better than it was and expect

54
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,729
the future to be worse than evidence suggests it will be.

55
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,690
There we go. That's where we start the past

56
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,250
-- in the context of software development.
-- The golden era of software development.

57
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:25,009
Ok. It was categorically worse than it is today.

58
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,669
It wasn't just worse. The, the

59
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,139
were worse,

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,440
the amount of effort it took was worse every time

61
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,380
I load a file in emacs and emacs is like,

62
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,800
oh, this file is bigger than 10 megabytes.

63
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,660
You sure you want to do that? I'm like, yeah, shut up. Just do it.

64
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,419
-- Wait,
-- do you still run emacs?

65
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:39,699
Yeah.

66
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,460
And it's a, there's this default for 10 megabyte file size, same thing in send mail,

67
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,619
right?

68
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,449
When you set up, send mail, it's a default 10 meg max attachment size.

69
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,699
And I remember when that mattered because my system had eight megabytes of ra M.

70
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,279
So you load a 10 megabyte file on a system with eight megabytes of ram.

71
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,669
Guess what happens? It goes, boom.

72
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,139
Well, no,

73
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:58,660
the whatever sound your hard drive makes you get to hear

74
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,759
-- that for the next 10 minutes
-- and then it goes,

75
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,399
boom.

76
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,619
-- Well, it works. But slowly,
-- well, maybe, I mean, it depends. Om killer off.

77
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,759
It'll kick in and murder something.

78
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:11,070
I had like 40 or 50 megabyte swap file.

79
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,770
-- That is sad.
-- I had eight megs of ra M. At least my buddy had four,

80
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:14,929
you

81
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,360
know, and he didn't even have an OK. And my friend didn't even have a numeric

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,029
Coros.

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,970
So it was faster for him to compile the Linux kernel

84
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,600
on my 46 DX 266 with eight megs of ra M

85
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,779
and download the compiled kernel off and modules off

86
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,199
my system over a 9600 bod onto his 386.

87
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah. But that's because the kernel could fit on a floppy disk.

88
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,960
But I mean,

89
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,970
the point is like it was faster to compile it somewhere else and download it at 9600

90
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,619
bod than to just wait for 3 to 6 to chew through it because he had no numerical

91
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,399
coros

92
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:44,910
and not enough memory.

93
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:45,800
I mean,

94
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,190
what gets me is like the stuff you and I both did

95
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,399
with monkeying around with make files and hand editing source code to.

96
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,369
And I don't mean like downloading some project where oh it's a little bit broken.

97
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,059
I'm talking about

98
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,360
downloading, you know, something from like

99
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,440
ISC,

100
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,559
this is a major software release that's supposed

101
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,339
to basically run the internet and yeah,

102
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,750
it doesn't compile out of the box.

103
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:09,869
Yeah, that was, that was super common. So OK, let's even ignore that aspect of it.

104
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,779
I just want to focus on. So here's, here's my view of this.

105
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,358
So if you look at the past, we had limited languages.

106
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,059
In fact, I just had this discussion with, with my son,

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,200
-- dude, we had C and Pearl
-- basically. And, and so the context of this was

108
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,170
he was asking me about programming languages and kind of how

109
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:33,165
did and it came about because he actually in one of his classes,

110
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,816
the kids were told in his, it's called digital literacy,

111
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:38,515
which is what we would have called computer class back in the day.

112
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:42,786
And digital literacy. Basically, the teacher said, here's a bunch of free tools.

113
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,115
You have to pick one,

114
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,335
learn how to use it and then make a thing with it.

115
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,626
And my son picked Inscape because he's,

116
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,716
he heard of me talking about it in the past because

117
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,325
Inscape is a vector drawing program and if you're making like low

118
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:56,361
or anything, you got to use vector graphics, right.

119
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:59,291
-- Anyway, then they resize and they get all chunky.
-- Yeah, exactly.

120
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:03,212
So he basically says like, how is this free? Why is this free? What's the deal here?

121
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,101
-- It's a
-- good question. No, I remember people ask like, how's open source work?

122
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,962
-- How are you going to eat? And I'm like, people pay me to work. Right.
-- Right.

123
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:11,571
But so we were walking the dog and it was,

124
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:14,891
I had about 30 minutes to explain and I think I used all my time

125
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,332
-- captive
-- audience, the dog

126
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,471
head. Exactly.

127
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,059
But anyway, like I was talking about the fact that when I was in high school,

128
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,429
if I wanted to do software development,

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,679
my option was essentially c there was really no,

130
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,549
-- like nobody wrote Pearl or Python and
-- what we think of as,

131
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,269
as the modern tool chain barely existed.

132
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,220
Well, and it didn't, you had to pay for it and very expensive.

133
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,190
Well, and just getting like getting GCC to compile something was,

134
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,010
I remember hand editing stuff,

135
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,540
running it and then it would fail halfway through

136
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,679
ignoring that though even Kurt, just if you wanted to write C code, you had to pay so

137
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:56,339
or Microsoft or someone like that, an enormous sum of money.

138
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,100
And then Linux appears and we have all these amazing free tools and it's

139
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:06,940
like this is literally thousands of dollars worth of operating system and tools.

140
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh,

141
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,640
easily I remember pricing out. Yeah. Was it so's

142
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,019
compiler or

143
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:13,540
it was one of the,

144
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,260
all of the compilers,

145
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:18,619
compilers or it was one of the compilers that doesn't exist

146
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,084
anymore because they went out of business because quite frankly,

147
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:25,424
like, yeah, GCC ate their lunch and yeah, like I didn't have thousands of dollars.

148
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,084
-- Right. Right.
-- I mean, I remember, like, I think Borland was the cheap one.

149
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:29,695
Borland.

150
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:30,614
-- Yes,
-- that was it.

151
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:32,605
It was a couple of 100 bucks and I didn't

152
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,105
-- have a couple of 100 bucks
-- for the student edition.

153
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:39,595
-- Yeah. And, but if you wanted it for a corporate, like commercial use pony up.
-- Right.

154
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,125
Right. Exactly. And,

155
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,519
and so anyway,

156
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,230
we, you can say, OK, so that was the golden age of software development.

157
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,100
It was c and you had to kind of artisan

158
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,209
generate all your libraries and make everything work together

159
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,059
-- and it was terrible
-- to make stuff cross platform was,

160
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,269
it was an art like it wasn't simple like it is now.

161
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,839
But like I remember people arguing that you can't use,

162
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,980
make S temp because it's not portable across platforms.

163
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,850
-- And, well, the reality is it wasn't,
-- well, that's, I mean, that's where pai

164
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,570
came from, which was the,

165
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,584
oh, we unify everything except it didn't,

166
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:17,234
-- well, it made it less worse.
-- It did make it less worse, but for sure it was still,

167
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:20,765
-- there were weird isms everywhere. There was
-- just missing stuff.

168
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:21,214
Yeah. Right.

169
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:21,744
Right. Right.

170
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,154
Well, and part of it too is like,

171
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:26,505
software development is getting better and I'm not talking, like, 3% a year,

172
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:27,915
but like, 10 or 20% a year.

173
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:31,755
At least I remember when Pearl CP Pan became a thing and it was just like, oh,

174
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:37,450
my goodness, I can just go get a Pearl library easily and by easily, I mean,

175
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,420
by modern standards, everybody would cry.

176
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,799
It was

177
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,049
back in the day.

178
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:44,179
It was, it was so much easier because literally back in the day it was like,

179
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,649
I need something that does this,

180
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,339
I guess I'll use maybe Altavista to search for it.

181
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,140
Maybe if I'm lucky, find a library because it's not like we had github

182
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,559
or Source Forge or some Unified space where you could look for stuff. Right.

183
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,779
You had to track it down on some random university site.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,089
Yeah, exactly.

185
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,690
And I remember literally downloading just random

186
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,744
libraries compiling them and being like,

187
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,165
ok, this one's completely broken, it just wouldn't even compile.

188
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:09,404
I'd get like, two or three that would compile, I'd run them and I'd be like, oh my God,

189
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,545
this one actually does what I want.

190
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:11,174
Hallelujah.

191
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,035
You know. And then

192
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,214
now most at this point people would say,

193
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,255
then I checked it into my source code repository, I think.

194
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,605
Well, we didn't have that.

195
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:22,204
Yeah, we did. We had R CS and CV S. It was fine.

196
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,184
Yeah, we had CVS

197
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:27,364
and, well, I never used R CS, thank goodness. But we had CV S and that was terrible.

198
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,424
It was terrible. It still is terrible to be clear.

199
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,419
But yeah, I mean, I,

200
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,190
I literally had a problem where I wanted to take a list of words and fuzzy match them,

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,619
not exactly match them, but fuzzy match them to other words.

202
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,979
So, you know, color and color with you like a Canadian spell it for example,

203
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,539
or industry terms

204
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,114
and have fuzzy matching and the math behind that and to build

205
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:51,015
that implementation yourself and see would be essentially back in the day.

206
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,645
That would have been thesis like phd level work, right?

207
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:56,554
Like if you built a working implementation of fuzzy string matching

208
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:57,474
20 years ago,

209
00:08:57,484 --> 00:09:00,825
that easily you would have presented that as your phd defense and they've been like,

210
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,604
yep, that's, yeah, absolutely.

211
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,369
And now in Python it's import fuzzy wuzzy and then like I actually

212
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,260
fit the code I needed to do the work into a tweet,

213
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,739
not a long tweet either like a 160 character tweet.

214
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,150
OK? I think we're stuck in the past too much here. The point is

215
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,780
it's easy to think of the past as a lovely, wonderful place.

216
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:23,299
-- But the reality is if you actually sit down and look at it, it was
-- terrible.

217
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,599
-- Everybody had cholera and died at the age of 27.
-- That's right.

218
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,539
And I, I can't

219
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,940
but wonder, I think part of it is,

220
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,500
is a combination of people think they understood the past and they really didn't.

221
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,460
It's no, it's exactly what you said. We love as humans.

222
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:38,419
We love to look at the past and say,

223
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,179
oh, how much better it was.

224
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,020
And

225
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,340
there's obviously this is just part of being a human, right?

226
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:44,570
It's,

227
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,580
it's our biases work this way and sometimes I'll think of how

228
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,119
much I enjoyed using Linux back and say that the early thousands.

229
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:58,020
But the reality is, it was terrible. But I don't remember the terribleness.

230
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,820
I just remember, like,

231
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,340
how proud I would be after spending two weeks getting my laptop to boot.

232
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:06,969
-- And it's like, now that's ridiculous.
-- Well, it also reminds me of like cars.

233
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,539
You know, people are like all old cars, you could, like, fix them yourself.

234
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,099
And it's like, I don't want to do that. I just want the damn thing to work.

235
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:15,039
-- And
-- that's so this is exactly where I was going to bring the conversation.

236
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,940
I'm glad you bring up cars. And

237
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:22,630
so I, my father in law restores classic automobiles that is like,

238
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,710
that is literally his job.

239
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,260
He owns a company that restores classic cars and he's, he's quite good at it.

240
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,929
And the work he does is phenomenal.

241
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,719
And I love listening to him though because he will complain to no end about how

242
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,760
dumb cars are today because they're full of computers and no one can work on them.

243
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,919
But here's the deal. Right. Those old cars, the gas mileage is terrible.

244
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,190
You can't go very fast and if you get in an accident, you're going to,

245
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:48,177
I, you know, you said something very subtle there, no one can work on them.

246
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:52,518
And the reality is obviously people can work on them because they get fixed.

247
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,437
Well, you need a village now though. Right.

248
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,638
Well, exactly what you need a village and you need technology.

249
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:59,348
You know, it reminds me of carpentry.

250
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,278
So, carpentry in Germany is still very much a very,

251
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,877
it's like a protected term basically.

252
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,588
And there's the concept of, you know,

253
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,838
a master carpenter versus a regular carpenter.

254
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:10,088
So I have a cousin in Germany who's a carpenter and

255
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,135
like, essentially that is culturally in Germany,

256
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:16,515
like being a doctor like that is a high skill, high wage job.

257
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,065
So here we go, master carpenter.

258
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:19,515
After working as a journeyman for a while,

259
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:21,556
a carpenter may go on to study or test as

260
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,546
a master carpenter in some countries such as Germany,

261
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:24,395
Iceland and Japan.

262
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,065
This is an arduous and expensive process requiring extensive knowledge,

263
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,135
including economic and legal knowledge and skill, blah, blah, blah.

264
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,286
The point is for my cousin to become a carpenter in Germany.

265
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:33,596
He took several years of apprenticing. One year of

266
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,116
ong where you have to travel for a year with only what you carry in your backpack.

267
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,713
And then he became a carpenter and then he actually went to school for,

268
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:42,314
I think it was three years in France to learn

269
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:45,383
new techniques of using like engineered wood products to build

270
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:48,133
just crazy stuff that again, 100 years ago,

271
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:51,723
a carpenter would have been like what spaceship don't understand?

272
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:52,513
Right.

273
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:56,973
But now with like laminated wood products, you can build just insanely cool stuff.

274
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,593
The table saw, comment about cutting your hand with a table saw.

275
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:03,544
Well, now there's a table saw that will detect it's a hot dog or a finger and stop

276
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,434
and I see people complaining about

277
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,762
and about the cost of it. And it's like true.

278
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:13,512
It is quite a bit more expensive than a $300 table saw. But like, what do fingers cost

279
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,791
like? Seriously? What do fingers cost? What are they worth on the chart?

280
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,921
I mean, in the context of us,

281
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:23,151
our fingers are extremely high value to us because if I chop my finger up,

282
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,211
-- I
-- would
-- assume this is true for a carpenter as well.

283
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:28,442
Funny you say this because I have a table saw in my woodshop and

284
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:30,791
I've taken all the safety guards off of it because I hate them.

285
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,502
Yeah, me too. I

286
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,789
keep them in a bin with some other random parts.

287
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,039
I finally threw them away when I moved all

288
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,750
my woodworking tools around because I moved them from the

289
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,119
garage up into the top of the garage where I have a nice room and I was like,

290
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,270
why didn't I do this suitor?

291
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,900
And I found my box of table so, stuff.

292
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,169
I'm like, you know what, I'm not even going to pretend I want this anymore.

293
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,260
Like I dumped it out in the trash or whatever it's gone.

294
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,169
Well, and that's the thing though.

295
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,070
There are like, chef's knives,

296
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,450
those things are wicked dangerous because they're really sharp and you can, like,

297
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,718
you know, if you can joint a lamb, well, you can cut your hand off with one.

298
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:05,007
No way, man, a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp knife. Exactly.

299
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,197
But, so that's the thing,

300
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,348
things that are inherently dangerous are typically do have safe ways to use them.

301
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,067
Like a table saw.

302
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:12,718
You have that little hockey stick shaped piece of

303
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:13,908
wood that you use to push the wood through.

304
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,528
-- You don't use your hand.
-- I do.

305
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:20,307
I have my hands never get anywhere near the blade and I have all the crazy

306
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:24,797
little holdy tools to make sure that's the case we're off on a tangent again.

307
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:25,997
That's all we do is tangents.

308
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Well, but the point is, you know, it's back in the day, you only had these kind of

309
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,020
tools that were not

310
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,840
as good, you know, like, yeah, given a set of chisels,

311
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,200
I want the super sharp chisels that will take my hand off if I

312
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,520
mess up with them because they're actually easier to use safely than a dull chisel

313
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,500
for sure. But the thing is also, there's, now there's better options.

314
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,840
There's, you know, various power tools that can do what that chisel did.

315
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:53,580
The A Dremel, for example, like I remember when Dremel came out and holy geez,

316
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,229
they were expensive now, you know, there are 100

317
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:56,793
they're less than that.

318
00:13:56,932 --> 00:14:00,992
I, in fact, my dre needs to be replaced and you can get a really nice one for about 50.

319
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:01,122
OK.

320
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,002
-- Exactly.
-- So I,

321
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:06,312
-- I, I just looked into
-- this, we have literally for carpentry just like software.

322
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,672
We have better tooling now

323
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,312
that allows like the things you and I can do with power tools.

324
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:14,793
It won't be as pretty or as good as a, as a professional carpenter, obviously.

325
00:14:14,802 --> 00:14:16,223
But the fact is we can get it done.

326
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,283
And that's part of what I think happens with this software thing is like

327
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:23,083
I need to do fuzzy string matching, import, fuzzy wuzzy, two lines of Coke.

328
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:23,625
I

329
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:27,176
get a nice CSV output of like all my matches with Weightings.

330
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:30,205
That, that is insanely amazing to me.

331
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:34,565
There's a second part to this as well is that if you look at the artisanal,

332
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,656
it of the past,

333
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:40,085
you had to be an artisan to use it. Right. Normal people couldn't do it.

334
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:45,806
But now we've reached a point where almost anyone can learn to write an application,

335
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,176
using the tools available.

336
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:51,556
It's actually quite trivial to stand up, let's say like a Hello World Web app.

337
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,739
Whereas in the past standing up a Hello World Web

338
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,219
app would have required an enormous body of knowledge.

339
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,780
Again, my friend who, you know, would compile his kernel on my machine.

340
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:03,719
We had to reverse engineer subnetting

341
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,619
because there was no documentation on how subnetting worked.

342
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,010
Like what was the bit mask?

343
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,710
It was in the RFC Y

344
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,409
Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

345
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:15,000
We had to like read the RFC and figure out how no, no, we had to,

346
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,270
we had to come up with a specific bit mask to make it work, right?

347
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,469
And we finally figured out that, you know, it's how the zeros and ones match up.

348
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:25,270
But I mean, it's not like we had some like networking for dummies book. We had an RFC

349
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:25,760
or

350
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,309
overflow. Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,799
Those things are not like instructional, those are reference documents.

352
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,700
-- There's a difference.
-- You know, actually it's funny you say that

353
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,205
because you say reference documents, instructional.

354
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,465
But I come from a time where reference documents was all you had. Yeah.

355
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:44,474
Well, exactly. So I view them as instructional even though that's demented.

356
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:44,854
Well,

357
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:47,854
they are instructional but they're instructional in the

358
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,344
way of you're already a journeyman carpenter.

359
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:54,335
-- Here's how this Dovetail saw works.
-- I would agree with that 100%.

360
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:59,265
-- In fact, the only now if I tell someone to go read the RFC, oh, you're
-- being

361
00:15:59,275 --> 00:15:59,844
a jerk.

362
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:03,594
I'm, yeah, exactly. I'm like f, you go read the RFC

363
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,510
and I think the reality is software much like cars got much more complex.

364
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:09,650
Now,

365
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,669
you can still have a single person effort

366
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,510
to build software and build good useful software.

367
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:18,190
But it's more rare because, you know, if you want to build an operating system,

368
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,700
you're going to generally, like you said, need a village,

369
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,109
not just a team but an entire village.

370
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,460
-- You know, somebody's got to do the icons and the artwork,
-- right?

371
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:31,570
I mean, I think the idea of some random dude sending an email to a news group that says,

372
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,030
oh, here's my little kernel.

373
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,450
I'm making this a project.

374
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,919
I'm skeptical that would ever work again at all.

375
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,419
There's literally one documented case of it in recent history and it was,

376
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,570
it's a very sad story.

377
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,109
-- It's not a sad story. Linux is
-- awesome. No, not Linux.

378
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:48,070
The, the other one, the one written in Assembler,

379
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,190
it involves mental illness and some other stuff.

380
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,460
-- It's,
-- oh, you mean the Temple Os guy? Yeah. Yeah. That's something different.

381
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,179
It's sad.

382
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,739
And I think part of it too is the bar is raised.

383
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:00,419
You know, you can't just write a Hello world app and run it on the command line.

384
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,089
You, it needs to be a web app like you said, which means you need a web server, dns.

385
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,739
Oh, well. And now you need SSL,

386
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,189
you know, you need certificates.

387
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,729
Perfect example of this.

388
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,489
I remember paying money.

389
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,489
Like I bought a copy of Red Hat Stronghold Secure web server.

390
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,608
And then when I bought a certificate from my website,

391
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,040
the poor company didn't know what to do because they're like, you're not a company.

392
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,890
I'm like, no, I'm an individual and I own

393
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,880
cre.org. And they're like,

394
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,209
ok,

395
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,180
-- I guess if you show us your passport, that'll work for proving that
-- you're only

396
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,859
$300 pretty

397
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,260
-- much.
-- Yeah.

398
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,209
Even just to get a fax,

399
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,339
like to scan a copy of my passport and send it to

400
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:37,449
them was a whole ordeal because I didn't have a digital camera.

401
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:40,369
-- Ok,
-- let's tie this back to automobiles, right?

402
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,510
Because now automobiles are complex and scary.

403
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,430
And in the early 19 hundreds, there were literally hundreds of car companies.

404
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,579
And if you just had four wheels and an engine,

405
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,915
you could build a car and drive it on the road.

406
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:52,505
Right.

407
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:55,685
-- If you did that today, you're probably going to get
-- a ticket.

408
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:56,655
It's funny because like,

409
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:00,635
you remember when on top gear before it got all kind of weird and grumpy, you know,

410
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,614
where they would have those challenges to build a car and

411
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,915
they built like an electric car and it's just like this,

412
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,194
it's like some children's drawing of what a car is with, you know,

413
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:12,125
-- like the angle steel and like,
-- does it look like the cyber truck a

414
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:12,675
worse,

415
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,555
much worse and it's, like, held together by tape.

416
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:19,579
-- So I've never seen an episode of Top Gear.
-- It's, it used to be good.

417
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:23,540
-- It used to be good, but now it's not.
-- And that's how most things work

418
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,000
again.

419
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,339
You know, the past was better, but we'll put a link to it in the show notes.

420
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:30,640
The reality is, yeah, software. We expect more of software.

421
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,040
Well, as we should though.

422
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,859
I mean, it's like as any product and industry ages and develops,

423
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,579
it changes completely.

424
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,084
And I mean, look even in the context of automobiles,

425
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:44,224
like the skill set you have for cars even,

426
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:48,025
let's say 50 years old is completely different than the skill set you need for cars

427
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,035
today and you think all electric cars are

428
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,704
going to be a completely different skill set.

429
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,814
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with old cars,

430
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,665
but anyone who says we should still build them

431
00:18:55,675 --> 00:19:00,194
like that I think is woefully confused by progress.

432
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,435
Simple economics. Yeah.

433
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:04,765
A modern bumper is anywhere from 1 to $5000

434
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,444
because of all the sensors and stuff going on.

435
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:09,364
That is what like 20 minutes of medical bills

436
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,670
-- when you hit somebody,
-- right?

437
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,130
And, and not only that if you hit someone or even if you get hit in an old car,

438
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,109
-- you are probably going to die. Should
-- we put a link to that where they crash?

439
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,270
Test the old Bel Air and the modern Bel Air? Yeah, we should totally do that.

440
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,310
I don't have words for like,

441
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,040
the intrusion into the passenger compartment of the steering

442
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,910
wheel on the old bel Air is horrifying.

443
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,109
Yeah, they said the driver of the old car would have been killed instantly.

444
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,829
The driver of the new car would have literally walked away from it.

445
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,292
Yeah, I mean, that's, that's bananas.

446
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:40,743
What always gets me is those f one crashes where essentially it's

447
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,883
not a car crash so much as a small plane crash,

448
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:43,223
like the

449
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:43,743
speeds that are

450
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:43,912
involved.

451
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,593
And those guys are literally walking out of those things.

452
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,203
-- Yeah,
-- it's completely nuts. I agree. But again,

453
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:52,272
their primary focus obviously is on safety. Right.

454
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:55,042
They have cars that go fast, but safety is a huge part of that.

455
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:59,182
-- Those drivers are expensive. Well, that
-- too. Right. It's totally worth the cost.

456
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:02,083
Right. No, it's like fighter jets. Fighter jet pilots are insanely

457
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:06,725
-- expensive to train.
-- Heck, aircraft, man, aircraft are a great example too. Right.

458
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:12,316
Old aircraft. They had like six parts, new aircraft are computers fly them.

459
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:12,906
It's,

460
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:17,196
it's not comparable in any way with old aircraft better.

461
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:19,056
It kind of depends how you're going to define it.

462
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,456
But I would say mostly, no, no, it wasn't.

463
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:25,176
They have that Garmin Auto Land thing working now it's an

464
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:28,336
emergency system where you literally press you press a red button

465
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,359
and then the plane lands itself at the nearest

466
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,949
airport safely and tells you what it's doing.

467
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,199
-- Yeah. And
-- remember the old movies where it, can anyone fly an airplane on board?

468
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,760
-- And
-- then Mythbusters and a couple other places tested that

469
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,079
myth and let's just say it always ends poorly.

470
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:41,599
Yeah. Right.

471
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,400
And even with, you know, they took like a single engine pilot, put him in the,

472
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,589
you know, the flight sim and it was like he, he got to the runway.

473
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
No, in fairness,

474
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,260
he got to the runway on approximately the correct glide slope and then no big plane,

475
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,170
not like small plane.

476
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,160
You know what I always laugh at is in, I think it's the movie Madagascar the kid,

477
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,680
the cartoon where the Penguins say any landing

478
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,560
you can walk away from is a good landing

479
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,069
after

480
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,869
they crash the airplane.

481
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,550
-- And it's, yeah, that is completely true. I love it.
-- Yeah.

482
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,560
-- Except in cartoons nobody dies.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

483
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,651
-- I think
-- part of it is just the world changes. Some people roll with that change.

484
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:21,391
Like I've done like I have a rule now that basically says anything.

485
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,832
I know technically that's more than three years old like that.

486
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:28,781
I learned more than three years ago is probably not just wrong but might be harmful

487
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,692
in the sense of like, oh, I should run my own mail, sir. No, Kurt bad.

488
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:33,011
Slap your hand

489
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:33,991
like use

490
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,832
you know, we're using Google and Sendgrid and Mail Gunn and a bunch of other stuff.

491
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:41,572
It's not easy to live like that, you know, to literally, I,

492
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:44,504
at one point I had two bankers boxes full of o'reilly books that

493
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:49,504
I had read and made notes in and highlighted and digested fully,

494
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:50,764
you know, the send mail book.

495
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:54,364
-- Oh, man, that thing was a monster.
-- Yeah, it's useless. Just try and forget it.

496
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,703
Like, make space for, you know, other stuff.

497
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:57,943
And that's hard.

498
00:21:57,953 --> 00:22:00,343
Like it's, it's, you know, it's basically I'm saying, like,

499
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:04,004
everything I learned prior to, well, 40 is, yeah, just forget

500
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,514
it. It's garbage useless.

501
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,673
And you know, what is useful is some of the metal level stuff where I understand,

502
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:09,375
like, if something,

503
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,796
you know, every time like cloud flare breaks, I'm like, oh,

504
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:13,836
I think my site broke and then I'm like, oh CNN also broke.

505
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,836
So it's probably not just me. What's the commonality? Cloud flare?

506
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:19,786
What actually happened? Oh, you know, either cloud flare fell down a bit or?

507
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,776
Oh, it turns out, what was it like that major network provider died and

508
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,395
everybody blamed cloud flare briefly because, you know,

509
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:29,215
they were spitting up airs because like 10% of the internet died.

510
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:30,255
Fundamentally,

511
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,816
you have to grow and you have to change and

512
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:35,416
you have to work really hard at learning new stuff.

513
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:35,576
And

514
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:39,030
to be blunt, for a lot of people, this is a job.

515
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,859
Well, it is, it's not something they love to do.

516
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,020
And I get that because they have hobbies and

517
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,479
family and they'd rather spend time doing that.

518
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,000
And that's fair.

519
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,260
But then you can't complain about the world changing and not keeping up with it.

520
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,540
Yeah, I would agree with that. I think there's nothing wrong with saying it's my job.

521
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,839
I mean, like, I would take an auto mechanic is probably a great example.

522
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:56,270
I bet

523
00:22:56,714 --> 00:23:01,635
any, like, someone who restores old cars, that's passion. But if you work on new cars

524
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,824
it probably pays the bills and you probably like cars. But I bet it's not,

525
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:08,234
it's not going to drive you in the same way.

526
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:08,665
Well,

527
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:11,405
I've met people who are into technology in whatever

528
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:13,214
facet of whatever it is that they do,

529
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,354
like, on the local slack, you know, security slack.

530
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:16,305
We have some people who,

531
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,689
well, a great example.

532
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,650
There's a locksmith who's into tech and, you know, there's,

533
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,030
there's some really cool technologies.

534
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, the lockpicking lawyer is a great example. Right?

535
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,640
Every time he touches those electronic locks, I'm like, yeah,

536
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,790
they're not ready for prime time.

537
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,589
Exactly. Yeah, they're so bad.

538
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,880
But anyway, so, so here's,

539
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,469
here's kind of my thought on this.

540
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:34,989
Right is that we live in a world now where you don't learn

541
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,319
a skill and then use it for the rest of your life.

542
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:40,430
Like, learning is part of our basic skill set,

543
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,329
I think in today's world because it doesn't matter

544
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,599
what job you have everything around you is changing

545
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,550
in dramatic and strange ways.

546
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:50,260
How many people, people are struggling with work from home,

547
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,579
with basic computer literacy skills and they've been

548
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,270
in the white collar workforce for decades.

549
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,439
I know a lot. Right.

550
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:58,290
It's brutal cause like I'm literally hearing stories about these people who

551
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,729
can't get their work laptop onto the internet at home.

552
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,410
And it's kind of like, but you have wi fi at home, like turn it on.

553
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,619
-- That's easy for us to say
-- I've seen these stories now about people who literally

554
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:09,849
this is my favorite.

555
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,000
They emailed the person who's still in the office saying,

556
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,280
can you please print this out,

557
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,920
this document that was sent to me by email? Can you print it out?

558
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,930
-- Scan it and email it back to me?
-- What? I don't doubt this but

559
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,089
-- ok.
-- Right.

560
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,770
Because well, they can't like it's, it's the they want it in the PDF format,

561
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,979
not the other weird format that came in or something.

562
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:31,969
And that's fair and that kind of stuff I can sort of forgive because like getting,

563
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,489
getting say a one document format into

564
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,209
PDF can be difficult on windows specifically.

565
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:39,012
Yeah, on a Mac

566
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:42,103
-- Easy on Windows. No, not easy.
-- Right. And Exactly.

567
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,863
And like on Linux, we've been doing this for decades. So no one cares.

568
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:47,262
But the point is, and I think you're exactly right.

569
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,093
And I think this is where something like people

570
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:52,873
keep saying how like a pandemic is basically speeding

571
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:56,463
up change where things that might have taken 10 years are now going to take one year.

572
00:24:56,493 --> 00:25:00,152
You can no longer hide certain inefficiencies and problems.

573
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:01,353
Whereas before, you know,

574
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:04,743
you could just eat that cost or hide it or you could have really inefficient,

575
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,652
you know, people who have a meeting and then, like, 20 minutes later for

576
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,436
what they discussed. Right. I worked remote.

577
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:12,206
I've worked remotely for 22 years and I remember being on a call

578
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,436
where my boss was like, Kurt, you know,

579
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,196
are you doing this with the rest of the team?

580
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,365
And I'm like, what, now, what are you talking about?

581
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,316
He's like, he's like, basically, like, damn it, Kurt, like,

582
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,836
it's like every email I send, you know, to you, you're ignoring.

583
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:24,975
I'm like, I read all the emails you send me, you're my boss.

584
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:25,436
Like I,

585
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:29,255
I read them and I internalize them and I like to the best of my ability do what I can.

586
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:32,076
He's like, no, Kurt. It's like you don't read any email on the at home list.

587
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:33,115
And I'm like the what list?

588
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,776
And I hear the silence for like five seconds.

589
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:36,895
He's like, can somebody check if Kurt's on the at home list?

590
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,410
It turns out I wasn't on the main list that

591
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,630
they were using to communicate policy changes and stuff to all

592
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,060
as workers.

593
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,859
And, and that's the moment I realized where I, I started telling people I'm like,

594
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,880
unless you explicitly tell me in an email, I don't know it.

595
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,760
Right, because I'm not there. I'm not at the water cooler.

596
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,839
I'm not hearing those phone calls and maybe I am.

597
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,069
But for the purposes of safety and brevity,

598
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,640
if it's not in an email that's been sent to me, it doesn't exist in my world.

599
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,300
And I've lived by that rule now for two,

600
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,395
like, almost 20 years and it works.

601
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:06,724
But there's a lot of people though,

602
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,805
having to learn that rule now because they've not worked

603
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,964
-- from home before
-- because when you're in an office it,

604
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:13,665
the dynamic is definitely different.

605
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,525
Bob. What about? Oh, ok. Thanks.

606
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:19,125
Right. Yeah, you just pick your head up over the cubicle and, and yell. Exactly.

607
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:22,625
Exactly. It's, it's completely different here is how I will end this.

608
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:25,005
This will be my closing thought is

609
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:28,704
if you are complaining about the state of the industry you are in,

610
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:33,204
it is almost a certainty that you are the problem and not your industry.

611
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:33,949
Yep.

612
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,930
-- 100% agree. That's
-- it.

613
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,849
That's what I'm going to say if,

614
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,449
like, at me, if you want. But that's, that's my standing.

615
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:44,010
And the funny thing is if you want to do old stuff,

616
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,410
there are absolutely jobs out there restoring classic cars or what was it?

617
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,630
New Jersey was like, we need coal

618
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,599
programmers, like by Thursday or

619
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,060
else

620
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,790
we can't, I forget what, like their unemployment system was going to fall over or?

621
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,295
Oh, carpentry is a great example.

622
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:00,285
Like, there's carpenters who specialize in restoring old stuff,

623
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,655
using the old techniques.

624
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,935
-- Yeah.
-- I'm familiar with this problem.

625
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,935
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah, because you own that historical house.
-- I own a 100 year old house.

626
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:10,854
And actually, so funny enough you say that is

627
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:14,655
so I enjoy fine woodworking. It's a hobby of mine.

628
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,614
I wouldn't say I'm a professional or by any means. But I do. Ok.

629
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,609
And there are certain things in my house,

630
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:23,699
I won't hire someone to do because I'm concerned

631
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,260
-- they won't do the job the way I want it done
-- every year.

632
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,180
I like going to the cabin show locally because there's about two

633
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:33,689
or three German carpenters at the cabin show and they're awesome.

634
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,579
And I mean, and again, like they are proper German carpenters wearing the clock,

635
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
you know, the uniform

636
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,093
they do is

637
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,113
unbelievable.

638
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,133
Like you look at, like,

639
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:45,973
the pictures of the modern place versus the pictures of the place these guys,

640
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:47,172
what these guys build.

641
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,012
Yeah. Like they're going to build you something that

642
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:51,052
it'll be there 500 years later.

643
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:52,892
-- Well, to a degree now. No, no,
-- no.

644
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:55,253
Like I've, I've lived in Germany, I've lived, like,

645
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:57,772
I lived in a town where they were renovating a house

646
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,942
that was over 500 years old.

647
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,686
No, I'm going to stop you because you're,

648
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:06,076
-- you're claiming the past is better and in some ways it was, well,
-- yeah.

649
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,556
But you don't have plumbing or electrical wiring and

650
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,215
that can make a difference.

651
00:28:10,225 --> 00:28:11,875
But I'm going to tell, you know, anyone who says, oh,

652
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:13,605
they sure don't build them like they used to.

653
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:18,645
I live in the way they used to and I assure you there's plenty of jank, like,

654
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:20,456
it's not perfect

655
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,206
and when it goes wrong it goes really wrong.

656
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,020
It's tradeoffs. Right.

657
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,079
Yeah. You know, we, we now have climate control in houses that, you know, don't

658
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:33,209
-- cost $5000 a month to heat in winter
-- in a cold winter.

659
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:37,530
I will pay $600 a month to heat my home.

660
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,079
Yes.

661
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:40,079
Yeah.

662
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
See, that's why you got to get more squirrels living in your wall.

663
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:42,920
That's

664
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,530
right. I need them to bring more nuts into the attic to insulate it all.

665
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:46,780
I

666
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:46,920
was

667
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:47,380
just

668
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:47,839
heat.

669
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,229
Squirrel heat. No.

670
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:52,469
You know, actually in all seriousness, I had squirrels at one point and I had,

671
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,369
I called an exterminator to help get rid of them.

672
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,150
And he said, uh,

673
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,910
squirrel pee is the problem with squirrels

674
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,619
in your house because they pee everywhere,

675
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,060
I guess

676
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,489
whatever.

677
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:02,920
Anyway. Alright.

678
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,030
I'm calling it. This was, this was I feel better.

679
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,900
I feel better after complaining about other people complaining that

680
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,599
it's very matter.

681
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,079
Anyway. Thank you everyone for listening.
