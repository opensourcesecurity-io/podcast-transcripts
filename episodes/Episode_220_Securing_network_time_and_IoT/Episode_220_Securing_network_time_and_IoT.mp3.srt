Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,720
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,319
-- Josh Resor. So,
-- what's new and exciting?

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,020
-- Well,
-- what time is it Josh

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,579
Showtime or

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,129
do you? Well, it's, if you're using good old

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,280
-- NTP, it's whatever time I say it is
-- maybe, I mean, not exactly

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,340
NTP can only have a skew of a certain amount before the results get thrown away.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,510
That's assuming an attacker doesn't, you know, maliciously intercept it and,

9
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:32,729
and manipulate it.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,439
We fixed that we now have NTS network time security for NTP.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,810
-- It's finally became an RFC last week.
-- Was it last

12
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:40,259
week,

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,310
two weeks ago?

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,669
-- Well, where
-- it was officially approved, but this has been in the works for

15
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:47,389
as long as I can remember at this point,

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,450
-- it's
-- literally
-- been something I remember looking for this in 2000 where I was like,

17
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:52,770
oh, I want to get time and TV.

18
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:55,130
Sure. Cool. But I want to make sure it's like

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,560
secure because this is going over the, like,

20
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,939
it basically has to go over the internet because I'm not buying

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,279
a PS time unit to sit in my server rack because they're expensive.

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,639
They're really cheap now though.

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,870
-- Well, yeah, but not in 2000, back in 2000 they were not really cheap.
-- That is true.

24
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:12,580
Also having to run an aerial to outside the building.

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,400
-- Yeah,
-- you probably need that in a lot of cases.

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,610
Generally speaking, server farms are not conducive to, you know,

27
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,790
receiving low level GPS signals.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
-- I bet
-- you could use the cell phone network these days.

29
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:24,839
You know what?

30
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,199
I used to think that too, until I noticed both

31
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,050
cell phones were like two minutes off,

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,089
they were on different networks. Seriously. That's embarrassing.

33
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,400
This is back in the day, right?

34
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:37,040
That could be. But anyways point is also, you know, NTP UDP, it's over the internet.

35
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,019
It's easy to spoof it's a anyways

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,129
we finally 20 years later have network time

37
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,989
security with a bit of hashing and signing.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,739
-- Hallelujah. It finally happened. Is it
-- Hallelujah?

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,169
I mean,

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,169
I feel like this is one of those movie

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,889
threat plots that probably isn't real smart contracts.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,169
Ok. In that context,

43
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:54,279
I

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,019
-- with it,
-- a big problem in Blockchain is where do you get a time signal?

45
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,870
And well, the answer, of course you go

46
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:01,300
NTP.

47
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:05,080
But the problem is you have a whole pile of malicious actors potentially because,

48
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,779
well, literally smart contracts are money.

49
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,800
No, you shouldn't be using

50
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,020
NTP. There are signed time sources you can use on the internet that can't be spoofed.

51
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:16,339
-- Yeah. How do I put this
-- nicely? You don't have to

52
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,970
be nice.

53
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,740
Have you seen what smart contract authors are doing? It needs to be the default.

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,570
It needs to be

55
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:25,139
simple. It's a great example, members, certificate, host name checks.

56
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,440
Like how many languages didn't do it by default,

57
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,979
like Python and how many developers got it wrong.

58
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,860
A lot of people still screw it up. Yeah.

59
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,919
And that's with it enabled by default.

60
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:39,179
-- I think the only reason people are turning it on now is because of let's
-- encrypt.

61
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,419
Well, it's more that it's as a client side thing.

62
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:44,815
-- It's because it's becoming the default
-- because of let's encrypt.

63
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:45,425
Yeah.

64
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:46,395
I mean,

65
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:51,054
if you look at host name check, there's literally 500 change CVS,

66
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,054
I'm sure there's, there's tons of problems like this.

67
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:58,195
-- What
-- Jenkins codefresh integration plug in 1.8 and earlier disables SS LT

68
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:01,384
LS and host name verification globally for the Jenkins master JVM.

69
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:04,835
-- That does not surprise me at all.
-- That's from last year. Like what

70
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,210
I, I just got one for a third party library.

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,100
I found the other day it's actually got a 2016 CD ID because

72
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,559
someone opened the issue in this project's github in 2016 pointing this out.

73
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,020
And then I was like, hold on. This should get a CV E ID.

74
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:24,070
So people start caring because it came up due to some other discussions.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,169
But I'm like, this is bananas here.

76
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,369
Well, the fact is, you know,

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,990
by now we should know that if you're going to do

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,809
SSL or TLS and nowadays you should not be doing SSL.

79
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,845
-- It's broken use that
-- just don't even say the word SSL. SSL is dead.

80
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:41,166
-- Stop SSL is dead TLS. Yeah, the
-- problem is, there's a perfect example.

81
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:41,936
I'm just reading Adam

82
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:44,065
Schott's Threat modeling book from 2000. And

83
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:47,496
was it 14 or 16? And it only mentions SSL.

84
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,796
Well, yeah, because he wrote it 150 years ago,

85
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:54,606
-- six years ago. It's
-- older than that. Are you sure? Which? No, it's

86
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:55,126
a reprint.

87
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:59,095
-- This is the
-- print date. Ok. It could be a reprint, but he obviously didn't update it.

88
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:05,061
And now at the same time I know a lot of people who say SSL and they mean TLS.

89
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:06,111
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

90
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,962
And the whole point of that is, was what wasn't a trademark thing or something.

91
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,481
It was some stupid trademark thing.

92
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:13,611
And in my brain when I hear anyone say SSL,

93
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:17,201
now I just automatically turn it into TLS and assume

94
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:20,291
nobody is running SSL three because if you are,

95
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,881
you're just inexcusably stupid at this point.

96
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:26,881
Well, or you've got old stuff that you're stuck with and no inexcusably stupid.

97
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,402
Well, and I was about to say, and you've got far bigger problems.

98
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,630
But yeah, so, I mean, let me ask you a question.

99
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,670
Is there any reason network traffic should

100
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:38,369
not at a minimum be signed and authenticated

101
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,790
-- and more ideally be encrypted by default now, I
-- think there is no good reason

102
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:50,859
that all traffic shouldn't be encrypted. And I think the zero trust model is why

103
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,109
there is a good reason,

104
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,109
things like NTP and DNS that have to

105
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,394
super fast and ideally lightweight

106
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,674
and do have a lot of valid scenarios where

107
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,375
I care more about the integrity and availability than

108
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,274
I do about the confidentiality of this data.

109
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,635
I don't care that people know I'm looking at cnn.com.

110
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:09,704
I am fine with that being public. I just want it to work reliably.

111
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,559
Now, granted there are other, you know,

112
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,910
DNS systems that people are looking up where

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,799
they would care about the confidentiality of it.

114
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,769
Look DNS over HTTPS,

115
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,399
-- solves
-- that DNS over HTTP also solves a whole pile of performance problems and,

116
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,920
and I've come to the conclusion that

117
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:32,040
solving security is nice but it should never be the reason for doing something.

118
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,470
It should be,

119
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,700
it should be a hopefully a good side effect of doing something.

120
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,140
So for example, DNS or HTTP gives us a bunch more privacy

121
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,220
which yes, is a form of security, but

122
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,739
it's privacy I believe is actually something that is

123
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,170
very tangible and important DNS over H TV.

124
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,950
Also gives us a whole pile of performance improvements, you know,

125
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,579
for certain websites,

126
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,820
but do very much matter.

127
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:59,260
And the fact that it, you know, solves a whole pile of DNS related security issues is,

128
00:05:59,269 --> 00:05:59,899
is great.

129
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,670
Plus while DNS we have a ton

130
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:05,130
of providers actively intercepting and modifying responses

131
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,760
to send you to a servers in case you get like an nex domain,

132
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:07,929
like

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,113
does exist query or whatever. Right.

134
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:14,002
I think the reality is with NTP, we want NTP to be lightweight.

135
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:19,562
-- It has to be fast, fast matters.
-- It has to be fast and have low jitter. Right.

136
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:22,622
It can't have like different latencies in the responses because, well,

137
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,622
then you're not getting an accurate time signal.

138
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:28,002
And in general it's hard to mask.

139
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,342
Like, if you encrypt NTP,

140
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,192
it wouldn't really matter because I still know

141
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,203
fundamentally you're talking to an NTP server,

142
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:33,912
right?

143
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:36,062
And, and that could be a legitimate security problem for,

144
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:39,265
all right. Maybe you have a job that kicks off once in a while to talk to NTP

145
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:42,045
and that gives the attacker some piece of information about your server.

146
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,466
But at this point we're talking about like movie plot threats, you know,

147
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,075
where they're hacking the Gibson.

148
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:50,006
-- But ntps doesn't solve that problem.
-- No, it doesn't.

149
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,885
And I'm saying it doesn't need to because it's,

150
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,705
that's a problem that's essentially so difficult to solve that.

151
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:55,865
You just can't.

152
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:57,485
And if you really do want to, like,

153
00:06:57,496 --> 00:07:01,865
anonymously somehow or secretly get a secure time signal,

154
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,895
you know, go and buy a GPS time receiver.

155
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,130
Yeah, exactly. 100%. So this is interesting.

156
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,100
I mean, kind of on a related note is so there's obviously the CIA Triad, right,

157
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:17,489
where you've got confidentiality, integrity and availability.

158
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,609
And in the case of

159
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,019
a service like NTP or classic DNS confidentiality

160
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,959
is non existent in that

161
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,250
in that instance, right? You need integrity.

162
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,820
Obviously you want to get good results

163
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,149
and you need availability but confidentiality,

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,410
throw that one out the window.

165
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,649
-- Well,
-- you can have confidentiality by VPN

166
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,410
it. Well, now more to the point, it's

167
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,959
-- generally not worth it, especially for something like time. Is
-- it though?

168
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,190
I mean, we, we,

169
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,649
we didn't design it that way from the start and

170
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,790
I can't think of a reason it should matter.

171
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:53,119
But is that because I've just been brainwashed by

172
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,109
the world into thinking no one should care.

173
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,350
I could see an attacker, for example,

174
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,279
determining what operating systems you have behind a firewall based on their NTP

175
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,130
time signature traffic,

176
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,709
you know, pack of time to live, stuff like that.

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,640
Sure, maybe so there could be information.

178
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,190
But again, I mean, we're talking movie threat level

179
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,769
of plots, you know, whereas most Attackers are like,

180
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,470
go take this exploit that's been around for three months and like go use that,

181
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,369
you know, one thing that occurs to me at this point which is,

182
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,000
it's comically overdue is so what is NTPS?

183
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,390
-- What does that mean? What does
-- it

184
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:25,570
do?

185
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,790
NTP is network time protocol and very simply put your

186
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,230
system and a server ping pong packets back and forth to

187
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,789
figure out how far the network is away in milliseconds

188
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,690
and then the time server sends you a packet saying,

189
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,119
you know, the time is now 417 at the beep, beep and your server goes cool.

190
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,789
It's now 417. And generally speaking, without trying too hard,

191
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,450
you can get your server clock. So, within a few milliseconds

192
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,530
of whatever the correct time is, it's,

193
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:56,400
-- it works really shockingly well and has been working for over 20 years and
-- 20 years.

194
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:00,479
Way more than that. INTP is 30 or 40 years, at least.

195
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:05,559
Well, I remember when Nist ran a dial in modem service to get a time signal,

196
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,570
like they had a public

197
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,669
uh public number where you dialed in at like 2400 bod

198
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,559
and got your time signal. That's pretty awesome, man.

199
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,039
Well, again, networks weren't as reliable or, you know,

200
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:19,320
latency wasn't as guaranteed like there was a lot more P jitter,

201
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,599
things like that anyways and NTP S simply put is just the time signal is signed,

202
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:28,979
which gives us what, which means I can't easily spoof the time,

203
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,375
not easily. Don't weasel this one?

204
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:31,635
Oh

205
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:35,414
-- UDP is trivial to spoof in certain situations.
-- Hang on.

206
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:38,755
Let's talk about NTP attacks first and then we'll kind of explain that.

207
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,414
So the thinking is yes,

208
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,674
P can be spoofed cause you could just like

209
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,465
crap

210
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,854
P packets onto the internet and they go where you told them to go,

211
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:48,744
which obviously you can't do a TCP.

212
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,284
Well, we'll

213
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:49,804
ask

214
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,695
anymore. I'm not going to let you do this

215
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,169
you can't do it with TCP. We'll see.

216
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,429
Well,

217
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,369
the thing with NDP is you can generally predict

218
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,090
when the system will want to get its time

219
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,640
and you could just spoof, you could blindly spoof time packets to a system.

220
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,549
Well, it's even,

221
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,219
it's even kind of more complicated than that

222
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,989
because let's say I spoofed the packets.

223
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,609
The

224
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,059
NTP demons are smart enough to be like, whoa, the time isn't 12 hours off,

225
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,520
Something's going on here.

226
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:13,770
Yeah.

227
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,020
Yeah,

228
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,770
I used to have that problem constantly where the time was too far out of sync where

229
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:20,340
NTP would basically, like, be like, no, I'm not going to fix this.

230
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,380
It's broken and I'd manually run

231
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,580
-- NTP date, get it within a few seconds and then,
-- yeah, exactly.

232
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,729
-- Start the NTP
-- servers.

233
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,330
So anyway, the idea is if you're trying to attack

234
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:30,890
NTP,

235
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,849
you would have,

236
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,109
it's like the long con where you'd actually have to

237
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,880
run the attack probably over the course of several weeks

238
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,520
to actually change the clock on the machine you're dealing with, which is, again,

239
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,130
we're talking about movies.

240
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,570
-- There
-- were some more subtle attacks where,

241
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,770
especially from a denial of service point of view.

242
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,869
If you could get a KOR

243
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:49,929
server

244
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,450
-- to be off by two or three minutes, bam, nobody can log
-- in.

245
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,849
-- It's usually like five or 10 or whatever.
-- But

246
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,619
you know what I'm saying?

247
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,900
Like,

248
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:01,059
-- and
-- then Kurt a two minute skew is going to take you probably days

249
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,070
or weeks cause most of these servers only check in once a day.

250
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,190
I forget what the algorithms do but all the clients are different.

251
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,900
They are. I understand that.

252
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,299
But I'm saying practically speaking because obviously you

253
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,309
don't want to overwhelm the NTP network.

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,030
-- So you're not checking in constantly.
-- Like that time.

255
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,070
-- Lysis bombed that university. Yeah,
-- that was great.

256
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,929
I'll put a link in the show

257
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,820
notes to that story. I know we talked about it before. It's hilarious.

258
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,739
There's a reason we use like DNS redirect to handle NTP servers.

259
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,539
So it's hard code in this NTP server.

260
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,070
And then

261
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,130
they couldn't undo it because it break all the routers.

262
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,650
It's not that they couldn't undo it. It's that

263
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,479
Lysis wasn't willing to fix it

264
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:45,224
-- anyway.
-- Well, I think they also just sent a bucket of money to the school.

265
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:47,135
It was like, please keep it up

266
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,775
anyway. So.

267
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:49,395
Right.

268
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:53,614
So there is the theoretical possibility to send forged NTP

269
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,854
packets over UDP to anyone in the world you want.

270
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,775
So the idea is let's sign them

271
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,039
and then you can't spoof this stuff. But now here's kind of why it has taken so long.

272
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:07,419
And this is,

273
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,859
I think the most interesting part is when you're dealing with something like

274
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,940
-- NTP, milliseconds matter less
-- than milliseconds

275
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,469
matter. Well, OK. Right.

276
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:20,159
But the point is like signing and verifying signatures takes

277
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,059
milliseconds to do.

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,609
So, now you're talking about, well, how do you decide what the time

279
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,909
-- actually is.
-- Here's a, here's the trick though.

280
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,760
That wouldn't matter if, for example,

281
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,460
the application could know exactly when that packet came in off the network.

282
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:36,359
And then, oh, ok.

283
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,140
That packet came in off the network at time X

284
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,000
and then I spent like a minute processing it.

285
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,559
Cool. The time at the beep when the packet came in was this time. Right.

286
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,580
-- And I can just figure it out. But the problem is that's really hard to do.
-- Yeah, it is.

287
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,239
And you most of these encryption app, well, OK, I shouldn't say this in the past

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,609
signature and verification operations were nondeterministic.

289
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:01,010
Meaning you didn't know how long it would take these days.

290
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,479
A lot of this stuff is happening in silicon.

291
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,640
So I think it is easier to understand.

292
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,830
OK, this operation is probably going to take this long.

293
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,059
It's not a guarantee,

294
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,320
but I think it's far more predictable now than it ever was in the past.

295
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,630
And here's something wild. So I just wanted

296
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:19,382
this is from a cloud flare blog entry two years

297
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:21,291
ago during the period in which error reports were,

298
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:25,531
they're collecting error reports for time on systems during

299
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,312
the period in which error reports were collected.

300
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:30,831
6.7 of client reported times were behind by more than 24 hours.

301
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,831
0.05% were ahead by more than 24 hours.

302
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:38,632
This sku is a causal factor for at least 33.5% of the sampled reports from win users.

303
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:40,791
8.71% from Mac Os, eight

304
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,364
46 from Android 1.72 from Chromo S.

305
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:46,934
These errors are usually presented to users as warnings that the users can click.

306
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:48,854
Basically, they're talking about certificate time

307
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,434
related issues, right? Where

308
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,924
if you're, you know that, well,

309
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,013
the certificate is now expired because the clock on your system is so wonky,

310
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:55,833
it's a problem.

311
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:56,674
But yeah, it was,

312
00:13:56,684 --> 00:14:02,633
I was shocked at how wrong these systems were by and large because like,

313
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,953
my understanding was that, is that pretty much every

314
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:09,935
operating system in the last, I don't know, 10 or 20 years has like an NTP client.

315
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:11,955
I would agree with that.

316
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:18,176
Although if so an easy example is if, if your machine is off by a year,

317
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,195
NTP is never going to fix that because it's going to be like, I'm under attack.

318
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:23,716
-- I don't know what's going on.
-- True.

319
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:26,575
But in general then nothing on the web is going to work anymore.

320
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:29,085
Nothing will work at all. That happened to me.

321
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
I forget what somehow

322
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,719
the clock on my computer was off by like, 12 hours. And I don't remember exactly.

323
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:36,700
I think it was

324
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,710
a Linux kept turning the clock to UTC and the system

325
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,299
and windows expected local time zone or something like that.

326
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,020
And anyway,

327
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,260
they kept fighting with each other and at one point I remember it had gotten so bad.

328
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,140
I was unable to literally do anything on the machine. And it was, it drove me insane.

329
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,739
It was so, it was so annoying.

330
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,419
And the thing is though, I knew I knew it was wrong right away

331
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,119
where it's yelling about certificate times and signatures and stuff.

332
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,570
And I'm like, oh, the clock is wrong.

333
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,979
A normal person would probably freak out if they,

334
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,469
no, they would just start ignoring the errors and click through them.

335
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,830
-- You can't click through them anymore though. Well, not
-- anymore. But

336
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:17,969
-- ok. So anyway, anyway, we have signed time.
-- Yeah, we have signed time. It's, it's

337
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:20,255
not only do we have signed time, but Crony and NTPC

338
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:24,815
both support it. And Crony is, I think pretty much across most Linux distributions.

339
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:31,184
-- The default.
-- Now I want to specify, Crony is C hr Ony like chronograph,

340
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:36,984
sorry, not, not Crony Cronie, which is like all of the politicians now.

341
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:38,174
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

342
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,710
So, yeah, I mean,

343
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:44,909
hopefully we'll see because the other thing is time often matters quite a bit for IO

344
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,340
-- devices.
-- Does it?

345
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:48,770
-- Well,
-- if you want things to happen at the right time

346
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,049
-- in sync,
-- look my lights on my house. I have actually, they're on my garage.

347
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,400
I have the lights outside,

348
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,719
set up to turn on at dusk and turn off in the morning

349
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,409
because I have literally no lighting in the back of the house.

350
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,960
And so this is kind of my

351
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,909
yay everyone,

352
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,966
there's some light here that clock could be off by 30 minutes and I wouldn't care.

353
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:09,067
Right.

354
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,226
But what if you start, you know,

355
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,396
actually tying stuff together and having sequences like first this,

356
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,677
then that maybe having an, well, let me put it this way.

357
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,916
What are people like, who are

358
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:22,187
a few minutes off? They're annoying as hell. Let's be real.

359
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:24,687
All of us have a person we know

360
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:28,627
who runs like, half an hour or 20 minutes or even 10 minutes late.

361
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,893
And it's just incredibly annoying if you are a punctual person.

362
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,554
-- Right.
-- And I try to be very punctual.

363
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,614
You do you, because I could, I could list some instances. We'll see.

364
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,533
-- I'm not saying
-- I'm perfect, but I try and I care.

365
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:42,814
So, here's the thing though, Kurt,

366
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:46,133
we're not talking about 10 minutes or two minutes or one minute.

367
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:48,953
We're going to be talking about probably 10 seconds or less.

368
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:52,934
-- Generally speaking does 10 seconds matter in io
-- from the looks of it,

369
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,593
the systems that fail are not going to fail by five or 10 seconds.

370
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:59,161
They're not get a time signal at all or it's just going to be completely messed up.

371
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,901
And that's probably fair.

372
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:04,839
And, but at the same time, how is signing time going to solve that problem?

373
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,099
Well, signing time doesn't explicitly solve that problem,

374
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,020
but it in general makes it easier to get an accurate,

375
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,480
-- known, accurate time signal out to things.
-- I mean,

376
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:17,441
sure, that's probably fair. And at the same time how many of this IO

377
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,000
gear is going to

378
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,560
verify, signed time stamps?

379
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,329
-- Uh Well, if it's the default in the DEV kit, they will.
-- That's true. That's true.

380
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,260
Like that, that,

381
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,959
that's literally where you're going to get all your

382
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,560
IOT security is whatever the default Dev kit does

383
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,300
-- in
-- 35 years.

384
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,410
Singapore has an interesting,

385
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,489
has an interesting thing that they just

386
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,890
released essentially a security label for IOT stuff

387
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,400
and they have like three classes of essentially security and class one is like,

388
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,150
this thing is not a

389
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,496
flaming train wreck all the way to class three,

390
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:51,737
which is like this thing is like securely designed.

391
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:53,256
I saw that

392
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,587
honestly, if statistically

393
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,136
class 12 and three won't really be much different,

394
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:01,516
there will be like absolute piles of fire in,

395
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,646
in class one.

396
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:03,697
But in general,

397
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,656
people who try to spend a lot of time and money

398
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,177
designing secure software usually don't do that great of a job,

399
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,136
especially when they're on a time constraint and

400
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:12,097
a budget constraint like IOT stuff is,

401
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:12,366
well,

402
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:15,063
we just talked to Larry who told the story about how he

403
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,793
screwed up his web server or even he wrote a web server,

404
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,004
which is a dubious,

405
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,443
you know, thing to do to begin with.

406
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,784
But the point is so actually,

407
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:25,984
I want to talk about this for a minute because I actually

408
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,624
forgot about this story and I'm glad you brought it up.

409
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:33,364
So here is my take on this and this is a signal. I think people give.

410
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,904
So you've got these classifications,

411
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,683
Singapore's trying to do and I give them tons of credit

412
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,551
and now I'm going to start out with just saying,

413
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:39,541
yes, we're going to screw it up.

414
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,770
Yes. It's going to be a train wreck.

415
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:44,230
But that's ok because this is how we learn, we learn by making mistakes.

416
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,730
They're going to make tons of them. Good job. Singapore.

417
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,171
-- Well, the thing is once you have a framework, you can start to fix it.
-- That's right.

418
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:53,340
Exactly. Exactly. And you never start, you can't start it. Perfect.

419
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,090
You have to start it terrible and work your way towards. Perfect.

420
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,360
Which is an unattainable goal, but you can never start it. Perfect.

421
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,961
I want to know how well, if at all will this device function

422
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,680
when a there is no network or a degraded network and b when the

423
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,589
mothership servers and the company servers or whatever don't work or go away.

424
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,880
I don't know if they're tracking that though.

425
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,500
-- No,
-- no. But I'm saying like as a, as a, as a nutritional label type thing,

426
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,540
for example,

427
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,689
there are light like, oh, perfect example, security cameras,

428
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,089
I looked into a bunch of security cameras.

429
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,140
I ended up going with Ring.

430
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,689
Yes, I have to pay a subscription fee. Yes.

431
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,859
If Ring goes away, my cameras are basically garbage,

432
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,670
I could have gone with something like ubiquity.

433
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,859
-- They're more expensive cameras. Yeah.
-- If you can find one.

434
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:34,589
Well,

435
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,780
they're sold out.

436
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:36,119
Yeah.

437
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,199
-- But
-- anyways ubiquity cameras, for example,

438
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,619
can log to local storage and like the company ubiquity could

439
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,810
basically go away tomorrow and my stuff would have still worked.

440
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,930
But due to cost availability and a couple of other factors,

441
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:52,206
I went with the simple ring stuff made this as a knowing informed decision.

442
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,046
This is for example,

443
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:58,375
why I will not go with nest cameras because Google has this habit of killing stuff

444
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,656
they just kill. Was it Google music?

445
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,975
And my favorite or Google Play or whatever it's called?

446
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,895
And my favorite is all these people that bought lifetime subscriptions

447
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:08,595
and were told basically transfer all your crap to youtube.

448
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:09,406
Good luck with that.

449
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,566
And then from what I can tell outside of the US that's not supported.

450
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,391
So I would like to see things like that as part of

451
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:19,631
-- this whole security label thing because that's availability
-- and that's fair.

452
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:22,391
I don't think they will. But here's, here's the point though, right?

453
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,751
I don't think the details matter at this point.

454
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,952
I think the fact is if you are a company making

455
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:32,942
stuff and you're willing to participate in this program at all,

456
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:38,151
I think that while it doesn't say that you are or aren't secure in any useful manner,

457
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:39,432
I think it says

458
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:46,618
you are willing to learn and that's huge because there are so many companies and so

459
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,578
many organizations and so many projects I've dealt

460
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,618
with that are just like f you nerd,

461
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:53,527
get out of here with your stupid security.

462
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:54,248
And it's like,

463
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,498
all right.

464
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,777
And now I will say also back when I was younger

465
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:00,897
and maybe had a little more fire in my belly,

466
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,417
which is just a nice way of saying I was a massive a hole, but

467
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,843
I had my fire in my belly.

468
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:09,004
I would, I would go to, I'd go toe to toe with some of these people and,

469
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,644
and try to explain to them why they were wrong.

470
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:12,854
Of course, I never did.

471
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,563
But now that I'm a little older, I understand like

472
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,144
there's some people, no,

473
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:20,163
if they don't want to work with you don't waste your resources on them.

474
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,124
Find people who want to work with you and work with them.

475
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:26,004
And that's where I think a program like this is huge because

476
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:29,443
it is self selecting the people who actually want to work with

477
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,900
security folks and do the right thing.

478
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:36,510
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-- And I, as a consumer then can make a much more informed choice

479
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,949
-- like these are signals.
-- Yeah. Right. Your security might suck.

480
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:44,349
But I know you care and you're going to get better versus someone who's like,

481
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,380
screw you nerd.

482
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,260
-- Get out of here.
-- Well, I mean, uh

483
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:47,939
yeah,

484
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,790
where to even begin with these companies.

485
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,910
Like my whole printer buying experience where it's

486
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,510
like now I realize basically I have to,

487
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,750
I have to be very gentle to my toner cartridge.

488
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,349
So that I can save the chip in it so that I can buy the chip less toner cartridges

489
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,750
and rip the chip, like,

490
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,300
physically rip the chip out of my toner cartridge once

491
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,270
it's empty and put it into the new chip,

492
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,229
less toner cartridge.

493
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,989
Because the chip less toner cartridges cost about one third of what the chipped,

494
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:14,839
-- proper HP ones cost. So
-- I can't speak for HP.

495
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,510
I have a cannon printer and I bought the cheap toner

496
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,000
and it didn't last very long at all.

497
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,150
And the quality was garbage and I ended up actually taking it all out,

498
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,479
throwing it away and just paying the stupid cannon tax and it's flawless now.

499
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,609
So I did a bunch of research and yes,

500
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:35,050
there is bad toner that's cheap and there's also ok, toner that's cheap.

501
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,660
And that could be,

502
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,930
I obviously didn't do enough research and I bought garbage toner and

503
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:40,689
my,

504
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,599
I atoned for my sins by buying the real stuff and

505
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:46,489
paying more for the toner than I paid for the printer.

506
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,469
Yeah, that sounds about right.

507
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:52,849
Which is, it's going to last me probably five or 10 years so I can live with it. But

508
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,145
no, I just, I'm sad that I needed a new printer because my old printer, the, the,

509
00:22:56,155 --> 00:23:00,364
the processor and it was so slow as it started choking on fillable PDF S,

510
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:05,385
it would just spit out the, uh, exclamation mark error and stare at me.

511
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,344
That's pretty awesome.

512
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:09,724
Well, it's got a 366 megahertz processor in it and, like,

513
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:11,675
all the modern stuff is multicore gigahertz.

514
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:14,265
-- Yeah,
-- because like a freaking raspberry pi cost

515
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:15,704
five bucks.

516
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:22,349
-- Well, but, I mean, should not a printer last 10 or 20 years.
-- It should. I, mine will.

517
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,510
I think that I have now, I've got,

518
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,530
it's probably three or four years old and it's still doing great.

519
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,060
-- But,
-- and again,

520
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,800
like this iot stuff like I just replaced all my s my old IOT light bulbs with newer,

521
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,130
but generally they, they do better color, temperature, different colors,

522
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,729
their Wi Fi so they don't need their own base station.

523
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,250
And so that's a good example of something where it's like, ok, I've removed,

524
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,209
you know, like a failure scenario from the chain of,

525
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:48,969
whereas my old light bulbs required a 700 megahertz space station.

526
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,089
But, you know, if it dies, well, all my stuff's dead.

527
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,369
Right. Whereas I can always buy new Wi Fi gear.

528
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,650
You know,

529
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,030
I go back and forth on this a lot because I have Phillips hue light bulbs right now,

530
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,609
which are very nice and

531
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:09,650
the Phillips software seems pretty secure as far as I can tell it doesn't use. I know

532
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,219
-- people laughing. It's ok. You can laugh at me. No, it's
-- just, it's all crap.

533
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:16,920
-- Like I, of course,
-- this is how I sleep at night. I lie to myself so I can sleep

534
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,032
at night cart. It's fine.

535
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:21,333
-- I just stopped
-- caring. That's fair. That's one way to do it too.

536
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,072
So, what I did,

537
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,892
I only buy my it stuff if I can now at Costco because they've won your money back.

538
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:29,353
That's true. They do. They do. But the point is I go back and forth thinking.

539
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:36,593
Do I want like 1000 Wi Fi devices on my network or do I want a Phillips Hugh Bridge?

540
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:39,432
That then is doing some sort of like back channel.

541
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,072
-- Who cares
-- if you have 1000 devices on your Wi Fi? I don't know.

542
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:42,772
Do I?

543
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,552
Well, if you have a crappy single

544
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:46,956
Wi Fi router? Yes. Yeah, that would be bad.

545
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:51,276
I have, well, I have a Google Wi Fi system which has been strained,

546
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:54,806
we'll say under the pandemic situation of school from

547
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:56,526
home and work from home and everyone from home

548
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,375
all the time and everything and like a million

549
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,965
devices on my network in effect just this weekend.

550
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:04,765
I started hard wiring my access points because they were just all meshed up before.

551
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:05,036
I didn't.

552
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,056
-- It was, it was terrible, man.
-- That's the problem with the Google Wi Fi, right?

553
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:12,176
I love my Google Wi Fi, but they only have one channel.

554
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:16,250
So like the, the higher end mesh stuff has two channels, one for the clients, one for

555
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,189
all mesh. So that's the problem with the Google mesh. You're basically,

556
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:20,530
well,

557
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,869
especially if you're like if you have like ABC and it

558
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,729
goes like from C to B to A to the internet.

559
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,310
Well, you're, you're, now,

560
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:30,775
each router has to receive the signal and send the

561
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:33,844
signal on the same channel as all the other clients.

562
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:37,675
-- And so you have to wire those suckers in and,
-- and I did, they're,

563
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,895
they're wired now and it seems better

564
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,474
than it was. I'm still, I,

565
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,859
the people I work with people who have ubiquity

566
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:46,750
gear and they keep singing the praises of it.

567
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,270
My next purchase will be ubiquity gear.

568
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,150
I don't know if I want to drop a grand on networking gear though.

569
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,699
It's a bit more than a grand.

570
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:59,069
But the thing is like you, some of the features you get are so nice.

571
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,150
Yeah, that's what I, that's what I hear, man.

572
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,800
The other thing I personally not to show for them, but, you know,

573
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,849
I'm waiting until they come up with their Wi Fi six stuff

574
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,969
and then I plan to get rid of my Google Wi Fi.

575
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,300
-- Yeah,
-- that's

576
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,229
true. I should wait for Wi Fi six. I can tolerate this for the time being.

577
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:13,880
Yeah, exactly.

578
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,989
And as long as you wire in, you're like, you know,

579
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,359
like all my desktops are wired in and they're the main data consumers, you know.

580
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,280
-- So,
-- you know what's killing me actually is I have PLEX internally

581
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,849
and I've got a couple, I have two TV S,

582
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,550
both of them can talk to flex and when you stream 1080 P video

583
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,650
off of because I'm using Flex for live TV over the air.

584
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,050
That shouldn't be because like even a couple of gigabyte

585
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:39,650
video file streamed over an hour or two is not that much data.

586
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,119
-- 1000
-- and 80 P is oh,

587
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,010
wait, because the PLEX is doing the upscaling and then shoving.

588
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,479
It's not upscaling at all.

589
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:49,489
It's literally taking the 1080 P off the air and it's,

590
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,469
it's shoveling an MPEG two stream over the Wi Fi then

591
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:56,689
and it is enough that the Wi Fi doesn't become unusable.

592
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,369
But you know that something big is going down

593
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,660
-- when it's
-- streaming. Well, and again, if it's,

594
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:08,849
well, no, 1080 P is only a couple of like single digit megabits per second.

595
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,359
-- Is
-- it?

596
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:12,930
Yeah, but the problem is like I said, if you're using Google with the mesh, it's,

597
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,390
it's all over the same channels.

598
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Like it doesn't have two channels. Once you get that wired in, it should be better.

599
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,959
They were all hopping through the mesh. Oh, yeah.

600
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:22,839
-- Well, then you're, it
-- was consuming. It was, it was noticeable.

601
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,359
-- I don't actually know what 1080 P depending
-- on exactly what it is. 1080 P video. It's

602
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:30,369
frames per second. The bit rate is between 4500 and nine

603
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,770
megabits.

604
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,699
You know, that's

605
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,890
honestly like that's fine.

606
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,430
I regularly run speed test on my Wi Fi devices and get 2250.

607
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:41,300
No, I mean ubiquity is a good example of this too, of, you know,

608
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,810
they have like this cloud control software that you

609
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,520
can run it on pretty much anything you want,

610
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,260
you know, a workstation, a server or they'll sell you that little cloud key.

611
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,849
It's like a Raspberry Pi in a USB dongle.

612
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:52,920
And it's a perfect example that stuff will

613
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,810
keep working even if like ubiquity disappears tomorrow.

614
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,489
Now, you won't get software updates, obviously,

615
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,810
but at least everything just doesn't fail.

616
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,069
Right. And this is the reason I won't buy a smart door lock is

617
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,300
from what I've seen all these smart door locks.

618
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,640
If your internet goes down or the head office or whatever goes down,

619
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,750
your door won't lock and unlock remotely,

620
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,069
which cool until it's minus 40 degrees outside and you want to get in your house,

621
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,479
the obvious answers just live somewhere warm.

622
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,180
-- Yeah. Well, I, that's not an option in Canada. I
-- know. Ok. Ok.

623
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,459
So, I guess let's end it on time because that's where we started.

624
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:28,959
It is. Oh, that seemed funny. I didn't even mean for that to be funny.

625
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:32,420
Oh, I just totally assumed you just, you were going for a dad joke there.

626
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,420
That's an accidental pun, like

627
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,510
I approve. I approve completely.

628
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,760
So, anyway, anyway, I guess signed time, it's exciting.

629
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,520
I look forward to it.

630
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,709
I don't think it's going to really

631
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:47,160
change anyone's lives drastically but it's progress.

632
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,219
It makes it easier to know that you're doing the right thing.

633
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,910
-- And
-- yeah, I do agree with that. And not only that, it's one less thing to worry about.

634
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
It's one of those situations where

635
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,709
if I was constructing,

636
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:02,650
let's say some sort of security sensitive data center environment

637
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:04,790
time would be on my mind.

638
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,790
But if I can get signed time from NIST,

639
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:10,959
I will not be concerning myself from anyone.

640
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:11,400
Well, no,

641
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,310
not from anywhere because obviously certain places are

642
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,939
going to be more trustworthy than others.

643
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:19,030
And Nist is a place I can get time from and not feel bad.

644
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,569
I would get time from, let's say like someone like Microsoft and be OK, you know,

645
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,199
but when you start going to just random time servers, then it turns into like a,

646
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:28,689
I don't know about this as much, but that's OK.

647
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:31,087
Thing is honestly if you're getting random time

648
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:33,607
from random time servers but different time servers,

649
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:36,756
-- it's you're going to notice if one of them is out of whack,
-- maybe,

650
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:40,626
-- maybe not
-- unless they're specifically targeting you which hint they aren't.

651
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:44,016
-- Probably
-- not. And if you, well, and it's one of those situations, right?

652
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:48,357
-- If you are being targeted in this way.
-- Yeah, that's Nation State mossad.

653
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:52,516
-- Spoofing
-- time is not going to make the list of things they're going to do.

654
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:53,663
You know, like

655
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:58,014
I still love, I'll put the link that XK CD comic where it's oh,

656
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,573
the encryption is too strong.

657
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,254
We can't, we can't crack his laptop. It's

658
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:01,433
like,

659
