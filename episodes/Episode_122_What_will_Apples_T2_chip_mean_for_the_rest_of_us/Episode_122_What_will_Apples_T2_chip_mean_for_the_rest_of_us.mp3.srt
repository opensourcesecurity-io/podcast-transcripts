Hello and welcome to episode 122 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,609
-- Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh
-- Pressers.

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,710
What's new man?

3
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,180
Uh Apple has some nice shiny new products.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,120
They, they do.

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:18,870
Actually, there was,

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,989
there was an announcement about some of their new stuff and we decided we

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,270
should talk about their T two security chip which while not open source is security

8
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:26,940
and

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:28,739
not even

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,690
close to open.

11
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,245
However, however,

12
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:35,134
the one thing that, that I'm telling myself uh potentially is a lie,

13
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:38,575
but I don't think so is that this is technology we're going to be

14
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:42,235
seeing all over the place in a couple of years because I think what,

15
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:45,154
what Apple's doing here will change the game enough

16
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,645
that it's going to make a difference.

17
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:46,784
Now,

18
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:51,634
all of you people screaming T PM at your phone or whatever you're listening to us on.

19
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:56,645
No, no A T PM sucks. And this actually looks like it might work. So all

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:56,955
X

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:57,810
why,

22
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:00,450
why don't you start us off by just kind of

23
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,490
running through a brief overview of what this thing is.

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,360
So the T two security chip is an actual, like,

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,750
separate physical chip that is on the motherboard of your, um, new Apple air.

26
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:18,050
-- And I believe we
-- should also specify. It's, it's a custom chip.

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,779
-- It's
-- only Apple has this. Like, they, they,

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,889
they built it

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,110
-- and, and yes, it's the airs and the,
-- well, they didn't build it.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,250
They, they designed it and they had it built for them.

31
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,379
Well. Right. Yes,

32
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:33,589
nobody builds anything anymore. Right. You design things.

33
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:35,769
Right. Right.

34
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,430
And, and yes,

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,550
you are correct that this is on the Airs and the pros

36
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:43,040
and for what it's worth some of this functionality already exists today

37
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,199
in iphones and even things like the surface tablets from Microsoft but not,

38
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,239
not on this level.

39
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,544
Well, and part of it is because those things slightly different attack vectors.

40
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:54,735
But regardless, so the T two security chip

41
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,894
I think is pretty nifty.

42
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:01,614
The old style was, oh, physical attacks came over. Right. That was always the man

43
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:05,214
if somebody physically controls your device game over. Well, you know what?

44
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,934
That's not good enough anymore because I have a computer in my pocket, my phone

45
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:12,255
that has my entire life on there. My last pass, my Google everything

46
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:15,975
and, you know, at some point I probably will lose physical control of it.

47
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:16,654
I'll get mugged.

48
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:18,804
You know, if somebody points a gun at me and says, give me your phone,

49
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:19,654
my answer will be yes.

50
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,419
-- Like here it is. Take
-- it from,

51
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:22,850
you know,

52
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,520
um And I still want that damn thing to be secure.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,970
I think that's fair.

54
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,550
So the T two security chip essentially covers

55
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,380
sort of, well,

56
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,750
two really important things which is encryption of the local data storage.

57
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,860
So the uh well, whatever the SSD or whatever it's called now on a, on a Mac

58
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,240
and the secure boot. So essentially, uh if you have the secure boot enabled,

59
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,960
even with physical access to your device,

60
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,149
I can't monkey with it. Right.

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,940
I, I must have your biometrics or I must have your password

62
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,589
to get this machine turned on and, and decrypted and running.

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,380
It's even more than that.

64
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,619
You can, you can make it so you can't even boot off of external media

65
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,300
because I mean, so like today,

66
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:18,539
the evil maid style attacks that are talked about is basically someone shows up,

67
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,539
they boot your computer with a special flash drive.

68
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,070
And let's say you have an encrypted hard drive.

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, they could monkey with your bios still and maybe have a bad bios

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,789
that could, you know, steal your passwords or even some data later.

71
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,160
And, and there are things like T PM modules and secure boot

72
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,869
that can do this to a degree,

73
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:41,134
but making them work correctly is a freaking nightmare.

74
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:41,654
Yeah.

75
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:44,854
And, and for those of you saying the evil maid attack is theoretical.

76
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:49,494
So back in, yeah, here we go 2003 Poker sharks laptop owned by evil maid attack.

77
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,184
Professional poker player, Jens K,

78
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,095
I'm sorry, I butchered that

79
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,104
learned a lesson about

80
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,335
security earlier this year.

81
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,425
Don't leave your computer unattended without securing it first.

82
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,455
Not even in your hotel room.

83
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:01,755
Now, realistically, I, when I travel,

84
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,324
I leave my laptop in my hotel room all the time because like,

85
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,774
I don't want to carry it when I'm going to,

86
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:10,169
-- you know, an evening function where there's, I
-- almost never leave it behind.

87
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:12,960
In fact, I have a chromebook I travel with for this purpose.

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,220
If I know the laptop will leave my site,

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,730
I bring the chromebook.

90
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,320
Whereas if I know I will have it on me at all times,

91
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,290
I might consider bringing my Macbook.

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,839
Yeah.

93
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,000
But so this basically the T two in theory, assuming it works as advertised,

94
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,170
basically solves this

95
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,200
to a degree,

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,670
it makes the attack significantly more difficult.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,070
Um like nation state level difficult.

98
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,510
So, well, why don't we start? So the first thing the T two chip does

99
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,510
is it has what's called the secure enclave.

100
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,709
Now, we've heard about this in the iphone and elsewhere.

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,070
And the secure enclave very simply put is the computer chip has

102
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,579
uh a small

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,000
area that is, well, it's a secure enclave,

104
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,519
like that's where the encryption keys live,

105
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,230
they're generated securely.

106
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,829
So this thing has a really, apparently a really good, you know,

107
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,160
cryptographically secure random number generator which, you know,

108
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,239
we've talked about in the past.

109
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:05,619
It

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,070
is.

111
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:06,720
Um

112
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,429
And so it'll generate the keys

113
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,679
and more importantly,

114
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,799
it stores the keys in a way that also makes it very easy for it to delete those keys.

115
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:15,119
So,

116
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,299
you know, if you do lose physical access or physical control of your laptop,

117
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,089
you know, you can do the,

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,579
find my iphone or find my uh my apple air and tell it to a remote wipe, right?

119
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,140
And all that device has to do is not churn through all the data on the hard drive,

120
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,010
but simply delete a couple of very small A es encryption keys.

121
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,179
You know, in the secure chip, this chip

122
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,779
makes it very like essentially extracting those keys from the

123
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,910
chip would require a physical attack against the chip itself,

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,839
you know,

125
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,700
which

126
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,019
possible. But we're talking nation state

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,720
level attacks, not a mugger.

128
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:54,809
It's, it's even man, even if you're a nation state, it also means you have to,

129
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,440
it's the sort of attack that's going to take a significant amount of time.

130
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,510
So you can not

131
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,850
during trying to do one of these sort of operations,

132
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:03,700
you also have a very high

133
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,510
probability of just like accidentally breaking everything

134
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,390
and

135
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,850
it takes days to weeks to mount.

136
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,954
This isn't one of those sneak into the hotel room quick through this attack and then

137
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:14,575
like

138
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:14,725
your

139
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:15,915
computer

140
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:16,575
at this point,

141
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,934
it's probably easier just to kidnap the guy with his laptop and

142
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,785
beat him with a stick until he puts his thumb on it.

143
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,105
Exactly.

144
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:24,424
Not that we're advocating for that.

145
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:29,135
But uh yeah, so, so the T two has a secure enclave with the encryption keys,

146
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:32,674
the encryption keys, theoretically speaking, just cannot be removed.

147
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:36,054
So that essentially means now that if you encrypt your

148
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:36,864
data,

149
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,825
uh you know, at the volume level

150
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:39,855
on your ma

151
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:40,334
air,

152
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,959
it's tied to those keys in that T two chip. So even if somebody, you know,

153
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,739
steals the media out of your laptop,

154
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,920
they can't access it because they don't have those encryption keys.

155
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,160
And that means also that, that,

156
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,000
that data that's encrypted is now tied tightly to that T two chip.

157
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,660
Like you can't,

158
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,290
you can't get access to that data without that T two chip.

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,920
And the T two chip itself has protections.

160
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,700
It's worth pointing out that the flash storage

161
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,320
on the macbooks is soldered onto the board.

162
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:07,869
So

163
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,869
you can't steal the hard drive

164
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,149
it out,

165
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,010
right? It's,

166
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,019
-- it's pretty much, this stuff is all connected.
-- Yeah.

167
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,660
Well, and, and so this is important to keep in mind, you know, if your T two chip fails,

168
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,940
then you're, well, I hope you had a backup of your data.

169
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,420
That's right.

170
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,500
But it's OK. It's on an unencrypted hard drive in my desk, right?

171
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:27,859
Don't tell anyone.

172
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:28,910
Yeah.

173
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,619
So,

174
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,779
so basically that secure enclave is what allows the chip

175
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,660
to do a bunch of magic with encryption keys.

176
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,239
Very, very, very securely.

177
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,809
One of those things being

178
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:38,730
storage, encryption,

179
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,779
something that isn't clear to me on this secure enclave is like the

180
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,200
Intel chips have a

181
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,619
similar function. The SGX

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,170
which is

183
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,450
meant to

184
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,880
SGX is not, well, SGX is a form of secure enclave, but it's actually for

185
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,489
processing not for

186
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,619
pure key storage.

187
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,079
And

188
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:58,470
that's

189
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,640
very

190
00:07:58,829 --> 00:07:58,980
much what

191
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:05,220
I I have a suspicion that T two chip doesn't allow arbitrary code execution.

192
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:05,920
It

193
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,899
-- is important.
-- Well,

194
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,899
so the, the way APPLE uses the secure enclave is they're referring simply to

195
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,959
key generation storage and management.

196
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,440
As far as I know, that's all their secure enclave does.

197
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,279
The Intel SGX

198
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,239
is

199
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,640
allowing code and data to be executed

200
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,529
um free from disclosure or modification. So a great example of this

201
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,480
is uh there's a, there's a Blockchain from the Hyper

202
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,190
Ledger uh consortium or whatever it's called called uh poet proof of a lapse time.

203
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,580
And it's very efficient because essentially

204
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,929
the way it works is all the nodes in the Blockchain

205
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,070
run this little bit of code in the SGX that

206
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,989
waits a random amount of time and whoever waits,

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,659
waits the shortest amount of time,

208
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,190
wins the election and gets to generate a block.

209
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,169
And you know, there's protections against people

210
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,809
having like a fake SGX and always winning and cheating.

211
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,289
But fundamentally, this means that you now have a Blockchain technology that's

212
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,900
like really efficient because

213
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,710
it's the shortest waiting time.

214
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,989
And it's, you know, you're typically measuring that in milliseconds,

215
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:06,539
you know, whereas with Blockchain, you're like,

216
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,020
you're what is it the, the Denmark?

217
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,429
Now, the the electrical version of Denmark

218
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,200
is churning away on, you know, shot signatures.

219
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:14,880
Um So

220
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,309
-- with this electricity turned it into pretend money.
-- Yeah.

221
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
So, so Apple's secure enclave is a very

222
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
specific limited use case, which I

223
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:26,530
think is

224
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,210
it's not that Intel is doing it wrong,

225
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,090
it's that Intel is solving a completely different problem and just

226
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,049
right,

227
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:37,770
and there's a more important aspect of this is by by making it very specific,

228
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,729
you've reduced your attack surface by several magnitudes.

229
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:46,909
Whereas Intel's attack surface and SGX is infinity, right

230
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:47,929
versus

231
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,890
apple, which has a finite attack surface now.

232
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,280
And so having these,

233
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,599
these keys that allow you to be very sure that these keys are unique to this chip and

234
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,530
secure allows you to do obviously data encryption,

235
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,570
but it also allows you to do secure, boot very securely.

236
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,460
Um And the T two chip also apparently has some magic to,

237
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,239
you know, enforce the boot process.

238
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,059
So yeah, even if you boot off of some external thing,

239
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,599
you know the T two chips like Nope, that's not allowed, sorry, you,

240
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,150
you're not allowed to do that because I control access to

241
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,799
the USB or to the whatever, right.

242
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,640
And so looking at this, sorry.

243
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,919
So basically you got your boot ROM evaluates the ibot signature.

244
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,070
The ibot evaluates the T two kernel cache

245
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:30,880
signatures,

246
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,359
the T two kernel cache

247
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,940
uh evaluates the UEF I firmware signature and then the UF,

248
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,760
the UEF I firmware

249
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:44,479
uh happens and those four steps happen in the T two chip,

250
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,380
like they physically occur in the T two chip,

251
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,940
then it hands it over essentially to the, the CPU

252
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,729
and hands it the UEF I firmware,

253
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,469
you know,

254
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,330
um

255
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:56,789
and it, it boots,

256
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,150
right? So essentially

257
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
the T two chip is evaluating and

258
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:07,150
uh validating the security of what you're asking it to boot off of,

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,489
you know, if you've,

260
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,859
here's one of the interesting things about the way this all works is they

261
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:18,719
say here in their document which we of course link to in the show notes

262
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,989
that the T two chip has an immutable boot rom embedded in it.

263
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:30,109
And that means that it obviously starts up and executes this ROM and it can,

264
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,169
it can never be changed because obviously having

265
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,859
the ability to change it would be and it

266
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,099
an attack.

267
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:36,010
And right.

268
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,229
And so that's the trick is if anyone, if any researchers ever find a,

269
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:43,590
a problem with this boot ram and let's face it, I think they will someday.

270
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,770
Now most of these T two chips depending

271
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,650
upon the attack could be rendered completely useless,

272
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:50,289
-- which
-- is

273
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:50,869
hilarious,

274
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,590
is super simplistic and all it does is check

275
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:58,090
the signature of a larger blob that can be updated.

276
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm not going to claim anything is perfect and

277
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:03,840
even that can be

278
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,940
-- smart.
-- Yeah,

279
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,210
even that can be screwed up. But,

280
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:07,950
but the beauty is

281
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,260
to remind everybody,

282
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,049
your T two chip has the encryption keys.

283
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:16,340
If you encrypt your hard drive, so that T two chip is tied to that laptop.

284
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,229
So if you take that T two chip out

285
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,419
and monkey with it and break it,

286
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,289
that laptop is dead

287
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,599
and it's not like you can take a T two chip out of one laptop monkey with it,

288
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:26,570
put it into your,

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,900
you know, victim's laptop boot

290
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,140
and access the data. Right.

291
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,219
That's the beauty is the T two chip and the data are, if you do the,

292
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:34,789
the drive level encryption,

293
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,299
-- that T two chip and that data are now tied together, you don't
-- have a choice.

294
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,530
So the way they've done this, that's really cool

295
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:47,979
is the T two chip sits between the, the regular processor and

296
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,250
your, your flash memory.

297
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:55,989
And what happens is even if you don't set a password for encrypting your disk,

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,469
your disk is still encrypted with a random key inside of that T two chip.

299
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,010
Meaning

300
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,710
like literally if you pull the T two chip out, put a new one in which I don't, I,

301
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,900
-- I suspect that's not possible, but let's just pretend
-- to

302
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:10,229
sure.

303
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,909
But anyway, like your,

304
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,500
your computer doesn't work anymore because the new T

305
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,789
two chip would have a different key in it,

306
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,239
which is freaking awesome.

307
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,969
You just have to reinstall the US and everything.

308
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,719
-- Right.
-- Right. But

309
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,270
here's the thing and this,

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,859
this is the thing that has me most excited.

311
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,510
So today, the way disc encryption works

312
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,450
is

313
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,590
on the first bit of the hard drive,

314
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,789
you'll have a special key and then your password unlocks that key.

315
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,880
But all of these operations are happening in CPU and in regular memory.

316
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,940
And so there's always like the cold boot attacks

317
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,489
and all these other things where you can easily acquire

318
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:48,299
the key that's being used. And likewise,

319
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,880
if you have the hard drive, like the key is there,

320
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,590
you just need the password to unlock it.

321
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:53,859
And in this instance,

322
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,859
now this is kind of like the equivalent of two factor authentication.

323
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,239
Well, and that's the thing that allows brute force attacks.

324
00:13:59,609 --> 00:13:59,859
Right.

325
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,210
-- Right. Exactly.
-- Exactly.

326
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:02,960
Defeat

327
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,640
it does because you can try what 90 times essentially and then it just cooks itself.

328
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,020
-- It's a
-- little, there's so my understanding was uh blah, blah, blah. Here we go.

329
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,500
You get 10

330
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,320
attempts to log in

331
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,770
to prevent malware from causing permanent data loss

332
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,049
by trying to attack the user password.

333
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,119
These limits are not enforced after the user has successfully logged into the Mac.

334
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,479
So,

335
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,690
um but will be reimposed after a reboot. So, but basically,

336
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,700
uh then you get, you get 10 attempts, then you get like 30 more attempts

337
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,489
and then you get 10 more attempts through Mac Os recovery.

338
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,840
Uh And then you get 30 more attempts

339
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,219
for each uh thing.

340
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,429
So if you have file vault recovery enabled, you get 30 more attempts.

341
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,700
So if you have icloud recovery enabled,

342
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,690
you get 30 more attempts and 30 more attempts.

343
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
And if you have file vault recovery key enabled

344
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,219
and institutional key,

345
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,349
you get 30 more attempts for a maximum of 90 possible attempts.

346
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,440
And it's also important to note

347
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,559
that there's a delay between the password attempts.

348
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,969
So attempts one through 14, there's no delay

349
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,700
attempts.

350
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:03,419
15 through 17, 1 minute, 18 through 25 minutes, 21 to 26 15 minutes, 27 to 31 hour.

351
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,099
So,

352
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:09,969
and I assume past 30 it's an hour. I don't know. But regardless it's, it's that,

353
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,719
yeah, you have a, a finite number of tries

354
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,330
to get it right.

355
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,969
And then the device is like, sorry, no.

356
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,169
And,

357
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,809
and

358
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:22,940
again,

359
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,090
you know, short of like, somehow pulling the T two chip out of the system

360
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,900
and doing some sort of physical attack on it to reset that counter.

361
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,190
You can't,

362
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,179
if you can, if you can reset the counter, you can probably just read the.

363
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,190
Exactly. Exactly. So,

364
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,039
you know, at this point now we're back to the whole, well, yeah,

365
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:45,070
just pull the T two chip out of there and, like, get the data out of it.

366
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,099
This is a,

367
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,140
you know, this is a nontrivial task.

368
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,659
It is theoretically. It is definitely possible.

369
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,500
But,

370
00:15:54,979 --> 00:16:00,450
-- you know, if I had to bet money, I wouldn't bet for it.
-- The bar gets raised so high

371
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,659
that

372
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,669
it is an

373
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,469
impossible attack for,

374
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:09,489
for most Attackers and here's the thing that I always keep thinking of.

375
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,549
The purpose of all this technology isn't necessarily to 100% stop Attackers.

376
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:18,270
The real purpose is this technology is just to know you're being messed with,

377
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,489
right? If your laptop's gone, you know, you've been messed with.

378
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,630
If there's someone like literally trying to force

379
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,590
you to touch something to unlock it,

380
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,510
like, you know, you're being messed with, right?

381
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:30,929
The danger is the unknown of leaving something say

382
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,150
in a hotel room and coming back and saying

383
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,229
I didn't leave it there. What just happened?

384
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:40,020
Well, fundamentally this raises the bar to it's less effort to just kidnap the guy

385
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,099
or girl with their laptop.

386
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,890
-- Stop telling people to do that. But
-- that's the thing, right? Is at that point,

387
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,960
the open

388
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,270
-- source security podcast does not condone
-- kidnapping.

389
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:54,400
But basically at that point, Apple can say they've done a reasonable job.

390
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,739
I, you know, I, I would,

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
-- I, I,
-- I agree. I agree completely.

392
00:16:59,359 --> 00:16:59,549
Yeah.

393
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,679
So the other thing they've done that I really like and well, I,

394
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,060
I don't want to argue about this because you

395
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,098
have a differing opinion of how this works.

396
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,079
But fundamentally when you close the lid on your Mac Air, now,

397
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,040
the T two chip or something associated with it

398
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,680
because it's apparently not 100% clear in the document disables the microphone.

399
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,209
I'm going to say they don't use a T two chip and, and this is why

400
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,900
because first of all, if the microphone is connected to the chip,

401
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,520
that seems like a stupid over engineering and more importantly

402
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,239
is the way this is written and here it is,

403
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,949
it says all Mac portables with the Apple T two security chip feature,

404
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,130
a hardware disconnect.

405
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:37,819
They don't say

406
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,719
that the T two T two chip is a disconnect.

407
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,979
And I would also argue that if, if it say,

408
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:46,599
say you do have a wire going to the T two chip and that's expected to do something,

409
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,239
I would not say turning it off via using

410
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,760
switches in the chip counts as a hardware disconnect.

411
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,239
Whereas a literal switch

412
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,359
in the lid that when you close it, a magnet opens a switch

413
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,000
-- that is a hardware disconnect
-- regardless the point is that

414
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,719
is no argue this with me.

415
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:02,920
Come on,

416
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:05,319
I'm just more impressed that they've finally done this because,

417
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:05,979
you know,

418
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,520
I've seen also reports that,

419
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,699
you know, the accelerometers in some of these phones now are sensitive

420
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,849
sensitive enough that they can put the vibrations of your voice.

421
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:18,329
Definitely. Or, or the I read one about our keyboards

422
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,349
where using the accelerate because let's face it like my phone

423
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,050
is literally sitting what two inches from my keyboard maybe.

424
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,030
And, and using the accelerometer,

425
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,369
you can measure how I'm tapping the keyboard to

426
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,430
guess what the keys I'm going to type are,

427
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,250
which is very cool.

428
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,959
Yeah, and I'm wondering do the Apple Airs have

429
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,329
accelerometers and motion sensors. I know like

430
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,380
the stuff with physical spinning hard drives used to have those like drop sensors.

431
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:45,579
But

432
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,329
-- right,
-- II,

433
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,839
I did try to research this actually before the

434
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,770
show and I couldn't find any references to it,

435
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,829
-- which leads me to believe they
-- do not, they definitely have a sudden motion sensor.

436
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,890
That's like the drop sensor. But again, how sensitive that is?

437
00:18:59,339 --> 00:18:59,359
Oh,

438
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,109
it is a tri

439
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,599
-- axle accelerometer. So. hm. Yeah. Well, which
-- is not sensitive enough.

440
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,300
You need a gyroscope to be that sensitive. Do you?

441
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,819
I don't know, man, some of these things are pretty crazy sensitive. Now,

442
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,310
all the research I've seen relies on

443
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,040
gyroscopes. So I'm going to stand by all the research I've seen

444
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,760
and I imagine

445
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:22,829
it I'm wrong and if I'm not wrong, someone will find a way to do this soon.

446
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:27,349
So actually you can just apparently type in PM set hyphen G

447
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,109
as root

448
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,030
and it will tell you

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,290
if you have a sudden motion uh S MS

450
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,949
and my IMAC does not, which would make sense.

451
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,510
Hopefully you're not dropping your um or sorry, my Mac mini

452
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,540
does not have one but my Macbook or my Mac Air doesn't

453
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,349
-- no weird.
-- I

454
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,750
I wouldn't expect them to anymore just because

455
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:55,625
new systems don't have spinning disk,

456
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:56,535
right?

457
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:56,714
And,

458
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,474
and really the drop sensor was so you could park

459
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,885
the hard drive heads is all it was really for

460
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,905
and, and it doesn't matter anymore. Because it's all solid state now.

461
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:06,114
Like, drop away.

462
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,204
-- In fact, that's funny
-- because, and again,

463
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,694
we're not advocating people drop their computers.

464
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:11,969
No,

465
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,969
no, no. You know what the problem is though?

466
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,630
So, like, my wife had a spinning disk in her old Mac

467
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,430
and at least once a year I was replacing it because she was notorious for dropping it.

468
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:25,290
Never far enough to break it, but always far enough to ruin the hard drive.

469
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,329
And yeah, like even with the drop sensor, it clearly didn't, wasn't doing its job.

470
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,760
And now she has a solid state drive, uh, everything is fine and the case is dented.

471
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,410
So I think it's been dropped from even higher,

472
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,750
but at least the drive is fine.

473
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh, yeah. No, my, my Mac here actually

474
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,239
has like a really solid crease dent in the edge of it.

475
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:47,050
I, I don't know what I did to it, but I must have been

476
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,699
like,

477
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,010
yeah, it's, uh,

478
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,410
anyways and here's the beautiful part too for all the

479
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,829
people like yelling about T PM and like secure boot,

480
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,439
you know, they're locking and in fairness.

481
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:59,319
So you can only use the secure, the secure boot with Mac Os and with windows.

482
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,770
So if you want to run Linux with secure boot, you're, you're out of luck,

483
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,180
but you can disable the secure boot if you want to run Linux, for example, on your Mac,

484
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:09,619
I want to clarify something about secure boot though before we go on is,

485
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:09,780
is.

486
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,160
So in the Windows world,

487
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,920
there are two C A keys they use because you could like Fedora and Ubuntu are signed.

488
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,790
You can, you can boot them with secure boot enabled hardware.

489
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,630
There are two Cas Microsoft has,

490
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,589
there's the C A Microsoft uses for Windows and

491
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,550
there's ac A they use for everyone else.

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,420
And apple is explicit in this document that they

493
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,959
only support the C A used for Windows.

494
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:35,000
They don't support the partner C A.

495
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,079
So,

496
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,900
yeah. Yeah.

497
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,849
All you people thinking but, but Fedora's got, it's signed for secure boot.

498
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,300
It is, but it won't work out

499
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,469
well. And realistically, the number of people that's going to affect is

500
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,989
not a lot. And

501
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:48,790
I

502
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,180
talking about a company that made a phone and told people they're holding it wrong.

503
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,839
So, quite frankly, you know, the entire Fedora community could try and

504
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,329
-- pitchfork mob them and I don't think I will care.
-- Right.

505
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:03,300
No, I don't think they will. And, and my, my suspicion is you can't even run Linux

506
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,939
on the brand new macbooks

507
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,219
because goodness knows they probably have

508
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,689
some incredibly wonky hardware inside that,

509
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,219
that just not enough people care.

510
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,839
But uh no, overall I'm happy with what this T two chips is doing because also,

511
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,119
uh they've made it easy,

512
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,119
right?

513
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,550
I mean,

514
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,750
I remember diddling around with secure boot and UEF I

515
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,459
and whatever when it first came out and like,

516
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,640
oh my goodness,

517
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:27,670
it's terrible.

518
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:28,500
I turned it

519
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:28,810
off.

520
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:30,099
That's

521
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:34,329
what I ended up doing when I had PC si just ended up disabling it because

522
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,280
stuff would just randomly break or not work.

523
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:37,839
Um,

524
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:39,829
oh, and there is one more thing the, um,

525
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,989
the, the T two chip does,

526
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,949
uh some of the stuff now with the touch ID sensor.

527
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,829
And again, so this is nice because it means for example, that, you know, you're,

528
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,969
the problem with biometric data is you generally

529
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,540
can't change it that easily unless you're like

530
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,780
really hardcore committed to like burning your fingertips

531
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,650
-- with a soldering iron and changing
-- your fingerprints,

532
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,579
you can't change it.

533
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:00,849
Just say you can't change it. Actually, you know what's funny?

534
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:03,500
I burnt my finger really bad on my 3d printer the other day

535
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,819
and, and II, I wonder, I actually, it's one of the wrong fingers.

536
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:12,119
What I, what I need to do is add all my fingers to my fingerprint reader on my phone.

537
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,089
And next time I, I like horribly burn myself,

538
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:16,750
I can see

539
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,489
badly burn your finger. It'll be fine because, you know, it's looking up

540
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:23,239
like you can because you can get like little cuts and

541
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,250
stuff on your finger and your fingerprint reader don't care.

542
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,930
Like because I,

543
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:28,359
I'm not gonna say which fingers I've registered but, you know,

544
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,599
I don't have all my fingers fingers registered

545
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,219
and yeah, you know, like my hands get beat up and

546
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,040
my phone seems happy with it.

547
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,099
But, um,

548
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,130
the nice thing is, you know, this is

549
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,060
again, the T two chip is

550
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,810
storing and processing this data.

551
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,489
So it's not hitting

552
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,630
the main CPU or the main memory

553
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:49,670
unencrypted,

554
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,270
you know.

555
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:53,069
Uh Right.

556
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,430
And it,

557
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,780
it sounds like from reading it and I must also interject at this point

558
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,709
that I feel like we've said the word T two chip a lot.

559
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,189
But anyway, uh right, it sounds like what happens is you scan your fingerprint

560
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,540
and then it kind of uses that data to decrypt a different key

561
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,790
in chip and then that is used to do stuff in that way.

562
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,329
Your fingerprint isn't like you said, going into ra M where

563
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,619
potentially be sniffed or stolen.

564
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,530
And well, and more of the point, you know, it can't be replayed, right?

565
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,229
Because talking to the T two chip only, well,

566
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,250
I'm going to assume the T two chip is smart enough to go.

567
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,109
I only take fingerprint data from the fingerprint sensor, right?

568
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:34,180
-- I would hope so,
-- you know, whereas if it's coming into the CPU, the CPU is kind of like,

569
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:35,270
yeah, whatever data is data.

570
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,709
I, I would, I would hope that is true.

571
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:39,660
I,

572
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:40,599
I,

573
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,260
I don't like to assume anything just because we've seen it all.

574
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,530
But that, that does sound like it makes sense. Yes.

575
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,079
Well, more to the point Apple is not a stupid company and

576
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,900
I think they fully understand that, you know, if they make,

577
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,800
if they screw this T two chip up, that's going to be expensive

578
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,089
for them to fix

579
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,510
probably, you know,

580
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,829
because it'll be a case of bring your laptop and swap it for a new one.

581
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:04,819
Uh,

582
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:06,569
and then all the old ones go back to China to

583
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,609
be de soldered and a new T two chip put on them

584
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,869
because that's the failure mode for a T two chip. Right, as well. It failed.

585
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:19,000
Sorry about your data. Say goodbye. Have a good cry. Here's your new laptop.

586
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:23,189
Right. Right. And, and actually that's,

587
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,569
that's going to happen, right.

588
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:24,849
Some,

589
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,469
some number of these will fail and you're going to

590
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,680
be left with a brick if it does because they,

591
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:33,680
they've integrated this so deeply into the hardware, which is,

592
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,709
that is interesting.

593
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:37,900
And that's one of the things I know, like with TP MS, you can replace T PM

594
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,040
and fundamentally,

595
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,250
although you're kind of in the same,

596
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,969
for example icloud backup is so easy. Like you, you log in,

597
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,810
that's it, there's no step to it.

598
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,209
Uh like unless you're like me,

599
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:53,609
you maybe need to go buy more storage because you have more than five gigs of stuff.

600
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,619
But fundamentally, you know, for people's core data,

601
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,530
like their address book and you know, their favorite photos and stuff

602
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:01,369
by default, all that stuff is safe and you know,

603
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,030
the extra storage is not that expensive or you just get

604
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,770
an external hard drive and do your time machine backup.

605
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,609
Right.

606
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,420
Right. Right.

607
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:13,939
I wonder if this will let you do external drive backups or, I mean,

608
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,339
external drive encryption,

609
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,239
but still rely on the functionality of this chip because if it does,

610
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,770
that would be really freaking cool.

611
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,260
Uh That's a good question. I

612
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:23,550
don't know.

613
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,859
-- I
-- bet it doesn't because from the thing is I've read,

614
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:30,040
it sounds like it's not in a position to be doing that.

615
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,380
And additionally, that means you'd have to basically feed USB through the chip,

616
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,579
which

617
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,750
the key storage on the chip.

618
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:40,800
Uh And that might happen, right? You could do something like that.

619
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,790
Although then the key is still going to be in memory

620
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,650
at which point you're not really gaining anything for yourself.

621
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:47,939
This

622
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,239
is a

623
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,380
S encryption and

624
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,560
it might actually, it does do a

625
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:52,319
because

626
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:54,699
each chip has a 256 bit AES key

627
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:57,339
that's burned into each process for manufacturing time.

628
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,310
It can't be read by firmware software and used

629
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,689
only by the T two chips hardware AES engine.

630
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,930
So yeah, it has an AES engine. So

631
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,500
you, you just shove your AES data through that T two chip up. What is it like?

632
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,250
Usually there are 10 gigs per second now for an AES chip.

633
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,630
I'm, I'm sure it's pretty fast,

634
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,209
right?

635
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,949
So,

636
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,869
no, that's cool. That's cool. And, and that's,

637
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,839
again, I'm, I'll be excited when this comes to all of the hardware,

638
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,239
which I think it certainly will and you don't think it will

639
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,479
I think it'll come to Apple,

640
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:31,439
obviously. I think it will come to chromebooks

641
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,599
and it might come to more business laptops.

642
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,630
-- I bet the surface season. Yeah.
-- And I was going to say that the

643
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:41,140
surface are pretty good.

644
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,119
Um,

645
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:43,739
the, the

646
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,339
Microsoft Mobile,

647
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,050
it is conceivable

648
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,900
and you might not be wrong because I know if you look at

649
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,810
a lot of the consumer hardware, it's, it's pretty bad

650
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:56,829
and their goal is actually to not have to help you.

651
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,839
They don't want you to call them and ask for

652
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,599
help and putting in a security chip would certainly,

653
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,010
we'll say, create a situation where you probably need help

654
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,030
where something like a chromebook or even a

655
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,890
surface book and special Apple's products are in

656
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,050
insanely walled garden.

657
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:12,810
Right?

658
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:17,250
And that, that makes it a little different with respect to

659
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,969
kind of how things work.

660
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:22,489
You don't, you don't have options, you do it their way or you shut up and leave,

661
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,569
which is

662
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,880
not very open source friendly, but

663
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,439
on the other hand, my fonts display correctly.

664
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,229
Yeah,

665
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:29,739
we talk

666
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:30,400
about that.

667
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:30,920
We were,

668
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,430
I was complaining to Kurt the other day about trying to use a high DP I screen in Linux.

669
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:38,150
And let's just say he laughed at me a lot

670
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,040
and, and my solution was to just turn my resolution way down.

671
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,089
So

672
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,790
I, I'll let I'll let the listener figure out what that all means.

673
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:46,969
Ah,

674
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:51,170
I think it also shows it's possible to do this at scale. Right.

675
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,369
Because I've seen a lot of,

676
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,709
there's oftentimes a lot of security hardware stuff where people are,

677
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,260
like they poo poo it because, oh, that's nice.

678
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,979
And it's too expensive.

679
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:00,849
We can't do it widespread or we could do it widespread but it's too hard to use or blah,

680
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:01,280
blah, blah.

681
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,140
And this clearly shows,

682
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,650
no, you, you can do it

683
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,469
right.

684
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,689
-- It's possible.
-- Yeah.

685
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:09,270
Yeah.

686
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:14,500
It, it, it is. It, well, I guess we're going to find out if it is.

687
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:15,760
I,

688
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,030
I have a feeling it's gonna work out. Ok.

689
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,900
So anyway, I guess in summary, well done Apple,

690
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,670
I can't wait to see this everywhere else

691
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:25,319
because I think these are awesome features and they

692
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,869
will definitely make a computer far more secure.

693
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,589
And I'm also glad

694
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,640
that I've not bought a new laptop recently because

695
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,410
this definitely makes me rethink buying a Mac.

696
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:35,849
Like II,

697
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:40,030
I hate Os X for the most part because I find it annoying for a variety of reasons.

698
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,609
-- But this might make me ignore my hate
-- that, say what you will about.

699
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:48,250
Like I'm, I'm, I use Mac Os daily, whatever it's an operating system.

700
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:49,689
But the hardware man,

701
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:54,579
like my hardware now is all six years old and it just still keeps chugging along fine.

702
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,630
You know, it's like it's fast enough, especially now with the cloud, right?

703
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,260
Because I can move all the heavy lifting into the cloud.

704
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,619
That's, that's not because of

705
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,130
that just because Moore's law has failed us.

706
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,939
Right?

707
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,709
No, but I mean, the apple build quality, I mean, a great example is Nintendo, right?

708
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,660
I pulled my Nintendo wii

709
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,920
it was sitting in a box in the garage for like 10 years,

710
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,630
like in a plastic box bin, whatever you call it.

711
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,719
And I basically just pulled it out, kind of blew the dust off of it, plugged it all in,

712
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,420
uh, realized I needed to buy that HDM. I adapter thing because like

713
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,569
TV, S in the last 10 years no longer have the um

714
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:32,219
is that the stupid thing with four cables,

715
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:33,420
the,

716
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,579
the, the four cables that's R GB with four cables and most TV s have those.

717
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,579
But the, the Wii doesn't do HDM.

718
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,540
-- I, the wii U does HDM
-- I for 23 bucks, you get an adapter that makes it do HDM. I,

719
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,030
-- but
-- does that give you too much lag?

720
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:52,819
So, so here's the problem. Actually, I can, I, I have,

721
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:55,319
I know more about this than I want to.

722
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:59,479
So I bought my first flat screen TV. I plugged my wii into it

723
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,260
and I went to play guitar hero

724
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,219
and like I failed

725
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,800
and I'm like, what's going on here?

726
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,380
And it turned out that uh L CDT vs have a certain amount of lag

727
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:09,920
to them and you can obviously

728
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,969
on game mode then and everything would be fine.

729
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,709
But my concern with trying to convert from the Wii to HDMIS,

730
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,290
you're going to have some on a leg doing the conversion

731
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,260
from what's essentially an analog signal into a digital signal.

732
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,329
I, I literally

733
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,609
spent like 23 bucks on this thing. And

734
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:25,890
-- now,
-- ok. Yes.

735
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,800
But now I want you to spend several $100 buying guitar hero.

736
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,739
-- And then tell me if it works,
-- I

737
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:32,260
mostly

738
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:32,760
play

739
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:33,479
that.

740
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:33,900
I

741
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,869
play Wii sports with the sword fighting and yeah, any leg there and you're hooped.

742
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:40,750
That's fair. And I do love wii sports. But

743
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,109
no, I do agree with you that,

744
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,060
that the Nintendo build quality is very good and being an enormous Nintendo fan.

745
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:49,109
Boy, that I am.

746
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:49,939
It, it,

747
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,489
I still own every Nintendo system I've ever bought and

748
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,780
I still use them ironically and they all work.

749
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,420
And in fact,

750
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,739
I've never even replaced any of the batteries in the stuff that has rechargeable.

751
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,579
I have like one of the old Nintendo

752
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,380
gameboy Advance SPS. It looks like an Nes. It's very nice

753
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,959
and like the battery still holds a charge for it.

754
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,680
Slightly less than it did, but still a respectable amount of time.

755
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:12,280
And that thing's well over 10 years old.

756
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,339
-- And
-- that's another thing. My Apple Air, I still get eight hours out of it.

757
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:17,180
I don't get the full 10 hours I used to get, but

758
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,130
eight hours, six years later, that's

759
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:19,839
like

760
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,319
six years ago. I wasn't,

761
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:24,579
I wasn't getting eight hours out of.

762
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,270
So. So anyway, anyway,

763
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,479
in summary.

764
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,920
Uh well done. Apple.

765
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,479
Everyone else copied these guys because they're onto something cool

766
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,040
