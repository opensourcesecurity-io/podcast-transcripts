Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,500
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,460
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I have a marvelous story to tell you.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,979
So this weekend,

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,680
I did a lot of work preparing a garden around the house and

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,879
we ironically had planned this long before the current state of world affairs.

6
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,180
I had to do a lot of digging

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,090
-- and a lot of tilling and just the usual preparation of the ground.
-- Sure.

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,110
-- I, I've never gardened.
-- It's harder than it seems.

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,979
I have tried to dig up some tree stumps and bush stumps in my backyard.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,939
And I, the decision I

11
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:44,984
-- was, I'm going to hire a guy with a baby backhoe.
-- Yes. Dumps are the worst thing ever.

12
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:45,543
But anyway,

13
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:50,074
so I was digging a hole to move a plant because I had a plant in

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,074
where the garden is going to go and I wanted to move it and I'm digging

15
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:57,944
and guess what I found in the bottom of the hole, a rock. No, the, my internet line.

16
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:03,914
-- I was like, I'm really glad.
-- Did you find both ends of it or

17
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,583
just not two? Just one.

18
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:09,047
Yes. That was my first. I was like, oh my goodness, did I break this?

19
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,148
And so I, of course, like,

20
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,807
ran inside and started running speed test and stuff to make sure, like,

21
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:15,447
my internet connection was good and it was, and everything's fine,

22
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,688
but it was the most terrifying moment I've had in a very long time.

23
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,008
I'm guessing, like, mine,

24
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,527
they have like the little baby board directional drill

25
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,288
that they pushed it through your yard with.

26
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:29,928
No, they, they, like, ran a little trench but it's only, it's only maybe

27
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:32,842
-- six inches to a foot deep. Like, it's not deep.
-- Yeah.

28
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,582
No, my, my line is like, maybe a,

29
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:40,192
about a foot ish underground and it's like a tiny scrawny, little white line.

30
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:41,222
It's

31
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,232
like when you sneeze on it you're going to break it.

32
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,791
So, anyway,

33
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,321
-- that was my, I don't know if I'd call it valuable lesson.
-- Stupid question.

34
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:53,632
But what do you think the time to repair would be ignoring the current situation?

35
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,466
I mean, it sounds to me like, because you, with one of those big American providers,

36
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:56,846
right?

37
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,655
And aren't they, like, comically evil and terrible?

38
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,055
-- They're,
-- they're generally slow.

39
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:06,276
I bet it would be on the order of a week or more to get a new line run?

40
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,795
-- I
-- wonder if you could get a private guy to come because, like,

41
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:10,395
I know a guy who does cable installs and he

42
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:13,195
actually is trained on fiber joins because it's honestly,

43
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,746
if you have all the equipment and you know what you're doing,

44
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:15,755
it's like a 20 minute job.

45
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:16,615
-- Right.
-- I mean,

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,535
yes. And if you don't have any of that stuff, it's impossible.

47
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,940
My suspicion is it's illegal to, you could probably mess with the stuff in my house.

48
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,500
But I bet messing with the box in the yard would be illegal.

49
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,919
Well, I didn't say messing with the box. I meant just like rejoining it.

50
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:34,139
Oh, just splicing it. I mean, I don't see why you couldn't pay someone to splice it.

51
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:37,070
-- I don't know if that would even be worth it.
-- Well, you wouldn't, you know what?

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,339
-- Because you wouldn't have any
-- slack. I could make slack.

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,550
So,

54
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,309
actually when there's a lot of slack on the side

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,210
of the house on this table and at that point,

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,009
like craves, I just, if I could find someone to join it,

57
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,029
like I'd dig it up by hand and pull, you know,

58
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,350
just to make it work because no internet right

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,059
now would be literally the worst thing ever.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,289
You can't work well.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,089
And, I mean, in fairness, you know, I've been working from home for 20 some years.

62
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:05,500
It would be terrible. You figure there's work, there's watching various TV shows.

63
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,320
They like everything I would and

64
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:11,205
I could tether a cell phone or whatever, but it would not be the same.

65
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:15,824
Especially like I have fast internet. I'm used to my gigabit up and down. I need it.

66
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,445
Well, Yeah, for the longest time I had, you know,

67
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:19,514
we have two infrastructure players here.

68
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,024
We have the cable company and the phone company.

69
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,835
And for the longest time I had one from each because I worked from home,

70
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:27,554
you know, and there were times where it would go down for half an hour,

71
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,285
an hour and being able to switch to the other one and

72
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:31,835
not have that hour of downtime because it would only ever happen.

73
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,104
Of course, when I was working on something that needed to be done right away.

74
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:37,820
-- But
-- now it same time, you know what this got me and I was thinking about that is, oh,

75
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,300
I don't have any backup solution.

76
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:44,080
And I actually the cable company. Yeah, you do, you have your phone, I've got that.

77
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:46,479
But I'm saying like the cable company has a line run to my house.

78
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,020
So like I could theoretically call them and go pick

79
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,820
up equipment and make that work if I needed to,

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,100
which could be an alternative.

81
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,139
But then at the same time, I also was thinking,

82
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,970
so let's say so the cable company when I canceled my service through them said, oh,

83
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,570
we're going to run fiber optic to the neighborhood.

84
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm like, that's

85
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,595
call me when it's done. Like, I don't see how that helped me now.

86
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:05,335
But,

87
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:09,434
but anyway, like, let's say they do run it and they want to run fiber to my house.

88
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,395
How are they going to run the line without chopping the other one because

89
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,053
I don't think there's any wire or anything in this fiber optic line that you can,

90
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,434
like, scan for, you know, with the magic machines.

91
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,035
Yeah, because I know,

92
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:21,673
like all our gas lines here have the little wire tied to

93
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,234
the side of it so they can run a tone down.

94
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:23,434
It.

95
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:24,605
It turns out at my last house,

96
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,674
my gas line came out of my house at a 45 degree angle and then went straight back.

97
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:29,385
So, like, you know, where the,

98
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,130
like where the meter is on the back of the house. My assumption was like, it just went

99
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,010
straight out to the alleyway where the main gas line was and it's like the guy's like,

100
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:37,450
yeah, no, it,

101
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,269
it goes off at 45 degrees and then it goes straight

102
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,200
out and it actually went where the back gate was.

103
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,690
And I'm like, I would, that's 10 ft away from where I would have guessed where it is.

104
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,250
Well, and that's, I mean, you never know how any of this is, run it.

105
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,730
-- It's, it's madness and a mystery for
-- sure.

106
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:56,290
So, what I do now is, is I either find out where it is or I call, click uh, before you dig,

107
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,204
well, you know, call, you set up the website.

108
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,345
-- Yeah.
-- Call those people no matter what.

109
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:03,165
Well, this is, even before I'm doing anything, I just want to know where it is.

110
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:04,644
So that if I do need to know where it is,

111
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,785
I have it and I don't have to wait for them to come out and do it.

112
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:07,825
Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.

113
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,904
I got caught up on my vaccines last year, you know, because my tetanus shot was like,

114
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,545
20 years out of date.

115
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:15,885
Oh, wow. Well, you're supposed to get one every 10 years.

116
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,834
So, like, 10 years is more than enough time to, like,

117
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,225
just completely forget about it.

118
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,315
-- And then, you know, so I pulled my vaccine records and I'm kind of like, huh?
-- Ok.

119
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:25,829
So my doctor actually has really good about that because

120
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,779
I just got a whole bunch of vaccines last year.

121
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,220
I was in there like, oh, you're, you know, you're way overdue on all these.

122
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,179
And I don't know if they were like,

123
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,239
happened to be checking in on people or if I just got lucky that the nurse looked it up.

124
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,839
But, yeah, they, like, they loaded me up with stuff because I'm like, great.

125
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,359
I'll take whatever. I don't care.

126
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,200
I don't want, like, freaking rabies or something.

127
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,420
-- Hook me up.
-- Yeah.

128
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:46,250
And I mean, it's one of those things where if you do it in advance, great.

129
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,769
And it's, you know,

130
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,119
because I remember when we got the

131
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,260
meningitis vaccine because there was a meningitis

132
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,105
locally because it was spreading and they didn't know how

133
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:57,045
probably, you know, people looking each other at raves

134
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:57,934
obviously.

135
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,964
But, yeah, I remember, you know, getting that, you know,

136
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,364
meningitis is one of those things where you don't,

137
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,825
you basically can't get vaccinated for it

138
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,214
unless there's an outbreak because it's just,

139
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:05,934
it's rare enough that, like, we don't bother.

140
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,894
-- Yeah. I don't think I have that one. You
-- know, it's like d

141
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:08,095
cor,

142
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:08,454
all right.

143
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:09,934
Unless you go to the travel clinic and get

144
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:12,095
it because we don't have cholera in North America.

145
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,744
Like, that's not a problem in most of where we live thankfully,

146
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,774
because we have toilets now.

147
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:18,695
So everything's

148
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,600
-- and toilet
-- paper for

149
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,619
now for now. I mean, all right.

150
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,149
Anyway, so anyway, let's, that's enough.

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,570
Well, one bit of quick news turns out I was right. Microsoft bought

152
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,420
corp.com.

153
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,390
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, so this,

154
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,459
this news doesn't surprise me in any way because I think they are dumb to not buy it.

155
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,429
-- Well,
-- just the cost and hassle alone of dealing with all those support calls.

156
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,510
Well, in the world doesn't need any more chaos right now.

157
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,325
So the part of me that, that would love to see what would happen if,

158
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:50,524
if like a bad guy bought it is unfortunately still there.

159
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,325
But yeah, I think given the circumstances of the planet this is good.

160
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,904
Yeah. So, I mean, that's kind of nice. They did the boring thing

161
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,355
and I'm, you know, it's,

162
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,184
I'm gonna say it's probably one of those things

163
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:03,575
where it was comically cheap comparative to even hiring,

164
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,765
like, three more support people.

165
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:08,904
-- Almost.
-- Definitely. Yeah. I bet it was cheaper than a couple of people without.

166
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:12,494
And I bet it would have cost them tens to hundreds of people

167
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,195
to,

168
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,850
with the, the fallout of this problem.

169
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:18,119
So, actually, it's funny, it's funny you bring that up.

170
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,190
I have, I have a similar problem going on at work right now where there's basically,

171
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,529
there's a customer saying we need this feature and we're like,

172
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,920
this feature is ridiculous.

173
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,829
This is just to appease like a security

174
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,369
team that doesn't know what they're talking about.

175
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,869
And the customers like we know we know these security people are morons,

176
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,459
but like we need this because they won't go away at this point.

177
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,690
And I even, I went to the developers kind of begging and I was like, look guys,

178
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,880
if this is going to take more than let's say, 10 hours, it's not worth it.

179
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,299
I've probably lost more than four hours of my life at this point.

180
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,369
I remember pushing for a team to fix

181
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,309
a cross site scripting vulnerability because I'm like,

182
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,750
these

183
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,600
people keep freaking out about it

184
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,010
and it will be honestly way less hassle and

185
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,339
effort to just fix it than to keep telling them

186
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,989
-- why we haven't fixed it yet,
-- right? Because that's the thing.

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,869
I mean, usually what ends up happening is we get a complaint,

188
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,750
then either the support person or the sales rep gets involved and then I get involved

189
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,135
and it's like this is,

190
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,585
and we've got like five people on the phone

191
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:19,265
for and while I can say like this is not an issue, this is not a real security problem.

192
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,835
And the people are saying we know,

193
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:23,476
but our security team makes us call you and talk to

194
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:25,425
you because we have to get a statement from you.

195
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,846
I always wonder what would happen

196
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,805
if companies could actually accurately track kind

197
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,625
of how much money was spent on an activity or an issue,

198
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:35,145
like dealing with this one customer complaint or whatever,

199
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,296
because I'm guessing the numbers are quite shockingly high.

200
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,466
Once you figure out like including overhead and everything,

201
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,091
-- I should
-- start hacking that.

202
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,711
I think that would be a valuable metric actually because

203
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,682
-- it would, it
-- would, well, there's not just how much time you spend on it,

204
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,111
but then the opportunity cost of, well,

205
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:50,911
I was dealing with this silliness rather than doing something more productive.

206
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:51,271
Well,

207
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,711
and all the other people involved and even the

208
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,111
customer involved because like at the same time their,

209
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,442
their people standing up, the services are saying, yeah,

210
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,392
we know our security people are ridiculous.

211
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,052
And I mean, in all seriousness,

212
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:05,072
I think part of this problem as well is that there's a lot of

213
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:07,432
organizations where the security teams just are

214
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,591
like unchecked maniacs and they can,

215
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:10,351
they can just say,

216
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,478
can't deploy this unless this is fixed and there's like, well, what do we do now?

217
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:14,958
I mean,

218
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:16,357
it's kind of madness.

219
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:16,648
Well,

220
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:18,697
they're probably running on policies and procedures that

221
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,468
were put in place like 20 years ago.

222
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:20,888
And I mean,

223
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:23,797
this whole work from home thing is a great example of that the local government,

224
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:27,437
not everybody has laptops, like a bunch of people have desktops or whatever.

225
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,478
And so part of their work from home strategy

226
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,218
was literally they sent out a questionnaire saying,

227
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,598
you know, do you have a windows seven or better PC at home?

228
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,857
And I'm like, wait, what?

229
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:39,398
And so they're expecting people to work off their personal gear.

230
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:40,218
What's the alternative?

231
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,684
I mean, and I get that because in fact,

232
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:45,903
I know of some organizations or some friends I have that I was talking

233
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:49,903
to that were saying that they're not able to get hardware for the new employee

234
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:53,523
and obviously their, their new employees are working from home.

235
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:54,924
So they're basically saying

236
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:58,403
your options are essentially either don't start working yet,

237
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,383
which for most people isn't an option.

238
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:05,223
-- Yeah, or go source a chromebook.
-- Yeah, or yeah, or, or find something to work off of.

239
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,124
And of course, look,

240
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:09,564
almost anyone in the tech field has one or more computers at home.

241
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:09,924
So like it

242
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,369
an issue, however, the problem then becomes.

243
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,210
So you've got your internal corporate standards for desktop security.

244
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:17,239
Well, what now

245
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,809
I'm using some guy's gaming machine, right?

246
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,659
My reply to that would be like cloud,

247
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,099
you move your trust perimeter to the cloud and assume that these

248
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:28,969
horrifically virus ridden nasty malware infected machines will be accessing it.

249
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,799
And that's cool because you can do things like, not to name drop vendors, but like,

250
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,570
you can do that Citrix terminal thing where they can't even cut and paste.

251
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,090
You know, worst case scenario they're taking, like, screenshots,

252
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:39,570
didn't we talk about Citrix a few weeks ago?

253
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,599
Yeah, we did. You know, like, it's funny.

254
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,830
Right, because, like, the cloud security lines were 100% cloud based.

255
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,609
So literally business as usual. Yeah. Right. Right.

256
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,510
Edmonton public school boards is all in on Google.

257
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,390
And so, like,

258
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,099
literally most of the kids actually have their user name and password memorized.

259
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:58,289
And so, like, the schools basically reminded of our kids accounts.

260
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,729
I logged them in on their ipads. That was it. There was no step to it.

261
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:05,580
It was kind of funny because I also set up a profile for Felix on, you know,

262
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,320
chrome for his school thing and get him, like, have him log in,

263
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,159
takes two seconds and then all of a sudden the chrome turns to this, like,

264
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,130
hideous orange and red and,

265
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,210
and I'm like, what? And there's like all these weird icons popping up.

266
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:19,710
-- I'm like, oh, this is his desktop from school?
-- Ah. Oh, I see.

267
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,809
-- I see,
-- because I was kind of wondering, I'm like, yeah, man.

268
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,390
Like, where's I'm gonna have to hunt down, like,

269
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,590
where Google classroom and whatever is and all that.

270
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,489
And it's like, no, like, just boom there's,

271
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,469
his desktop is a web browser and it's everything he needs.

272
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:35,479
Yeah, the chrome user experience is remarkably good.

273
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:39,380
And I mean, I, I discovered this exact same thing, right. I am a chromebook.

274
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,851
I do lots of stuff on it. At one point. My kids need to log into Google for, for school.

275
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,541
And I was like, here just take this right.

276
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,581
Go, go off in the corner and use my chromebook. I don't care.

277
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,892
And, yeah, they logged in and I was like,

278
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,831
this is nothing like when I use chrome it's so different because of course,

279
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:55,892
they're all locked down.

280
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:59,132
And the most annoying thing is they can only print a school printers,

281
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:03,942
they can't print to the printers in my house. So it's like, ah, this sucks. Right.

282
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:07,142
We, we worked around it basically. We, we can save to PDF.

283
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,421
So I had him save it to PDF and then I just, like, you know,

284
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:11,081
sneaker net it to the printer.

285
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:11,364
Yeah.

286
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:11,973
So, what,

287
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:13,653
what gets me is like for the organizations that

288
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,333
they weren't necessarily even prepared for this specifically,

289
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,734
but just in general they've embraced the cloud and they've embraced.

290
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:18,934
Yeah.

291
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:19,554
You can have like,

292
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,573
a totally locked down corporate desktop and then a

293
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,734
zero Day comes around and we're all screwed,

294
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,504
you know, or a new virus comes out or something.

295
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,414
Right. Like, that's the thing, right.

296
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:30,494
-- Having a lockdown corporate desktop doesn't make it secure magically,
-- I have a lot.

297
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,213
I can talk about on this topic.

298
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:32,934
But I mean,

299
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:36,013
fundamentally from what I've seen is most of this

300
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,104
technology that's being used to lock us down,

301
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:39,523
there's kind of two sides to this.

302
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:39,924
And

303
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:40,205
now,

304
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,046
like we talked to Tony Meehan a couple

305
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:45,445
episodes ago and there's the magic Endpoint response

306
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:49,085
software now that just looks for badness and then it tries to stop the badness.

307
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,505
I feel like that is the future because it's,

308
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,166
it's trying to be smart and then there's the, oh,

309
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,726
we're just going to lock your desktop so you can't do anything dangerous.

310
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,565
And, like, so my favorite example of this is when I was in college,

311
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,085
I worked at a paper mill in the summers.

312
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:08,825
It's how I earned my money to basically pay for beer at college. And

313
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,237
they had, of course, all the computers everywhere because, like,

314
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,208
everything has computers.

315
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:13,338
I mean, this was in what the,

316
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,797
the late nineties and there were still computers

317
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,518
everywhere and the computer that was in,

318
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:20,257
like, the little room we'd sit in that was air conditioned because the paper mill is,

319
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:22,038
like, freaking boiling hot.

320
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,627
There's this little room we could sit in, had a computer and the computer had all,

321
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,038
like, the readouts of all the,

322
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,918
everything on the machine and we were supposed to pay attention to it

323
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:32,317
and they were like, yeah, we used to play, uh, Solitaire on this but they,

324
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:32,888
they took it away.

325
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,927
I'm like, oh, I can probably fix that and, yeah, like 10 seconds later, of course,

326
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:37,687
I was past whatever crappy song

327
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,210
-- where they were using to lock everyone out. You
-- know, a funny story.

328
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,219
I remember at the Chaos computer conference in 1999

329
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:46,619
a guy had a Windows machine set up.

330
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,809
It was a Windows NT machine. I forget if, I think it was a 351 must have been anyways.

331
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,789
And he had it so locked down that you could actually do stuff on it,

332
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,679
but you couldn't mess with it and nobody was able to, like, mess with it.

333
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,880
Now, granted, most of the people there weren't, you know, windows experts.

334
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,530
They were more uni

335
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,580
type people.

336
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:06,590
But I specifically remember this guy somehow did some horrifically art

337
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:09,481
set of group policy objects to this laptop that he actually

338
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:11,521
had it so locked down that it was quote unquote secure.

339
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:14,151
But what gets me about all that is then, you know, nine times out of 10,

340
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:17,572
the person's like, but I need to do X to get my job done and they're like, yeah, tough.

341
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,702
You can't. Exactly.

342
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,822
My favorite thing is, you know, back in the day when USB ports were new.

343
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:27,252
Well, what's the easiest way to secure access to your USB ports, glue hot glue?

344
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:30,081
I remember I dealt with this company that actually made like USB

345
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:32,742
software security for Windows where you

346
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:34,361
can basically whitelist devices and stuff.

347
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:35,461
And it was like, I was like, wow, that's,

348
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,374
that's better than hot glue. But

349
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:37,984
also it's a

350
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,164
-- lot more expensive than hot glue.
-- It is.

351
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,783
And it actually doesn't work as well either because

352
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,573
you can just spoof the ideas now and stuff.

353
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:44,934
Right.

354
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:47,213
-- There's all kinds of shenanigans you can do
-- well back

355
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,864
in the day it worked because like this was like,

356
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:49,934
you know, 20 years ago

357
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:51,593
it was still magic.

358
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:55,473
And, and now for those of you listening, if you just fun fact,

359
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:59,713
a Raspberry Pie Zero has like a programmatic USB port on it.

360
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:04,254
So you can essentially spoof and do anything you want with USB. So like get hacking.

361
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah, you can make those like mice that send their own keyboard commands and stuff.

362
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,650
-- Everything
-- that's like the people made the little dongle that you

363
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,599
plug it into a computer and it would just say like,

364
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,859
oh, I'm the, I'm the whole internet.

365
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:18,859
Everyone route all your traffic over me and then computers would just start sending

366
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:23,340
all kinds of crazy network traffic to the Raspberry Pi Zero that got locked.

367
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:25,669
So anyway, I'll look at it for the show

368
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:26,000
notes. Uh

369
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,059
Right. Right.

370
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,590
So anyway, we are talking about locking down desktops and right, as soon as so,

371
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,409
but here's the thing.

372
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:33,260
So I think

373
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:34,718
to 10 years ago

374
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:38,437
people would say I need this to do my job and the security team would say too bad.

375
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,567
So sad. But I don't, I don't see that anymore.

376
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:43,418
Right now people say I need this to do my job and they open it up

377
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:44,658
and now it's like, well,

378
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:47,697
what's the even freaking purpose of this crappy software you put on?

379
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,138
Like I can do everything I need to do to get around it.

380
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,418
And one thing I think where the chromebook really gets it right is the

381
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:55,638
chromebook is less about locking it down and more about when you log out,

382
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,117
you are logged out

383
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,828
and it has that power wash option.

384
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:03,416
So like I feel comfortable using like I have a chromebook here that use once in

385
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:06,755
a while and I feel safe knowing that like when I log out of that thing,

386
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,195
there's nothing left on there.

387
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,375
So even if it were physically stolen and you know,

388
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,895
somebody imaged the SSD in there and did all that magic

389
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,935
that there's nothing that would come back to bite me.

390
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,515
So I'm fine with like handing it off to my

391
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,895
kids because if my kids like short of them somehow

392
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:23,236
getting some like resident virus that has a whole pile

393
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,895
of zero days to get through chrome and stay put.

394
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,875
I'm just not worried if they can basically do whatever they do

395
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,606
on that thing and it's not going to mess it up.

396
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:30,875
And that's, you see, that's the other thing that's,

397
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,323
that's classic problem with Windows,

398
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:36,193
right is people would have a Windows machine at home, especially Windows 9598 XP.

399
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,213
You'd have an account, everybody logged in to use. Right.

400
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:43,033
And so Bobby would go, you know, play his online game, get a virus and then, you know,

401
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,593
his dad would have to deal with that virus because it's in

402
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,833
the computer now because there's only that one trust level effectively running,

403
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,823
you know, with something like chromebook, it's essentially containerized.

404
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:56,593
So, you know, my kids stuff is just a completely 100% separated from mine, you know,

405
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,744
short of breaking out into the US and really hosing it.

406
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:01,771
Google puts a lot, like, they just shipped another security update, what,

407
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:02,692
23 days ago,

408
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,571
because there is something going around that where

409
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,571
you can potentially get out of chrome and

410
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,842
so they fixed it, you know, and I did the update on my computers,

411
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:12,092
which I hate doing because I have like 50 tabs open and, you know,

412
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,540
it's like reload chrome and I'm like, yeah.

413
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,131
Yeah. And I'm going to go, like, watch TV for half an hour.

414
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:19,071
Well, this is actually, I love it about the chromebook because you click,

415
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:23,051
restart it restarts and literally it pops up exactly where it left off.

416
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,381
It's marvelous. I love it so much.

417
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:28,962
And actually, yeah, I had that because Firefox just had a rotten security issue and,

418
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:29,102
yeah, I,

419
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,380
I had like 100 tabs open and I just declared tab bankruptcy and closed everything.

420
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,270
Yeah, I

421
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,619
don't even know what I had.

422
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,920
I assumed someone will yell at me eventually if

423
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,630
I don't do something I'm supposed to do.

424
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,510
So it's fine.

425
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,170
No, this whole keeping state and backup when my mother was first playing Minecraft,

426
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,989
you know, trying to hang out with the kids on Minecraft.

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,069
She's like, how do I save it? And I'm like, it just does.

428
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:51,510
And my mom was like, what, why I'm like, the computer just saves it because, like,

429
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,800
obviously you would want your work to be saved.

430
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,609
And she's like, yeah. and I'm like,

431
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,939
she's like, wait, why couldn't our old computers do this? And I'm like,

432
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,339
they could, but they just didn't because software programs are hateful people. So,

433
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:06,390
so actually, it's hilarious. You bring this up a couple days ago.

434
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,040
My wife and I were talking to our kids about back in the day when you would be like,

435
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,510
working on a paper in Microsoft Word and you'd

436
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,750
accidentally delete everything and it was gone forever.

437
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,946
And they said, why don't you just go back and document history and recover it?

438
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,086
I said there was no such thing.

439
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:25,725
Like this is why you'd have like four floppy disks and they're like, well,

440
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:26,806
what's a floppy disk?

441
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:27,076
But, you know,

442
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,206
you'd have like four floppy disks with like various backups of your term paper.

443
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:33,916
Well, you'd be emailing it to yourself once Gmail came out.

444
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,845
-- And I'm like, that's actually your best bet.
-- I remember that.

445
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:39,156
You know, like now

446
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,776
you can collaborate on documents.

447
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,141
They're magically saved in the cloud.

448
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:46,501
There's like, there's almost no way to lose this.

449
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:51,141
Like, until you delete it and empty the trash can. It's, it's there somewhere.

450
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:52,651
And even with that, like, if you,

451
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:55,342
if it's a corporate thing with Google Vault or whatever it's called now it's,

452
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,411
it's there somewhere.

453
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:56,802
Like

454
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:00,582
it's, it's an insane amount of work to accidentally lose a term paper

455
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:00,802
now.

456
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:01,942
So.

457
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:02,569
Oh,

458
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,550
my goodness. I don't miss those days.

459
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,130
-- So, anyway,
-- well, this, this whole, like, desktop security lockdown thing.

460
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,550
I mean, to me it's the other aspect of this is it shouldn't matter because again,

461
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,329
we're moving to that, bring your own device

462
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,010
thing because like, I'm not going to carry two cell phones. That's ridiculous.

463
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,199
And I'm also not giving you access to put like that

464
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,010
crazy software on my phone that can then wipe it.

465
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,260
Like, because there's been multiple people,

466
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,520
especially students talking about that,

467
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,410
how they want to access their school remotely university level mostly, you know,

468
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,588
they get this software that's like, like warning this thing can wipe your phone,

469
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:32,027
you know, do you get these permissions?

470
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,787
And it's kind of like I don't want to because again, I've looked into, you know,

471
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:38,108
deploying the software and I came to the conclusion

472
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,947
that I wouldn't have left on my devices.

473
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,927
So I feel like it would be a hard sell if you know, director of it is like,

474
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,748
yeah, we're going to do this but like, it's not going on my devices.

475
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:50,118
I had that conversation with someone. Not, this wasn't even that long ago.

476
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,677
They were, they were talking about, oh, you know, this is what we're looking into.

477
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,368
And I said, if this is me

478
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:57,725
would literally say no. And they said, well, then you can't work from your phone.

479
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,446
I said that actually would make my life a lot

480
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,625
better and it would make your life a lot worse.

481
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,135
So,

482
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:03,965
-- local
-- optimization for the win,

483
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:04,265
right?

484
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:07,125
I mean, seriously, because like, if I didn't have work on my phone,

485
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,456
-- that sounds pretty nice actually, like I'm
-- OK with that.

486
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:14,156
Although in hindsight, I should uninstall slack someday. But it's

487
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,156
anyway, anyway, there are, it's one of those things, right?

488
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,725
There's advantages to having slack on my phone and there's disadvantages. But

489
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:21,573
another story,

490
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,604
what I'm really curious about is after this whole work from home mass experiment is,

491
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:26,754
do you think it's going to stick?

492
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,484
I have been thinking about this a lot and I see.

493
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,083
So there's a couple angles to this that, that I envision. And

494
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:35,864
so there's the people who get to work from home that

495
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:38,663
like working from home that is a huge benefit to them.

496
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,673
And like you and I are an example of people who enjoy working from home.

497
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:44,104
I know people who do not enjoy working from home,

498
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,891
they need like the human interaction and they liked being in a place with people.

499
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,281
And I think that's OK too. And there's always going to be a certain degree of that.

500
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,722
Well, and there's certain kinds of work too, especially like creative,

501
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:54,722
collaborative work.

502
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,891
-- Absolutely.
-- You can't do that over a video link.

503
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:02,041
Like you have to be in the room playing with objects, taping them together,

504
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,732
whatever.

505
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:06,722
-- Right.
-- Yeah, I totally agree. I think there's always instances where it makes sense

506
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:12,921
now at the same time. So an example being there's a large insurance company in town

507
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,359
that is like, you know,

508
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,890
like they obviously have lots of people that

509
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,319
have to work their answer phones deal with.

510
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:21,459
You know, people want to submit claims against their insurance.

511
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:24,099
People have questions about policies, they're not paying their, you know,

512
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:25,310
whatever, there's a million reasons,

513
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,510
the parking lot's empty and they have

514
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,900
-- this enormous building just sitting there
-- blank.

515
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,869
Well, that's what, you know,

516
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,719
I'm thinking about like the cost of commercial real estate costs and he, you know,

517
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,400
-- and all that stuff and look
-- man, my guess is they haven't ever

518
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,020
migrated this work to being

519
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,400
at home because quite frankly,

520
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:47,084
this is the sort of job where the supervisors are kind of that, that

521
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,084
they like lording it over people because I know

522
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,084
some people that have been in these jobs and they

523
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,505
100% of them hated their supervisors.

524
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,655
I think this is one of those situations where the incentive is to maintain that level

525
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:03,135
of control because what you're going to see is the company is going to be like,

526
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:05,244
wait a minute, what's a supervisor doing now?

527
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,385
Like, you're not walking around yelling at people all day, like,

528
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:08,364
why are we paying you money?

529
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,755
And so my suspicion is there's a lot of these,

530
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,550
these organizations and departments that had kind of perverse incentives

531
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,310
where the people had an anti incentive in terms of

532
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,449
keeping people in an office because it felt it gave

533
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:23,270
them a certain amount of power and ability that they,

534
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,930
it's gone now.

535
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,989
Well, from everything I've read with every organization,

536
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,770
the number one metric essentially for success is what's your head count?

537
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,930
Fundamentally is what it pretty much always boils down to.

538
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,410
Yes, been articles about, you know,

539
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,719
the surveillance software being bought by companies to, you know,

540
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,079
put on people's computers to make sure they're doing their job, you know,

541
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,574
extreme example of this being. What was it?

542
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:46,435
Yahoo fired everybody who worked on a VPN and because apparently they

543
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:48,464
were checking their VPN logs and like some of these people,

544
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:52,925
like there's been zero traffic for like six months or whatever, right?

545
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:55,354
And I get it like you will, obviously, but I mean,

546
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:58,295
to me that really speaks to a fundamental failure in the business

547
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:00,675
and the management of so you hired this person to do something

548
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:03,854
and what they were doing was so poorly defined or untracked that

549
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:05,994
they literally just didn't do it and got away with that.

550
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:06,775
That's pretty broken.

551
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,405
And I don't think the answer is to put software on their computers to track that they

552
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,939
actually doing it. It's to, more to the point was that job even necessary.

553
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:17,739
It's like the old story of what is your incentive actually?

554
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,829
Where, you know, in India they paid people to bring in dead cobras.

555
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,030
So people just started raising cobras. Right.

556
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,680
-- Well, it's
-- a lot easier than catching them.

557
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,719
Yeah. Seriously.

558
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:27,839
That's exactly opposite.

559
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,589
Or my favorite was hearing these horror stories from

560
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,800
people in telemarketing companies where they were basically told,

561
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,500
like, no call can last over eight minutes.

562
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,170
-- So at eight minutes they just hung up.
-- Yeah, I remember those days.

563
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,619
I remember when that happened. I remember all those text

564
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:42,324
things where all of a sudden, yeah, tech support people just started hanging up.

565
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,435
And what, and what I love now is my previous phone carrier.

566
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:47,905
They must have some automated system because the guy asked, like,

567
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:49,844
so have I solved your problem?

568
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:51,545
And I'm like, and he just got,

569
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,505
and I kind of did this intentionally just to see what would happen.

570
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,805
But I basically refused to say yes or no.

571
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,505
I just kind of made an uncommitted grunt and he

572
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,665
just kept asking the poor guy like he just,

573
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,265
he's like, sir, I need to know, you know what I mean?

574
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:06,665
-- Like, he really had to get a yes or a no out of me.
-- I feel bad for a lot of these people.

575
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,314
And in fact,

576
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,064
like, for example, when,

577
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,489
when I take an Uber.

578
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,949
I basically, unless like that, I felt like my life was in danger,

579
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:18,020
which has only happened once in Uber and it wasn't Canada, in fact, but, like,

580
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,560
I give him five stars because I know if you don't give this person five stars, like,

581
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:22,469
he'd be like, yeah, it was ok.

582
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,920
It's a 2.5 star ride.

583
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,709
But if I don't give the five stars they're going to

584
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,410
lose their job and then their kid doesn't get to,

585
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:28,900
which is ridiculous, right?

586
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,969
-- Like that's not ok because
-- that's one thing I really wonder with, you know,

587
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,660
people having to work sort of under their own direction more.

588
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,430
I mean, I'm reading these articles where these guys are talking about, you know, oh,

589
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,339
my boss gave me

590
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:41,040
piece of work and, you know, based on previous experience,

591
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,260
I said it would take me two or three days to finish and, you know,

592
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,060
it was done in two hours because I

593
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:48,579
had two hours of completely 100% uninterrupted work.

594
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,260
Actually,

595
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,479
it's funny you bring that up too.

596
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,540
So I think one of the unexpected outcomes of all these people working from

597
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,640
home is so one of the things I do at work is people,

598
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,199
for example,

599
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,479
run security scanners and they send me the results

600
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:03,140
of their scan without ever having looked at it,

601
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,099
which again, kind of comes back to the scanner podcast we talked about,

602
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,390
we'll say last week.

603
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,180
But anyway, we like,

604
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,569
we had this discussion and so these people are running these scans,

605
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,099
they send me the scan, of course, they don't look at them and then I send them back.

606
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:16,530
I'm like, OK, here's what's going on.

607
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:20,069
This is what's happening and 99% of the time like, ok, great. Thanks for that.

608
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,880
And that's it right. There are no questions asked.

609
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,010
They're clearly now paying attention.

610
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:28,280
And so they're saying, OK, well, uh I don't, I don't believe you, I prove, prove this.

611
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:31,520
And I'm like, what do you mean? Prove it? Like, what do you want me to freaking do?

612
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,079
And they're saying, well, I, I want you to prove this.

613
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,900
And I'm like, that doesn't even make sense.

614
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,487
You're like saying like, prove Air is air like that. What?

615
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:39,746
Well,

616
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,116
my favorite is when they're asking you to prove a

617
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:43,187
negative because like I remember we had a Jackson data

618
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:43,776
thing

619
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:47,717
and I went through the code and I'm like, well, we, we never make that call. Cool.

620
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,077
And then I confirmed it with the developers.

621
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,317
Like, yeah, we never use that and we never will.

622
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,587
But then I was told we had to fix it

623
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:55,996
anyways because the customer could turn that feature on.

624
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:56,357
And I'm like,

625
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:57,607
the only way they can turn that feature on is

626
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,477
by like rewriting a big chunk of the product.

627
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:02,197
That's exactly the same problem I have as Jackson da,

628
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:06,884
people say we want you to fix this. I said like we can't. And here's why

629
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,364
they said we don't care, fix it.

630
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,884
I'm like, you can tell me that all you want and like,

631
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:12,843
it's not going to make it happen any sooner.

632
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:16,803
-- Well, here's the funny thing. They did a scan of a production system. Correct.
-- Sure.

633
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:19,073
-- Some are production, some are whatever,
-- some

634
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,433
-- of
-- them are production for sure.

635
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:24,423
-- Well, the world has not ended. That thing's running well.
-- Right.

636
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:25,553
Is it a risk?

637
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:30,203
-- Kind maybe sort of, but realistically, no,
-- it's, there's literally no risk

638
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:30,904
so well,

639
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:33,240
then it definitely falls into bucket of acceptable risk.

640
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,130
And, well, here's the thing, if they were really adamant about it,

641
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,961
they would turn it off.

642
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,240
Well,

643
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,821
it's funny actually you say that because

644
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,600
I've been in conversations where the security team

645
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,360
says we can't run this and the other team says this is literally mission critical.

646
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,081
It stays up

647
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,561
and then the security teams like, oh, no,

648
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,681
we're telling you have to turn it off and they're like, no, like you don't,

649
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:52,781
you can't win this one.

650
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,171
If we turn this off, you don't get paid. Like,

651
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,181
yeah, like I worked at a place where they had this,

652
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,311
they had this accounting package and it's

653
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:00,218
construction industry.

654
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:03,397
So like when I learned about how that accounting software works because, you know,

655
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:05,878
every contract has different like holdbacks and, you know,

656
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,667
like they do all the work and then there's like 10% held back that's paid out.

657
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,197
Like six months later when they make sure, you know,

658
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,677
the whole thing didn't burn down or whatever.

659
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:14,687
And anyways point is it's this like horrendously custom piece

660
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:18,157
of software written locally because it's got to be legal locally

661
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,447
and it has to kind of fit the local culture and everything.

662
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,427
And I was running on this so machine with, you know,

663
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:27,187
VT 100 or whatever terminals and they, we upgraded, you know, so like

664
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,875
there, you know, we got like a dozen windows,

665
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:32,314
95 machines and then they upgraded to like an actual proper school box.

666
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:32,805
And like

667
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:33,795
it was just,

668
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:38,035
it was comically horrific because like the password to log in was

669
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:41,155
the company name spelled backwards with like every second letter capitalized.

670
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:42,905
And it had like a dedicated modem and its own

671
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,435
dedicated phone line and its own dedicated phone number.

672
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:46,645
So the company could like,

673
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:48,994
remotely log into it and update the software and fix stuff.

674
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:49,775
Which yeah.

675
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:50,234
No, no, I,

676
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:54,915
I support that because that thing printed out a huge pile of paychecks every Friday.

677
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:55,921
And like, I

678
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:58,751
remember one time it went down on Thursday and

679
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:01,092
they're like, Kurt, can you fix it? I'm like, no,

680
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:05,832
I'm not touching the, I'm not touching the machine that like pays, you know,

681
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:10,161
several 100 people. No, like you call the company and you make them fix it

682
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:11,702
right? And it is.

683
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:15,822
But I just, yeah, I had this dot matrix printer with like just these boxes of,

684
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:17,222
you know, the checks and anyways.

685
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:20,531
I mean, yeah, it's like there's nothing I could have done or said, or I wanted to,

686
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,411
to be clear where it's like, no, I'm not touching that.

687
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:25,918
Like, you, this thing has to work. It's outsourced to this company. Like that's them

688
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,068
because they're like, oh, Kirk,

689
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,989
could we save a few bucks by building our own PC to run this?

690
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,598
And I'm like, yes. But then paychecks might not run one week

691
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:34,149
and we don't want that. And they're like, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

692
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,149
I mean, this is a topic for another day because we're basically out of time today.

693
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,269
But I think something to consider is if you look at

694
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,989
kind of the state of affairs happening in most organizations,

695
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:47,149
obviously, I would say many organizations are running

696
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:50,308
in a sort of panic mode for a variety of reasons. And

697
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,630
how often is security getting involved and how often

698
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,989
is security just being blatantly overruled because they're like,

699
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,609
no, you're being like crazy person.

700
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:58,859
We don't want to talk to you. And,

701
00:28:58,979 --> 00:28:59,550
I mean,

702
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,050
I've seen both sides of this where I see

703
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,689
security teams that are involved and they're very reasonable

704
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:07,060
and they're actually partners and I see security teams

705
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,800
that it's like you're acting like a crazy person.

706
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,969
-- We don't care, go away like we're done with you
-- now. Yeah, they're the, no police.

707
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:15,520
I think this is when you're in this sort of crisis because there's like,

708
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,977
there's the security crisis.

709
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:18,376
We're like, oh, we've been hacked. We need your help.

710
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:21,437
Security, please help right now and then security's like, oh, I'm important.

711
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,896
I can do whatever I want. Like, this isn't one of those, right.

712
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:26,977
This is one of those things where security is a partner in the crisis.

713
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:29,077
-- Not like the fixer
-- right now.

714
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:32,927
We have, you know, something going on where like, business has to go on.

715
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,977
The security team can say no, but

716
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,536
-- we have to do our jobs.
-- Security team should never say no.

717
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:42,016
-- That is my, that is my honest opinion.
-- I think they should be

718
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:44,543
able to say no, but it should be, in my opinion,

719
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:47,293
the security team has failed at their job if they end up in

720
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:49,963
a situation where they have to say no much like a parent.

721
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,913
That's probably fair. All I do is say no as a parent, Kurt.

722
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:55,484
-- But
-- you know, there's the difference between the no and like the no,

723
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,083
I'm actually like banning this, right?

724
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:58,423
That's fair. That's fair.

725
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:02,494
And I would say like, if you as a security team, if you're having to say no to people,

726
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:05,014
you need to maybe do some like root level analysis

727
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,784
of like stuff has gone wrong a long time ago.

728
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,500
I, well, and look, if you say no, too much,

729
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,581
they just stop asking like it's the same thing with kids, right?

730
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,711
Kids figure it out, man. If mom and dad just say no to everything.

731
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,071
Just don't ask, texting and driving.

732
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,590
Let's not even get into that one. All right. Anyway, anyway, we're out of time.

733
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,071
I'm going to call this one. This was, this makes me amused because

734
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,220
I don't think we talked about any of the things we previously discussed,

735
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,551
talking about for this episode.

736
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,581
So I love it more content for next time.

737
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,209
