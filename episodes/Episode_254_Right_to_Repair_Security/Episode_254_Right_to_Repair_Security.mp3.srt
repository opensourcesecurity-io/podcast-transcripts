Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,029
Kurt Siefried and my partner in tractor crime.

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,940
-- Josh
-- Pressers, whatever, man. It is the 764th day of 2020 one.

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,899
Do not panic.

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,250
Do not go outside.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,290
Yeah, just continue,

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,030
continue hiding under the bed, rocking back and forth and crying. It'll be fine.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,030
Maybe build a fort out of furnace filters.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,409
I, you know, I actually have a lot of furnace filters. Funny, I buy them by the case.

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,200
-- Yeah, Costco
-- man, I Costco does not sell the furnace filters.

10
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:36,630
I need,

11
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:40,189
I'm lucky they do because they're literally less than half the price at Home Depot.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,110
Anyway. Anyways. Yeah.

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,830
So killer tractors and cars essentially the right to repair.

14
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:50,685
Why the right to repair is clearly going to lead to the 1986 film maximum overdrive.

15
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:52,575
I don't know what that film is, but we should,

16
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:57,125
let's before we delve into whatever crazy talking points we have.

17
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:58,615
We should clarify that.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:03,884
2021 is actually exciting because in the eu right to repair is,

19
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:05,605
has been codified into law

20
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:10,264
and it's kicking in and now companies have to,

21
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:12,779
there's a handful of things. They did some, a little bit research on this.

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,500
Probably not as much as I wish I had. But basically they have to

23
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:17,980
sell parts

24
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:19,650
for the stuff they make,

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,779
they have to make it actually user serviceable where it says you have to, I,

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,860
I think they use a word common tools or I forget what they said, but basically, like,

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,180
you can't use some ridiculous screwdriver that only you sell.

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,819
And then they also have to have like

29
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,930
manuals available for people to download for the,

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,349
well, a choir, we'll say for the products.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,385
Like this is part of me, really excited for this and part of me is mortified.

32
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:42,875
Well, but on the flip side,

33
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:47,334
the challenges are with value engineering where you take a product

34
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:50,355
and shave 10 cents off the manufacturing cost every year,

35
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:53,805
you end up making certain engineering and design choices

36
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,714
that can really impact

37
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:59,285
repairability, but conversely can really bring the price of the product down.

38
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,995
So a great example of this is if you want to make something waterproof, guess what?

39
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,824
You, you can't use a lot of screws,

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,339
you got to glue the thing together and make it seamless as much as possible.

41
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:10,979
And, and then you crack the screen when you try to open it.

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,449
Yeah,

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,789
these manufacturers aren't necessarily evil but to be clear, some of them are evil.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,539
Oh, totally unquestionably. Yes.

45
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:22,100
And some of them are just dumb and some of them are just, well, meaning schmucks.

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,550
My favorite example, being this guy who had an

47
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,869
stroller and, I mean, you know, I had twins so I had the duetto.

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,259
That thing is 900 bucks.

49
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,919
Right? Twin strollers are hideously expensive if they're any good.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,130
Yeah.

51
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,669
And the duetto it's like, not side by side,

52
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,669
side by side is garbage because they don't fit through doors.

53
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,720
I won't argue with you. But someday I'll explain to you.

54
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,550
-- there, there are some that do that but they are ridiculously expensive.
-- I know

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,300
there is this piece in his stroller that was made out of plastic

56
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:51,270
and it cracked and it was part of the wheel lock system.

57
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,350
And

58
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,869
when you know, for anybody that's ever had their kidney stroller, those,

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,350
those two locks on the back wheels, like

60
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,179
that's not an optional thing to have, right?

61
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:05,630
You're never going to park your kid on a perfectly flat surface, right?

62
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,729
This ain't Rick and Morty.

63
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,320
So he basically took the crack part out, tried gluing it together,

64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,039
that's not gonna work.

65
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,750
So he glued it together. 3D, scanned it, printed out a

66
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,550
metal version of it, popped it in off you go.

67
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,889
And I believe he got hit by AD MC A

68
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,330
takedown or whatever because he also published the part.

69
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:20,740
Oh

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,399
Thing of a

71
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,619
jigger

72
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,410
online.

73
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,570
Interesting

74
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,850
in many of these cases. Number one.

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,839
How do you even contact the manufacturer to buy that part?

76
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,690
Number two,

77
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,089
unless you have a manual with like an exploded diagram showing all the parts.

78
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,880
How do you like? This is my favorite thing. My parents used to own a 19

79
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,300
75 diesel Mercedes 300 diesel.

80
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,649
And the thing I most loved about the car were two things.

81
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,080
One, the air conditioning and that thing, I mean,

82
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,169
it probably made a hole in the ozone later about a kilometer wide.

83
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,729
But man, you could have kept beef in that car in summer.

84
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,600
And number two,

85
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,169
the Mercedes manual had exploded diagrams of everything like every nut and bolt.

86
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:01,649
That's epic. And I remember fantasizing always as a kid of taking the car apart,

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,990
but I was smart enough to know I couldn't put it back together.

88
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,119
That's a grounding right there.

89
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,740
-- Yeah,
-- that's probably going to get yelled at.

90
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,830
So how do you even know what part to ask for?

91
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:14,050
Let's reframe this all in the context of security because

92
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,470
an open source for that matter. So

93
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:19,630
we could go on and on and on about parts.

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,410
And I think that's something easy to understand as humans.

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,529
-- This leads to the second thing. Software is now apart.
-- We're getting to that.

96
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,450
So that makes it easy for us to understand as humans because we like physical things,

97
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,630
we can touch physical things, we feel like we can fix physical things,

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,839
but physical things basically are all just computers now.

99
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,279
And so the thing I keep thinking of in my brain

100
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,380
with bright for repair is how does software fit into this?

101
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,369
Because I've yet to see anyone discussing software

102
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,820
in the context of right to repair.

103
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,320
But I feel like in many cases,

104
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:54,339
the software is probably just as or more important than the physical stuff.

105
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,040
Ok. So we're going to stick to right to repair and not right to modify.

106
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,339
So we're going to ignore the whole

107
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,119
like car ECU hacking where you want to get your car to go faster.

108
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,109
So you get like some dodgy ec firmware that

109
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,670
essentially drives your engine faster, like more fuel, more air, whatever.

110
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,760
So let's ignore all that. Let's just stick with right repair.

111
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,350
So perfect example. Yeah,

112
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,309
cars nowadays obviously have a ton of software that runs everything right,

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,589
the the entertainment system, the lane assist,

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,339
-- they're computers with wheels
-- basically.

115
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,459
And so for example,

116
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,790
what happens if you find some failure scenario

117
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:31,000
that somehow you're competent enough to actually fix?

118
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,029
I mean, there's like what three people on the planet maybe

119
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,109
that can do this, but let's assume you're one of them.

120
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,190
Well, do you have a right, for example, to get to that source code?

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,700
Do you have a right, for example, or what if they're signing keys required? Right.

122
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,089
I mean, I'm pretty sure

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,269
that the automakers are going to look at this and pretty soon

124
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:51,109
start locking down the boot process just like the console makers did

125
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,369
for if nothing else,

126
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,799
maybe for just reliability so that people aren't

127
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,100
breaking their cars and then being like,

128
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:56,529
oh,

129
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,609
I did nothing at all. Weird to my car and it doesn't start now. So please fix it.

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,290
What?

131
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,040
Right. What did you do to your computer? Dad?

132
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing

133
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,420
like? Oh, ok. Nothing. Right.

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,820
What happened when it broke? Nothing. I wasn't touching it.

135
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,239
-- I wasn't even in the room.
-- That's right. That's right. Oh, look.

136
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,570
Anyway, I mean, this is a really interesting topic because

137
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,329
I think there's many angles, right.

138
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,570
There's the right to repair aspect, which is if I have an item,

139
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,309
I should be able to fix it or someone else should be able to fix it today.

140
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,929
That's very difficult now now.

141
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,209
But then there's the open source aspect which says I want

142
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,730
to buy a device and I want to hack on it

143
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,399
as much as I feel like

144
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,890
-- that from the perspective of tinkering. Not so much. Let's circumvent.
-- Yeah.

145
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,920
So that would be the right to modify.

146
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,709
And that's a very different thing than the right to repair, right.

147
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,950
But it's similar, oh, there's huge Venn diagram overlap here. Absolutely.

148
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,790
But from a legal point of view, I feel like from a legal point of view,

149
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:57,369
the right to repair is much easier to argue than the right to modify.

150
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,950
Well, I agree completely and I think that's easier,

151
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,329
but then there's still the security aspect of so from right to repair,

152
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,890
you can have people modifying things in dangerous ways or just the fact that,

153
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,260
let's say you have a computer that's 10 years

154
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,000
old and security updates stopped three years ago.

155
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,170
-- I mean, that's
-- dangerous.

156
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,350
Or you have a computer that's 10 years old and the hardware's

157
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,690
starting to flake out and you want to replace it with something.

158
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,450
Well, I mean, that happens anyway,

159
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,450
the point is so talking about right to repair in the context of physical goods.

160
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,200
Like if it's a washing machine, that's great.

161
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:31,350
-- But if it's a washing machine that they all
-- have software and control circuit book,

162
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:35,489
I actually had a friend who uh he was a Y2K consultant slash security consultant.

163
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,809
So pretty technical guy and uh one of the buttons on

164
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,309
his stove stopped working and it was like an important button.

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,170
It was like the thing to turn the oven on or whatever, right?

166
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:46,450
So it's not a button you can live without like resetting the clock. And basically

167
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,549
they had to, it was like a $500 repair

168
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,890
because you can't fix the button. You have to replace

169
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,079
the entire circuit board under the front of the stove.

170
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:01,730
Yeah, I, I had that, I bought a washing machine years ago and the power button

171
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,010
was like, it was set back too far and when you pushed it,

172
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,149
it cracked the like the front panel,

173
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,779
that little membrane

174
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,049
and it was brand new. So I called the manufacturer.

175
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,149
I'm like, hey, this happened, you know,

176
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,769
why don't you send someone out to fix it and the guy came out and, yeah,

177
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,829
he basically just took off the front panel, completely removed the computer.

178
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,269
Put a, like the computer board, put a brand new computer board in

179
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:24,029
and I was like,

180
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,174
-- this is bananas for one freaking button
-- from a cost perspective of fixing it.

181
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,885
That's way cheaper than having him de

182
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,585
solder the button and solder a new button on it.

183
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,494
-- Well,
-- I just thought they'd like, reseat the board or something, but no,

184
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,674
like he just literally removed the whole thing and put a whole brand new one in.

185
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,794
-- But
-- if he tries to fix it, then it may or may not work.

186
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,565
Whereas if I just take the module out and put a new module in, right?

187
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,335
Like look at the military and tanks. Perfect example, tanks. Now

188
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:50,799
they don't have an engine,

189
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,570
they have a power module that typically attaches with about 2 to 4 bolts or more.

190
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,530
And you literally just undo a bunch of bolts

191
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,979
and lift the thing out with a crane,

192
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,650
throw it away and put in a new one if it

193
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,250
gets damaged because you don't have time to fix it,

194
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,609
you need that tank to work now.

195
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,130
And so this is part of that whole value.

196
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,799
Engineering isn't just about, you know, making the product cheap.

197
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:09,729
So we make more money.

198
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,609
But it's about, for example, how do we make, if,

199
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,179
if the product does fail and needs to

200
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,130
be repaired because people expect their white goods,

201
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,765
you know, they appliances to be repaired.

202
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:18,526
Not, oh, you know, my fridge made a funny noise.

203
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,395
So time to throw it out and get a new one, you know, $2000 later.

204
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:25,156
And so this idea of modularity of just take the whole module out,

205
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,676
don't even try to fix it and just swap in a new one.

206
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,096
It's faster and it's more effective in the field repair.

207
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,455
I mean, probably in the big picture for these companies,

208
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,036
but we're talking about right to repair, which isn't big companies.

209
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:37,676
This is people like you and me and spending $500

210
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:41,156
replacing a computer versus 52 cents on a switch.

211
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,622
-- It is a very different story too
-- bad.

212
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:47,901
For example, car manufacturers no longer make engine blocks out of like steel.

213
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,661
They use some pretty exotic alloys and those engine blocks are not cheap.

214
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,372
So your engine block cracks because you do. God knows what?

215
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,661
Well, I'm sorry, but that new engine block is not going to be cheap.

216
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,861
Well, neither is the control panel in your stove.

217
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:00,052
Here's where your discussion,

218
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,521
I think starts falling apart a little bit

219
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,452
is the idea of this is manufacturers will supply

220
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:06,921
manuals that explain

221
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,208
in what's going on. They'll have, obviously there will be certain parts.

222
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,208
They sell certain parts.

223
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:14,078
They don't like, I don't think they're going to sell like a switch.

224
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:14,778
For example, you'd s

225
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,747
onto a board, but they'd probably sell the board but at the same time,

226
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,328
if I had a manual with the parts,

227
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:22,638
I would know like this is the switch I need to replace on this board.

228
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:23,288
You know what I mean?

229
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,607
You could send it to Luis Rossman who would, you know,

230
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,927
remove the surface mount components and put on new ones.

231
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:32,648
Sure. This is, I think an interesting thing to think about because from the

232
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:34,393
concept of being a company,

233
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,624
what you need to do is very different from being

234
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:39,354
a person who's maybe trying to repair their stuff.

235
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,874
-- We're
-- back to the law of large numbers.

236
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,633
I as a company am going to,

237
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,143
I know statistically I'm going to have to repair 10,000

238
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:46,934
of these washing machines over the next 10 years.

239
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:48,513
And I'm going to have to have people doing it out

240
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,674
in the field who may or may not be competent.

241
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:55,754
No one in the field is going to de solder parts who works as a repair person.

242
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:58,453
It's just not a valuable use of time.

243
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:00,153
Well, if it's even possible,

244
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,114
that is also very true.

245
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,419
So I, I think this right to repair legislation is a good start.

246
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,130
And I think what fundamentally is going to

247
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,229
have to happen is manufacturers are going to have

248
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,340
to integrate the idea of right to repair

249
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:17,859
into their business process as to how they design

250
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,520
and build these products.

251
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,739
I mean, I hope so.

252
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,979
I feel like now, now I want to also clarify that this legislation is imperfect,

253
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,380
but it is the first step in a very long,

254
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,780
-- all legislation is imperfect
-- and it always starts terrible.

255
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,390
But I think this is an important change of direction because

256
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,859
I am weary

257
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,369
of just having to throw things away constantly.

258
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,309
So, here's a question,

259
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,820
I'm actually just holding my Swiss army knife and it's

260
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,619
the bottom of the one side is chipped off.

261
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,900
At what point does

262
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,919
the Swiss Army knife? People say, like that knife is more than 20 years old.

263
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,390
-- We don't carry those parts f
-- off.

264
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,630
They haven't, they been using the same parts for like 100 years in those things.

265
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,559
Well, it's, you know, it's not like the, I don't know

266
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:06,450
right

267
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,090
there. I mean, there are products that are virtually timeless

268
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:14,611
-- and I think the Swiss Army knives are one of them, for
-- example, you know,

269
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:18,791
-- are shoe manufacturers going to be expected to carry an inventory of
-- soles.

270
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:23,572
I don't know what the legislation says about how long they have to carry parts for.

271
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:28,312
-- I guarantee there is some limits on this, but I don't know what they are.
-- Yeah.

272
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,372
Like what if they only make 500 extras?

273
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,812
And they're like, well, we ran out and we're not making any more.

274
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:37,091
Does the law have some recourse for that? Where? Ok. You know, now you have to

275
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:39,914
-- refund them or something.
-- I don't know the answer to that.

276
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,484
But look, I guarantee it's,

277
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:46,254
if it isn't addressed it will be soon because that's like,

278
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:50,754
it's idiotic to expect a company to continue making parts for the end of time.

279
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,203
Right. That doesn't make any sense.

280
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:57,254
And at the same time there is something to be said about a company that's like, oh,

281
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,213
it's been three months, sorry, we're all out.

282
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:02,434
-- Like, that's obviously ridiculous. Also
-- fast fashion. Right.

283
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:03,693
There, there are many

284
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,815
glasses of products now

285
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,346
that are meant to only really exist for weeks or months.

286
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:13,015
Fast fashion being sort of a very extreme example of this.

287
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,406
I'm trying to think of from an electronics point of view.

288
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:20,736
Are there any electronics that kind of are meant to be very kind of ephemeral almost.

289
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,325
There's loads of electronics that are meant to be ephemeral.

290
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:23,606
I mean,

291
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,096
so one of my favorite examples and I hate these things are those

292
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,995
you can buy those greeting cards or like birthday cards at the store,

293
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:30,846
you open them up, they play a little song

294
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,978
and then you throw them away and it's like that is

295
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:36,278
the most ridiculous waste of resources anyone has ever created.

296
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,617
I think reading cards in general. But

297
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,817
that's a separate discussion.

298
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,208
But regardless that's why people with kids, you just give them a piece of paper,

299
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,728
like free greeting cards, you can't be there.

300
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:50,237
You know what I mean? There's plenty of products that fall kind of in that category

301
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:54,117
where it is clearly going to be thrown away almost immediately.

302
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:58,098
And so purchasing them and using them is an annoying waste of resources.

303
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,400
Yeah, I, like I said, I,

304
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,140
the legislation doesn't exist in a vacuum, right?

305
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,780
The manufacturers have to start thinking about this and taking this into account.

306
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:11,299
And I think the brutal truth is this will mostly happen and be effective at the

307
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,489
levels of more expensive products that actually have

308
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,960
sort of discrete components and modules and systems.

309
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,789
Like say a car or white goods.

310
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,460
I mean, to a degree my IOT light bulb,

311
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:25,929
how much would it cost to pay somebody to take IO light bulb apart de

312
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,080
solder, a component, fix it and put the thing back together again.

313
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,500
-- I mean,
-- it would cost way more than the light bulb for sure. Like if you paid someone.

314
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,400
Yeah, absolutely.

315
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,070
I mean, so now here's another thing to think about though is so this is where Europe,

316
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,020
I love Europe when you buy, like we'll say household appliances, Europe is the best.

317
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,520
They do some things really well. So one of my favorite examples is

318
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,479
I was in the market for, you know,

319
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:51,619
those little like hand mixer things where it's like you fold it in your hand.

320
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,619
It's got the two little spinny things on it.

321
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,880
-- The thing
-- that's called literally a hand mixer.

322
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,109
-- I don't, people don't
-- know.

323
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,619
I, I actually just bought a new one from.

324
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,030
-- Don't know what it's called.
-- You don't

325
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:00,849
mix.

326
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,530
Ok, great.

327
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:02,219
So

328
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,049
we are, we use it a lot usually to make,

329
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,179
we'll say difficult things like mashed potatoes is an easy example and,

330
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,700
and we burn them out pretty quick.

331
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,429
And I was looking into this and in Europe they are required to have a multi

332
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,039
year warranty on

333
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,809
-- items like this. And so
-- well, the whole fit for purpose.

334
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,570
Right. Right.

335
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,890
And so I was, I was researching these and basically if I bought like,

336
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,190
the quality of the European mixers versus

337
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,349
the United States mixers is drastically different.

338
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,750
My mom's brown

339
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,429
is older than me.

340
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,190
No, that's it. Like, that's all I have to say.

341
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,580
Like my mom has a hand mixer that was actually made in West Germany,

342
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,950
which doesn't exist anymore.

343
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,219
And that brown will probably be used by my great

344
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,012
-- grandchildren someday to make mashed potatoes
-- in all seriousness.

345
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:45,771
Part of me is like,

346
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:48,952
I should put a 220 volt plug in my kitchen so

347
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:53,572
I can buy European appliances because they will last forever.

348
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,632
It's just, but like this is frustrating to me that, that

349
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,572
this stuff.

350
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,252
And anyway, anyway, we're in a rattle.

351
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,252
And actually, no,

352
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:02,031
that's a perfect example of because back in

353
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,611
the day making stuff was hard and expensive.

354
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,771
So making it really good, didn't actually cost that much more.

355
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,651
But then we got value engineering and for example, you know,

356
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:13,244
the machinist out of BC that takes stuff apart and shows

357
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,393
you these motors and these roller skate bearings and stuff,

358
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:15,773
right.

359
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:19,443
They the innards of these system of these power drills and,

360
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:23,013
and I think he actually does do a hand mixer at some point are so cheap.

361
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:23,914
It's amazing.

362
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:26,314
-- Yeah, they're full of plastic gears and stuff.
-- It's,

363
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,513
or nylon gears or laser centered anyways.

364
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:35,314
But the point is you go and you can get a decent hand mixer for 20 bucks. Not 200

365
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,593
so part of what I,

366
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:39,375
I love and hate about this repairability thing too is we've

367
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,606
driven down the cost of manufacturing so much that we've literally

368
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,875
gotten to the point where Amazon is even doing this now

369
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:48,026
where they're saying on certain items that are like below,

370
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:50,255
I think it's like 10 or 15 bucks or are bulky

371
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:52,556
and expenses to ship when it comes to handling returns,

372
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,666
our response is going to be here's your money back,

373
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:57,736
you can throw the item away or donate it to charity or we don't care.

374
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:00,125
We're just, we're not dealing with it. It's just not worth our time.

375
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,106
And this has led to this whole situation

376
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,445
where you have all these disposable products that

377
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,229
it's not that they can't be repaired.

378
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,910
I mean, and actually a lot of them can't be repaired.

379
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,750
It's that they're not worth being repaired. It's just economically makes no sense.

380
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,189
It literally would be cheaper to buy a new one than to fix it.

381
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,569
This is a security podcast and we've gone off into the weeds horribly. I think so.

382
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,829
I want to, I want to reel this back in.

383
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,280
This sounds a lot like the security we have versus the security we want.

384
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,949
-- It kind
-- of is actually, I mean, that's,

385
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,310
that's one of the things I wanted to bring up is the

386
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,420
fact that if we think about this in the context of software,

387
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,706
right, how often in software is it not worth fixing a problem?

388
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:37,286
Or how often in software is it easier to rip something out and replace it?

389
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:40,206
And how often in software does something just age out? It's like too bad.

390
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:40,885
It's, it's old.

391
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:45,286
-- Well,
-- how often in software do people rather than maintaining the old junk,

392
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:49,776
write something new, lose some backwards compatibility but lose

393
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,176
a lot of technical debt.

394
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,475
Like, well, a perfect example is computer languages, right?

395
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,115
Pearl Pearl was amazing.

396
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,485
And now it's a dead end despite the fact that it keeps lurching along like a zombie,

397
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,475
you know, then Python came along.

398
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,572
Python's doing pretty good.

399
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,521
But now we've got even better stuff like,

400
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,802
well and better is a subjective word here clearly

401
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:05,671
because people are going to yell at me.

402
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:07,791
But things like no Js or Rust, you know,

403
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,472
like some of the stuff Microsoft is doing with.

404
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:13,521
-- Rust is kind of amazing.
-- Rust is really cool. I like rust a lot.

405
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,312
Part of it too is do we want to repair these old things and keep them chugging along?

406
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,021
Like a perfect example being cars,

407
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,562
you don't want to keep cars more than 2030 years

408
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:24,521
old on the road in general because they pollute so much

409
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,797
compared to a modern car and ignoring all safety systems

410
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,878
and anti lock brakes and airbags and maybe even seatbelts.

411
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:36,458
My argument as well is going to be from the security angle is old things,

412
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,937
which is old software.

413
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:40,517
In the case of even a device hooked up to the internet

414
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,397
is going to be dangerous because it isn't going to be,

415
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,397
even if you can update the software.

416
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,047
There are,

417
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,037
let's pretend you can.

418
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:49,657
But I mean,

419
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:54,364
like in the silicon there's changes that have made things more secure for

420
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:57,894
the last 20 plus years and you won't get any of that stuff.

421
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,604
-- It was funny
-- when I was at the hospital, I noticed on my IV pole, like,

422
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,053
because it had so it basically had a battery pack,

423
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:07,573
a sort of control unit and then a pump unit and they kind of click together,

424
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,543
sit on the pole, you know, so that they can say, you know,

425
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:14,413
dispense the 500 mL of this over the next 27 minutes at this flow rate, blah, blah,

426
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:14,854
blah, blah, blah.

427
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:19,323
Anyways, it had a couple of stickers on it, you know, inventory control and you know,

428
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,504
this, this thing is a battery.

429
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,563
So charge it once in a while

430
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,869
and one was mandatory software upgrade needed. September 2020. 0, interesting.

431
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,430
And I was like, huh, I wonder if that software upgrade happened or not,

432
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:33,900
-- I was
-- going to say, is that there because they didn't do it, or

433
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:38,709
now I would also say that anything that says mandatory software update,

434
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,910
I would probably not touch with a very long poll right

435
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,030
now just because of the current state of the medical system.

436
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,619
Oh, yeah. No,

437
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,790
I would be like, we're going to just wait a little while on this.

438
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:52,326
And II, I don't think it attaches to the internet.

439
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,086
Everything attaches to the internet now. Don't kid yourself.

440
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,586
Well, no, no, no, this, this thing looked old enough that I don't, maybe it didn't.

441
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,615
Yeah. No, I just,

442
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,836
well, and that's the second part of the right to repair is the right to repair.

443
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:07,115
Assumes that you're actually going to repair it and make it better,

444
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,526
not break it permanently.

445
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:13,745
-- I mean,
-- well, there's a lot of repairs that don't end very well, we'll say,

446
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,326
but that's on you for attempting it.

447
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:21,281
I have the number of things I have broken while trying to fix them is probably

448
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,092
larger than the number of things I've actually fixed if I was going to guess.

449
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:26,192
But I'm ok with that too.

450
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:30,192
Yeah, I would say, I mean, I actually have had some, like, for example,

451
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:33,131
my washer started making a horrendous noise and so I kind of opened it

452
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:36,911
up and there's just this giant concrete block bolted to the top of it.

453
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:39,942
So when it's spinning really fast, you know, the laundry flies upwards and

454
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,342
the concrete block dampens the

455
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:43,171
momentum

456
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:47,047
just tighten the bolts because somehow the bolts had gotten loose. And I,

457
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,157
well, I know how the bolts got loose, probably because I overfilled the darn thing,

458
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,828
repeatedly bolts loosen.

459
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:53,218
-- Like it's just what happens
-- to bolt.

460
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:53,417
Well,

461
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:57,258
-- now I don't overfill my washer and it's not been a problem
-- but

462
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:59,598
it's going to loosen up someday even if you don't overfill it.

463
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,897
-- And
-- the thing is now, I actually know how to fix it quickly. Right.

464
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:02,677
So I'll hear that noise,

465
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:02,988
Wanka, Wanka,

466
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:03,767
Wanka.

467
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,628
And I'll be like, oh, I gotta go get my socket set, you know, 10 mil,

468
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:07,368
because everything,

469
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:09,478
that's something I find so weird is like almost every bolt

470
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:11,037
is 10 mil except for all the ones that aren't.

471
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,650
Yeah, that's how it works.

472
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,599
-- Although you live in Canada, which is a civilized country, unlike everything
-- is,

473
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,030
-- I say e here,
-- there's, you know,

474
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,189
what's funny is most things are metric now and I get annoyed

475
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,000
when,

476
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,500
well, ok, ignoring building supplies. But

477
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:30,810
like when I, when I work on some sort of mechanical device,

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,869
it's virtually all metric. And I get annoyed when my,

479
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,410
because I always just get the metric sockets and the metric wrenches right away.

480
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,035
And then when they don't work, I'm like, oh, for crying out loud.

481
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,104
Now, I have to go get the stupid.

482
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:45,334
And the worst part about English units is like, ok, this is a 7/16 wrench.

483
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,415
I need the next highest wrench up. What is that?

484
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,494
I have no idea

485
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:54,864
-- in my brain. I
-- just keep trying wrenches to one fits. Like, I literally don't know.

486
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,625
32. Si, don't know, whatever.

487
00:21:56,635 --> 00:22:01,185
But like, in metric though the 10 doesn't fit, I'll try the 11, the 11 doesn't fit,

488
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:05,145
-- I'll try the
-- 12 and eventually you get to like 31 and you're like, what the heck.

489
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:06,145
Yeah, exactly.

490
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:06,949
But

491
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:12,699
-- anyway, anyway,
-- I was just so annoyed to find out that Sae is not imperial.

492
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,709
-- What do you mean? It's not imperial
-- standard?

493
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:19,099
Automotive engineering is not imperial, half inch Sae is not half inch imperial.

494
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,339
It's slightly different.

495
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,390
Yeah.

496
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:21,750
Why

497
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,140
-- I don't get that. That's just
-- how it works.

498
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,209
Yeah,

499
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,660
because I just assumed Sae was like the standard for the tools,

500
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,209
not the standard for the sizes.

501
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,949
No standard. Automotive engineering.

502
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,885
Imperial is different than like imperial imperial,

503
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:39,775
like half inch Sae is basically half inch imperial but not exactly.

504
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:43,074
Anyway, whatever, whatever, I don't care. Imperial units are terrible

505
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:43,564
and

506
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:47,854
I hate them all anyway, whatever, whatever we're talking about two by four.

507
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:48,895
What are we talking about?

508
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:50,685
So, back to this, I think,

509
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:53,165
I think what we've decided upon is that

510
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:56,665
it's complicated and that essentially the consumers,

511
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,814
the regulators, the manufacturers, heck, even the companies sell

512
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,680
this stuff are going to have to figure a lot out and going

513
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,630
back to your example of buying something that's quality and fit for purpose.

514
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,040
Again,

515
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,109
this is why I'm trying to buy like all my tvs

516
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,930
and stuff from Costco because Costco does a one year.

517
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:14,770
We don't care. Here's your money. Get out of my face, go shop.

518
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,609
And so basically everything Costco sells, you know, bathtub failure rate.

519
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,930
It's going to fail in the 1st 3090 days or whatever.

520
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,170
-- And I think they even sell an extended warranty.
-- They do.

521
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,390
I buy their extended warranties because my TV S always fail in three years.

522
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,765
Which is that right after the manufacturer's warranty.

523
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,275
But now I have my Costco warranty.

524
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,094
So that's perfect because basically I can buy it

525
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:34,785
at Costco and one of two things will happen,

526
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:37,395
one, I will either get a quality product and be happy or two.

527
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:40,564
I will not get a quality product, but Costco will make me happy, problem solved.

528
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:41,114
I'm happy.

529
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:41,954
-- But
-- anyway, anyway,

530
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,645
the whole reason I wanted to talk about this and we really

531
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,885
have not talked about near as much as I'd like is just,

532
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:48,484
I love repairing things.

533
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,204
But as a security person,

534
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,864
I'm mortified by the thought of having something

535
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,984
connected to the internet for 30 years.

536
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:55,494
Yeah.

537
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,510
-- And right. I mean, yeah, it's the only answer to that.
-- No. Absolutely.

538
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,310
You know, and I, I just bought New

539
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,270
Globe

540
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,750
Iot light bulbs at Costco last year.

541
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,900
You know,

542
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,750
I bought actually an entire case of them because here's the other thing is I

543
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,109
realized at some 0.1 or two of these bulbs will probably fail and burn out.

544
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,910
What do I replace them with? I have to replace them with the exact same bulb.

545
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,260
-- So I can use the app
-- if you buy a bulb today and you buy a bulb in a year.

546
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,369
Are they going to look the same?

547
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,430
Because if you have a lamp with two light bulbs

548
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,213
in it and one of different than the other.

549
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:26,953
Well, yeah. Yeah, they might be using totally different set of LEDs

550
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,572
from some other manufacturer that are off by half a percent.

551
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,552
I'm banking on Phillips not having this problem.

552
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:33,243
And if they do,

553
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:37,973
I'm going to weep tears of having spent too much money on light bulbs for no reason.

554
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:40,593
Yeah. But I mean, like, and that's part of the right.

555
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:45,233
This is, there's just, this is such a crazy topic with all this stuff.

556
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:47,133
And then the security person in me,

557
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:50,052
I feel like I'm locked in a cage in my own head screaming, let me

558
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:51,526
because

559
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:55,316
I love right to repair and I hate old devices on the internet.

560
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,135
And it's like, I, I don't know what to say.

561
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:00,135
Even I think part of the problem is even OK, think about this.

562
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:04,995
An incandescent light bulb is literally about a simple and I don't mean simple,

563
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:05,406
simple.

564
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:08,365
I mean simple conceptually because actually making a vacuum in a

565
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:14,946
glass thing is, is super nontrivial. But conceptually, it's simple. You have a, a

566
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:15,946
wire

567
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:16,995
with a filament

568
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,449
that you run electrons through and it glows that. Right.

569
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,930
Like I just explained how ink and doesn't light bulbs work

570
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,949
basically. Now, how do my globe light bulbs work?

571
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,589
They have Wi Fi, they have multicolored Led S

572
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,650
the Magic

573
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,020
-- and an app and they have a software app
-- and they, they run,

574
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,589
they probably run Linux or something too.

575
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,130
I would hope so. The, the difference in complexity is not

576
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,319
one or two or 10 times complexity. The difference in complexity is

577
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,089
throwing a rock at somebody's head

578
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,449
and calling in an airstrike.

579
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,150
Yeah, that's probably fair.

580
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,510
It's literally the degree of difference in complexity.

581
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,410
I don't know that I comprehend it and I

582
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,839
think that's part of the problem is everything.

583
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,010
Got that complicated. Your washer and dryer.

584
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,849
-- Now,
-- my washer and dryer, I specifically bought the,

585
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,869
the Speed Queen washer and dryer,

586
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,339
which are like twice the price of normal washers and dryers.

587
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:11,229
But they have like, no, I don't think they even have a computer in them.

588
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,290
I think it's all just like analog circuits.

589
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,390
They basically,

590
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:17,239
the only you can sell them is if there's someone who can repair

591
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,890
them who lives within like a 30 mile radius of the store.

592
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,410
So, like,

593
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,069
I can 100% use this washer and dryer for the rest of my life and just keep repairing it,

594
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,369
which pleases me to death

595
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,449
anyway, here's,

596
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,670
here's a point I want to focus on for kind of the end of this is

597
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,579
you raise a good point that the complexity

598
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:37,630
has become infinitely greater on virtually all products.

599
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,170
And the reason for this is fundamentally software.

600
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,739
So from the security perspective, do we see the complexity

601
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,229
de we see

602
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,250
due to something like right to repair or do we think it's just going to be a well,

603
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,329
good luck everybody.

604
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:50,849
And we're going to ignore the software.

605
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,099
The software is also subject to the value engineering and the cutting costs.

606
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,349
And for example,

607
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:59,719
is it just cheaper to have the software talk to some mothership in the cloud

608
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:03,369
and have the app talk to a mothership in the cloud rather than trying to build

609
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,170
something that will work locally,

610
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,900
but also somehow magically work remotely without a gateway.

611
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:11,619
And the answer is, of course not, you just have the mothership in the cloud.

612
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:12,650
And so

613
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:19,520
essentially, I suspect the software is subject to market and economic forces that

614
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,219
essentially doom us to crap and things like,

615
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,849
you know,

616
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,229
globe shuts down their servers in the cloud

617
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:28,020
and my light bulbs don't do anything fancy

618
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,920
other than turn off and on if I turn the power to them off and on?

619
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,260
Right.

620
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,449
Because why would software not be subject to the

621
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:36,770
same forces of business that the physical stuff is?

622
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,609
Well, I think the right to repair is going to change that conversation though.

623
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,780
Well, for example, how does the right to repair affect servers in the cloud?

624
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,219
That are needed to run this stuff.

625
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:48,130
I mean, I don't know, to interact with it and use the more advanced functions.

626
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,010
I haven't seen anything in what

627
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:52,452
read in. Right. To repair that covers this.

628
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,452
I imagine we're going to have to, the legislation's going to have to change, to

629
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:57,452
accommodate it.

630
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:00,251
-- Is my guess
-- they have to run the servers or do they have to

631
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,671
give me a copy of the software so I can run the servers?

632
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,421
I mean, that's a really good question. I don't know the answer to that.

633
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:06,732
And more importantly,

634
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:10,102
what if there's encryption keys that the light bulb talks to the?

635
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:11,212
Like, what do you do now?

636
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,891
How do you, you know, it's, this is,

637
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,651
here's how I'm going to end this from the security perspective.

638
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,612
I think our historical response to hard,

639
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:20,063
like this is to throw our hands in the air

640
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:21,254
and declare

641
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:22,404
whatever

642
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,933
everything is terrible. There's nothing we can do.

643
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:28,874
But like these are good and legitimate questions to be asking

644
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:31,093
and it's ok that we don't have answers to it.

645
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:35,213
-- It's, it's,
-- I'm also pretty sure like light bulbs are not some corner case.

646
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:35,634
Well,

647
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:37,984
everyone buys light bulbs but not everyone

648
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:40,333
buys light bulbs with an operating system,

649
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,774
-- but
-- it's becoming quite common.

650
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:45,213
It is becoming more common anyway. Anyway. All right, we are

651
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:50,566
at a time. I will let you end this what I will best call a bizarre conversation

652
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:52,336
almost related to.

653
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:53,026
Right. Or

654
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:53,656
there.

655
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:57,895
I like the idea that they're trying something

656
00:28:57,906 --> 00:29:01,875
new that has good intentions and I suspect

657
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,656
may actually have a good outcome.

658
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:05,485
Like, I don't,

659
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,845
I don't think there will be some horrible second order effect where we end up,

660
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:12,286
you know, dooming the world to zombie plague because of this right to repair bill.

661
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,897
I don't think so. I think it is the first step

662
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:17,498
in a place

663
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,937
that we should be.

664
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:20,738
I'm also going to point out not just Europe

665
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:23,527
benefits from this because I like in theory,

666
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:23,657
yeah,

667
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,748
you could go to Europe and buy some appliances

668
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:27,197
or whatever and bring them back with you.

669
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:31,878
Maybe I actually knew a guy whose mother had this shoebox sized

670
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:35,998
voltage converter because she had a proper like Asian rice cooker.

671
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:36,348
That

672
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:37,848
that's it.

673
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:40,258
You know what I want. I want, I miss the kettle

674
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,060
had when I stayed in London

675
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,619
-- that I will give the British
-- that 200 and 20 volt kettle.

676
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,619
That thing could boil water in a frighteningly short amount of time.

677
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,579
And I, my mom's German. So I'm used to this thing called an Insync

678
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,050
orator, not the grinder, but it's an actual

679
00:29:55,219 --> 00:30:00,260
hot water boiling. Like it keeps about 2 to 4 L of almost boiling hot water.

680
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,900
You turn the tap and it runs it through a little heater. So you get

681
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,500
like I grew up as a kid if I wanted boiling water, I,

682
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,010
-- I literally turned the tap on
-- every now and then I

683
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:09,531
think about getting one of those,

684
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,141
-- but then I look at how much effort
-- they're not that expensive.

685
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:13,521
The problem is an expense.

686
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:17,442
-- It's like getting all the right stuff to hook it up correctly. Dude, it's
-- easy.

687
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:20,501
-- It's just you put a tap into the cold water line and
-- electrical,

688
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,822
but you need like 220 volts for them, don't you?

689
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:26,391
Maybe

690
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:26,921
I should insulated

691
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:30,342
-- and it just keeps the water hot.
-- Anyway. Anyway, it is time to go.

692
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:31,472
