00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,150
It's December 25th. We made it,

1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,170
actually, at this point, we finished recording,

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,060
I still have to edit 25 podcast episodes. So,

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,110
-- yeah,
-- it's like pie. If you cut it into small pieces, it doesn't, it's not as filling.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,629
Obviously. That's right. Exactly. Anyway, Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,760
Merry Christmas to you and happy holidays I believe is the generic for everything.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,010
Now,

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,510
whatever. I don't care.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,110
I don't care if I, if I, if I

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,600
-- offend you send me, hate me. You know what? And
-- if you're working today, thank you.

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,479
-- Because
-- seriously, that sucks.

11
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,959
We need nurses, policemen, food,

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,959
food is good to people. I agree. And you are appreciated and seen.

13
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:42,880
-- So
-- why do we do some things? I'll be honest.

14
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,520
Most of the things I do is because I'm either tired or hungry,

15
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,200
but that doesn't even make sense what we've got to set this up.

16
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,799
-- Well, that's why I do things like, can't just start
-- talking.

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,779
I mean, ok, we'll say you were up late last night because it's Christmas day today.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,439
-- So obviously you're tired.
-- But

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,119
so why

20
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,130
do some things?

21
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,090
Let me, let me, let me frame this

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,810
when many of us in North America and Europe celebrate Christmas.

23
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,050
We have a story that a man breaks into our house,

24
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:11,410
eats our cookies and leaves behind gifts if you have

25
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,959
behaved as a child over the course of the year,

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,080
even though most kids are rotten and deserve nothing.

27
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,180
Why do we do that?

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,050
Well, wait, is he also the man who folds our toilet paper into triangle points?

29
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:23,819
Does he? No one folds my toilet paper into triangle points.

30
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,599
You should demand a higher level of service.

31
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:27,970
Yeah,

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,739
I am the higher level of service in many instances.

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,419
-- So no,
-- the thing for me about the story of Santa Claus is

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,099
I like the idea of aspiring to be a good

35
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,250
person and to being well behaved and to being kind.

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,599
And I,

37
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,930
so I think stories that help people embrace these values

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,839
are probably not the worst thing in the world.

39
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,190
Yeah, I mean you can make that argument.

40
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:54,224
-- The actual mechanics of the story. Yeah, they're bonkers.
-- It's,

41
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,815
-- it's pretty nuts.
-- A perfect example.

42
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,864
Santa would have to travel at such a speed to get all the houses to be

43
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:01,495
covered

44
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:01,875
in

45
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:04,125
-- detail
-- because it would basically be worse than that

46
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:07,415
Pluto slam missile that they developed in the seventies,

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,619
right? And, and if you don't know what we're talking about, we'll put a link.

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,460
But this it was this horrifying nuclear weapon that essentially

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,850
did as much destruction by just flying around at mach

50
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,240
10 or something stupid as well as the nukes on board. And so

51
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
when you think about Santa,

52
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,440
it's like this stranger breaks into your house

53
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,020
and eat your food and leaves presents.

54
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,509
If you only if you've been good.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,279
It, that, that's nuts.

56
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,240
Right? When people do that, we, we call the police.

57
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,889
So I want to tie this into security though, in the context of

58
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,869
there are certain

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,029
stories we tell in certain ways we behave

60
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:40,990
that

61
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,179
obviously have some bizarre historical context that has been forgotten.

62
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,429
And now we just do it.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,529
And

64
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,270
I think this is like,

65
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,699
passwords are an easy example where we just did it the way we did it.

66
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,690
And now we literally have people saying don't do it that way because it doesn't work.

67
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,490
And the people who gave us the original advice are saying,

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,940
don't do it that way because it doesn't work.

69
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,490
And I still encounter people on a regular basis that are like, well,

70
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I think we should still change passwords every month.

71
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,660
And it's like, well, I don't even know what to tell you.

72
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,649
-- You
-- want to hear the worst thing. Stupid tradition.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,940
July 1st in Quebec is moving day.

74
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,979
That is to tradition, not a legal requirement, but by tradition,

75
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,649
that is the day when people move

76
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:20,800
-- one day a year is when you move.
-- Why? That doesn't make sense.

77
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:25,779
It began as a humanitarian measure of the French colonial government of New France.

78
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,369
So that's going pack a ways blah, blah blah, citing a 1750 bylaw, blah, blah, blah.

79
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,666
So the the point is, it's a 250 year old tradition that is just makes life horrible

80
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:39,166
because literally every moving company is busy for about two days of the year.

81
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,906
-- So
-- just move a different day. Won't that be easier?

82
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,296
Most landlords won't allow it.

83
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,335
Seriously.

84
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,845
Most people sign a one year lease.

85
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,156
-- Jeez
-- Louise,

86
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,626
you read up on it and it's just bonkers.

87
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:51,276
I just sign

88
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,022
like a third.

89
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:57,391
I actually, there was, I rented an apartment long ago where I signed a 13 month lease,

90
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,432
which was marvelous.

91
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,611
-- Actually, it was quite nice because I basically,
-- yeah,

92
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,972
because it gives you a month to move out.

93
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:05,352
Yeah, I had like a whole month to move. It was great. But anyway, brilliant. Anyway,

94
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,972
-- it was like, so the
-- point is, I mean,

95
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,772
we do things because we do things because our

96
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,582
ancestors did these things and they didn't die.

97
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,072
So obviously these are good things to do.

98
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,072
I mean,

99
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,830
like they were

100
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,100
like,

101
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,500
I think security is the perfect example of we are not a

102
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,459
species that has evolved to deal with the threats we have today.

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,609
Like, I'm really good at seeing a lion in the grass.

104
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:32,100
I'm really bad at seeing fishing, email, fishing. Right. Exactly.

105
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:36,036
And I mean, I don't know if we ever will evolve necessarily, but I feel like

106
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,156
it is a good idea,

107
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:42,115
especially on a day like today to remind everybody

108
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:47,876
that it is good and OK to literally question everything you do

109
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:52,406
every day to say, why am I doing this? If I don't do this, what happens?

110
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:53,015
You know what?

111
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:53,635
And that's,

112
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,955
that's a problem though because most people don't have that kind of energy.

113
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,532
They're too busy surviving.

114
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:02,941
-- And
-- that's a good point that, I mean, I feel that on a regular basis where I have, like,

115
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:06,171
when's the last time you optimized and reorganized your kitchen

116
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:11,071
-- cabinets? The answer is never,
-- I had a kitchen remodel last year. So.

117
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:12,041
Well, so you basically,

118
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:14,411
-- what you're saying is you burned it all down and started
-- fresh?

119
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,742
-- I did. And it was lovely.
-- Exactly.

120
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:20,332
So, how come you haven't optimized it and reorganized it since?

121
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,532
Because I'm happy with it.

122
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,812
Well, and that's part of what I love about human beings is the way we can post

123
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:29,980
decision, rationalize that this was the pair of shoes I wanted,

124
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,529
even though the pair I really wanted wasn't

125
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,929
in stock because otherwise we'd go insane.

126
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,809
-- I mean,
-- that's normal. Yeah,

127
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,089
I agree. We would, we would.

128
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,049
And

129
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:43,790
I, I, so I deal with this problem at, at work where I have

130
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,450
like a fire hose of stuff that comes in.

131
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,130
So, what you're saying is you have a white collar job.

132
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,029
I,

133
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,750
yeah.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,260
Well, I've started trying to automate as much as I can, which is hard though because

135
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:02,720
spending time building robots to do my job means I if I'm busy doing my job,

136
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,510
I don't have time to build the robots to do my job.

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,880
-- And so it's like this crazy circular madness.
-- It's the red queen.

138
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,970
-- You have to run to stay in place. Yes.
-- Seriously.

139
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,549
So, anyway, anyway, we're out of time. It is Christmas.

140
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,619
We should get back to spending the day with

141
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,429
our families and I apologize to anyone listening to

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,529
-- us
-- or your friends or your loved ones or you know what if you want to be alone?

143
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,450
-- That's ok too.
-- That's true. I envy you.

144
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:27,589
I've had several Christmases where I spent them alone and it was quite ok.

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,109
-- And it
-- sounds lovely right

146
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,010
-- now. Others where it wasn't. But that's
-- life. Indeed.

147
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,049
Indeed. So let's, let's call it. Thank you.

148
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,989
Everyone who made it this far on this bizarre and ridiculous journey.

149
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,000
-- I'm sorry. There was no chocolates in the little
-- doors. There are no choc.

150
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,970
Well, it's not chocolate cart,

151
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:48,420
I

152
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,239
guess. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

153
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,820
Have a good year. Everybody.
