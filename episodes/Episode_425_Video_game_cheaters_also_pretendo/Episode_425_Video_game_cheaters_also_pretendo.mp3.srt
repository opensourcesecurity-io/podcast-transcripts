0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,340
We were watching some cookie shows and the way

1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,210
they say some of the words that are French.

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:07,869
If you would like someday, I will take a map of the state of Wisconsin

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,789
and I will walk you through

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,329
how we pronounce the French names

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,250
and you will probably be weeping less than five minutes into that conversation.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,989
The Midwest took it to the next level.

7
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,149
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself. Kurt

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,829
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah. Back to Thought Crime.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,590
Yeah.

11
00:00:34,849 --> 00:00:37,240
Well, it's, it's interesting because I've, I've actually, um, well, the,

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,459
the show topic today is video games and cheating

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,020
to some degree and I've also been working on

14
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:45,080
cheating in general because we're preparing for the release

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,750
of the new CCS KV five stuff in summer.

16
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,310
And of course, that means a new exam.

17
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:50,389
Oh, right.

18
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,744
Well, I mean, at this point, every technical exam on the planet has like,

19
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:55,775
exam question dumps and like

20
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,264
cheating because

21
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:00,185
people want to get these certifications and not

22
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:01,104
study.

23
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:03,935
No, that's it like that, that, that's it. That's human nature.

24
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:07,224
Like humans have been cheating literally their whole lives. For the most part.

25
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:11,385
I mean, there's cases of small Children cheating on tests. Yeah.

26
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:15,805
Well, and I get it like, II, I am blessed in that. I am really good at multiple choice.

27
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:16,404
Like I'm,

28
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,525
I have really good

29
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,180
and I'm just like, no, I can

30
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:19,860
like II,

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,120
I did my M CS E plus internet back in the day by

32
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:25,220
reading those little red exam prep books and I would read it twice

33
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:26,440
and then I'd go write the exam

34
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,260
and I had a sort of enough practical knowledge around networking and windows,

35
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,139
especially that I could just grind.

36
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,660
I ground through like eight or nine exams in a period of like +23 months.

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,680
And I met people that were also taking those exams and

38
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,099
had paid like $20,000 for the boot camps to take them.

39
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,839
And I'm just like, whoa, ouch. Like, can't you just read this book and write

40
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,995
it? Apparently not. Anyway,

41
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,654
I've been thinking about cheating a lot and like, what can we do to well,

42
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:52,224
incentivize good behavior, disincentivize bad behavior,

43
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,805
make it harder for the cheaters, kind of punish them.

44
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:59,394
And this came across hacker news. It's the guy's name. Le oh, Liam Neeson.

45
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:03,254
No, Liam Neeson's arm. Sorry, Liam Neeson's arm.

46
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:03,775
Right.

47
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:08,875
I don't know if it's the left or right one. It doesn't matter. Some user on hacker news

48
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:09,854
could be an A I

49
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,259
anyways. He, he made a searchable public database of cheaters and video games.

50
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,759
Which I find kind of interesting sort of, it has two pages of cheaters. So

51
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,380
it's called the Toxic Gaming Database.

52
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,729
It calls itself a community driven public database

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,110
of toxic gamers based on reported evidence.

54
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,889
And I went to it and I browsed many of the

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,330
reports. I don't call these things

56
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,009
and

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,600
they're fascinating, I think.

58
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,479
And this is something I've actually been talking about

59
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,850
in the world of video games for a long time.

60
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,419
So actually let me before I explain

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,339
how to find cheat, the, the right way to find cheaters in video games,

62
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,949
what is being done today? Because not everyone understands what's happened.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,179
Like if you don't play video games,

64
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,460
this is probably a foreign and bizarre world to you.

65
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,809
We exist now in a place where a lot of video games install these, like basic, they,

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,360
their, their root kits.

67
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:03,559
Yeah,

68
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,740
they install these like kernel level root kits on your system

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,740
to supposedly detect cheating even though all of the cheating apps

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,860
can get around them because that's like the job of the

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,619
cheating app or you just buy a cheating monitor now.

72
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,619
Right? No,

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,220
because on the last show, but where the monitor will flake you alerts. And

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,119
also what's fascinating to me is too,

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,179
is like there's so much different kinds of cheating in ways of

76
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,259
like one of my favorite things is there are some games,

77
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,339
Starcraft is a great example in Starcraft.

78
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,399
If you actually have proper balanced matchmaking, then your win rate should be 50%.

79
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,059
Right. Right. Right. It's just that simple.

80
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,380
Well, but ok, but let's focus on,

81
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,740
on the toxic gaming database because this is very what Team Fortress Two,

82
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,039
I think the game is right?

83
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,279
That it's focused, it's done.

84
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,119
It's first person shooter oriented, right? First person shooter.

85
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,460
And so basically in the first person shooter world,

86
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:53,899
what you often run into is people get these things called aim bots.

87
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,710
And the idea behind an aim bot

88
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,190
is you don't have to aim, right?

89
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,059
A computer program, a robot will just say aims for you and you never miss

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,809
and you usually have the headshot, which is like the Insta kill and all that stuff.

91
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,059
Right?

92
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,320
Well,

93
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,520
and then also the sees through walls thing is

94
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,380
the other classic side of this where you can see

95
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:13,259
well,

96
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,380
where the players are when you shouldn't know where they are through the fog of war.

97
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,790
So fun fact about that.

98
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:18,269
Actually, I,

99
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,399
I think it was Quake two was the

100
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,829
first multiplayer kind of very competitive online thing.

101
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:25,869
And

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,630
back in the day,

103
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,429
the server would send like the location of every player to every client.

104
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,500
And then people figured out, well, if we just turn all the walls invisible, we can see

105
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,470
where everyone else is in the whole game.

106
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,440
And now what happens is when you play a lot of these games,

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,380
the server will only send you what you need to know, for this specific reason,

108
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,410
the challenge is they also have to send you with the data a little bit.

109
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,910
Like if you're coming around the corner,

110
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,950
it has to show you to some degree

111
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:55,920
or

112
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,140
you're in the bushes or, and there's, if you can see someone,

113
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:03,320
your computer knows where they are. And like, that's what an aim bot

114
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,929
will use, right.

115
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,049
The aim bot will be like, oh, there's a, another player at this location,

116
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:09,630
I'm going to point the gun at exactly their head

117
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,690
and then we're going to fire a bunch of bullets.

118
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,670
And what's funny to me is, uh, a friend back and this is way back in the day. So

119
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,010
over 20 years ago,

120
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:20,609
they were trying to build a robot with a computer vision system to like

121
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,100
drive around the room and they could not get any of the stuff working.

122
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:24,140
So they actually built the bot

123
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,220
in Doom and had it doing like vision recognition in Doom. That's a good idea

124
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,299
and

125
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,726
around and so like to put it bluntly, people have been doing this kind of thing

126
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:39,376
legitimately. And otherwise for over 20 years, like it's a mature industry now.

127
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:40,915
It should also be pointed out

128
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,196
that there are other anti

129
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:49,075
cheating focused things we'll say like, uh, one of my favorites is Genshin Impact,

130
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:51,246
which is that horrible game my kids play that I would,

131
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:54,592
I love to play because it looks fantastic, but it's like a security nightmare.

132
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,231
From the perspective of what everything it does to your system.

133
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,631
And, and anyway, in that game there,

134
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:02,391
it's one of those like use real money to buy fake money

135
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:07,182
to then buy gems and then gems buy like trolls or whatever,

136
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:07,381
you know.

137
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:11,981
And it's like the, the, the crazy pyramid scheme to turn real money into

138
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,799
fake things in the video game,

139
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,630
which of course is funny because my kids have no problem with this.

140
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,690
And I'm like, you're spending real money to buy fake money. This is,

141
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,859
did you ever buy magic? The gathering cards?

142
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,350
Don't,

143
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,739
I'm not answering that question.

144
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,709
I

145
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,609
have boxes and boxes of them.

146
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,149
They're probably worth a fortune because I have the really old ones like from

147
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,549
way back in the day.

148
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:37,269
So obviously these games that let you turn real money into fake money,

149
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,709
they have a vested interest also because

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,429
they don't want people cheating the system,

151
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,619
right?

152
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,630
They don't you to change your luck and get better items

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,630
or know how to kill all the enemies faster or whatever.

154
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,760
Because then

155
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:51,760
in many of the games, if you grind for hundreds of hours,

156
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:54,820
it equals like four cents worth of money or whatever.

157
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,679
And they don't, they don't want anyone to do that, right?

158
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,640
So there's that angle as well.

159
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,790
Now, now we'll assume that that explanation was, was good enough. So

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
the thing this toxic game database does that I I

161
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,500
truly appreciate is you click a view toxicity report.

162
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,299
And at the bottom of the report, there's a button that says view evidence.

163
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,489
And when you look at this evidence,

164
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,540
there's a website called Leady,

165
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,140
which apparently is

166
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,299
some sort of statistic tracking app for people who play.

167
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,940
I, I assume Team Fortress Two, maybe more games. I have no idea.

168
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,390
I didn't dig around that much. But

169
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,329
the thing is,

170
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,739
it shows you like the aim percentage of these people have like,

171
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,739
I just clicked a random one.

172
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,200
It says 93% aim percentage. Like no human can do that, right. This one is 97%

173
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:44,910
like

174
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,760
humans are not doing that.

175
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,029
And then you look at like these other stats and some of the

176
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,589
other stats are terrible and it's like this is clearly a robot.

177
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,119
Well, that's one of my favorite things is like,

178
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,709
I watch a lot of rust because I find Rust very intriguing

179
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,290
and the game Rust

180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,929
rust, the one where you get dumped on the beach like naked and you have to like,

181
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,989
beat people to death with rocks and whatever,

182
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,000
build an AK-47 of shovels.

183
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,869
But what's fascinating to me is like many games.

184
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,769
There's like the pro streamers who have, you know, over 10,000 hours in game.

185
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,029
And that's why I don't actually play the game because you play the

186
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,429
game and I have my like five or 10 hours and I,

187
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,910
I get murdered by somebody who probably has like thousands or hundreds of hours.

188
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,910
So it's no fun. But these 10,000 hour players

189
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,589
can consistently

190
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,670
not just beach cheaters but, like,

191
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,670
just

192
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,950
school them, like, totally trash them

193
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:36,179
because here's the reality you and I could be dumped into rust.

194
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:37,869
We could have all the cheats, all the aim bots,

195
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,789
all the seeing people in the dark and the behind the rocks and stuff.

196
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,068
And we'd still suck because we don't have, like, the technique.

197
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,268
We don't have the, you know,

198
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,309
I think rust is a different sort of game though. Right.

199
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,408
It's, it's very strategic.

200
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:52,879
Yes. And that's part of it.

201
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,468
What I find so fast about this is, it's, it's kind of past a first person shooter.

202
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,129
Like, there's obviously first person shooter elements to it. Like

203
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,189
you're a person who shoots other people,

204
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:01,638
but

205
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:02,578
you have

206
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,052
build a gun out of like coconuts.

207
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,262
And also, like,

208
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,002
there's a lot of strategic stuff you can do with base

209
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,081
design or with how you attack bases and all that.

210
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,481
And so what's really fascinating to me though is, like,

211
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:16,442
fundamentally a lot of cheaters are still

212
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:17,762
terrible

213
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,101
or whatever it is. They're cheating on.

214
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,562
Like, we've like,

215
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,882
I've seen that where people writing these technical exams

216
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:25,392
and they cheat at them and they still fail.

217
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,012
And I'm like,

218
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:27,242
you, you cheat.

219
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:31,521
How did you fail? I mean, come on. It's like the 11 job you had here,

220
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:32,492
like, cheat.

221
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:32,934
Yes.

222
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:35,633
And I get that there's a lot of different reasons for cheating.

223
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,984
You know, some people want to just, well, if there's money involved I get it.

224
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:42,864
You know, if there's a certification vault, I get it, if it's a game, you know, it's

225
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,263
part of me wants to cheat at some of these games just because I'm so bad at them.

226
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:47,893
Like, it was just to be honest,

227
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:52,424
like, I feel like, you know, Steam should be like, oh, you're AAA, late forties male,

228
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:56,664
You're allowed to cheat a bit because you suck. Yeah, I, I agree with that. I,

229
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,914
there's a penny arcade comic that has something like that.

230
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:02,734
That's like, you know, where's the game for, like, responsible

231
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,585
adults or Children or something? I got, like, 2.5 hours a week

232
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,806
getting into, like, weird chunks of time.

233
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,765
Like this is why I play Factorio with the bugs off. Right.

234
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:14,276
Because I can't even be bothered to cheat and get the weapons to kill the bugs.

235
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,945
I just wait, you can turn the bugs off. I've never done that. That would be lovely.

236
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,926
Yeah, it's just, it's a relaxing Builder game.

237
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:24,026
Yeah, that's what I want. I don't want those stupid bugs. They kill me every time.

238
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:25,935
I need to look at that.

239
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:29,056
Now it's, it's a setting like, it's, you can turn cliffs on and off.

240
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:30,546
I turn cliffs off because clips are just

241
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,065
look at. Ok.

242
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:32,656
So

243
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:36,719
I keep everything default. Kurt, I'm too lazy to go look in the settings.

244
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:39,119
But now I will and I'll turn the bugs up anyway. Ok.

245
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,640
I want to bring us back to the topic because I think this is important.

246
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,799
So, the point is like this, this website, the, the toxic, the gaming herd thing.

247
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:46,119
Right.

248
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:51,320
This is, well, these people are probably bizarre and they, you're gonna end up with,

249
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,099
like, people reporting just people who beat them legitimately and things.

250
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:55,280
Well,

251
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,390
and actually that's a fun thing because a lot

252
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,184
of times these 10,000 hour players get reported as cheaters

253
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:06,375
who they're just thumping on because they're just like 200 hours, 10,000 hours.

254
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:06,984
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,655
No, there's, it's like Mike Tyson versus a kindergartner that's

256
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,635
solvable because the

257
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,474
whoever is writing the cheat bot

258
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:19,065
or whatever can look and be like this person has played 10,000 hours,

259
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:21,145
of course, everyone's going to think they're cheating,

260
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:25,025
they know the server admins in most cases, right. So, like, sure report me anyway.

261
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:28,010
The point is this sort of, of statistical analysis

262
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:31,880
is really the key to detecting cheaters. And this is true of like

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,530
all of these games because even the ones that have these insane root kits,

264
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,330
you can't,

265
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,719
you can't cheat statistics, right?

266
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:43,570
It's just like, it's the unfortunate reality of math

267
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,440
is

268
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,450
if you are cheating,

269
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,340
you're going to have statistics that fall outside of the expected ranges.

270
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:51,869
Right?

271
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:56,244
Also mean that for somebody to appear normal, they'd have to, I don't know, like,

272
00:11:56,255 --> 00:12:00,094
waste a lot of time in game, like, if you wanted to grind and cheat at grinding,

273
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:03,205
you'd also have to spend a lot of time not cheating and not grinding.

274
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:03,625
And so,

275
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:08,075
right. I mean, I guess you'd have to have a computer attached for 24 7 kind of playing.

276
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:11,195
And I, like it goes back to World War Two where, you know,

277
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:14,895
the allies had cracked the enigma code and the purple code for the Japanese

278
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,065
And they had to find ways to use this information without showing that,

279
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,969
that they had cracked all the codes. So they, that's

280
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,099
right.

281
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,190
Oh, we sent out some spotter planes. They just happened to see the, you know,

282
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,840
that we need to see. Oh, look at that. Lucky us.

283
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:33,119
Yeah. So, actually there's a movie called The Imitation Game

284
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:33,909
where, uh,

285
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,119
what Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing and it's actually pretty good.

286
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,799
I've read

287
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,479
many historical, we'll say

288
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,190
retellings of like this

289
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,525
Alan Turing whole whole universe and I'm sure most of it it's all hearsay, right.

290
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,174
So you can't, like, count on any sort of real historical record.

291
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:52,684
But anyway, the Imitation Game does a pretty good job there.

292
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,164
It takes some liberties here and there.

293
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,955
But that is one of the things they bring up is the fact that

294
00:12:57,205 --> 00:13:00,804
they can't tell people they know what's going to happen

295
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:03,645
because the Germans will figure out they've cracked enigma,

296
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,794
which would obviously be much worse

297
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:06,684
than,

298
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:11,330
you know, letting the course of war happen, which is like a, a mind

299
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,359
boggling problem to, to think about.

300
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:13,830
Well, I've,

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,960
I've worked with and for military people and they have that mentality of like,

302
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,580
we have to keep our sources secret and like,

303
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,479
the one guy wouldn't even let me say echelon on the phone and I'm like, echelon,

304
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,039
he's like, don't say that word and I'm like, good God, it's in books

305
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,909
now. Like, come on.

306
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,140
So for those of you that don't know echelon was the NSA program to monitor

307
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,080
all

308
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,090
the faxes and phone calls in America. But no, that was, that, that wasn't happening.

309
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,960
Remember everyone told us we were crazy.

310
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:39,919
It was

311
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,130
anyway. Well, considering their budget, like,

312
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,760
what did people think they were doing with it?

313
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,549
Oh, really? Right. Like,

314
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,039
I

315
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:47,450
know

316
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,710
this

317
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,570
isn't like Canada where you look at our

318
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,500
budget for our security services and it's like,

319
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,119
yeah, they're probably not that harmful

320
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,840
compared to, you know, what the US spends.

321
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:56,820
Right.

322
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,909
Yeah. Anyway, so you're right though. You can't.

323
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,030
Like my favorite thing is financial analysis where

324
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,309
the minute people start committing financial fraud,

325
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,400
they generally start making up numbers

326
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,989
and there's patterns in there

327
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,909
how often numbers appear, how often numbers start, you know,

328
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,590
with the number one versus not the number one, what you've just described.

329
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,150
Kurt is called Benford's Law.

330
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,489
That's the way this, this person, it was a mathematician.

331
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,270
And funny enough that the way they found

332
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:24,414
out that numbers follow certain patterns is they were

333
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:27,934
back in the day when you needed to calculate logarithms.

334
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:30,713
University libraries had books of logarithms

335
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:31,614
and,

336
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:36,083
and Benford apparently recognized that the, basically the, the,

337
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:39,174
the number one pages section book,

338
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:43,054
I don't know exactly how it was split up was more tattered than the rest.

339
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,453
So he's like, people are obviously looking here more often than

340
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:46,158
other places.

341
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,867
And then they started doing like statistical

342
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,388
analysis on just how often integers appear.

343
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:50,598
And yeah,

344
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,778
there's like a pattern to it and one appears

345
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,898
way more often than any other number does.

346
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:58,857
And yes, the IRS and other tax agencies are using that

347
00:14:59,047 --> 00:14:59,937
to figure out because yes,

348
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:03,047
if I'm a human and I just like make up numbers and I type them in,

349
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:04,888
they're not going to follow Benford's law.

350
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:07,158
They're gonna follow like squishy meat brain law

351
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,947
which has no pattern to it.

352
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:09,658
It's really,

353
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,992
yeah, I, I can't help but think maybe this like,

354
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,921
because one thing I've consistently seen is where

355
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,221
people talk about games need a replay system.

356
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,262
So you can like, look at what happened,

357
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:22,541
do the instant replay and see if cheating happened or

358
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:26,302
not because a lot of cheating is often in hindsight,

359
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,461
very obvious,

360
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:28,581
you know, like the guy

361
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,142
literally pops around the corner and just happens to be

362
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,262
aiming at the guy's head when he pulls the trigger,

363
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:33,861
you know,

364
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,466
and it's like less than human reaction time.

365
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:38,426
Right. Right. But again,

366
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,986
the, the owner of the game can do this if they want to.

367
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,786
Instead they have opted to install these invasive root kits that do,

368
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,015
who knows what on your system?

369
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:54,306
Because apparently that's easier than hiring a statistician. I, I don't know.

370
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:58,015
I, well, and I, I do get the idea of prevention rather than

371
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,020
after the fact because,

372
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,780
oh, you just, you just reminded me. Ok. So I watched

373
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,299
the, I think it was the latest John Oliver show last week tonight,

374
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,599
which was on Medicare or Medicaid, Medicaid in the United States.

375
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:19,359
And one of the things they talked about was Medicaid fraud

376
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,400
in one of the States. I forget which one it was now,

377
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,000
but they were talking about how there was this fraud

378
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,330
task force

379
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:32,289
that had found like $900,000 worth of Medicaid fraud

380
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,570
and it only cost $6.5 million to run the task force.

381
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,010
Well, that's like the, uh, hang on a second. Let me find the number of New York City.

382
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh, the subway story.

383
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah. Where they,

384
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,890
they spent millions of dollars to prevent

385
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,429
more than

386
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,539
a million worth of subway free riders or whatever

387
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:53,809
anyways.

388
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,289
Yeah, I, well, we, like, we constantly see that with a lot of these things, like,

389
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,599
but, I mean, but video games are a little bit

390
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,669
different

391
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,589
in that. I don't think they are. I don't think they are at all.

392
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:10,270
I think this is the very typical case of as human beings, we want

393
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,260
to like, we want to live in a just society. It's like it's built into us.

394
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,790
We want it so bad.

395
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,270
And so we are willing to do ridiculous things.

396
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,540
If we think the result is justice when the reality is reacting

397
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,109
to various events, like banning cheaters after they cheat

398
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,349
is easier, cheaper and more effective than trying to stop them before the case.

399
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,069
Which is what we do now in many instances. But

400
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,349
if the game has already been ruined, like,

401
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,819
but it's not ruined as long as you're catching them in a timely manner.

402
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:48,605
You don't wait until half the game is cheaters and then start banning people.

403
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:51,046
You start banning people on like day five

404
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:53,686
because now you have enough statistical evidence.

405
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:56,786
I don't know, I just, I don't play enough video games.

406
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,345
Like I kind of gave up on video games because

407
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,645
between cheating and between just not being good at them.

408
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:05,086
They're not, they're not fun anymore. I just don't play online because I'm so bad.

409
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,286
But I can play me some Mario. Oh,

410
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,345
speaking of which, I'm going to put a link in the show notes.

411
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,462
So Kurt sent me a video, a four hour long video but invisible

412
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:18,192
wall walls of Mario 64 don't say I don't give you nice things.

413
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:21,682
I totally watched it all four hours. It was amazing.

414
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,141
It was the most amazing video I've seen in a long

415
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:26,541
time and I don't expect anyone else to watch it.

416
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,541
But holy cow, like the amount of research

417
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,222
that was put into this video is mind boggling.

418
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,582
And I told Kurt before we hit record as well, like,

419
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,901
I've started writing a conference talk basically titled like

420
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:42,021
The Speed Runners Are the, the Best hackers alive today.

421
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,719
Because if you look at like what people like this guy did with video games, the,

422
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,040
the things they're figuring out are,

423
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,020
they blows your mind. It's amazing. You know what?

424
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,829
This guy has 217,000 subscribers on youtube.

425
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,709
The video has 46,000 up votes and three quarters of a million

426
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,359
or how many views does this video have? It doesn't say

427
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,459
anyways, it's got a lot of views.

428
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,439
It's got 5000 plus comments.

429
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,910
Most videos don't get 5000 views, let alone comments.

430
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,130
I don't look at the comments ever on youtube, ever ever.

431
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:14,989
But

432
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,150
yeah, like the video is fantastic. Four hours, four hours.

433
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,630
Like he shows every invisible wall in Mario 64 every one of them.

434
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,579
It's amazing.

435
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:27,010
What's always fascinating to me is sort of like this

436
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,609
reverse engineering of these old video games because like,

437
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,209
you see this with physical things too where, you know, people buy an old

438
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,089
tool or an old car

439
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:39,130
and like, take it apart and like here's how this works. It's very clever.

440
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,310
It does this, like one of my favorite things is, you know, the VW beetle

441
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:45,390
to essentially prevent they did something

442
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,660
clever with the engineering to prevent the

443
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,839
engine from getting too hot in one spot by shortening something or whatever.

444
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:50,030
And

445
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,380
like just these clever engineering hacks that after the

446
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,530
fact when you take it apart and you're like,

447
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,630
oh, ok, cool.

448
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,329
Car people who have been doing that literally forever.

449
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:01,709
It's what car people do, they, they take their cars apart and they do stuff to them.

450
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,219
Now, you just reminded me as well.

451
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:06,859
It's in the show notes so well in, in the,

452
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,579
we'll say the Show Notes curtain I have before we publish,

453
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,369
I don't know those called Show Notes, whatever.

454
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,540
Anyway, it's in a github

455
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,140
issue.

456
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,400
There's another story about video game related, I dumped into this called Pre Tendo

457
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,739
and this has an ethical aspect to it that I think will be very interesting and I,

458
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,339
I don't want it.

459
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:26,020
It's not exciting enough I think to cover like a whole show. But

460
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,819
so

461
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,859
Nintendo, actually,

462
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,040
there's been a lot more I've noticed on L TT and a couple of other places.

463
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,449
There's been a lot of discussion the last month or two about the shutting

464
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:39,229
down of these video game services and like people paid money for that game and

465
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,689
that would be available.

466
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,140
Yes, let me explain that.

467
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:47,510
So Nintendo shut down the servers behind the Wii U and the Nintendo three Ds.

468
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,069
They're like 12 years old,

469
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,910
which is longer than most other companies run this stuff in Fairness.

470
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,729
My original Nintendo wii

471
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,010
still works great.

472
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,270
Well. Yeah, it still works great because it, it doesn't need a server.

473
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,810
They shut this down. Now.

474
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:04,709
There are these people that created this, this application?

475
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,714
Well, they're running a network called Pretend.

476
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,025
Oh, right. Like pretend. Oh,

477
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:11,685
Nintendo wordplay. I

478
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:12,035
think we

479
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:12,525
got it.

480
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:17,425
Look, I don't assume anything. All right. I'm not the fastest person in the world.

481
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:21,025
So funny enough. My, my keyboard, uh the Z key broke

482
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:22,270
and

483
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,640
I, I run vi a lot. I'm blaming V I,

484
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:28,060
how long did it take you to notice the Z key broke?

485
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,489
And I, I made a little joke on Mastodon and uh uh a fellow I know named Marius is like,

486
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
oh, what about the X key?

487
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:34,989
And I'm like,

488
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,989
I don't get

489
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,170
it.

490
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,109
He's like XZ, I'm like, oh, that's clever.

491
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:43,484
Well done, sir. Like, I'm not smart enough to get your joke.

492
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,515
I don't assume anything anyway. So pretend

493
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,305
they found a security vulnerability

494
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:54,405
in the, the way Nintendo was parsing.

495
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:58,665
I, I think it was um signatures on certificates. Ok. I'm just gonna pause it.

496
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,949
There is a security vulnerability in every piece of

497
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,750
software ever that did something involving parsing of data,

498
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:04,770
a

499
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:08,050
certificate specifically, especially certificates because

500
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,880
I dare

501
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:09,459
to go

502
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:09,939
download and

503
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,349
here's the

504
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,680
thing,

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,099
they found it and they sat on it for like a year waiting for Nintendo to end

506
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,555
of life, their servers and shut them down

507
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:19,925
and then

508
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:22,964
announced the security vulnerability and they used

509
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,324
it to create basically fake Nintendo servers

510
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:29,344
that you can then have your Wii U and three Ds connect to.

511
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,545
I don't know if the three Ds for sure, but I know the Wii U can

512
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,964
anyway connect to

513
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:36,699
and then basically pretend it's Nintendo and you can do things.

514
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,819
And so your wii U is kind of still functional online because of this.

515
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:42,770
Now, here's a question.

516
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,260
Is it unethical to sit on a security vulnerability for a year?

517
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,300
No, I, no, because like I would say whoever finds security vulnerability,

518
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:56,459
there are obviously very unethical things to do with it,

519
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:57,880
like using it to hurt people.

520
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,650
Like if you find a security vulnerability

521
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,989
in a medical device and use it to kill people through their pacemaker,

522
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,160
I think we could agree that's probably unethical

523
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:07,439
and conversely, there's ethical things to do with it,

524
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,790
like depending on the kind of software and what it is, you know,

525
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,869
you go to the vendor and say, hey, I found this flaw, can we please fix it, blah, blah,

526
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,069
blah.

527
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,839
But I would actually flip that on his head and say,

528
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,650
is it ethical for Nintendo to turn those servers off?

529
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:23,189
And I would point out, ok, first of all, 12 years is not a long time.

530
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:26,170
What's interesting to me is in Europe and in general,

531
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,020
a lifetime warranty is actually 25 years.

532
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,400
That's

533
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,290
really,

534
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:31,300
yeah,

535
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,369
that's generally what that actually means

536
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,829
a fun fact in Canada outside of cemeteries.

537
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,530
It is illegal to sell a lifetime membership

538
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,290
like it. That's just, that, that, that, that's illegal because we all know

539
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,510
that, that's just not a real thing like the company

540
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,339
fold or be like, oh ha ha. We changed our mind it.

541
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:51,849
How you're gonna cost money every month. Now,

542
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:54,250
there's tons of stories about that. Right.

543
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,449
Where someone bought a lifetime membership to a thing

544
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,810
and then it's taken away from them eventually.

545
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,270
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,739
So anyway, so first of all, I would say, I'm

547
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,130
kind of angry that these companies don't state how long this will work for.

548
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,839
Because for example,

549
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,630
if Nintendo said here's this Nintendo wii it really benefits from these

550
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,670
online services and works better and we'll run them for 12 years

551
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:16,939
and they were upfront about it

552
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,829
then, OK,

553
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,430
assuming they kept their word and run it for 12 years if they had to pronounce this.

554
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,239
And,

555
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,050
but there's no like there's no transparency, there's no

556
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,989
like I paid for this thing and now I'm at Nintendo's whim.

557
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,699
I mean, you're already at their whim, right?

558
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,130
If, if you do something that like let me give you an example.

559
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,689
I have a 3d si hacked my three Ds. So I could play funny enough.

560
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:43,829
So I could play Mario 64 on my three Ds

561
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:44,800
because

562
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,150
I think we talked about this years ago now where they decom

563
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,619
pled Mario 64 source code

564
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,099
and then someone recompiled it.

565
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,579
So it ran in full screen and like very well on the three Ds

566
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:01,182
hack. My 3d has literally delayed this one thing. Now,

567
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,692
once it was hacked,

568
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:04,743
I never connected it to the internet again

569
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:08,562
because I knew like, if I and here's the thing, let's say I connected to Nintendo,

570
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,052
Nintendo was like, you hacked your three Ds.

571
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,223
We're banning your account.

572
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:13,942
I would lose all my switch games,

573
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:14,432
all my,

574
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:18,182
you know what I mean? You're already at their mercy here.

575
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,432
And I think maybe we need some consumer protection laws

576
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,993
here is that we as consumers are getting kind of

577
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:23,942
the short

578
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,436
of the stick here. And so when I see something like pretender,

579
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,145
I 100% support that.

580
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,635
And I actually think if anything they are doing the

581
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,706
ethical thing and I'll point something out e waste.

582
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:35,255
They are preventing all that stuff from becoming e waste

583
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:38,666
for you. Wonder how much old video game stuff is worth Kurt. It's,

584
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:43,206
it's not e waste on many levels. They're doing a service. I think you're right.

585
00:25:43,215 --> 00:25:44,556
I don't want to get to.

586
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:48,505
We've already went way too deep into the whole ethical, how long

587
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,306
tech lasts and all that stuff. But

588
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,060
I, I, so for what it's worth, I agree with you.

589
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:57,530
I think what pre tendo did by sitting on a security vulnerability and it's

590
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,140
even like it's icing on the cake just seeing what they've done with it.

591
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,540
I uh for honestly I really don't have a problem with it. I really say simple question.

592
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,300
Did what they do make the world a better or worse place

593
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,270
for the same.

594
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,079
It depends who you ask.

595
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:16,260
Nintendo's lawyers will assure you that the world is a much worse place.

596
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,819
And, and my honest question, there would be, how, like,

597
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,979
are they losing it on sales of Nintendo we use,

598
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,170
have you read any of the stories about Nintendo's lawyers?

599
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,619
Oh, yeah, they're maniacs.

600
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:30,699
But my point is like, this is really a case where you, you can't make piracy,

601
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,050
sales claims you can't.

602
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,290
Like this is somebody using something they already paid for

603
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,439
properly. I

604
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,910
know, but I'm sure there's some C FAA violation or something buried in there.

605
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,719
So anyway.

606
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,420
All right. All right. We've covered quite the gamut of topics today, haven't we?

607
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,180
We started at,

608
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,280
and we're ending on Nintendo,

609
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:52,800
which is exciting. We got some Mario 64 thrown in for fun.

610
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,329
Well, I would say sometimes cheating is good and makes the world a better place.

611
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,400
Like one of my favorite things.

612
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,040
And this is one of the reasons I really despise those root kits.

613
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,160
Some people need to cheat at video games because they

614
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,199
need a system of devices or software because they have disabilities

615
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:07,969
and they can't play the game way.

616
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,420
And so there are people that have, you know, said like, hey,

617
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,410
my um like my foot mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore or my

618
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:15,839
Oh,

619
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:16,630
perfect example,

620
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,599
like screen readers are getting like messed up all the time by all this BS.

621
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,229
Like we don't want to let you cut and paste the screen or we don't want to, you know,

622
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,300
blah, blah, blah, right?

623
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,989
Where we want to show you the content but like not let you somehow

624
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,510
copy it. And I'm like,

625
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,680
but it has to go to my computer to show it to me,

626
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,349
you know.

627
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,290
So

628
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,119
I think

629
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,790
anyway, anyway,

630
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,869
II, I also think from the angle of cheating

631
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,140
when you are like speed run,

632
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:48,599
especially when they're, they're exploiting bugs and games basically, like,

633
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:53,880
it's basically cheating and it's epic. Are there any speed runs for like

634
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,619
multiplayer online games?

635
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,810
Like, is there a speed run thing for like, say, well for say of

636
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,349
rust to get up for rocket? Like, is there a thing for that?

637
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,020
There probably are there speed run for every game

638
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,099
and the online ones where they play together

639
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,280
are usually not heavy on exploiting bugs.

640
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,420
They usually just play really well

641
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:17,300
because obviously these online services tend not to let bugs exist.

642
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,260
I mean, so like one of the things that happens, it's like, I'll pick on uh the,

643
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,199
the new legend is Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom.

644
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,270
When it came out, everyone's like, oh, the speed run will never be under an hour.

645
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,359
It's like 25 minutes an hour or something. Of course,

646
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,680
I remember obviously, like humans can't run faster than 44 minute mile.

647
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,010
It's physically impossible.

648
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,339
That right. Anyway,

649
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,160
so the thing is though,

650
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,060
in, in like tears of the Kingdom,

651
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,383
they, they specifically will buy cartridge j

652
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,532
least day because they want like the 1.0 Cart

653
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,812
because that usually has the most bugs.

654
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:50,052
Whereas when you play online games,

655
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,662
you have to keep upgrading to the

656
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:53,853
latest version and they're fixing bugs constantly.

657
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:58,532
So you just, you can't rely on them like you can in, in console titles looking at this.

658
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,463
Uh, so Blazed Ashley is a big rust streamer.

659
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:02,762
He's got a 57 minute rust speed run.

660
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:03,422
So, yeah,

661
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:06,733
it's amazing. I mean, some of these people, it's ridiculous.

662
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,572
This is why I don't play that game because like

663
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,965
that guy can basically finish Rust and 57 minutes.

664
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:15,595
We need a rush server for like old people without any free time.

665
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:17,365
Oh, I found some. They do exist.

666
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:18,326
Yeah,

667
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:19,095
they're actually

668
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:19,855
kind of soothing.

669
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:22,526
I went to one and it was like raining and it was the sound,

670
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:24,755
the sound of the rain and rust is actually one of

671
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,166
the most pleasant things I've ever experienced in a video.

672
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:28,806
I don't know if I've ever had it rain on me.

673
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:32,676
I, I played it for like an hour and I kept dying and I'm like, I'm done.

674
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,326
I give up, I'm never playing again

675
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,125
anyway. All right, man. I think we should call this one.

676
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,365
Here's the thought, maybe what we need

677
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,166
is

678
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,099
you can buy skins

679
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,140
but you also have to like prove that you're

680
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,050
like like an older person or you have Children

681
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,260
to get this skin and, and it would also have like armor like properties

682
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,579
and no, but think about it, people would pay for that.

683
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,640
Uh Kurt, the young people would seek out and they would hunt us like animals.

684
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,300
We

685
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:03,310
would be their trophy.

686
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,920
I shot 30 Boomers today. They would wear our skins

687
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,479
and

688
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:09,780

690
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:11,349
