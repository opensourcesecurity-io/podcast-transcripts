Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,560
and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:14,899
Josh Pressers joining me the day after the real Thanksgiving,

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,469
the real Thanksgiving.

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:17,819
Oh, man, Kurt, I'm,

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,139
I'm not even gonna get into this argument with you because I don't think

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,040
either of us are gonna win for those of you who don't know.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,340
Kurt lives in a country called Canada

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,260
which celebrates a holiday they call Thanksgiving in the month of October, which

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,080
that's all I'll say.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,619
All right, I will, we will let the audience decide and, and by all means,

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,159
let us know on Twitter, what you think of celebrating Thanksgiving a month early?

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,299
So, what's new Kurt?

13
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, uh my favorite

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,520
back to something I've looked at before is

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,619
where do prime numbers come from?

16
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,220
I, I think they're the stork brings them.

17
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,380
Yeah, I, what,

18
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:59,520
what gets me is even when I generate prime numbers on my own computer in a way that I

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,540
am told is correct.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,220
I, I'm, I'm still not entirely correct. Right.

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,879
Because that's part of the beauty and the magic of this prime number based crypto is

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,680
the definition is that these things are so hard to determine their factors.

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,860
That's the whole security property of them to some degree. Right.

24
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,650
And so we can't really prove if these numbers

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,349
are prime or not because they're so dang big.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,849
I mean, unless they end in like a 20.

27
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:25,110
Right.

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,389
We, well, it, it, ok, so that's something really important you just said is,

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,470
it is very easy to prove something

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,690
isn't prime because you just find something that

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,169
it can be divided into, right? No big deal.

32
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,250
And for those of you who don't know which I'm, I'm not gonna lie.

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,830
Anyone who listens to this podcast, I would expect to know what a prime number is.

34
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:47,139
But essentially it's a number that is only divisible by one in itself, right?

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,379
So you, for example, can't divide it by two or three

36
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,769
and get a whole integer of the other side of that.

37
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,769
Now, that said

38
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,580
it is

39
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:59,660
something that keeps coming up in the news lately is the fact that

40
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,059
prime numbers which are the cornerstone of cryptography today

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,089
are increasingly coming under attack. Historically speaking,

42
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,320
we've been far more interested in

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,860
the algorithms themselves, but now that we have research going on into

44
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,809
the fact that some of these algorithms like Diffie Hellman, for example,

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,850
relies on having a large good prime number.

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,139
Well, when we did a bunch of this work, 1024 bits, what's considered large and,

47
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,869
and good is questionable at best, but we'll get to that

48
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,630
1024 bit primes are no longer big enough.

49
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,360
And

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,679
did you read the paper, Kurt?

51
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,639
-- Honestly, I don't really read crypto papers because you don't know
-- how to read.

52
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,720
Well, usually by about the second or third paragraph, I'm, I'm lost,

53
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,779
I've read about the first. It's 29 pages and I read probably 15 of them so far.

54
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:52,509
I, I won't lie.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,809
I don't, I don't delve into the math very deeply now that, you know, I,

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,789
I don't do that sort of thing very often.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,050
But,

58
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,929
but fundamentally, these guys have done some pretty solid work. And for those of you

59
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,130
out there who listen,

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,529
the fundamental problem here is that

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,779
when you have an algorithm like Diffie

62
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,250
Hellman,

63
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,080
which relies on essentially having a good prime

64
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,089
number that both parties know and share,

65
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:15,470
then you do some,

66
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,770
some math and there's plenty of videos on the internet that

67
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,809
discuss how Diff Helmet works and it's an ingenious algorithm.

68
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:24,240
But the problem is that if you have an attacker

69
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:29,520
that has significant amounts of computing power at their disposal,

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,009
they can do a bunch of pre computations around

71
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,389
these prime numbers

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,039
and then they can essentially so there, well, there's kind of two attacks here.

73
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,130
There's one where you do a bunch of pre computation and you store the data

74
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,139
on

75
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,720
understanding what all the possible

76
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:50,139
numbers are that I, this is, this is tough man to not go too crazy

77
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:50,809
and so

78
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,360
alienating everybody.

79
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,539
But essentially what you end up with is

80
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:57,529
you've got a prime number, you're doing some math with another number

81
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,699
and you can pre comput a whole bunch

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,979
of this math in advance. And then you can use that to your advantage to

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,970
essentially break the diffie Hellman

84
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,960
results that are expected to be secure. But now this new attack

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,949
is essentially talking about how you can have prime numbers

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,178
that are known bad.

87
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,160
And this is fascinating to me because historically speaking,

88
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:25,220
the idea that we were always afraid of was having a number that wasn't really prime,

89
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,019
whereas you have a number that's mostly prime,

90
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,730
we'll say which I know sounds hilarious.

91
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:30,019
But

92
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,089
the way we check prime numbers is we don't go through every possible integer,

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,140
multiplying them and dividing them and saying, you know,

94
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,170
does this give us our prime number?

95
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,309
We have various algorithms

96
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,089
that we think

97
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,850
are correct for determining prime this?

98
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,890
We don't, I don't, I don't believe they're proven.

99
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:51,309
Well, actually, it's worse than that.

100
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,079
I, I did some research into this last year and all of the stuff that those um

101
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,950
those tests and those algorithms are based on is

102
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,369
math that is essentially at this 0.30 years old.

103
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,959
And I was unable to find,

104
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,739
I was unable to find any recent work on it,

105
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,350
right? The work was done 30 years ago and that's it.

106
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,850
And it was,

107
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,670
these algorithms

108
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,329
definitely do work for testing the primal

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,970
of prime numbers

110
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,880
up to a certain size.

111
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,220
And back then

112
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:29,619
like 30 years ago, a 1024 bit prime was like magic, let alone a 4000, you know,

113
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,380
96 bit prime or something.

114
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,440
And so I wasn't able to find anybody that

115
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,519
could even say with any certainty that these algorithms

116
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:41,089
will work well on large prime numbers.

117
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,649
And nobody as far as I can tell has done the research publicly.

118
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,540
That's,

119
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:49,220
that's really interesting because the answer to having

120
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,209
essentially weak back door 1024 bit primes is using

121
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,790
2048 bit primes

122
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,880
because in, in the research, I don't have the number in front of me right now.

123
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,279
But basically, they said that in, in a couple of weeks of compute time,

124
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,880
given the fact that the cloud exists, which is

125
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,420
really makes some of this research crazy because in the past,

126
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,320
there were a few organizations that could literally have, you know,

127
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,299
thousands of computers at the disposal.

128
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,119
I know anyone can do it for, you know, $4 and a credit card.

129
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,869
So the answer here though is to use large primes.

130
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,679
When I say large primes, we're talking 2048 bits,

131
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,920
which is still not super huge. But

132
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,279
that's really interesting if you say that there isn't a ton of good math

133
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,529
deciding if our old ways of determining prime.

134
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,450
Well, yeah. Well, that's fair,

135
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:32,839
but

136
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,480
it might not be good. And the problem is though, we don't

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,989
uh there hasn't, as far as I can tell, there hasn't been a lot of research into this,

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,380
you know,

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,910
I was looking for.

140
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,109
Um,

141
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,940
because two of the things I've always wanted to

142
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,010
find is a good test suite for prime numbers

143
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,309
that is

144
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,040
mathematically,

145
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:53,670
you know, has had some research done into say larger primes, like 4, 4000 bit primes,

146
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,829
8000 bit primes

147
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,970
and a second test suite for randomness and cryptographically secure randomness.

148
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,410
-- And there's
-- some really good random test suites.

149
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Actually, I don't remember the name of it. I should look for this.

150
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,140
Yeah, there were one or two that were pretty decent. But

151
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,510
part of what frustrates me is that there's, you know, the,

152
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,730
the math to understand this stuff, let's face it when you read one of these papers,

153
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,350
unless you have a degree in math,

154
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:19,339
you kind of have to trust what they're writing because it's, it's, you know,

155
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,869
you have to devote a few years to understanding this and

156
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:22,890
let's face it.

157
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,440
Your average developer or even your average security

158
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,790
person doesn't have the time for that.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,179
I mean,

160
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,709
but that's fair with any industry.

161
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,920
Kurt is the fact that you have experts and most other people rely on those experts.

162
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,850
I mean, I don't know how to build a silicone chip,

163
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,170
but Intel sells them, I buy them from Intel and I assume everything is fine, right?

164
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,250
Uh But,

165
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,359
and then the other thing that really gets me about a lot of

166
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,510
these primes is let's assume for a moment that these prime numbers,

167
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,959
you can generate them safely and correctly.

168
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,790
What's interesting to me is there's a lot of prime numbers

169
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,899
in use and people aren't really sure where they came from.

170
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,119
Like some developer

171
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,329
created them, I guess at some point and put them into the code base and

172
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,640
back in the depths of time.

173
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:12,170
And, you know, we literally don't know where some of these prime numbers came from.

174
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,809
Well, all right.

175
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,089
So there's, I think a couple of important things we should clarify here is,

176
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,929
first of all,

177
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,450
there are a significant number of cryptographic

178
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,559
algorithms and operations that rely on having

179
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,730
a large prime number. All right.

180
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,010
Second of all, generating a large prime number

181
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,260
is a nontrivial task.

182
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:34,549
Given the fact that we are essentially dealing with randomness,

183
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,808
it might take 10 seconds, it might take 10 minutes.

184
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:41,080
So you don't want to generate these large primes on the fly.

185
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,020
All right.

186
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,280
So we've got that because obviously,

187
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,400
if you're connecting to a website and it

188
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,739
takes 10 minutes to generate the prime number,

189
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,260
you need,

190
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,900
you're, you're gonna find somewhere else to go. Right.

191
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,940
So, and additionally, there's the fact that

192
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,719
these large prime numbers have been pre generated,

193
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,400
we don't necessarily know where they came from,

194
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,760
but they're often shared

195
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:07,039
amongst various things in use on the internet.

196
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,080
For example, I think the,

197
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,960
the top million websites or top 1000 websites are one of those,

198
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,760
this is actually in that, that paper,

199
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,669
they all share a handful of primes

200
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,989
that are the same, which is kind of crazy when you really think about it. That,

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,049
and this again comes back to that pre computation attacks and the, the back door is

202
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,989
if, if someone decides your prime number is one of the blessed primes and, you know,

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it's back doored.

204
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,770
Yeah, I mean, you're in right.

205
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,210
Yeah.

206
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,080
it's actually a bit worse than that.

207
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,010
I mean, even on a, on a modern PC, sure you can generate a prime number and then,

208
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,549
you know,

209
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,429
a few seconds, uh,

210
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,330
a few tens of seconds if you're unlucky because

211
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,929
literally the way these things generate these large primes

212
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,159
is they pick a randomly large number and then test it for primal, right?

213
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:54,710
You know,

214
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,030
and using like, what is it? Um, I think it was the number of something, like if you do 50

215
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:04,280
tests on this number, like the chance of it being not a primer vanishingly small,

216
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,880
um, like two to the negative 80th or something, you know,

217
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,520
which for the majority of us is fine.

218
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:09,710
But,

219
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,440
yeah, when you start using that prime number for like 60% of the world's websites,

220
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,380
then, you know, that is,

221
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,130
that is something worth attacking for a bad guy.

222
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,580
And what really

223
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,179
the reality too is like on a phone, for example, generating prime,

224
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,380
it's gonna kill your battery.

225
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:29,770
And if you had to generate new primes, right.

226
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,549
Every time you connect it to a website because

227
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,260
not only does the server have to generate primes, but the, you know,

228
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,090
the client needs primes as well.

229
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:36,799
Right.

230
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,419
And the reality is if, if we had everything generating primes on the fly, I mean, the

231
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,950
honestly, the battery drain alone a week of that,

232
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:48,340
regardless of battery, it takes too long to do

233
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,500
to generate suitably large prime numbers. Now, that said,

234
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,880
even though

235
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,340
you have a certain amount of shared primes across these

236
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:59,559
various applications and various websites and whatever you want to do

237
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,059
there is

238
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,799
these algorithms are designed

239
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,119
with the concept of shared primes in mind.

240
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,619
Diffie Hellman relies on having shared prime numbers

241
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,299
right

242
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:11,750
now.

243
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,599
At the same time, you also want some amount of shared primes because for example,

244
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,200
if, if I'm connecting to a malicious website

245
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,729
and it hands me a number and says here's a prime number,

246
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,090
is it prime?

247
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,159
It takes a long time to check that. And so

248
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,809
there's value in having some of this pre shared. I'm not saying

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,919
that we should all just be automatically doing this stuff on

250
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,659
our own and trusting whatever the server is giving to us.

251
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,219
Now,

252
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:40,409
when we put all of that together,

253
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,809
the fundamental takeaway here is stop using small primes, right?

254
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,849
We need to use large primes and this is true of encryption keys in general,

255
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:54,390
we now have so much computing resources available to us

256
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,510
that you need to be using large keys.

257
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,250
And actually, that was one of the things I looked into was, was there any,

258
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:04,130
was there any cryptographic software on the client

259
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,849
side that was verifying the prime numbers,

260
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,520
uh, that it was being handed?

261
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,609
And I did find one and it was really, it was some bizarre oddball library for, like,

262
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,950
-- uh, music or something.
-- Lib Tinfoil hat.

263
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,650
Yeah, it was, it was totally strange because it actually did call,

264
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:20,390
uh,

265
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,020
the thing to check if this number was a

266
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,039
prime and then it would error out and literally,

267
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,349
but the key thing is it would air out with rather a

268
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:30,049
generic error message and not something like this number is not prime,

269
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,479
you probably need to panic a bit.

270
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,520
I

271
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,289
mean,

272
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,619
none of the crypto libraries return good error messages.

273
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:36,320
I mean,

274
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,710
you're lucky if it says can't connect,

275
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,719
right? That's,

276
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:40,960
it's terrible.

277
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:41,950
Yeah.

278
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:42,869
So

279
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:48,280
one thing I, I would love to see is a project to generate some good primes

280
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,789
and test them, you know, widely.

281
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,190
Now you started a github

282
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,590
repo or something, didn't you to capture prime?

283
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:58,380
So, the idea was to basically have I wanted to see,

284
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,940
uh, you know, when you, basically,

285
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,799
because there's a variety of tools to generate these primes, uh like open SSL has a,

286
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,299
you know, uh uh there's a command line switch to do it and there's some other things.

287
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,409
Um, part of it was to see how long these things take, right? Because I was,

288
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,289
it's non deterministic, right? It's not like it.

289
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:19,369
You want a 1024 bit prime? It'll take a minute. You want 2048 it'll take two minutes.

290
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,869
It's literally the way we generate these primes is give me a random number.

291
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,330
Now, I'm gonna test it for primal

292
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,530
and you might generate like I've had uh occasions where

293
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,270
generating a large prime took like less than a second and

294
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,429
I think my record was just over 10 minutes.

295
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,090
-- What, what do you, what, what, what is a large prime in this
-- context?

296
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,349
I think it was like 4096.

297
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:40,400
So,

298
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,210
yeah.

299
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,330
Um and I tried doing some larger ones like eight K

300
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,090
and 16 K and that didn't work out so well.

301
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,210
Um

302
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,000
And

303
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,869
just to put it bluntly, they're, they're just to test them properly.

304
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,309
I mean, they're so big that, you know, it's,

305
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,030
it's gonna take hours if not days on a fast machine.

306
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:02,070
The good news is this kind of testing parallelize is beautifully.

307
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,460
The bad news is as far as I know there's no good software for it,

308
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,710
but here's the thing you say, it parallels beautifully,

309
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,419
but

310
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,440
you have a trust issue because let's say Kurt generates some primes and

311
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,690
Kurt decides to make some backdoor primes that can be easily cracked.

312
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,330
Now, how do I verify that one?

313
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,359
It is prime, which we can do that easy enough.

314
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:24,500
It,

315
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,010
it will take time but I I would assume there has

316
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,690
been remarkably little verification done on many of these prime numbers

317
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,140
in things like open ssh and Apache.

318
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,059
In fact, we should, um,

319
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,729
one of us should do that just to,

320
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,030
just to make sure because that would be entertaining.

321
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,010
It would be even more entertaining and sad if, if

322
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,989
something wasn't prime there.

323
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,940
But anyway, so there's that.

324
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,000
But then

325
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:52,150
how do we trust this stuff? Right. You generate this stuff. Where did you get it?

326
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,780
Did you find the prime and the park

327
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,119
or, or what's going on here? Right. That's the challenge.

328
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,549
Well, I mean, for example, the uh the DNS se people have already done that, you know,

329
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,710
they have these elaborate key signing ceremonies,

330
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,650
um which, you know, they, they pull these uh

331
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,099
encryption cards and stuff out of a locked safe and the locked

332
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,750
safe is kept in a room made out of like plexiglass.

333
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:18,190
And I remember halfway through the key signing, somebody was commenting that the,

334
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,299
the front of the safe was a bit shiny and that they might want to like,

335
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,479
make sure it's not shiny in future because you might be able to see a reflection

336
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,500
of the person entering the safe and like, you know, the code to enter the safe.

337
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,609
Um

338
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:33,400
And so they basically just have this elaborate key signing ceremony,

339
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,369
you know, to make sure that nobody like nothing up my sleeves

340
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,960
and

341
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,809
yeah, but it boils down to at some point,

342
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,690
we have to have a computer involved that we trust because, like,

343
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,130
you can't generate these primes using like dice rolls or, you know,

344
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,090
one D 2016. Ok. Well, that's not prime 17. Hey, we got a prime number

345
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,940
we're

346
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,299
in,

347
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,210
you know,

348
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,289
um,

349
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,270
I think a lot of it will have to

350
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:00,340
ultimately rely on testing and, you know,

351
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,669
having somebody generate the prime that

352
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,869
maybe has an incentive to not

353
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:07,820
generate an even number, like maybe the eff you know,

354
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,330
the electronic Frontier foundation, right?

355
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,190
They have a good, strong uh history of working for people's privacy.

356
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,270
Um Because the reality is if you hand me a number generated on a computer that are,

357
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,000
as far as I know,

358
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,479
there's no real way I can truly verify that number and that computer are, you know,

359
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,669
safe to generate a prime.

360
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,090
And there's,

361
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,500
you know, there's some incredibly subtle stuff you could do to monkey with it.

362
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:28,890
Yeah.

363
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,599
Well, and so that's kind of the point to this research in this paper is the fact that

364
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,520
they have found a way to generate a number that is prime,

365
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,559
right? It is prime. If you test it,

366
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,530
nothing

367
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,940
will come up as being shenanigans.

368
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,030
But then due to the way math works with Diffie

369
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:47,679
Hellman,

370
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,750
you will easily be able to crack data that is encrypted using the Diffie

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,809
Hellman algorithm.

372
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:55,440
And so

373
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:00,479
that's crazy. Now, at the same time, they do say that a 2048 bit prime

374
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,339
would take some insane number of years

375
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,260
for them to es essentially crack, be it, be it.

376
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,959
Once you, let's say you generate a weak 2048 bit prime

377
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,239
or back door, whatever we want to call it,

378
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,390
the computational power to still crack that

379
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,380
software or not software, but

380
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,219
to crack the math is significant. Now, granted, it's still

381
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,719
magnitude lower than it is expected to be.

382
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,930
But that's, that's important because let's face it today.

383
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,550
It is thousands of years,

384
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,719
but at some point,

385
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,849
it's not gonna be thousands of years, right?

386
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:40,089
It's going to be something between, you know, probably weeks to days

387
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,300
just because the amount of compute power that is available to

388
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,229
us continues to increase and continues to get much cheaper.

389
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,359
I just think about in, in

390
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,599
50 years, how much,

391
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:53,839
you know, cloud are you gonna be able to buy for five bucks? It's gonna be crazy.

392
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,699
Well, and part of what I mean, the, the good news here,

393
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,910
TLS uh version 1.3 the spec is almost finalized.

394
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,439
They've essentially embraced uh perfect forward secrecy, right?

395
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,339
So the idea behind perfect forward secrecy

396
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,819
is that rather than, you know,

397
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:10,729
use the same sort of set of prime numbers for all your connections

398
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,890
you generate,

399
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,579
you know, new prime numbers, new keys for each session. So

400
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
even if an attacker, you know, sniffs all the data and collects all the data,

401
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,900
that's not how it works

402
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:21,250
at

403
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,390
a

404
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:21,729
high

405
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:22,069
level

406
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,109
EFS

407
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,170
is

408
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,500
you still use Diffie Hellman for the initial key exchange,

409
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,530
which is where the weak primes comes in.

410
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,869
But then what happens is every connection

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,869
or every client, it depends how you, how you put it together.

412
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,750
But essentially, then you have a different

413
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,939
key, be it RS A or ECC or whatever.

414
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,869
Because the way

415
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,670
the older tlss work is a server would literally have one key and every client used it.

416
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,459
So if you broke that one key,

417
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,630
you could unlock all of the data

418
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,989
right

419
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,109
now. We still have the weakness in Diffie Hellman though,

420
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,030
because in many instances,

421
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,250
the server and client are probably using a small number of primes.

422
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,300
So if you have a small prime, it doesn't matter how big your key is,

423
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:07,709
you're going to have problems.

424
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:08,949
Well, yeah,

425
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,500
but the workload for an attacker goes up,

426
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,260
right?

427
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,040
And that is basically the whole point of cryptography, right? Is, is

428
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,099
there is nothing to prevent you from brute

429
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,300
forcing this with the exception that it's so

430
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,400
much work currently that you just can't do it in a reasonable amount of time,

431
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:24,810
right?

432
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,739
Uh I mean, the reality is, you know, you

433
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:31,234
would get fantastically lucky when trying to break a 2048 bit

434
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,045
key and guess the right one on the first try,

435
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,895
you know, it's theoretically possible.

436
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,824
It's just vanishingly improbable.

437
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:42,464
Fire up your Bitcoin mining rig, right?

438
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:42,854
Yeah.

439
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:47,025
So I think the the part of it is we need better primes.

440
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,785
We need to know where they're coming from.

441
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,880
Uh And yeah, like you said, the, the test ability is even with good test ability,

442
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,079
we still have the problem of, you know,

443
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,760
do you really trust the guy and the computer generating this prime number?

444
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,479
Sure. Sure. Sure.

445
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,939
And, and there's some,

446
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I forget, I forget who did this, but

447
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,930
there, there's basically some,

448
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,040
I think it's one of the ni standards defines

449
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,989
how to explain where your primes came from.

450
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,869
But of course, it's not must, it kind of falls under one of those optional,

451
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,339
you know. Yeah, you can do this if you feel like it

452
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,680
definitions and hopefully

453
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,800
that will be adjusted in the future

454
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,520
to make sure we understand where this stuff came from.

455
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,109
Well, it's, yeah,

456
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,310
it strikes me as insane because it's like if you inserted a line of code into open SSH

457
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,719
and refused to say where it came from, like

458
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,459
everybody would be in an uproar.

459
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:40,189
You know what I mean?

460
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,770
You've clearly never tried to add anything to open SSH,

461
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,150
like getting anything

462
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,050
put in there is, is very difficult.

463
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,459
But

464
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,810
yeah, you know, and that's the thing, right? We would never accept random code from.

465
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,969
Well, when you know, where did this come from, why, why, why did you write it this way?

466
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,310
You know, it's trust me, it's good code

467
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,405
and yet we take these prime numbers and

468
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:02,385
part of it is, you know,

469
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:06,854
a lot of projects just go to say open SSL and grab their primes and copy them out

470
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,474
straight up, you know, because what else are you going to do?

471
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:09,885
Well,

472
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,385
I think the assumption is that open SS SS L

473
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:15,694
has done some level of due diligence on their primes.

474
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,619
I don't know if they have, I would assume they have just given the project,

475
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,400
but I probably don't want to really know the answer.

476
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:24,839
Do I?

477
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:29,219
You know, that's one of the things that's even if they've done due diligence.

478
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,589
Uh

479
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,380
you know,

480
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,829
is that enough?

481
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,349
Because like I said,

482
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,300
I looked into the research and there's just not a lot of recent research,

483
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,829
there's not a lot of people with expertise in this publicly.

484
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,099
Now,

485
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,069
I'm pretty sure the NSA has a bunch of guys in

486
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,420
a room that could tell us one way or the other.

487
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,099
-- Uh And
-- if you are one of those guys, you know, you can,

488
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:45,979
you can email us,

489
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:47,420
we'd be happy to,

490
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:47,900
I

491
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,579
don't want to disappear. My family needs me.

492
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,869
But yeah, I mean, that's, that's part of the problem with these, you know,

493
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,479
with these crypto systems is the, the level of knowledge required to even

494
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,510
understand it, let alone do it properly

495
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,319
is, is quite daunting

496
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,209
it. It is, it is, it's man, this is such crazy stuff.

497
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,290
It makes my head hurt even thinking about it.

498
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:10,479
And

499
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,859
well, the good news is Attackers don't really attack crypto because let's face it.

500
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:15,770
Why bother. Right.

501
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,099
Uh I was reading a recent thing. Um, this guy found 6900

502
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,250
card skimming websites.

503
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,180
So basically what the Attackers had done is broken into the website

504
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,400
and essentially installed a software skimmer for the credit cards being entered.

505
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,079
So, you know, like a hardware skimmer. It

506
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,729
your main

507
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:32,869
lo

508
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,609
well, no.

509
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,040
So what this is basically, it's like, it's like a, for example,

510
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,819
it's basically a script plug in for um one of the common

511
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,849
ecommerce packages was uh I think it's called Magenta or Magenta,

512
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:44,680
something like that.

513
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:49,329
And it's used by some large retailers and essentially it just inserted a bit of code

514
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,680
that was labeled uh

515
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,969
ups shipping code

516
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,329
and then it was like script

517
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,250
and then a whole bunch of

518
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:55,880
gibberish,

519
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,109
you know,

520
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,209
and essentially what it does is as, as a person enters, you know,

521
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:03,959
their credit card number and Magenta or Magneto or whatever it's called processes.

522
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:04,199
It,

523
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,229
it was sending a copy of all of that data off to. Well, God knows where Russia China,

524
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,099
some dude in like Texas, who knows.

525
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:13,349
And

526
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:17,910
like, yeah, the guy found this on like 6900. We like big websites.

527
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,229
And the reality is, you know,

528
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,699
Attackers aren't going to like record

529
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,750
the data stream and then run decryption algorithms on it.

530
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,290
They're gonna like break into the server and install this little, you know,

531
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,550
one kilobyte shim of code that then sends them every

532
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,619
bit of data they want in future for the next,

533
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,410
you know, six months until somebody notices.

534
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,670
It's that, that XK CD Comic where,

535
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,359
you know, the guy says, oh, this is how I imagine it.

536
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,390
Oh, no, he's using 4096 bit crypto.

537
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,260
We, we can't break his stuff and they're like, no,

538
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,630
like take this wrench and hit him until he tells you his password.

539
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,390
Right. Like that's

540
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,599
it. It's so true. And I think

541
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,989
that is always going to be the story of crime.

542
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,339
Crime will naturally take the easiest way in

543
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:04,430
and breaking crypto is never the easiest way. But that said now that said though

544
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,829
this kind of research is fascinating and I think it's super important.

545
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,170
So

546
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:14,060
by all means, even though we're going to talk about how, you know, ha ha,

547
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,670
no one's ever going to do this, it is still

548
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,469
super important to the universe that people do this kind of stuff.

549
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,760
Oh, I agree. I mean,

550
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,040
the reality is, if you know, this stuff is important, this data will, you know,

551
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,160
we don't know if anybody's recording it or how long for, uh,

552
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,229
the reality of storage is getting so cheap.

553
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,489
Like I just picked up a four terabyte external drive.

554
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,280
Um, because quite frankly, it was,

555
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:40,739
it was just cheap. So why not?

556
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,199
And uh

557
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,209
never throw anything away.

558
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,449
Yeah, pretty much.

559
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:47,560
Right.

560
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,550
Yeah.

561
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,500
The reality is we don't want to make it too easy for Attackers.

562
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,239
You know, like with the, like, I don't know if you remember, um, oh,

563
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,020
what was it called?

564
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,300
Http S Sheep or the, the one that would basically,

565
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,739
if you had a http unencrypted login page

566
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,599
would intercept it on the fly.

567
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,229
And so when you logged in, normally you would go to a secure site.

568
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:09,430
Well, this would strip it and send you to an insecure site so that it could, then,

569
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,859
you know, sniffle your user name and password.

570
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,780
Fire, sheep, fire sheep. That's the one. Yeah, I knew sheep were involved

571
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,199
in,

572
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:17,609
of course. And, uh,

573
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,290
you know, and so, and, you know,

574
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,010
so the response to that is simply people

575
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,310
put all their login pages as being encrypted,

576
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,170
secure web pages.

577
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,520
You know,

578
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,729
we need these fundamentals,

579
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,949
you know, these building blocks.

580
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,319
Otherwise there's, there's really no point, you know,

581
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,339
if it turns out all the primes we're using are actually divisible by seven,

582
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,819
-- then
-- they're not prime.

583
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:35,979
Yeah.

584
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,500
Well, when I say these prime

585
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:38,459
because, yeah, like I said,

586
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,020
we don't know with a guarantee that they are

587
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,089
prime until we know that they're not a prime.

588
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,209
Yes, I'm going to hope none of them are divisible by seven.

589
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,400
But if something is, I'm blaming you now.

590
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,069
Yeah.

591
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:52,550
Yeah, that was me.

592
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,199
So,

593
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,180
that was me. I did it

594
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:56,410
all right. Anyway,

595
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,459
let's bring this one home. Here's what I'm going to say to everybody listening is

596
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,209
all of the mistakes

597
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,000
we have made discussing crypto

598
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,329
in randomness in primes. And I'm sure there were many,

599
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,500
I want you to tell Kurt.

600
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,670
Ok. So Tweet Kurt on Twitter all about the mistakes we made

601
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,839
and he would be happy to address your concerns in

602
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,680
a future episode of the open source security podcast.

603
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:22,339
Well, that's what I love is,

604
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:26,780
we could be completely wrong and 99% of people wouldn't notice.

605
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:31,199
I, I suspect a handful of the people who listen to us, they know

606
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:31,880
and

607
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,209
so be sure to tell Kurt.

608
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:40,439
So I, I guess that leads us now into the most exciting news of October

609
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,010
is. It's cybersecurity month.

610
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:44,369
I'm

611
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:44,550
super

612
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,119
excited.

613
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,119
Oh, sorry Awareness Month. Right? Because we, we need

614
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,349
plenty more awareness. I'm super excited.

615
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,719
I've, I've had just nothing but a party for the last, you know, 11 days going on here.

616
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,310
I, uh, I didn't find out about this until accident through my feed.

617
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,920
I, you know, I don't even remember how I found out about it,

618
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:08,000
but it's clearly ridiculous and I'm skeptical anyone cares about this.

619
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,619
It's a good,

620
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,459
I think it's

621
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,150
done with good intentions,

622
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,380
-- but I
-- just,

623
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,329
-- everything is done with good intentions.
-- Well,

624
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,839
yeah. No, this is true. Sadly.

625
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,160
But, yeah, fundamentally, I don't understand like

626
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,310
what this reminds me of is, it was funny.

627
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,650
I was actually talking to somebody who works for the FDA, the, um,

628
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,319
the US Food and Drug administration

629
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,359
and the topic of security came up and she's like, oh, you know,

630
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,819
are, things are not so bad, they're getting better.

631
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,339
And I'm like, no, it, it's terrible. Everything's terrible. What do I mean?

632
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,569
I'm like, well, for example, I'm like, you work for the FDA, correct.

633
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:41,979
She's like, yeah. And I'm like, well, do you know, what's your policy on

634
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,329
taking data off of your network and putting it onto removable devices?

635
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,069
She's like, oh, we're not supposed to do that.

636
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,189
I'm like, ok, that's, that's good.

637
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,579
How do they prevent you from doing it? And she's like, well, they told us not to,

638
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,739
that's probably

639
00:27:56,069 --> 00:28:00,729
better prevention than 99% of the organizations on the planet.

640
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:02,660
Which is the best part.

641
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:03,579
Yeah.

642
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,170
And so, I mean, that,

643
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,170
you know, there's nothing I'm like, well,

644
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,300
is there anything technological preventing you, like, did they,

645
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,900
you know, is there software that controls what you can copy data off of or is,

646
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,660
did they hot glue the ports, shut,

647
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,939
you know, whatever, right. She's like, no, they just told us not to,

648
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,630
you know, so cybersecurity awareness I think is a great idea. But the problem is

649
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,050
part of it, like you said is, you know,

650
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,010
what can we actually tell these people that's helpful,

651
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,000
we can tell them to

652
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,420
cry quietly under their desk

653
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,510
and that's probably the best advice we can give.

654
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,229
You know, like I'm always reminded of the whole email thing, you know, it used to be.

655
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,469
Oh, you know, you can open up email safely.

656
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:45,339
Like you can look at an image in your email, you would never get a virus from that.

657
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,670
Just don't run the dot exe.

658
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,099
Well, of course, that change and now it's like, don't, you know,

659
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,770
my favorite all time piece of security advice is because it's so useless.

660
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,119
Don't open data from untrusted sources.

661
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,410
-- I, I don't trust you, Kurt. What do I do now?
-- Yeah,

662
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,569
exactly. You know, except, well, an email shows up in your inbox from your mom.

663
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,209
You trust your mom.

664
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,770
I do not.

665
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,729
So, you know, so that's the thing, right?

666
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:13,030
Is, is every time all,

667
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,369
pretty much every piece of advice of security advice we've ever given people,

668
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,099
you know, Attackers have found a way around.

669
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:21,760
Uh, and so essentially we're at the point now where basic human nature of like, oh,

670
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,709
I found a USB key.

671
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,640
I wonder what's on it.

672
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,719
-- There's no safe way to find out,
-- you know,

673
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,449
Schneer

674
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:31,589
just had a post about this not too long ago where he talks about the fact that

675
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,890
we

676
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:35,339
cannot fix the users.

677
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:36,729
That is,

678
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,050
I, I, it's an impossible task to do.

679
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,890
And so in security we do this all the time where we're like, oh, don't do that,

680
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,219
don't do that, don't do that.

681
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:47,010
Don't do that.

682
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,310
And nobody ever listens to us.

683
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,089
You might have one or two people who sort of take you seriously, but even then

684
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,349
it, they're certainly not going to do it 100% of the time.

685
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,859
And so the only solution

686
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:03,890
is to fix the products the users use,

687
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,359
which is

688
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,560
easier said than done.

689
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,119
Oh, I agree.

690
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,030
I mean, there's, I,

691
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm a somewhat security conscious user and I still make mistakes all the time.

692
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:12,790
Like,

693
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,189
uh, you know,

694
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:17,130
I've entered my password when my kid was watching and so

695
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,430
I had to change the pin number on my phone.

696
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:19,849
You know, because I

697
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,750
figure it out,

698
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,709
-- right? Because he wanted to play games on
-- my phone.

699
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,280
That's what the fingerprint meters for.

700
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,810
-- That's why I
-- got the new one.

701
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,310
Don't nap because they're gonna hold the phone up to your hand.

702
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,810
It's fed

703
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,900
-- off the side of the couch
-- and just don't touch anything

704
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,630
in my house where they can lift a print from it,

705
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,739
you know? Right.

706
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,329
So, you know, that's the thing, right? We, we definitely, I mean,

707
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,300
the other thing that drives me nuts about fixing the users is that,

708
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,189
that presupposes that we have

709
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,709
something safe and useful to tell them,

710
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,349
which quite often we don't like because advice

711
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,430
like don't open data from untrusted sources is,

712
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,310
is useless.

713
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,410
It's meaningless, right?

714
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,430
Especially when viruses are sending out an email, using your address book

715
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:02,989
-- or, you know,
-- people

716
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,920
I wrote about this in my blog. Uh What, what did I title? It?

717
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,979
Don't Eat Food delivered by Zebras and I forget who I had this discussion with.

718
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:11,750
It may have been you,

719
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,359
but it was the fact that

720
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:17,959
we give people advice that they consider to be ridiculous.

721
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,540
And so

722
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,739
if you give someone ridiculous advice,

723
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,579
they'll probably nod and smile because they think you're crazy

724
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,890
and then they just do whatever they want anyway.

725
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,420
And that is basically the history of computer

726
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,579
security summed up into two sentences right there.

727
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:36,560
No,

728
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,459
I think quite frankly that the general solution is

729
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:42,530
to where possible remove humans from the equation.

730
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,719
You know, much like driving, right?

731
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:47,979
People, we can't even get people to reliably use their turn signals, let alone,

732
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:50,699
you know, driving sober or

733
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,459
driving while, you know, eating and texting and doing, you know, a

734
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,140
crossword puzzle.

735
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:58,260
Um

736
00:31:58,569 --> 00:31:59,900
But the problem becomes, you know,

737
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,800
is we've got all these existing systems that

738
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,260
were not really designed with security in mind.

739
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,640
Um And the other problem too is we want these systems to be useful

740
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,449
and to do things that are useful, you know.

741
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,910
Yeah, I mean, so,

742
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,150
and part of it too is do we, do we really need perfect security?

743
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,790
And the answer is obviously not because we don't have perfect security in the world,

744
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:18,910
in the

745
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,229
-- world.
-- No

746
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,699
such thing as perfect,

747
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,000
right? That's the reality of it. You just need to,

748
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,319
it's kind of like the old saying of I don't need to be faster than the bear.

749
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:29,040
I just need to be faster than you.

750
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:29,640
Right.

751
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,650
And that used to be true except now, you know,

752
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,719
Attackers will target everything online.

753
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:35,199
Like that

754
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:39,589
recent denial of service where they, you know, captured and took over 100 and

755
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:43,400
some 1000 digital video recorder systems or whatever. Right.

756
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,170
The problem is now, if you plug it into the internet, you're not

757
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:49,729
an anonymous fish in a big school of fish, you're just a fish.

758
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:52,489
You know, that the bad guys will find at some point.

759
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,329
Yeah. I mean, that's fair. That's fair. It's,

760
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,489
this is complicated. I suppose you can't always use the,

761
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,729
the argument of, I just need to be slightly more secure than the other guy because

762
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,290
it's not even being more secure than the other guy.

763
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,430
You have to have your security bar at a point where it is more inconvenient

764
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:14,140
for the bad guys to attack you than to find something else to do.

765
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:15,099
Yeah.

766
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,270
The problem is that's all been automated now.

767
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,979
So as soon as they find something that you are not secure against then, you know,

768
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,790
-- you're gonna get popped.
-- Right.

769
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,270
Well, and, you know,

770
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,810
that's actually a good point too because if you imagine security as a graph,

771
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:35,270
the graph goes down over time where the amount of security you have essentially

772
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:36,680
decreases

773
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,030
as time goes on.

774
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,339
As security vulnerabilities come out as research like

775
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:43,790
this crazy prime number stuff comes out as

776
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:49,000
people find new ways to attack TLS and we find new ways to attack, you know, you know,

777
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,500
I PV six is coming, I PV six is insanely complex.

778
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,810
I am terrified of the security flaws

779
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,109
that are going to come out in the I PV six stacks.

780
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,329
It's, it's horrifying to me.

781
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,439
Yeah. Well, and this is also,

782
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,640
and that's for the people that apply patches for the people that don't apply patches

783
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,389
or don't do change.

784
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,050
Yeah, exactly.

785
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,030
You know,

786
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:11,850
I mean,

787
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,050
I already have devices in my house that I cannot apply patches to, uh,

788
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,350
my nest smoke alarms.

789
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,228
For example, they get over the air updates. I am told by the company I

790
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,728
trust us. Everything's,

791
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:23,840
yeah,

792
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,000
uh same with my bathroom scale, you know,

793
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,918
Tavis arm and he found a flaw in it that you can use to remotely

794
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
hijack and compromise my bathroom scale.

795
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,560
I'm told it was fixed.

796
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:36,580
Well,

797
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,040
just

798
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,469
hack

799
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:37,688
it. I

800
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,629
asked Tavis for the exploit.

801
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,668
Yeah.

802
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,780
So you know, it's getting to the point rapidly,

803
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,120
especially with the internet of things.

804
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:51,080
Not only am I going to have a large number of internet connected devices in my house,

805
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,199
but it's going to be from a huge number of vendors and you know, each,

806
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,399
every single one of them, it's not like there's some unified control panel.

807
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,659
So you, you know what I do for this actually is I I I'm well aware of this problem

808
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,790
and I additionally don't trust my Children or wife

809
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,830
to use my network.

810
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,870
So I have a guest network essentially for devices and guests and my my kids and wife

811
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,540
because I know whatever devices they have,

812
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,840
are almost certainly crawling with malware

813
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,100
and rather than trying to clean it, I've just segregated all of this stuff.

814
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,850
And so there's, there's Josh's friendly network

815
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:28,939
and then there's everyone else's stuff

816
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,080
and,

817
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,229
I mean, that, that's easy for me to do

818
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,030
but

819
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,229
for normal people that's probably out of the question, unfortunately.

820
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,300
Yeah.

821
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,750
So, I, I don't know what the answers to this are but, um,

822
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,270
it's, it's, you know, it's, it kind of reminds me actually of the, uh,

823
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,870
I hate to bring this up but the Samsung Galaxy seven

824
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,459
thing, you know, where, like,

825
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:52,050
right now there's all these people with this phone that, like,

826
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,169
literally might catch fire and, or explode,

827
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,439
but

828
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,669
once it explodes it's totally secure.

829
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,429
So Samsung has solved the security problem

830
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,729
for us.

831
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:05,110
But, I mean, you know, there was a guy on the radio calling in on his, you know,

832
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,659
Samsung seven or Note seven or whatever the heck it's called

833
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,780
and they're asking him. So, like, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna, like, go

834
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,860
in or whatever, like

835
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:12,219
the fing

836
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,219
phone,

837
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:14,159
you know?

838
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,040
Yeah, I mean,

839
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:15,879
and

840
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,070
even something, you know, where the, the course of action should be pretty clear,

841
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,790
like you're supposed to turn this phone off and go swap it for one that doesn't burn,

842
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:24,750
um,

843
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:25,219
ignoring

844
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,530
the

845
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:25,870
fact that

846
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,280
apparently

847
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:27,939
did you

848
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,659
hear, I think it was,

849
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,260
they

850
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:33,679
said they're discontinuing the line completely. They've given up trying to fix it.

851
00:36:33,689 --> 00:36:34,520
And it's done.

852
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,389
They, they, they, they've given up,

853
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,020
-- which
-- is, I think from a branding perspective, they've killed it regardless.

854
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:40,780
That's

855
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:41,620
-- right.
-- I mean,

856
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,270
and,

857
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,300
and honestly they can just shut the line down and

858
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,050
then restart it with a new sticker on the phone

859
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:46,669
and

860
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,270
probably the intent. Right. Like,

861
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,419
but, uh, you know,

862
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,820
people need their phones.

863
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:55,560
I

864
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,439
also need to

865
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:56,850
not just

866
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,560
burnt.

867
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,600
Yeah. Exploded.

868
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,479
Yeah.

869
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:01,639
Well, apparently, uh,

870
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:03,239
and I didn't even know this was a thing but you

871
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,629
can get these essentially fireproof bags for your phone for recharging them

872
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,790
for people who are like, worried about

873
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,510
their phones catching fire firewall charging.

874
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,800
And what's even more amazing is if you read the fine print on most of these devices,

875
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,719
they specifically say they should not be charged while unattended.

876
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,850
That doesn't surprise me. Well, and so

877
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,250
I remember a long time ago there was a guy named Alan Cox who

878
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,209
worked on the Linux kernel and he worked for Red Hat and I,

879
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,350
I remember dealing with him on a fairly regular basis and at

880
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,459
1.1 of his laptops lit on fire while he was charging it,

881
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,010
which in,

882
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,419
in his story was comical in Ha Ha. That's funny. Right.

883
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:44,520
W which, but it's very serious because people don't realize that

884
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:48,429
lithium ion batteries had the energy density of TNT.

885
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,300
So like these are i it's a big deal.

886
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,169
I mean, I if lithium ion is going to explode, you're going to get hurt.

887
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,429
It's not like, oh ha ha, the battery leaked a little bit of something out of it,

888
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,169
you know, look, it ruined my video game.

889
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,389
No, no. Like this is,

890
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,969
you're going to be seriously injured by this thing.

891
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:08,389
Well, like those houses that burned down because of those, uh,

892
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,070
hoverboard thing, of the jigger with those bad batteries,

893
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,879
you know, that

894
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,270
have now been banned.

895
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,790
Exactly the same thing.

896
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,699
Exactly the same.

897
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:16,770
Yeah.

898
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,040
I, part of me wonders if this is back to,

899
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,550
I don't know if you remember the whole uh Japanese Chinese capacitor

900
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:26,389
shenanigans that happened about 1510, 15 years ago

901
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,600
where apparently what happened is some company uh broke into another

902
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,320
company's uh computer network and stole some of their design stuff

903
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,320
and started producing capacitors, uh

904
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,719
you know, very cheaply that were supposed to be very high quality.

905
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,639
And it turns out they, they didn't get enough information or they didn't do it.

906
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,459
Right. And basically they, they made,

907
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,800
you know, literally billions of capacitors that ended up uh popping and leaking.

908
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,350
Right. And

909
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,010
like my mom had a deal with this where they, they sent a guy.

910
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,199
They're like, oh, yeah, we know exactly what that is.

911
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,479
Uh, you know, we'll, we'll schedule a guy to come over and swap the motherboard,

912
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,919
you know, and he did it in like 30 minutes and,

913
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,070
you know,

914
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,580
there were millions of these motherboards and

915
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,110
other devices affected by these bad capacitors.

916
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,270
You know, due to this industrial espionage that didn't go quite right.

917
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,189
And part of me kind of wonders if that's

918
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,790
the case with some of these battery situations because

919
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:17,870
I mean,

920
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:21,229
obviously it's in Samsung's best interest to make a phone that doesn't catch fire.

921
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:21,669
Like,

922
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,909
from a branding perspective alone, let alone, you know,

923
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,429
ignoring the whole legal issue.

924
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,189
And I can't help but wonder like, how, how did this become such a big,

925
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,699
like this isn't like a single bad batch of batteries,

926
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,000
right?

927
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:34,889
This is,

928
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:40,120
I don't know, it's interesting and it also kind of brings us back.

929
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:43,290
I'll tie this into IOT as well is

930
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,040
who's verifying the safety of all this stuff?

931
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,760
You look at like an automobile and

932
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:52,550
you know, they, they crash cars into each other

933
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:54,879
to figure out is this car

934
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,360
safe or is this car dangerous

935
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,919
and kind of with all this consume consumer products going on?

936
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,780
Who's paying attention to this?

937
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,760
But in, but additionally, the other crazy aspect of that is you and I talk about this

938
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,649
when, when something costs a dollar,

939
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,409
does anyone even care

940
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:17,620
or can you justify the cost of verifying the safety of something?

941
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,419
I mean, it, it's crazy stuff, man.

942
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,469
Yeah.

943
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,320
And, and I'm really curious is how much of the IOT is gonna have a built in battery?

944
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,139
I assume

945
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,919
some of it because you know, you want it to retain settings.

946
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:28,409
I would

947
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,139
expect most of it to have built in batteries. I can't think of any iot devices

948
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,909
that don't come with batteries.

949
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,790
Yeah, I mean, I mean, thinking about it, nothing comes to mind and,

950
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,709
and they put batteries in freaking everything, man.

951
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,469
It's crazy.

952
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:45,669
Yeah. And so, I mean, this, this is, you know,

953
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,149
do we end up with a situation 20 years from now with like, you know,

954
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,110
houses just randomly catching fire and it's normal.

955
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:54,560
I hope not,

956
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,889
you know, because part of it too is

957
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,340
getting, you know, once people get used to this.

958
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,159
So it's like, it reminds me of texting and driving, right?

959
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,419
Texting and driving was not a problem 20 years ago

960
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:08,229
-- because
-- people didn't text 20 years ago,

961
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:08,669
right?

962
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,270
And you know, with this iot everybody's like, and, and myself,

963
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,199
I put myself in this camp of, you know, this iot stuff at home,

964
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:17,350
you know, what do I care? Right. It's kind of

965
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:18,949
the thing that

966
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,120
is

967
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,629
the solution to texting and driving

968
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,389
isn't

969
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,830
telling people not to text because we know that doesn't work.

970
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,340
The solution is going to be self driving cars

971
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,629
totally. So

972
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,830
where does IOT end

973
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:36,110
on this machines taking over the world scale?

974
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,169
So

975
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,860
best case scenario, I think we're going to have to see regulation because Schneer

976
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,649
talks about this actually in a recent essay

977
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:48,100
where where you have market failures, you know, like

978
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,969
in theory, like the market

979
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,449
doesn't want people's houses to burn down because it's bad for their brand,

980
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,810
you know, like Samsung, right?

981
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,810
And so in this case, you know, Samsung is now

982
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,260
hopefully eventually doing the right thing of recalling

983
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,219
all these phones and not selling them anymore.

984
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:02,310
And

985
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,790
for what it's worth as much as we made fun of them,

986
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,409
they're totally doing the right thing

987
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,340
and they're, they're eating their poop pie here.

988
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:11,260
It, it's as bad as it gets,

989
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,300
but I will give them immense credit for making the

990
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,540
correct decision in this instance because a lot of organizations,

991
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:23,459
they will let stuff like this drag out for years. So, I mean, Kudos to Samsung here.

992
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,020
And so I think with the IOT,

993
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,260
we're going to have to see regulation because part of it is,

994
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,219
yeah, I mean, with a $1 light bulb,

995
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,780
there's no way they can afford a security guy to vet the design.

996
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,479
I mean, I, I think best case scenario

997
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:39,439
will have sort of reference software

998
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,080
that they can use, you know, like probably Linux based

999
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,659
uh that's hopefully secure, but even if it is, you know, what about the updates,

1000
00:42:46,669 --> 00:42:48,379
what about the management piece?

1001
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:48,709
You know,

1002
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,659
companies are going to are going to want to put value add on

1003
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,179
top of this and they're probably not going to do so securely.

1004
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:56,389
So

1005
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,899
I'm beginning to think at some fundamental level, the IOT cannot be truly secure,

1006
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,959
at least for a few decades until,

1007
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,060
you know, houses start burning down.

1008
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,510
We get regulation

1009
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:09,360
be secure.

1010
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,370
Well, and here's the worst part, I was talking with somebody about this.

1011
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:13,860
He's like, well regulation is the answer.

1012
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,550
And I'm like, well, in theory, yes. But I'm like, what are we regulating?

1013
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:18,510
He's like, what do you mean?

1014
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,800
I'm like, well, you know, so this, this guy, uh,

1015
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,429
works for the Canadian government and did some stuff with arms control.

1016
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,919
So there, it's relatively simple, you know, this is a missile technology.

1017
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:27,439
This is not a missile technology.

1018
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,360
Well, except, you know,

1019
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:32,840
what about the PS four or these accelerometers that go into smartphones or,

1020
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,139
you know, all these other things, right?

1021
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:36,830
And so he's like, ok, fair enough, you know, it's hard to regulate that stuff.

1022
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,310
And I'm like, well, but with, you know,

1023
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:40,800
with this software and stuff, how do we ha

1024
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,350
we don't even know what to measure in security right now.

1025
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,010
Like, how do we measure software security

1026
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,250
defects per line of code?

1027
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,350
I can't answer that, but we don't even really know that.

1028
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,350
I mean, we, we kind of do but we don't have any hard numbers.

1029
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,010
Well,

1030
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,370
we don't even have a vocabulary or a proper

1031
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:01,409
ontology that identifies all the types of flaws,

1032
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,239
let alone measures them.

1033
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:07,209
We, we do have CWE but it's not complete

1034
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,149
and, and it's already huge.

1035
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:11,889
Um So, you know, that's the thing.

1036
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,979
First of all, we don't even have good ways to describe and measure this.

1037
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,709
So let's assume for a moment we magically

1038
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,629
find good ways to describe and measure this,

1039
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,050
we then need the resources to do that, you know?

1040
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,580
And obviously it's gonna have to be automated because there's so much code.

1041
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,639
And even then,

1042
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:33,100
so then let's say you find something that arbitrarily scores 5.0 out of 10.

1043
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:34,040
Well, then what

1044
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,199
do we ban it? Do we make them fix it? Do we put a tax on it?

1045
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:39,280
I, I don't know.

1046
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:41,189
Right.

1047
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:46,820
Oh, my goodness. I wonder if this is how the discussions went

1048
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:49,949
back when automobile safety

1049
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,409
was becoming a thing

1050
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:52,399
or a

1051
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,510
various consumer product safety?

1052
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,310
I would love, I should try to find some history, uh,

1053
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,389
listeners if you know of any sort of good history about safety

1054
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,830
and in kind of this topic, by all means, let us know because this is,

1055
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,909
this is a fascinating thing to think about. I'm

1056
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,250
part of me thinks

1057
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,729
we're certainly not the first industry to have to think about this stuff.

1058
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:18,169
And another part of me thinks this universe we exist

1059
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,189
in today is unlike any that has come before us.

1060
00:45:22,229 --> 00:45:23,889
-- So
-- it's interesting, you mentioned that, uh, I,

1061
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:27,010
I think a really sad example of this is, um,

1062
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,250
the whole positive train control system that

1063
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,929
has been deployed across a lot of Europe

1064
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,870
and is being deployed across North America

1065
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,830
and has been delayed. Right? They've said it's, it's expensive.

1066
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,149
It takes too much time, blah, blah, blah.

1067
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,300
And they're shooting,

1068
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,330
I believe it is for 2018 to have this idea of what's called positive train control.

1069
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,790
So the idea is that the train is under positive control.

1070
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,909
So you don't get situations like that train going

1071
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,909
into that train station at full speed and,

1072
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:51,760
and, you know, destroying the place

1073
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,580
in New Jersey.

1074
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:58,729
Um, or like those, you know, trains that have taken bends too fast and, and derailed.

1075
00:45:59,260 --> 00:45:59,909
And

1076
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,979
so it's,

1077
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,060
you know, there's a situation where you have the technology, you,

1078
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,120
you even have regulations saying you have to go do this soon

1079
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:08,159
and it's

1080
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,719
not happening terribly, you know, some would say it's not happening fast enough,

1081
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,479
right?

1082
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:14,479
Based on the fact that we still have these hor, you know,

1083
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:17,239
horrifying accidents that are entirely preventable.

1084
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:20,439
And that's a relatively well and I, when I use the word simple,

1085
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,120
I'm making finger air quotes here,

1086
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,030
you know, but that's a relatively simple security problem.

1087
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,969
You know, at least they have defined the problem.

1088
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:29,540
They've defined the solution, they've actually got a working solution.

1089
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,110
They just now have to get it deployed.

1090
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:32,659
You know, we're

1091
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,389
in the software world where

1092
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:34,949
that

1093
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:35,560
we don't

1094
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:35,969
know what

1095
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:37,149
is

1096
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,620
man.

1097
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,300
And train signaling systems are a great example of safety systems that have,

1098
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,959
you know, evolved over, over 100 years because like,

1099
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,209
let's face it when you smash trains together, it's expensive.

1100
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:50,629
-- But
-- I, I would also counter that with the fact that

1101
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,169
anyone can understand

1102
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:55,820
how trains work

1103
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,689
and

1104
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,169
the concept of crashing a train is bad

1105
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,550
is crashing your computer bad is crashing your website bad.

1106
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,010
And the there's no yes or no answer to that.

1107
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,810
It could be bad depending upon what's going on.

1108
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,969
Well, with the IOT, I mean, for example, if I crash your fridge,

1109
00:47:12,979 --> 00:47:15,770
does it then stop chilling your food and you lose all your food in the fridge.

1110
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,590
You know that, that clearly is bad

1111
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:19,229
in my case. No,

1112
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:19,810
because

1113
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:21,600
I will never buy, I say that

1114
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,310
right. I, I have one in two years now, but I will never buy a fridge

1115
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,449
that is connected to the internet because I don't

1116
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:30,629
want it to be connected to the internet.

1117
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,229
I, I would say the same thing about TV.

1118
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,600
S but I'm rapidly approaching a point where I'm not sure I'll be able to buy a dumb TV

1119
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:42,340
-- in my
-- TV is connected to my crappy guest network because it has Netflix on it

1120
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:47,479
and I can watch it and I know it's a terrible mistake and I don't care because

1121
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,340
the,

1122
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,469
the convenience of having Netflix built into my

1123
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:55,260
TV outweighs all of the potential security nightmares.

1124
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,620
I can imagine. It doesn't have a microphone that I'm aware of.

1125
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,439
So I have that going for me

1126
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,649
and let's face it if somebody hacked my TV,

1127
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,149
I, I can't imagine a scenario

1128
00:48:07,439 --> 00:48:11,149
that doesn't involve me just unplugging it, throwing it away and buying a new one.

1129
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:11,530
Right.

1130
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:12,000
Well, you know,

1131
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,100
there was a real good comic talking about the um the evolution of ransomware and

1132
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,139
essentially it showed a picture of a house with all the devices in the house.

1133
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:22,689
You know, saying, for example, I'll make you a cup of coffee for 0.01 bitcoins

1134
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:28,649
or I'll let you open the fridge for 0.01 bitcoins or, you know, I'll make toast. And

1135
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,229
to me that's a really fascinating

1136
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,709
possibility is, you know, what,

1137
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,310
what do you do someday when your fridge says basically I've been hacked, you know,

1138
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,149
deposit $5 or

1139
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:40,370
I will do something bad. I mean, let's face it.

1140
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:43,080
You can't get your fridge fixed for less than $5.

1141
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:46,270
And, and that's kind of how ransomware works today.

1142
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:49,310
It is in the best interest of the ransomware.

1143
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
I,

1144
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,870
I guess operators because I won't even say authors because like you

1145
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:56,270
can buy these things and run them on your own now.

1146
00:48:56,689 --> 00:48:59,510
But it is in the best interest of the ransomware operators to

1147
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,189
ensure that removing the ransomware legitimately

1148
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:03,909
costs more than paying the ransom.

1149
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:08,010
And I think we talked about this at some, some point in the past, but

1150
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:12,209
it's man, everything is on fire literally in some cases.

1151
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,110
So,

1152
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,070
oh my goodness.

1153
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:16,100
I,

1154
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,379
that's all I can handle today.

1155
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:20,560
Kurt, my, my brain doesn't wanna wanna deal with any more than that. So

1156
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,229
I'm gonna tell

1157
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,679
all of our fans out there that at all the show notes,

1158
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:27,620
all the interesting things we've talked about as well as how to

1159
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:30,169
contact us and tell Kurt all about the mistakes we made,

1160
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,229
talking about prime numbers.

1161
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:35,030
You can, you can catch that at open source security, podcast.com.

1162
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,520
Hit us up on Twitter. Let us know what you think. We'd love to hear it. And

1163
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:42,429
with, with that, let's, let's just climb back under our desks and,

1164
00:49:42,439 --> 00:49:44,719
and continue weeping on the current state of security.

1165
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:46,610
Yeah, I'm gonna go buy some canned food.

1166
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:47,590
That's right.

1167
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,320
That's right. Do

1168
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:49,050
the basement?

1169
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,080
All right, folks have a great day until next time. Thanks for listening. Goodbye.

1170
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,449
All.
