Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast number 23 with myself,

1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,229
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,149
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,569
-- Hey, Kurt, how are you
-- doing?

4
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,420
I am doing awesome.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,459
I actually had a really interesting experience during breakfast this morning

6
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:23,280
-- that
-- this story sounds like it could be really funny or, or really disturbing.

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,950
-- Uh,
-- a bit

8
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:24,620
-- of
-- both.

9
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:30,405
Um, so I, I tend to eat breakfast upstairs and, uh, sometimes I like to watch,

10
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:33,275
you know, a little youtube while I'm eating my breakfast.

11
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:37,935
So I, uh, fired up the, uh, the computer.

12
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:41,145
It's a Mac mini hooked up to the TV, because it's basically the cheapest,

13
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,055
quietest computer I could find for a TV.

14
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,985
I accidentally logged in as my own account because, um, well, not accidentally,

15
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:49,075
I had to do a backup of it.

16
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,814
Like I had to run time machine and change the settings.

17
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,334
So I had to log in as myself and not the kids account. Right. Normally the, uh,

18
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,575
that machine is logged in as the kids account, which, you know,

19
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:57,645
they can't break stuff.

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,250
Right.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,020
So I,

22
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:02,200
I logged in as myself because I had to fiddle with

23
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,540
some time machine settings and make sure time machine was running

24
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:11,628
-- and uh I forgot to log out and I of course, fired up chrome and um as
-- yourself,

25
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,609
not the Children,

26
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:16,369
-- well
-- as myself and all the Children and this is the one copy of chrome I

27
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:20,098
have where I don't like log into chrome and I don't have an ad blocker installed.

28
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,329
Oh man.

29
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:24,150
So it's funny, right? Because I typed in like why

30
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,470
like normally on my browser if you hit the Y

31
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,500
key youtube, you hit the A key Amazon.

32
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,809
Do you know like there's just,

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,750
you know, that's just how it is.

34
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:35,760
So I typed in uh yout hit enter,

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,470
right? Because without thinking, right?

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,669
Just like, you know, because I'll end up youtube, right? Of course.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,459
So I actually ended up doing a Google search for Yout, which,

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,519
you know, conveniently enough showed me uh 33 ads, the text ads for youtube, which I

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,180
then I kind of thought it was a little weird because I

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,819
just assumed Google would have bought like one ad for themselves,

41
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,800
but maybe they bought a couple.

42
00:01:56,809 --> 00:02:00,800
So it like shows the screen, right? What do I know? So, whatever, right? Obviously

43
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,779
this ad at the top it says like youtube, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

44
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,610
wwww.youtube.com blah, blah, blah.

45
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,500
And I'm like whatever, click on that, right?

46
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,520
And immediately the TV starts belting out your computer is infected with a

47
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,979
virus and you've got a virus and it shows me on Microsoft,

48
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,970
is it actually saying these words?

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,449
It was audio, right?

50
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,830
And it was like a Microsoft skinned website,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,690
you know, like it was the micro, like it looked like a Microsoft knowledge,

52
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:25,929
like, whatever

53
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,490
saying, like, blah, blah, blah. And, um, I'm talking

54
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:28,710
to

55
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,029
you just like the real

56
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,570
microsoft.com does. Right.

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,690
Exactly. And of course, I'm like, what, you know, because, like,

58
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,250
you know, I haven't eaten breakfast yet.

59
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,429
I haven't had my coffee yet, so I'm not 100% with it. But I'm like, wait,

60
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,839
this is a Mac,

61
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,559
you know.

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,839
Right.

63
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,509
So that's my first clue.

64
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,679
And then I, like, I wake up a little bit more and I'm like,

65
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,080
I probably don't have a virus because like,

66
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,330
this account has never done anything other than like

67
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,589
run time machine and like fiddle the settings.

68
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,130
And, um, so it was a call 1 800 some phone number, your computers infected by a virus

69
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,100
than that

70
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,149
if you don't give out the phone number, Kurt.

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,220
Uh, but even better than that, there was also.

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,160
So I was like, ok, obviously this is like a malware scam type deal, right?

73
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,500
And so I, I took a screenshot and hit back

74
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:19,339
and then clicked on the second link because, hey, I'm kind of curious now

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,750
and it was the same site,

76
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,639
but a slightly different link instead of saying

77
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,029
like your computer is infected with malware,

78
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,500
blah, blah, blah.

79
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,869
It was like something something, something Facebook

80
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,729
and, but these looked like youtube ads.

81
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,223
They were the Google,

82
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,912
-- they were Google ads at the top.
-- It

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,152
-- was
-- like

84
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,552
-- the
-- Google text based

85
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,322
-- ad. But what did the ad say? What was the text?
-- It

86
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:42,503
literally just said www.youtube.com, an online site for videos. And

87
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,902
so it looked like a youtube ad. You clicked it and you clearly went to

88
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:47,832
-- this thing,
-- uh,

89
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:51,902
some hacked website because now if you go to the website dyvry.com or whatever,

90
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:55,302
the, uh, somebody was kind enough to remove all the files,

91
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:55,425
uh,

92
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:58,106
it's now blank. There's not even an error page.

93
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,785
The website itself is actually, was quite nicely done.

94
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:05,156
Uh, there were no spelling errors. Uh, it actually was in like, proper English.

95
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:09,085
If that's the bar, I think we've got problems.

96
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:09,686
Well,

97
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:13,326
come on. Have you read the spam email in your spam folder?

98
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:16,385
Have you read any of the email you get from most people

99
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:16,745
in

100
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:20,065
full of spelling mistakes in van grammar?

101
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:22,848
Yeah. Well, any grammar would be good at this point.

102
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,509
But anyway, so, yeah, it was interesting because,

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,539
ok, the part where, like, people hack somebody else's website and use it to serve,

104
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:30,308
you know, whatever wonky stuff.

105
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,669
Yeah, that's, that's normal. That's just how the internet works now. Right.

106
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,348
But the fact that they had

107
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,588
Google ads that redirected to their thing and it was based on typos, right?

108
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:45,118
-- Like yout, not like typing in youtube or
-- y you know, it's really funny you,

109
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,699
you mentioned this and

110
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,769
when, when I was a buddy, we

111
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:50,399
lad

112
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,709
working as a Cetin at

113
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,380
an ISP,

114
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:59,399
we had a customer that would register like all kinds of misspelled domain names.

115
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:02,200
And like this was, this was a company that sold chairs

116
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,390
and they

117
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,500
literally had like 1000 misspellings and they would call us

118
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,760
at least three or four times a day and say,

119
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,989
hey, buy this domain for us, buy this domain for us.

120
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,190
And it was just, it was kind of bonkers honestly and they just,

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,880
they kept registering these domains traffic

122
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:17,470
though,

123
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,750
you know, I don't know, I have no idea.

124
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,540
In hindsight,

125
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:22,929
I kind of wish I would have crunched some of

126
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,690
the numbers to understand if like this made sense.

127
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,779
Like because back in the day when like you could get ads for click

128
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,475
or not through, click throughs, but for just page views and stuff, right?

129
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,345
People would do that kind of stuff all the time,

130
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:34,915
you know.

131
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,084
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:36,774
And I mean,

133
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:39,005
I know that there's also the people um I don't know

134
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,755
if you remember this from last year or this year,

135
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,244
I guess still this year

136
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:43,125
people

137
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,785
squatting on domains that are like one bite off of a regular domain.

138
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:48,734
So like basically,

139
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,464
you know, so so apparently the deal is when you make a DNS request,

140
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,355
like a packet can get mangled

141
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,295
and like, so let's say for the

142
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:56,524
no,

143
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:56,815
-- no,
-- no,

144
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:59,445
it's not, it's not even just that it's about like,

145
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,369
-- it is
-- a

146
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:00,750
bit.

147
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:01,940
Right. Exactly.

148
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,829
You can have various hardware errors and it, it's not a lot and I'll link to the story.

149
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,399
I forget what the number is but

150
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,679
it, it's, it's nonzero.

151
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,609
Um, anyways, yeah, things like that.

152
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:13,799
Like,

153
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,359
so it's interesting to me because on the one hand

154
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,720
are these bad guys actually buying Google apps for like,

155
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,220
you know, yout

156
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,269
search results because let's face it, right?

157
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,769
Like you're going to get search results for like a ma a ma Z am Ezo, right?

158
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,350
For Amazon, right?

159
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,519
And you send those people to something that looks like amazon.com,

160
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,989
they may not pay attention to the address bar and

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,239
they might type in their credit card number again.

162
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,049
-- I mean,
-- nobody pays attention to the address bar

163
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,160
because I know like traditionally,

164
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,989
one thing everybody does is the defense of DNS registrations,

165
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,320
right? Like

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,100
bob.com Bob with

167
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,959
an O, Bob with a zero Bob with a Q because hey,

168
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,250
there's sort of

169
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:57,950
kind of circles.

170
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,170
And so, you know, I'm familiar with the idea of DNS defensive DNS registrations,

171
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,209
but the idea of like defensive ad registrations because here's the change, right?

172
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,350
Like

173
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,019
I remember what was it about 5, 10 years ago?

174
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,480
That's when all the web browsers, the address bar turned into also the search bar,

175
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,760
right? That's the thing to remember, right? Folks is that

176
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,510
it used to be that address bar, you type something in it.

177
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,910
Better be a valid DNS or URL or you get an error.

178
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,809
Now, it's like it'll do the DNS look up and if that works great,

179
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,559
it'll send you there and

180
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,929
it doesn't work, it'll send you like Google and do a search.

181
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,399
Um Which is really fascinating because I know, um, apparently columbia.co was uh

182
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,450
well, but here's the really cool part, right?

183
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,470
Because Google Chrome, for example,

184
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,950
and some other browsers in an attempt to be faster

185
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,739
will do things. Like if you type in like google.co, it'll be like, oh,

186
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,489
you're probably going to like

187
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,359
that domain. I'm going to look it up right away.

188
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,440
Right?

189
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:57,109
And so of course, because people type like.com dot You know,

190
00:07:57,119 --> 00:08:02,260
you type.com Columbia was basically typo squatting all of.com,

191
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,730
right? There's, there's articles but it, it was, it was unreal, right?

192
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:07,380
Because, you know,

193
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,589
and especially now because we have how many new top level domains that are actually,

194
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:10,750
there's

195
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,179
an infinite number now. It's completely crazy.

196
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,380
Apparently,

197
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,839
I there was some discussion about like should local host be a

198
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,619
reserved top level domain or should they be allowed to sell it?

199
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,690
-- I like,
-- didn't they end up selling it?

200
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,000
Which is freaking nuts

201
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,200
dot local host? Yeah. Um It's reserved, apparently, still reserved. Thank God.

202
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,460
But I know my like my current ISP back in the

203
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,359
day when they started out with high speed uh cable modems.

204
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:39,840
This is like, oh my goodness, this is like 9899.

205
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,159
So long ago anyways,

206
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,770
they would let you pick a host name like Bob or Dave or whatever dot ISP dot C A.

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,219
And so me being a smart ass, I picked local host

208
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,719
and then my modem just like lit up,

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,330
you know, because here's the thing, right?

210
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,890
When your, when your computer system looks for a name, uh for example,

211
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,599
when it looks for local host, it actually looks for local host dot

212
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,059
whatever you put in as your default search domain first that

213
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,719
either fails or ideally,

214
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:11,049
a lot of places do list an actual explicit like local host dot Like

215
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,539
cried.org is 1 27.0 0.0 0.1 right?

216
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:15,799
So you end up at the right place.

217
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,239
Um And if that fails, then it tries like just local host and goes, oh yeah,

218
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,359
I know what to do with that now.

219
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:25,080
But uh yeah, so I basically set my host name to local host and then my,

220
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,489
my cable modem lit up and I was able to log into

221
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,599
the web page to change my host name back to something else.

222
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,250
So I had to phone the, the is the uh one of the uh cis

223
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,419
AINS there and I was like, uh Kevin. Yeah.

224
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,299
Uh Remember that thing where you let people choose a host name.

225
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,039
He's like, yeah, and I'm like

226
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,750
it, let me choose local host

227
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,510
because the funny thing is they actually had a black list of stuff like a men male,

228
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,710
like host names that they used

229
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,780
and then they actually started adding a black list of names that were like,

230
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,010
sort of official looking

231
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,869
-- and, and apparently local host, eventually
-- you should add local host to that

232
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,020
because I just did. And well, yeah, now my, my internet connection is melting.

233
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,979
That is awesome. And you totally got what you deserved.

234
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,260
Well, but, you know, it was fun.

235
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,599
I should have really been running a sniffer though.

236
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:14,469
Oh my goodness, man, you, no, no,

237
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,179
no, no.

238
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,919
-- You
-- know,

239
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:21,770
-- violating all kinds of laws.
-- I remember hearing stories about stuff like this where

240
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,280
I haven't heard any recently. I'm sure this still happens. But

241
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,669
there, there's a story I heard of this,

242
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,260
this an old Geezer hacker one time was doing some testing and he was basically,

243
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,750
this was pen testing before it was called pen testing, right?

244
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,309
And, and he essentially sends an exploit into the NTP server of this ISP

245
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,859
and he had it set up a reverse shell

246
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:48,940
because he wanted to prove to them. It's a problem, right? And, and here he sets it up.

247
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,510
So the,

248
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,710
the, the use net post shouldn't leave this one server

249
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,520
and lo and behold, they screwed up their, their NTP server, NNTNNTP.

250
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,669
It was called, right? Yeah, NNNNTP server

251
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,250
and then put it out on all of use net.

252
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:10,590
And so this, this dude had like reverse shells coming in from all over the place I was,

253
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,440
like, what do you even?

254
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:11,549
I

255
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,739
guess he unplugged his internet connection because he's like,

256
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't even know what to do with this.

257
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:18,440
-- Like, it's like
-- that guy with the excess or whatever on Facebook that, like,

258
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,320
turned into.

259
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,820
Right. Right. Like, yeah, like that.

260
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:25,109
It was just like, all of a sudden it's like, boom, I have a million friends.

261
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,940
And then did they? I think they, they killed his account, didn't they?

262
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:32,200
Oh,

263
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,250
yeah, they're, they're not going to be nice about that

264
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:38,150
-- anyway.
-- Anyway, so back to your fake site.

265
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:41,460
I took a screenshot of it and yeah, it was just, it was really fascinating. Right.

266
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,880
Because I understand,

267
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,520
you know, like, it's just, I've never encountered,

268
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,770
I've never encountered malware and whatnot through advertising because

269
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,890
I always have U block origin and, um, the Efeffs, uh, the effs

270
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,780
privacy badger thing installed, which privacy badger is super awesome, by the way,

271
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,789
kind of a bit of ac pu hog comparatively, but

272
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,940
like, super awesome for, well, privacy and blocking ads, you know,

273
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,409
it basically doesn't allow third party sites to do dumb stuff.

274
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,690
And so, you know, it's funny. Right, because

275
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,030
I'm just not used to seeing ads on the internet.

276
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,289
Right. So when I do accidentally browse

277
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,520
-- with a browser that doesn't have ad blocking, I'm kind of like, oh, what's
-- that?

278
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,890
You know, it's really funny. So I, I did that. I was,

279
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,669
I've got my ad blockers and

280
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,890
I was, I was at somebody's house and they had loaded,

281
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,190
I think it was Facebook and I looked, and I'm like, what's wrong with your Facebook?

282
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,849
It's like, but seriously, you don't have an ad blocker.

283
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,229
It has so much garbage on the screen. It's unusable.

284
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,409
I mean, it's not even recognizable. Honestly.

285
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,340
You're, yeah. Right. Exactly. You are totally the product.

286
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,789
You are not the customer.

287
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:48,950
But,

288
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:53,710
so anyway, but here's the deal with, with you finding the, the,

289
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,510
the ad that's obviously, I, I think

290
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,119
I'm comfortable calling this malware.

291
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,320
Right? Is

292
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,419
definitely

293
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,609
I'm guessing they would have had me either give them my credit card number or,

294
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:12,239
-- you know, install this like teamviewer dot exe, not
-- ransomware dot exe.

295
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:13,239
Yeah,

296
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,349
totally legit. Don't

297
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:15,739
panic. Do.

298
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:20,909
But here's the deal when I think about all of this stuff is

299
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,549
the bad guys. They're fitting into society in amazing ways.

300
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,919
And this reminds me sometimes of

301
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:30,409
during prohibition in the United States,

302
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,150
the mob was essentially a business

303
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,429
and you even look at organized crime today.

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,580
You hear these stories about like they operate like a

305
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,609
business and that's what these guys are starting to do,

306
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,289
which is just crazy.

307
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,150
I mean,

308
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,929
they're, they're basically,

309
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,010
they figured out what the rules are that everyone else uses and they're,

310
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,359
they're just bending them in their own way.

311
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,150
It's, it's crazy.

312
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,580
Well, what gets me here is, um, I mean,

313
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,590
this stuff works because here's a great example.

314
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,609
It's on the register.co.uk.

315
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,989
Uh and it's talking about and this is what uh Los Angeles to

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,150
extradite bloke from Nigeria after scores of city workers fall for fish scam.

317
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,429
So apparently some Nigerian scammer actually emailed like

318
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,479
everybody who works for Los Angeles.

319
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,830
But here's the thing. So

320
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,049
the L A District Attorney's office claimed in May that

321
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,049
uh sorry claimed on Friday that in May of this year 2016,

322
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
last name O Ona

323
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:25,409
Ginor,

324
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm butchering that

325
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,340
sent the emails to more than 1000 Los Angeles counties, 100 and 20,000 employees.

326
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:35,289
So basically he had up like less than 1% or roughly 1% of the

327
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,530
total employees

328
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,989
of the 1000 employees.

329
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,905
100 and eight of the messages tricked

330
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,125
users into handing over their login credentials to

331
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:44,224
service portals.

332
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,294
Now this isn't

333
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:45,424
like,

334
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:46,534
like

335
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:47,114
that's

336
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:47,335
a

337
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,414
-- 10% success rate for like, please give me your password.
-- That's

338
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:55,034
right. Actually is there have been a lot of studies done on fishing and it's

339
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:58,244
like 10 to 30% is about what you can expect

340
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,085
for

341
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:01,924
when you have 100 and 20,000 people working for you. I mean,

342
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,054
you're up to like you, you're done,

343
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:07,765
right? And so this is exactly the point right is

344
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,780
we will never stop fishing.

345
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,229
Fishing is

346
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,549
it it, it exploits the human, we can't patch people.

347
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,429
And so there is no way to fix,

348
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,479
you know what,

349
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,429
-- I'm gonna have to disagree for you for one moment because it just came across
-- my

350
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:25,880
anti

351
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:26,400
fishing.

352
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:32,320
Uh No. Uh Uber runs their own email I DS, system

353
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,739
engineering security through Uber's custom email I DS

354
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,200
and it starts off with fishing is one of the

355
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,280
largest and most difficult challenges for any enterprise security team.

356
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,419
It's the greatest equalizer of security. We all have to deal with it.

357
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,719
Well executed fishing attacks can trick people

358
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,580
into making simple yet costly mistakes.

359
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,619
One way companies go blah, blah, blah, blah,

360
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,400
blah at Uber, we decided to build our own email ideas for a couple of reasons.

361
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,500
Number one to drive operational benefits

362
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,080
and price extensibility and performance.

363
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,010
Number two to exercise full control over features and alerts

364
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,080
so we can adjust to evolving threats in real time.

365
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,940
And number three

366
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,969
to capture advanced insight for debugging intrusion alerts

367
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,840
and email processing at Uber in general.

368
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,760
Anyways,

369
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,280
um we'll obviously post a link to it in the

370
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:15,809
show notes but like seriously this thing is really interesting.

371
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:16,760
It does,

372
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,520
it sounds awesome and it sounds like something that everyone should be doing.

373
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,659
But again,

374
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,390
we're not.

375
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,950
Well, the reality is we can't fix the people, right?

376
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,320
There's a certain subset of people where you, you,

377
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,580
you ask them nicely for money and they'll just give it to you,

378
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:34,950
right?

379
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,330
And part of that is because humans

380
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,369
and large are nice people.

381
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,979
-- That's
-- why they like as seen on TV section exists in the, in the,

382
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:44,080
-- you
-- know,

383
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,179
struggling with those Tupperware, man. That thing can be tough.

384
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,429
Um,

385
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:48,989
I, I

386
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:52,510
hate to say, I love that subreddit where they, they take those, uh,

387
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,219
those I've seen on TV, like the,

388
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,890
the bits of the video where the people are struggling

389
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,210
with whatever product they're trying to sell a solution for,

390
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,890
you know, and they like me subtitle it and it's just, it makes me laugh.

391
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,280
But,

392
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,630
um, no, but the reality is, here's the reality, right?

393
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,380
Like I, I don't have the expertise to build like an anti fish ID system for my family.

394
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,699
You know,

395
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:16,280
like I'm sure my kids would be more than happy to go find daddy's wallet

396
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,300
and hand over his credit card number to get like some online game or something.

397
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:25,239
Yes, you're probably unfortunately correct.

398
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:30,599
Um, which I believe you had brought, uh, you mentioned something earlier

399
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:34,290
-- that you maybe want to mention on the show.
-- Which particular thing would that be,

400
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,910
-- uh
-- the Mario thing? Oh,

401
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,810
the Mario Run.

402
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,359
Right. Right. So, so

403
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:41,359
who don't know is I,

404
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,930
I unfortunately don't have it because I don't have an Apple device.

405
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,290
But

406
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,949
so Nintendo, who I am a huge Nintendo Fanboy.

407
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,550
Nintendo creates an app called Super Mario run, which is one,

408
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,540
just one of those endless runner type games with all the Mario characters,

409
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,229
which of course,

410
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,949
I'm, I'm the person that like you could, they, they could like,

411
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:04,189
put poop in a box and call it Mario or Zelda and like I'm gonna get it right.

412
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,739
I'm gonna get it and I'm gonna show it to everyone. I know and talk about how cool it is.

413
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:12,420
So, anyway, Super Mario run it. It's like 10 bucks on I OS

414
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,109
and there is nothing for Android. And of course I hear about Mario run.

415
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm like, the first thing I do is I type it into the Play store.

416
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,520
I got bad news for you, buddy. It's free on Apple.

417
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,900
I thought it was. No, no, you can download it for free.

418
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,270
But no, no, no, like you get,

419
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,910
I guess like a crap demo level and then to actually play the game,

420
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
you have to give them 10 bucks.

421
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:31,270
Right.

422
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,239
Right. Right. So, anyway,

423
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:34,839
anyway,

424
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,640
I, of course, type it in the play store. Nothing there.

425
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,640
And then I type it into Google and there are plenty of Super Mario run

426
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:47,020
A PK si can download and install on my phone and I'm like, yeah, I'm not doing that.

427
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,550
But so there's, there's a

428
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:49,449
story. It's an awesome

429
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,060
dude.

430
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:51,670
Right.

431
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:52,689
So I hear,

432
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:55,250
no,

433
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,239
no, I hate, I hate malware.

434
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,630
But, but so, so here's the thing, right? Is,

435
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,959
is, this is a,

436
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:05,510
this is totally related to people not knowing really what they're doing and,

437
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,890
and this even kind of goes around fishing and it is very related to your, your, I guess

438
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:13,349
yute search is that, is y out a word? I hope it's a word.

439
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,349
But anyway,

440
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:18,489
So, so here's the point though. So yut is not in the dictionary, unfortunately,

441
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,099
but we'll fix it.

442
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:20,900
So,

443
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,750
so anyway, but, but here's the deal, right is when

444
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,550
there is a hole

445
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:32,310
in the universe for some reason, I if, if the good guys don't fill it, the bad guys do.

446
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,750
And this Mario run is a perfect example of that where

447
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,290
the good guys don't make it for Android.

448
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,260
-- So of course, there are copies of it for Android. The
-- ever classic.

449
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,030
What is it like lonely Singles in your area? Wanna talk

450
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,459
-- to you?
-- Right.

451
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,000
-- No, no,
-- they

452
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,410
won't.

453
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,819
Right. Right.

454
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,760
-- It's
-- human nature. Just

455
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,000
wait till we've got A I bots powering that stuff.

456
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,189
You build it for like five bucks from Amazon.

457
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,329
You be able to start up your own only singles. 900 service.

458
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,530
Um Well, you can already do that. Remember.

459
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,010
Um, Amazon announced, what was it, Amazon Parrot, which does the text to speech

460
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,545
in um,

461
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,464
what was it like two dozen languages and 40 some accents.

462
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:18,564
Yeah, but I'm sure, you know, it's a computer.

463
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:21,344
Well, I, I figure it's like probably like my Apple, my iphone,

464
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,285
I actually set it to the male British accent so that I can pretend it's my butler.

465
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:28,964
Ok. So the way the Apple phone uh works is you can select a variety.

466
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:32,645
I think it's about four or five different uh, voices and either male or female.

467
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,305
And you have a choice of like um, like American English, British English,

468
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,244
Australian English

469
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,859
and the way they pronounce things, especially names,

470
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,180
like my last name is way different.

471
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,260
And so I have the British male voice set because then I

472
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,380
-- get to pretend it's my butler because he's like calling Melanie
-- Smith.

473
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:54,020
Your English accent is top

474
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,359
notch.

475
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,750
Well, you know,

476
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,060
the best part though about English English is they pronounce aluminum

477
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,219
aluminum,

478
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:04,219
which is like the greatest thing ever.

479
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,880
I just, I remember finding out that in Australia they actually spell tire, like,

480
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,359
like the thing on your car tyre.

481
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,619
-- And I'm like,
-- they do that in the UK too, don't they? It's tire,

482
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,359
tire

483
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,739
tire.

484
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,849
I'm just trying to think of top gear and I've never seen them spell it.

485
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,489
-- So
-- you

486
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,680
-- want
-- to know what's really funny is, so, I,

487
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,290
I worked for an Englishman for, like, 10 years

488
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,550
-- and
-- I don't even,

489
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,829
I don't, whatever,

490
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,239
a gentleman from the UK will say that.

491
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:38,310
And

492
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,439
I say so many English iss

493
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:42,920
like, like UK iss

494
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,729
that the people in here in America, they laugh at me constantly.

495
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,430
I don't even know I'm doing it. And so,

496
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:53,109
like, yeah, I, I'll read words written in, in the Queen's English

497
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,329
and, like, my brain doesn't even register it.

498
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,219
And everyone else is like, ah, look at those idiots spelled tyre wrong.

499
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,630
I'm like, what? No, they didn't.

500
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,859
I've actually, yeah, for Color Center and a variety of different words

501
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,229
when I write them in

502
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,869
emails to my family.

503
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,829
I spell them in Canadian English, which is essentially British English.

504
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,349
-- But when it's a work related it's American English.
-- God bless English.

505
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:17,510
The greatest language ever.

506
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,050
But, yeah, I know.

507
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,239
It's, um, well, I've actually had a related thing with, uh, to the Mario speed run.

508
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,589
So,

509
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,630
one of my kids loves this youtube thing called boba

510
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,319
-- boob A and it's totally safe for work. It's like
-- a little

511
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,709
computer

512
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,859
-- is a
-- little,

513
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,930
it's a little computer generated um,

514
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,780
like cartoon essentially. Um

515
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,719
But is like the sort of little like Russian troll thing.

516
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,000
-- It's like
-- a little hairy guy

517
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,239
who's like

518
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,910
horrifying.

519
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,109
Look at this face.

520
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:47,729
It's like,

521
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,939
it's a head

522
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,069
with legs and arms. This is like, what

523
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,780
little kids

524
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,489
anyways, he loves this guy

525
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:55,589
and there's like, you know,

526
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,569
he gets into all sorts of adventures like where

527
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,750
Aruba tries to attack him or he sets the kitchen

528
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,020
on fire or he breaks into a bakery and

529
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,329
needs all the packaging and not the cake anyways,

530
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,119
my kid loves this thing and I accidentally found out that there's like

531
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,000
there's two BBA apps.

532
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,660
Oh, and uh so people know Bubba is a of Russian origin, but it's not verbal.

533
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,680
It's just like there's no talking in these things.

534
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:19,910
So anyways, of course, he wants these two apps. So I install them

535
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:21,489
and the first thing they do

536
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:25,410
is they install and then I load them up and they say downloading content

537
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,660
and it's like 60 megs of stuff from somewhere in Russia

538
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,569
bear.ru.

539
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,650
Well, so the good news is as far as I can tell, it's only ad based spam.

540
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,489
So at the top of the app it shows like a little banner with like,

541
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,420
-- click here to buy a car or click here to, like, learn about
-- it all in Russia.

542
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,319
Uh, no, it's in English because, you know, they know the target market.

543
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,680
But it got me thinking, I'm like, I really hope this Russian software is not like,

544
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:52,089
just

545
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:52,750
using my

546
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:53,650
phone,

547
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,209
whatever.

548
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:00,300
And, um, yeah, you know, it's just, and all this and the one app just does not work,

549
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,619
right?

550
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,810
Like, it just doesn't work properly at all.

551
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:05,089
And my son's like, wow, you know, I'm like, well,

552
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,859
because it just doesn't work like we tried turning it off and on.

553
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:08,459
I don't know,

554
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,430
I got nothing but they love this app and

555
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,869
it's so frustrating because I don't trust this app.

556
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,750
I don't trust the people that wrote it.

557
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,510
This creature is clearly untrustworthy

558
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,810
the attic episode where he like, it's actually pretty well done and amusing.

559
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:25,250
Like with the little voodoo doll and the Snow Globe and stuff, it's,

560
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,160
you're not convincing me.

561
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,680
This is what,

562
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,790
you know, it gets me like is realistically like what happens

563
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,589
if halfway through playing a game or something, the ads, the, the,

564
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,489
the game says something like,

565
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,630
you know, you can unlock everything in this app.

566
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,930
All you gotta do, go find your dad's wallet and, like,

567
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:47,729
put his credit card in front of the thing and we'll take, you know,

568
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,660
we'll verify your identity and what they're really doing is like,

569
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,729
taking a picture of it and sending it somewhere

570
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,020
and it, like, takes a picture of the front and back of your credit card and send it to,

571
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,219
you know, sends it to somewhere.

572
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,839
But why even do that?

573
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:03,900
There's probably easier ways to get people on a device

574
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,020
to hand over something of value actually on the device.

575
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:09,540
Well, but a six year old,

576
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,260
yeah, but

577
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:11,739
I mean,

578
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,900
because I've got their devices locked down and more

579
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,439
to the point there's nothing on their devices.

580
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,359
They can do like, they don't

581
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:16,719
have

582
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:17,219
the

583
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,680
card

584
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:17,849
and

585
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,119
do the same thing. My kids

586
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,699
like, yeah, he did, I'm gonna buy this app. Nope.

587
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,410
Even the people I know that aren't savvy are using like the uh, you know,

588
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,439
the apple uh family plan and stuff to like lock down their devices because,

589
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:33,099
you know, there's been those cases where those kids spent like, you know,

590
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:35,880
like $6000 on one game like

591
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,109
rubies or whatever to like buy

592
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,829
rainbow ponies or Lord knows what.

593
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:45,189
But I live in fear because like what happens if my kids snake

594
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,839
my wallet and go to Amazon and set up a new account.

595
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:48,010
But

596
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,599
here's ok. So first of all, that's why you have a credit card

597
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,949
because it's, it's the credit card company's money and even if your kids steal it,

598
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:00,719
I'm sure there's rules going on here. Right.

599
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:04,380
If somebody steals a credit card because of an action your Children take,

600
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:09,040
you're still not going to be liable for those purchases because it's still fraud.

601
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,719
Right.

602
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:14,199
Now. If they go to Amazon and they order a whole pile of crap,

603
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,750
you just send it back.

604
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,560
Right.

605
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,229
Assuming you can't get it canceled,

606
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:19,790
your

607
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,199
account gets blocked or canceled.

608
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,040
Amazon might do that. I mean, rightly so, but whatever, whatever, right.

609
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,000
The point is that

610
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,800
what you're talking about is

611
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:35,540
I would say a, if I was going to do a threat model of my concerns of, of,

612
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:41,369
we'll say malware type or, or, or organized crime attacking like my Children.

613
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:42,739
That's

614
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,180
not on the list.

615
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,979
Right.

616
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,839
It's unlikely. But, you know, it's just me being paranoid. Right.

617
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:49,729
Yes,

618
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,180
because my kids are becoming smart enough to understand that there's,

619
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:58,060
they understand that the credit card is a thing that, for example, if they had one,

620
00:26:58,069 --> 00:26:59,540
they could get skins in Minecraft.

621
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,010
Uh, you know what though?

622
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,890
Like you're right and, and I, I remember that age when my Children were that age,

623
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,729
but they've also reached a point now

624
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,290
where they understand that's not how it works.

625
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,569
And,

626
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,819
and so part of it is I've spent a

627
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:17,209
significant amount of time already trying to teach my Children

628
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,319
about money.

629
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,719
Ok. That's fair. But then that's their own fault.

630
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:23,119
But again,

631
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,880
that's why you have a credit card and it's not your problem because the liability.

632
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,969
But I mean, so, so seriously, actually let's talk about that. Right.

633
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:34,890
We're talking about this, this malware and fake things and what's going on.

634
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,040
And if we look at the credit card industry,

635
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:41,540
they've solved some of this problem by shifting the

636
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,020
risk from the consumer to the card issuer.

637
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:48,750
Right. Like that's a model that works

638
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,180
because the people don't really have to care if

639
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,339
someone steals your credit card and they buy,

640
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,810
you know, $10,000 worth of chocolate.

641
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,819
It's not your problem.

642
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,260
I mean, yeah, you might have to deal with a little bit of crap to get it dealt with. But

643
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:07,390
-- fundamentally
-- what frustrates me fundamentally though is ultimately,

644
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,530
do these people build security systems or do they just pass the cost on?

645
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,569
Well, that's,

646
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:16,849
yes. Yes, that's an excellent point. And that's kind of where I was going with.

647
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,569
This is, it's not about

648
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:21,020
building insecurity necessarily.

649
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:24,589
It's about understanding where your risk is,

650
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,130
but it's about ensuring that the

651
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,010
correct organization carries the appropriate risk

652
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,890
because if we expect an end user and this is, again,

653
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,140
we'll tie this into the fishing conversation if

654
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,680
we expect an end user to have the knowledge

655
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,560
to avoid dealing with this stuff.

656
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,439
I, we fail every time. Right.

657
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:48,079
Well, it's, it's actually part of my, uh, security economics course.

658
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,880
They specifically talked about how in the UK financial system,

659
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,040
the banks were able to hand

660
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,430
the risk over to customers. So, guess what happened for online banking security.

661
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,479
Right.

662
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,239
Well,

663
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:03,560
if the customers got,

664
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:04,599
you know, whacked on

665
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,520
this until some laws were changed,

666
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,130
you know.

667
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,209
No, I agree.

668
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:09,479
I mean,

669
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:10,670
part of it is we want to create

670
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,180
an environment where bad behavior is dis incentivized,

671
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:16,959
which is a fancy economic term for, we're going to smack you

672
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:18,314
a two by four if you do it.

673
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:20,944
And that good behavior is incentivized,

674
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,604
which is again a fancy term for saying if you do the right thing,

675
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,405
we'll give you a hug and a cookie.

676
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:26,805
You know,

677
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,984
so, you know, like with my kids, for example, right?

678
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:30,765
I'm trying to teach them like, yeah, we can, you know,

679
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:33,584
we can spend money online but we have to do so carefully and we

680
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:36,314
have to make sure we actually want this and that it's like legitimate.

681
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,405
And I, for example, been trying to teach my kids that like,

682
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:40,474
and I've had some success with one of them that like,

683
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:42,765
advertising is theft of your time,

684
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:44,319
right?

685
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,839
And he actually seems to understand this a bit. But,

686
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,680
you know, I'm like, oh, this ad, it has

687
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:53,050
a, this app has ads in it. I'm like, it's stealing your time. He's like, what?

688
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,719
And I'm like, you're spending time getting rid of that ad.

689
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,540
That's time you can't spend playing the game.

690
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:02,630
-- He's like, oh, I'm like, yeah, it's bad. Huh?
-- I have a great story.

691
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,250
This is so my, my daughter has this game on her app.

692
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,540
This, this podcast episode is like the parenting extravaganza that's in it.

693
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,609
But, but my,

694
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,589
so my daughter has this app and,

695
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,589
and she kept setting the tablet down on the couch and going over and

696
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,310
getting a piece of candy

697
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,060
out of the candy dish. Like a very small piece. Right? And I'm like,

698
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,349
what's going on?

699
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,959
He's like, oh, they keep playing these videos as ads and I don't want to watch them.

700
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:32,890
So I just go eat candy. I'm like, that's awesome. That is so cool.

701
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,449
I just remember when youtube started introducing mandatory ads

702
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,329
and I showed my kids the skip ad button and they would

703
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,750
just sit there going ba

704
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:41,910
ba,

705
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:43,569
you know,

706
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,050
because it's like you have to watch five seconds

707
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,699
of the ad before it'll let you skip it.

708
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,709
And they would just sit there like smacking away

709
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,579
on that skip ad button until you know,

710
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,750
the five seconds elapsed.

711
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,290
And I was like, ok, you can just, just wait for the button to, you know, like sit down.

712
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,339
It's more fun

713
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,079
doing something.

714
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,069
Yeah. But uh yeah,

715
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,709
I am really curious because this whole, let's face it,

716
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:05,380
micro payments for content will never happen, right.

717
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,699
It's just too much hassle,

718
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:10,040
-- too much decision
-- making would never say never,

719
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,189
ok, fair enough.

720
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,939
Um But the advertising model is between the people like you and me who

721
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,660
you know,

722
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,579
will only ever surf the web with ad blocking enabled

723
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:22,560
and our Children as well and their friends and whatnot

724
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,979
and combined with the fact that, you know,

725
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:25,760
we're teaching them explicitly like that.

726
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:25,949
Yeah.

727
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,819
Like, advertising is stealing your life, like,

728
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,739
it's stealing minutes out of your life.

729
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,489
So, it's evil and sorry to all the advertisers out there.

730
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,020
I guess that means we can't have advertisers on the show. Hey,

731
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,520
uh, I think I'm comfortable saying that won't happen. But

732
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,829
-- if somebody came to us with a million bucks, we'd
-- take it.

733
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:45,839
I would do almost anything for a million dollars,

734
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,510
you know,

735
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,900
audience that you heard it here.

736
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,790
But, but ok, so, so here's the deal is I read a story the other day that was claiming

737
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,290
there's something like $7 billion in, in ad fraud

738
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,449
in

739
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,609
this was, this was a story about, I think it was on Krebs site about this.

740
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,150
Yeah,

741
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,660
-- that's right. That,
-- that it was $5 million usa

742
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,329
a day

743
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,530
because they were basically,

744
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,849
they built like this whole fake infrastructure to essentially load ads and,

745
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:16,739
and have just computer

746
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:18,314
pretending to be people

747
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:19,415
-- and they were
-- collected

748
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:20,974
-- load ads for the
-- right.

749
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:31,015
Here's the deal, right? Is you read this and they said something like $7 billion

750
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:32,625
in ad fraud a year.

751
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:36,474
You're talking, that's like 10% of the whole online ad industry.

752
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,439
Is there any other industry out

753
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:38,719
there?

754
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,290
It's that low

755
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:41,650
to be honest with the online ad

756
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,170
because I remember back in the,

757
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,910
remember those things where you got like paid to surf.

758
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:48,489
This is a long time ago folks.

759
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,589
So the concept was like, literally,

760
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,170
I think it was part of it was just pure old market research.

761
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,329
So they'd install like a browser plug in or something that would

762
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:59,469
like basically watch you web surf and the more so you surf,

763
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,209
the more you got paid and you could actually make like a few bucks

764
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,583
a day doing this.

765
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:05,792
So people would basically just set up like farms of

766
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:10,333
cheap P CS with scripts to like grind through websites

767
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:14,123
and make, you know, a couple 1000 bucks a month. Like it was insane. Like,

768
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:17,692
I remember places where we got paid per 1000 click and we got

769
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:22,662
-- paid upwards in some cases of like 20 or $30 for
-- 1000 clicks

770
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:24,383
worth

771
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:26,383
seven cents now.

772
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:27,343
Maybe

773
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:29,725
so. But here's the thing, right? So what happens?

774
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:32,776
Well, I got really good at getting my stuff on slash dot

775
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,375
Because you get 100,000 click throughs on

776
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,885
slash dot which means 100,000 impressions at

777
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:43,395
20 or 30 bucks per 1000 impressions. And it's like, I basically just,

778
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:46,105
I've justified my existence for the next three months

779
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:47,436
with one article,

780
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:48,556
you know,

781
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:52,515
like Clickbait, Clickbait has always been a thing, folks, let's face it, right?

782
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:53,546
Like it works, you know.

783
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:58,380
And I remember, yeah, this one thing on slash it was the death of open ssh and open SSL.

784
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,449
Right. And it got so much traffic and death threats and everything

785
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,250
and it literally basically paid my salary for four months.

786
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:07,410
That's awesome. Right.

787
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,280
And, you know, it was a decent article actually it wasn't total garbage.

788
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,719
Um, but the reality is like that, that kind of thing has always worked

789
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,989
and, you know, it's just, it's a matter of, well,

790
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,889
especially now that these clicks are worth less.

791
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,850
-- It's, it's escalating,
-- you know, I guess you're right is,

792
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,179
it's just that now the,

793
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,580
the bad guys have figured out how to start gaming the

794
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,810
system as opposed to the players in the game itself.

795
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,129
-- I
-- mean, well, you know, there's money there,

796
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,909
right. That's why, what was it, uh,

797
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,639
that famous us Bank Robber. They're like, why do you rob banks?

798
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,699
And he's like, well, because that's where the money is and it's like, oh,

799
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,679
-- good
-- answer.

800
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,080
Who knew?

801
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,530
-- So,
-- yeah. Yeah, I mean, it,

802
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,418
but I guess here's, here's, here's the deal is

803
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,179
when I think about things like the, the scare wear

804
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,389
and the ad fraud

805
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,139
and, and even just living with ads in general

806
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,050
is

807
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,929
there's clearly a

808
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:05,110
very human element that's being abused here

809
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,189
and

810
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,879
we don't have a way to stop it because like a

811
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,889
great example is your ad that looks like a youtube ad

812
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,639
that should

813
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,879
Google shouldn't let that happen.

814
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,520
And I'm sure when they find it they will pull it,

815
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,629
but you need some sort of automation to stop that from the beginning.

816
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:24,090
Right.

817
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:24,280
Well,

818
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,669
I just would have assumed that an ad displaying like

819
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,439
www.youtube.com but going somewhere else wouldn't have been allowed,

820
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,600
which is why I clicked on it.

821
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,040
Right. Otherwise I would have scrolled down to the actual,

822
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,969
was the ad,

823
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,969
-- is it a graphic or is it all?
-- It was a, it was a Google, um, text ad.

824
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:44,449
So, it was, wow. Yeah, they should,

825
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:45,780
they should catch.

826
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,530
It's weird.

827
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,050
I, well, or maybe, I don't know, it was weird. Right?

828
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,639
Because I, I was just so shocked because I clicked on

829
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:52,780
a,

830
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:55,959
you know, in my experience. Right? What little experience I have with ads,

831
00:35:56,139 --> 00:36:01,949
the Google text based ads, the URL that you're shown is like where you end up going?

832
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:02,699
I thought

833
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,790
apparently I'm wrong.

834
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:05,510
I don't know.

835
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:06,300
I mean, I, I,

836
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,629
what's funny though is I've been seeing other Google spam and fishing like I got

837
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,179
a Google. Um

838
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,699
let's see if we can find it uh Google account.

839
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,929
So I got a thing for um ah here we go.

840
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:21,939

00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,100
Now, II,

852
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,000
I was unable to believe that this was real because Google as

853
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,629
silly and crazy as they are emailed me on December 13th,

854
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,040
which is uh that was a um a uh Tuesday

855
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,520
saying essentially you have until Friday to accept this

856
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,000
new contract is kind of weird and insane,

857
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,510
but maybe it's legit as it turns out.

858
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,429
I don't know, but

859
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,639
-- it struck me as fake and I certainly didn't click the link.
-- Wow,

860
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,919
that's when you set up a VM man.

861
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,689
See what it is.

862
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:23,409
Yeah.

863
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:27,010
But um you know, like, uh that reminds me I need to send the,

864
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,600
the full email headers to somebody at Google who asked for them

865
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,689
um because I tweeted about this and you know, yeah, it's just like

866
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,659
here's my concern, right?

867
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:39,179
My bank TD, Canada Trust I'm naming you guys because I'm not happy with you guys.

868
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,399
They,

869
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,310
they phoned me one time and they were like, hi, is this Kurt Seaford?

870
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,590
And I'm like, yeah, and they're like, this is blah, blah from TD and I'm like, really?

871
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,120
He's like, yeah, I'm like,

872
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,379
how do I verify that? And he's like, what? And I'm like, how do I verify it from TD?

873
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:55,939
And he's like,

874
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:56,879
he's like, well,

875
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:00,110
I'm gonna ask you some security questions to verify you and I'm like,

876
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,280
that's not how this works.

877
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:02,919
Yeah, I've,

878
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:05,100
I've done the same thing to my bank and they

879
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,600
clearly are not used to that happening to them.

880
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:13,649
So, like TD Canada Trust again, naming and shaming phones customers and says, hi.

881
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,669
Is this Curtsey Fried? Yeah, we'd like to verify your

882
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,709
granny. What's your date of birth? What's your postal code?

883
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,000
What's like blah, blah, blah,

884
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:19,610
right?

885
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,310
Not something like what was really interesting with my corporate um credit card?

886
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,879
I was buying some stuff on Expedia.

887
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,709
The first one went through, the second one got blocked

888
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,989
and then I got a phone call from them and they were like to verify your identity.

889
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,250
We wanna ask you what um the last transaction on your card was like for how much,

890
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,590
which you know, is a little less scary, right?

891
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,020
It's not a personal information, but TD Canada trust naming you guys

892
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:45,689
asked me for like my date of birth, my postal code and um

893
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,979
uh what was it my address or whatever?

894
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:51,729
And I'm like, no, like I'm not having this because this is like, no,

895
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,469
you know, and, and yeah, I mean

896
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,229
the my concern is that we have these companies that

897
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,030
do things that are training people to get ripped off.

898
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't think it's

899
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,419
like this,

900
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,689
if this Google thing is legit

901
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:05,209
you know, it's like as discussed, here's a tight time frame.

902
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,790
You have to act now, you have to click this link,

903
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,310
you have to put in your administrative credentials.

904
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,310
-- Like what
-- now? But, but why would people, why would they not trust

905
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,739
organization to give them solid advice

906
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,560
-- on
-- that? Actually is an actual Google email. It's

907
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,300
for real.

908
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,260
-- It's accounts.google.com. That's
-- horrifying.

909
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,290
So they're bad.

910
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:29,899
This email is legit and they're like training their

911
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,209
people to be like here's a time sensitive thing.

912
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,379
-- Click on this link and enter your password. Here's the
-- deal, right is. So

913
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,979
there's a bunch of layers here

914
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,300
at the top.

915
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:41,909
There's Google

916
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:47,560
that has groups internally that know better that were clearly not consulted,

917
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,340
right?

918
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,770
Oh, there's actually a reply to the email saying hi Kurt.

919
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,370
I, because I replied, I said phishing email supposedly from Google,

920
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:55,659
your account is being impersonated.

921
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:59,949
I I replied to abuse and the supposed google.com account came from

922
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,469
and I didn't see this because I like marked the thread like go away

923
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,810
and it says hi Kurt, thanks for your reply and sorry for causing you any concerns.

924
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,260
You can always call us to confirm this email at our support

925
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,620
line and we will be happy to provide you more details.

926
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,000
Uh Trick question,

927
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,500
-- what's the Google support line?
-- I hope they included it in the email to you.

928
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,370
No, of course not.

929
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,929
-- They didn't.
-- Thankfully.

930
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,120
That's

931
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,350
good.

932
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,520
Yeah.

933
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,409
Well, it's like every time somebody shows up behind the door and they're like, hi,

934
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:25,429
I'm from Energy Company

935
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,290
X and I'm like, really? And they're like, yeah, look at my ID and I'm like,

936
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,840
-- yeah.
-- Right. Of

937
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:31,899
course, you are.

938
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,449
Ok. Right. But, so here's my point though. Right. Here's my point is

939
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,479
you have

940
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,939
organizations

941
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,010
that don't always have the right people helping them make smart decisions.

942
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,379
And why would a normal person know

943
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,899
that doing? This is a bad idea and let's face it.

944
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:52,780
This is someone at Google with good intentions that is trying to do the right thing.

945
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,520
Well, whatever, we won't

946
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,020
argue,

947
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:58,979
we won't argue the philosophical

948
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,649
intentions. We'll just say they have intentions. OK? We, we'll leave in there,

949
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:06,479
but here's the deal, right? So

950
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,979
when, when you're a user of Google, they're an organization that you trust

951
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:12,820
and

952
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,459
I,

953
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,320
in a way you look up to them, we'll say, right?

954
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,520
Because they're providing you something of value and important. Right. Exactly.

955
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,199
Exactly.

956
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:25,840
And now it's human nature to trust organizations and

957
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,830
even people to a degree that we kind of

958
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,445
-- my kids think Santa Claus is real because apparently we said
-- so.

959
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:35,844
Exactly. As a parent, this is very, very parent child, right?

960
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:37,885
And, and that's kind of the relationship. There is

961
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:41,725
people trust Google because they see Google as a giant

962
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,014
amazing

963
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:44,084
entity

964
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:48,705
that has their best interest in mind. And we won't talk about that either today. OK?

965
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:49,965
We'll just say

966
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:51,245
that's what people think.

967
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,360
OK,

968
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,030
and So you've got that angle and I mean, this is even true of,

969
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,989
of banks and department stores and,

970
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,510
and whatever grocery stores pick an organization

971
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:05,889
and people think like this, it's just being a person.

972
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,909
But then the bad guys, they know this too

973
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,030
and they take advantage of it. And the problem is

974
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,959
this has been happening like throughout human history

975
00:42:16,149 --> 00:42:20,989
and it isn't going to go away. This is the way people are

976
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,939
and the bad guys are always going to find a way

977
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,260
to use one organization's good name

978
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,979
to fraud another person.

979
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,209
It is just unfortunately,

980
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:34,419
it, it is the way of the world.

981
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:37,580
Well, I remember like reading about fraud back in the day when you know,

982
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,979
this is before computers and laser printers and everything

983
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:46,229
and like just possessing the letterhead of an organization like so stationary with

984
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,360
Bob's mining company established 19 whatever

985
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,979
with, you know, this address and phone number on it, typing something out on that.

986
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,669
Like, you know, uh

987
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,649
this is Bob in accounting,

988
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:03,209
give the bearer of this letter like $500 would be like enough to get $500 or whatever,

989
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:04,020
you know, it was insane.

990
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,120
It's

991
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,375
crazy, but I mean, it hasn't changed, right?

992
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:11,485
We, we have that whole spearfishing of CEO S and C level executives for, you know,

993
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:13,665
bank uh transfer fraud where

994
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,415
it's like please pay this invoice of like

995
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,834
$200,000. Thank you or you know, hey, this is supplier X.

996
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:22,625
Our banking details have changed,

997
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:25,344
you know. So in future, please pay us here

998
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:30,360
and apparently companies do this, you know, like it's with minimal

999
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,729
oversight. It's,

1000
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,010
it's bonkers,

1001
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:38,169
it's people, man, it's not bonkers. This is how people work and this is where

1002
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,250
I guess

1003
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,050
you don't

1004
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:44,649
because the same people, if you said like this cup of coffee is $7 they'd be like, no,

1005
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,290
-- absolutely not.
-- I bet if you slapped a Google logo on that sucker,

1006
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:50,129
they'd pay it.

1007
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,719
And I'm, I'm only half kidding.

1008
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:53,360
But

1009
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,479
actually, no, you're right. Like Starbucks does sell $7.

1010
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,510
Isn't that like Apple's entire business model?

1011
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,790
Anyway. Anyway, let's bring it all back though.

1012
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:10,479
Is we come back to what you talked about with, with the Uber, I guess, anti

1013
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,370
fishing

1014
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,729
spam, whatever the heck, email server thing they have, right.

1015
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,760
And

1016
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,080
that's really what it's about is it's the job of

1017
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,209
the security people to understand what the bad guys are doing

1018
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,330
and to make their lives very, very difficult.

1019
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:29,979
And if you look at

1020
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,649
like, literally everything that happens in the financial universe today

1021
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:39,030
in the way that normal people handle transactions.

1022
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:43,689
It has been designed to make fraud difficult. I won't say impossible,

1023
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:44,979
but it's difficult.

1024
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,600
Well,

1025
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,969
what's always funny to me is you hear about

1026
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,989
these places that suffer fraud and it's like they,

1027
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,060
they violated very basic standards, like, um, and we'll look it up in the show notes,

1028
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:53,479
but

1029
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,479
I don't know if you remember about a decade or two ago,

1030
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:58,239
there was that large bank that cratered out because the, um

1031
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:02,669
there was a trader who was trading and I believe it was copper derivatives

1032
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,179
and the oversight was being provided by his wife.

1033
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:09,500
That's totally legit, right.

1034
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,270
It was, it was a British bank.

1035
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:15,550
It is up to the security people and, and really, it's up to everybody,

1036
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,570
but I'm gonna pick on security folks just because I can

1037
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,070
on this podcast is we come back to the point that,

1038
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:22,909
that

1039
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,110
I, I'm, I'm feeling like the internet

1040
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:30,489
and electronics and everything we interact with today is

1041
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,270
still too new and we don't totally understand.

1042
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:34,750
And so

1043
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,020
the problem we have is we don't fully understand the problems,

1044
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,860
which means we can't really work on the solutions yet.

1045
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,159
And so

1046
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,159
it's, it's so hard and I feel like as security people,

1047
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,989
we love to try to solve problems that aren't real or don't exist

1048
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,760
yet and we ignore real problems that are causing real issues today.

1049
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:04,050
Uh You know, I just ran into this. I had to pay somebody a large amount of money.

1050
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,419
So I was like, oh, you know, I'm gonna use in track uh

1051
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,550
e transfer.

1052
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,310
So a debit essentially over email hit a daily limit

1053
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,800
and so it took three days to pay this person

1054
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:16,540
because I had to break the transaction up into three transactions of

1055
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,959
small enough amounts so that I could send this person the money,

1056
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:20,439
you know.

1057
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:25,500
Um, and I'm, I'm kind of glad that in a sense of so I, I, I'm assuming the idea is

1058
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,989
we limit your transaction amount and actually then step it down the next day by half.

1059
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,885
Um, so somebody tries to clean out your account,

1060
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:36,014
it's gonna take them a few days and maybe hopefully notice,

1061
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:38,854
but I legitimately had to pay this person

1062
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:39,594
on time.

1063
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:41,745
It's a lawyer, you know, you got to pay your lawyer, you know,

1064
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:44,385
and it was really annoying but the funny thing is he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

1065
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:46,385
we I forgot to mention that to you, right?

1066
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:49,754
Because he, you know, he of course runs into this all the time, you know,

1067
00:46:49,764 --> 00:46:52,205
because the transaction limit by default is so low,

1068
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:55,705
it's like 1000 bucks which like if you've ever dealt with a lawyer,

1069
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:57,094
1000 bucks doesn't go very

1070
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:57,334
far,

1071
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:58,665
right?

1072
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:06,689
Uh ok, so, so here's the deal though is there are ways to get that man, his money,

1073
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,850
you just didn't use them. I mean, I just,

1074
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,340
I, I in

1075
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:11,870
a

1076
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,989
paper bag full of twenties.

1077
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,620
-- No, no,
-- no, there are, you can do wire transfers and there's

1078
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:19,560
various,

1079
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,550
he's a freaking

1080
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:21,909
lawyer,

1081
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:22,469
doesn't he have

1082
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:22,840
a,

1083
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,350
he gives me his wire transfer details.

1084
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,120
In theory I could do a demand debit and clean out his account.

1085
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,919
If you give me a blank check for your account,

1086
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:32,629
I can do a demand debit

1087
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,530
from your account and clean it out.

1088
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:39,090
You can, but he's your freaking lawyer, dude, he's going to sue you.

1089
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,679
Like, don't do that to your lawyer,

1090
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,330
obviously. Yeah. No, don't mess with your accountant or

1091
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:46,909
-- lawyer.
-- And so you can even,

1092
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,340
there are ways around this though.

1093
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,679
Is there are clearing houses whose job is to be the middle man?

1094
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,760
My accountant flat out. It was funny because he sent me an invoice

1095
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:00,330
and I'm like, what? There's like a link to square. What the heck I phoned him.

1096
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,689
He's like, yeah, we're accountants. We're not like we don't do

1097
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,810
invoicing and pain.

1098
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:04,225
Why we

1099
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:04,524
just

1100
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:05,564
pass our money.

1101
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:08,635
You know, he's like, and I know half of you don't have checks anymore.

1102
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:12,514
So we're using square, it's like 3% but we don't have to chase you. I'm like, awesome.

1103
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:13,014
Thank you.

1104
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,145
Seriously. It's, it's phenomenal.

1105
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:17,844
The annoyance is I can't pay my taxes with a credit card

1106
00:48:17,955 --> 00:48:18,554
that's

1107
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:20,165
on purpose, I'm sure.

1108
00:48:20,594 --> 00:48:23,554
But then it's Visa's problem and not the tax people's problem.

1109
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:26,044
Right.

1110
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:27,405
Anyway.

1111
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,270
But, but, so here's the deal at the end of the day, right?

1112
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,300
Is, is we keep laughing about all this stuff.

1113
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,250
We keep making up these silly jokes and reasons and whatnot. But,

1114
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,649
I mean, fundamentally

1115
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,669
the financial sector I think has solved a lot of these problems and they get

1116
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,399
what their threats are.

1117
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:51,100
Right. You don't understand our threats today to the degree we need to.

1118
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:55,939
Well, one thing I haven't seen is actual, what's the cost of these things? You know,

1119
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:58,929
uh, in some cases, we have a very clear cost, like they paid a

1120
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,459
million dollars in false invoices, you know, obviously that's a problem but

1121
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,739
here's what I'm seeing, like,

1122
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,750
especially with the leaks of personally identifiable information.

1123
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,939
What's the problem there? Like, how does this actually end up costing money? I mean,

1124
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,679
obviously

1125
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,669
the people whose information gets leaked,

1126
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:16,550
they have to eat costs and deal with hassles and whatever.

1127
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,070
But the

1128
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:23,229
-- like lost it all,
-- do they? I mean, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna argue about it today

1129
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,070
but like in, in all seriousness,

1130
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:27,754
even if someone steals your pi i

1131
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:28,665
it's not

1132
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:29,675
a huge deal.

1133
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:31,094
Why do you think people are buying that

1134
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:32,975
medical information there and especially in America,

1135
00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:33,695
they're buying it

1136
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:36,675
-- so they can use it to get medical treatment?
-- Sure.

1137
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,064
-- But does that
-- skip out on the bill

1138
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:39,804
damage me? Really? I mean, that's the,

1139
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:44,195
-- when you get a bill for $20,000
-- then I don't pay it because it's not me.

1140
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:47,514
Right. It creates some issues for me, but

1141
00:49:47,814 --> 00:49:50,995
it is and that's probably a discussion for another day. But I mean,

1142
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,179
I think this is part of our issue is we don't have a way

1143
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,820
to put value on this information or the problems. And so we struggle to say

1144
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,459
yes, this is an issue or no, it's not.

1145
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:06,260
I mean, as security people, we've always defaulted to. Holy crap.

1146
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,260
Biggest problem in the world, which is never true.

1147
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,560
Well, here's my real concern is even if we put value on that information,

1148
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,179
we're still able to externalize the cost. So, it's not my problem and

1149
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,469
that.

1150
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:17,850
Right.

1151
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:19,739
Right.

1152
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,399
It shouldn't be my problem as a consumer.

1153
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,110
It should be.

1154
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,780
I mean, as the person who dropped the ball and made the security mistake,

1155
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,580
it's not their problem and

1156
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,080
-- that's where things fall down. Yes,
-- I agree with that.

1157
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,500
And that's a topic for another day, I think.

1158
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,459
But you're, you're dead on.

1159
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,639
It's, oh, man, everything is a mess.

1160
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,600
Like,

1161
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,770
well, you know, the good news is, I mean, we're seeing more regulation,

1162
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:47,679
try with good intentions. Now, I don't know if it's gonna work or not,

1163
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:49,399
but let me add that.

1164
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:54,399
Yeah. Well, you know, I, I'm a realist, not a hopeful person

1165
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,270
and I am hopeful in that we're hopefully, you know, I,

1166
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,419
I do see people becoming generally more aware and I don't know if it's because

1167
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:04,300
they're becoming more aware or it's because the pool of suckers has been like,

1168
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,070
sucked dry.

1169
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,620
Oh, dude, there, the pool of suckers will never run dry.

1170
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,719
Well, I mean, for simple, you know, scams, like I, I would like to think that like, um,

1171
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,399
you know, I,

1172
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:16,520
I have $50 million I'm trying to move out of the

1173
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,239
country and I was given your email address by a friend.

1174
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:24,469
-- Don't ask any questions.
-- Just help me out. No, man, those are never going to end

1175
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,399
-- well. True.
-- But I would like to think that it's,

1176
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,959
-- they've depleted the
-- pool. No way.

1177
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,800
No way.

1178
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:31,804
You know, they have it.

1179
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:32,064
I

1180
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:34,465
-- had hope, please let me have
-- my hope.

1181
00:51:34,754 --> 00:51:35,254
Hope,

1182
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:36,245
hope is dead.

1183
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:37,455
Well, it was funny. Right.

1184
00:51:37,465 --> 00:51:39,044
Because you would have thought like the, the,

1185
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,814
the younger people are more digitally aware and apparently they've done

1186
00:51:41,824 --> 00:51:44,645
some studies with like fishing and fake news and stuff like that

1187
00:51:45,054 --> 00:51:48,155
where everybody's just as terrible as everybody else

1188
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:49,774
or

1189
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:50,034
whatever,

1190
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:50,905
the person,

1191
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:53,844
we will never patch the person.

1192
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,899
Yeah. Unfortunately, I'm calling it Kirk.

1193
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:00,989
There's, this is, this is like the most depressing conversation we've ever.

1194
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,320
-- The reality
-- is like some, just some simple stuff.

1195
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,280
Like if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

1196
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,560
Or in the case of this Google thing,

1197
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,939
like this is so weird because it's like you have three days to like,

1198
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:13,189
accept a new contract and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1199
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,479
But I'm pretty sure if I don't,

1200
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:16,679
they'll just keep billing me and keep giving me service,

1201
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:22,429
-- you know, they will
-- like, yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm well, please Google,

1202
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,060
don't cut me off.

1203
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,409
I need my email. Thanks.

1204
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:29,070
Please Google, don't cut me off.

1205
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:31,199
All right. So thanks for listening. Everybody.

1206
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:35,320
