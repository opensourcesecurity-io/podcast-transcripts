Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:12,539
Kurt Siefried and my partner and wondering what it's all about Josh Presser.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,439
-- Yeah.
-- Anyway, Douglas Adams figured this out years ago.

3
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,639
All right, I have a story of epic proportions to start this episode with.

4
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,790
Right before

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,440
I got on with you,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,600
I recorded a webinar

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,079
for Clouds Smith, right?

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,139
Which is a, a company in like the supply chain security space.

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,029
They're really good people. I, I like them a lot

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,119
and

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,520
I have a Mac I use for work and I hate Macs.

12
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:40,119
This is not a secret to anyone who's listened to the show for any period of time,

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,490
right?

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,169
I could not get this Mac to work with the webinar. It's just a web browser, right?

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,130
Just a web browser.

16
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:49,259
It would not work like the video was messed up.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,849
The audio is messed up like it just would not work for me.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,130
And finally,

19
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:56,009
I was like f this and I pulled out the computer

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,099
we use right here to record this podcast all the time.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,939
And I fire up the web browser site on Linux

22
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,860
Flawless which browser

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,989
chrome it was chrome I tried Firefox.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,410
Firefox was unhappy, which is not surprising in any way.

25
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:12,739
I find almost everything that has to be chrome.

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,269
I

27
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:16,709
-- just, it,
-- it does happen. I, I hate that too, but that's another story.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,339
But anyway, like, worked flawlessly on Linux and I was like, this is the first time,

29
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,589
like, I think in the history of ever, Linux

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,680
has actually had audio and video working correctly while Mac Os did not do it.

31
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,389
It was like,

32
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,629
blew my mind. I didn't even know what to say.

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,775
It's, I just, I feel like it's 2023 and we've computers have had sound for like, what,

34
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,684
-- 40 years
-- more than that they had sound in the sixties.

35
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:43,694
-- Like,
-- I know the original analog since and stuff and like,

36
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,245
yeah, but I mean, like proper digital sound,

37
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,805
you know, with like delivery over the internet since the late nineties easily.

38
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:51,529
Like,

39
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,419
and I just, I'm kind of like, it's been 30 years.

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,010
-- How come we can't get this right reliably across all the platforms.
-- It's hard to do.

41
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:04,980
Well, I get it. I totally get it as a person who's worked with sound for a long time.

42
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:09,330
I've written applications that do sound things like, I totally understand

43
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,929
why this is so hard.

44
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,250
-- But
-- I also feel like, like I get like using some wonky little browser,

45
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,110
maybe not working.

46
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,490
But like if you're using Chrome Safari or edge,

47
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,210
it should

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,220
-- just work.
-- One would think. But it didn't, I blame,

49
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:21,630
I

50
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,440
blame Mac Os because it hates me and I hate it. And that's fine.

51
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,149
It's funny because I, I have a pretty good relationship with all my computers.

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,759
Be they Linux

53
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,210
Mac or Windows and we just all seem to get along.

54
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,470
So I, I hate them all and they all hate me. But the beauty of Linux is, it has

55
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,289
the ability to figure out at least what's going on

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,809
so I can go like, stomp something

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,449
to the ground if I need to and solve my problems.

58
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,029
Whereas on Windows and Mac Os, they're basically like, ha ha, no, go f yourself,

59
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,570
loser.

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,559
Well, and that kind of leads into this thing,

61
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,289
this opaqueness of systems where like you bought it, you own it.

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,449
Well, you own a license to the software,

63
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:04,070
but do you kind of own it? And so here's the thing. What do, ok.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,490
So what do the Polish trains GM, car dealership,

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,729
service departments and like G capital kind of all have in common?

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,809
They're out to screw us all.

67
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:17,210
Well, no, there's a very fundamental fact about selling large equipment, which is

68
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,410
the vast majority of money you make when you

69
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,559
sell large equipment is off the financing of it like

70
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:22,949
a

71
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,389
few,

72
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:28,399
like a decade or whatever ago, GE split into GE capital and the GE that makes stuff,

73
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,830
the G capital, finances, same thing with all the big three automakers.

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,119
-- Well, or big four auto, I forget how many it is now, whatever
-- the big

75
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,029
automakers,

76
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,649
they make all their money on financing.

77
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,639
And it's getting to the point now where

78
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:41,490
car dealerships are refusing to sell people cars.

79
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,589
If they want to pay for them,

80
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,399
they will only sell it if they finance it,

81
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,539
which is sort of, kind of illegal depending on your jurisdiction.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,130
Like, it's happening locally and there's been some kerfuffle about

83
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,619
it. Like, what are you gonna do? Sue them? Like good luck.

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,539
-- There's,
-- I'm sure there's nothing you can do.

85
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,419
And then the second part of large equipment is you make a lot of money servicing it.

86
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:05,350
OEM. Parts. Right? Like I watched that cutting it.

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,509
Engineering, you know Australian Curtis guy

88
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,740
and you know, like he quotes these jobs and he's like, ok, like

89
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,589
they asked me to fix this part that like,

90
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,089
and it's got like a giant crack and it's like broken in half.

91
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,720
It's like, it'll take like a couple of days,

92
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,369
but the original OEM part is like $30,000 and I quoted them like 10 grand to fix it.

93
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,290
So they're like, please please try.

94
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,850
Um, also

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,049
the OEM part isn't available for six months.

96
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,850
So, you know. Wow.

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,970
I mean, it's just

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,049
a million dollar piece of capital equipment sitting there for six months.

99
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:33,429
That's very,

100
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:33,859
that's

101
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:34,279
fine.

102
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,239
And that's what gets me is like, people

103
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,250
always seem to forget that it's all about the financing and the servicing, like,

104
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,910
like the selling you, of the thing,

105
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,730
I'll sell it to you for a dollar. I don't care.

106
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:48,920
As long as you let me service it for 50 years and finance it.

107
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:49,790
That's fair.

108
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,679
Well, that's

109
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,649
kind of coming home to us now with that Polish train company that apparently

110
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,940
went so far as to put like Geolock

111
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,179
software so that the train undergoes like a level one.

112
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,959
I forget the levels,

113
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,239
but basically there's several levels of service and like a level,

114
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,660
like a lower level of service, like an oil change kind of thing.

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,779
Sure, whatever that,

116
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,720
that's allowed anywhere but like the deeper levels of

117
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,619
service where you're like swapping out engines or,

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,170
you know, doing like really

119
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,600
massive things.

120
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,829
Yeah, apparently that's geo lo

121
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,799
and if you do it,

122
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,029
not at their service locations,

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,880
they, they break the train and,

124
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:27,029
well, it wasn't even just that just if the train sat for, what, 10 days,

125
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,320
I think it would basically

126
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,339
because you don't know if they're touching it or not. Right. So just,

127
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,329
you know, no, no, no.

128
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,459
Because unless the parts have like electronics in them,

129
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,760
that kind of know what's going on.

130
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,070
You, you don't know if the train was serviced or not.

131
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,589
Like, you can't tell if the pistons in

132
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:40,790
a,

133
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,869
you know, in an engine were

134
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,500
swapped out or whatever. It's not an iphone with serialized parts

135
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,720
electronically communicating to each other.

136
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,779
-- I think
-- here's the story to the train thing because like John

137
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,190
Deere does this as well and they're not apologetic about it.

138
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:54,700
Right.

139
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,779
But I think the train story is interesting

140
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,839
because

141
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:04,049
they said none of this was happening and it was actually a group of hackers.

142
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,269
-- Oh,
-- they're still denying it. Yes.

143
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,089
-- That,
-- that's true.

144
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,260
They are, they're still denying it now threatening to sue the hackers.

145
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,089
And I love that. Well, number one, the hackers made the train work

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,700
and I'm pretty sure as good as a software engineer

147
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,100
is if there's something actually physically wrong with the train,

148
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,179
no amount of turning it off and on again and like,

149
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,260
tweaking the software is actually going to fix it.

150
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,299
So I'm pretty sure they actually fix it.

151
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,269
But what really blows my mind is this poor

152
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,739
train company literally like stumbled into this because they,

153
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,489
they were servicing trains and they kept breaking them and they're like,

154
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,799
like what's going on, right?

155
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:37,029
We're like,

156
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,760
we're not idiots like what's going on

157
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:42,119
and they literally googled like Polish hackers.

158
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,510
That's

159
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:43,804
Dennett said,

160
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,635
-- I love that you
-- maybe want to make sure you get the

161
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:49,404
right one and not an ad from some Chinese company or something.

162
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,494
But so they straight up contacted these Polish hackers and the hackers like, hey,

163
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,515
yeah, that's totally a thing we can help you with and,

164
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,095
and you know, there'll be links in the show and it's the articles.

165
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:00,424
If you haven't seen it, it's all over Mastodon and everything.

166
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:01,475
But it just

167
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:06,065
the fact that the company is shamelessly both denying that it happened

168
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,445
and now

169
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,480
trying to essentially get the trains pulled from service

170
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,299
by saying that it's not safe because the software

171
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,459
has been monkeyed with. It's been modified. We don't know what happened.

172
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,359
So therefore it's not safe.

173
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,420
And of course, the Polish Tracking group is like, yeah, no, we,

174
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:20,529
we didn't mess with the train control

175
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,559
software because we're not like idiots like,

176
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,200
right,

177
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,700
like anybody who has ever dealt with industrial control systems

178
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:30,959
even a tiny bit knows like if this control something that

179
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,200
weighs like 50 tons and moves at 100 kilometers an hour.

180
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,070
-- Right?
-- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

181
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,980
I want to interject one other part to this story.

182
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,459
Oh, it's juicy. Huh? No, no,

183
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,799
no. It was just related. It's the Blender

184
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,410
presentation that was,

185
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,880
it was sent to us actually from a listener uh like a couple of weeks ago now, I think,

186
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,220
but

187
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,839
there's a marvelous presentation from Blender Con

188
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:56,524
where the, the head of the Blender Foundation, uh the

189
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:57,125
best

190
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,024
name ever.

191
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,265
It, it's, I know. Right.

192
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,265
But anyway,

193
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:04,084
he, he talks about the license of Blender and how it's a GP L and

194
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:07,184
I've never seen someone focus on

195
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:07,875
the,

196
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,114
the A he take the angle he takes of it

197
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,714
where obviously and this is something you've talked about before.

198
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,885
When we think about things like the VSD license,

199
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,885
the end user is a developer.

200
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:20,255
But when we think about the GP L, the end user is actually the end user

201
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,614
and he focuses on how like the first

202
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,649
items afforded to you from the GP L are, are a hugely important part of lender.

203
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,690
On a quick note on the BS D thing. It's not the developer so much. That's the end user.

204
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,479
It's the distributor of the software which

205
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,429
is in open

206
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,419
-- source, that's the developer. But
-- in a

207
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,700
company, it's not the company who has developed whatever.

208
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,380
But the point is like, I think about all this stuff kind of mixed up together

209
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,510
and we live in this just like Bizarro universe

210
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,150
where like, what, what do, what do we even own anymore?

211
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:51,544
Nothing. Well,

212
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,125
it's worse. It's, it's not even that I don't own it.

213
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,065
It's that I don't have meaningful control over it.

214
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:56,645
And

215
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,934
even if I do have meaningful like, OK,

216
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,905
I have meaningful control over that Linux box sitting over there

217
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,025
and

218
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:07,505
I can download all the source packages. I can recompile them.

219
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:12,224
I and I actually can do this. I have done this. I did it for a living. Like I've made

220
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,244
-- like, I work for red. We'll say
-- you used to be able to do this.

221
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:16,715
But the point is

222
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,065
I don't want to,

223
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,450
I don't want to

224
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,049
like,

225
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,590
I own a car. I

226
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,849
don't want to rebuild the engine. That does not sound like fun.

227
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,109
Like I just recently swapped out the side mirror on it

228
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,570
because a lady hit me and broke my side mirror.

229
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,969
But the point is, I don't want to, I just want a car that works. I want a solution.

230
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,330
And so I'm also at the point now where

231
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:42,650
most a lot of what I own is so complicated and would be so like fixing a TV.

232
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:46,229
No, you're just gonna go to Costco, spend 500 bucks on a new one, right?

233
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,510
Like the thought of even just trying to take a

234
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,760
TV apart without breaking those little clips in the back,

235
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,409
you know,

236
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:56,179
like it would have to be like, I love watching those people repair,

237
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,429
do component level repair of phones and switches

238
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,500
and it always boils down to,

239
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,229
they didn't pack their data up and they need

240
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,700
their data because the guy literally is like,

241
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,239
this is a Samsung 20.

242
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,179
Like, why is the person paying me $400 to fix it

243
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,580
because their photos are on it,

244
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,099
please back up your data and then he's like

245
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,289
-- taking it apart and swapping out a
-- capacitor.

246
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,500
Yeah, I mean, but, and, and there's people who can't, most people can't do that.

247
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,049
Right. Yeah.

248
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,570
Well, and more to the point though, but there is,

249
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,309
I own a lot of stuff that is so complicated.

250
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,770
Now,

251
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,409
even if I technically

252
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,570
both own and control it,

253
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:31,409
I don't have the time and expertise to actually fix it.

254
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,140
And even if I can find somebody who does,

255
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,059
it's barely worth it anymore.

256
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,679
And that's obviously like a train is different because the train is a giant capital

257
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:39,929
investment.

258
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,080
You know, that makes

259
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:41,359
sense

260
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:41,590
to

261
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:41,760
keep.

262
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,599
And that's happening locally too now where

263
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,770
I sent you that article. But so here in Alberta,

264
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:51,200
the average used car is about $42,000 Canadian

265
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,919
and the average new car is $71,000 Canadian,

266
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:55,570
which is like,

267
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,510
that's more than I've ever spent on buying these

268
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,830
cars and fixing them in my entire life.

269
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,190
And

270
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,049
so the article was talking about people who are like,

271
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,900
my Subaru broke and it was going to be $9000 to fix it. So we did

272
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,280
and I'm like, you know, like five years ago, if somebody said,

273
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:16,909
like they spent $9000 fixing their car, you'd be like,

274
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,580
-- you're insane. Buy,
-- buy

275
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,070
-- like
-- a used

276
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,010
one for sure.

277
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:21,059
100%.

278
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,580
I know that's not an option.

279
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,049
-- Right?
-- I mean, that's a,

280
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,299
that's a weird, it's such a weird problem and I think,

281
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,070
but on the one hand,

282
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm kind of glad people are fixing things and not throwing it out

283
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,309
because the amount of energy that goes into building a car significant.

284
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,559
But

285
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,510
at the same time, like, you know, am I gonna have my 2015 car until 2035?

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,140
Yeah,

287
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,859
like it

288
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,489
maybe looks that way.

289
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,169
-- I
-- mean, and cars, cars do better now,

290
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,340
I feel like they last longer than they did when I was a kid.

291
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,450
I felt like once a car had about 10 years old, like, it was a heap of trash

292
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:59,450
and I have a 10 year old car now. That works remarkably well.

293
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:02,640
But anyway, all right, I wanna, I wanna pile this together

294
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,659
because

295
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,210
I think the concept of ownership is, has been overdone and,

296
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:12,500
and if anyone listening doesn't know who Cory Doctorow is, he's spoken extensively

297
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,159
to

298
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,909
podcast.

299
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,539
-- The one in 10,000 that, that, um, do
-- not assume people know

300
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,150
ever because it is extremely common

301
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:27,469
for the things we think are obvious, aren't necessarily obvious. Right?

302
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,450
So anyway, Cory Doctorow

303
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,039
writes extensively on all of these sort of topics and he's been on a real kick,

304
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,690
especially with the train story,

305
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,640
kind of about this whole concept of ownership, right?

306
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,539
And I think this extends

307
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,330
all over the universe now, right?

308
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,609
Everything from like the video games we play to the music, we listen to

309
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,880
you heard all the Sony story.

310
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,000
Uh Yeah, the the losing the rights to their

311
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,049
like,

312
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,159
oh, I even have a better story.

313
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,000
My one child

314
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,080
loves

315
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,590
the Crayola apps on the ipad and the Crayola

316
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,150
apps on the ipad are actually quite well executed

317
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,710
and they made one back in the day that actually had like

318
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:08,250
like a,

319
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,590
a pen and a brush and a thing that you would actually touch on the ipad surface to,

320
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,190
to brush and draw and it would like do different effects and stuff

321
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:15,640
and

322
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,130
they stopped maintaining the software. So at some point I OS was like, you,

323
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,729
sorry, it doesn't work anymore,

324
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:21,789
you know.

325
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,390
But the good news is now is I can pay

326
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,750
Apple Arcade $9 a month and get access to the Creole app again.

327
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,349
So I get to pay for it again.

328
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,400
Oh, wow. This is so exciting. Well, it sucks because now I get to pay.

329
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,049
Actually, it's, I'm paying the yearly fee, which is like 60 bucks a year.

330
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,830
But I basically,

331
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,340
I get access to the software I previously bought and was taken away from me.

332
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:42,429
What a good deal.

333
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:42,950
Yeah.

334
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,580
And the best part is it can go away at any time again

335
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,989
because now it's an Apple Arcade

336
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:48,859
and I'm like,

337
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,969
I don't know how the Apple Arcade stuff works.

338
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,830
Like, if I stop paying for Apple Arcade, do I still have access to all the apps? I,

339
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,460
-- oh,
-- you know, it's gone.

340
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,280
-- I
-- mean,

341
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,260
-- I get to pay forever and it might just go away randomly.
-- How exciting for you.

342
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,400
-- This is the best of
-- both

343
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,900
-- worlds.
-- I mean, this is like, I, I've got,

344
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,469
what are they, what is Microsoft game pass, I think for the Xbox

345
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,469
-- game pass? Extreme
-- Pro.

346
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,530
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,309
But it's like

348
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:11,460
for

349
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:11,770
two

350
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:12,940
-- bucks
-- a month and you,

351
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,059
and you get access to tons of games and,

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,940
like, it

353
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,619
is a reasonable deal because there's a lot of games I've played on

354
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,549
game pass that would have been 60 bucks if I paid for them.

355
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,340
-- They also
-- don't tend to break or disappear stuff as much.

356
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:26,679
They

357
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:26,929
do.

358
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,119
They

359
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:27,729
do, they

360
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,409
do

361
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,450
-- so on, like on game pass. Wait
-- between versions.

362
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,729
No, no, no. There's a section of game pass called Leaving Game Pass Soon

363
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,789
where they've run out of their license or whatever and they,

364
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,380
the games are disappearing

365
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,140
like a five

366
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,130
year license or something.

367
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:45,510
And there's,

368
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,289
there have been a handful of things. I've been,

369
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,380
ironically,

370
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,099
there have been a number of things that have disappeared and

371
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,130
then come back a couple of months later I've liked,

372
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,520
but

373
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,840
this is, I mean, it's this Bizarro. Well,

374
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,140
we

375
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,210
own things,

376
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:57,820
right?

377
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,510
-- What they want.
-- There

378
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,739
-- is
-- no, see in the old world,

379
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,299
I would sell you something. You would give me a pile of money for it.

380
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,659
And we were basically done.

381
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,460
That's right because

382
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,200
I didn't have the infrastructure and the services in place to like,

383
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,059
do recurring billing easily and actually get my

384
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,049
money out of you and more importantly,

385
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,580
enforce it.

386
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,419
Like, if you don't pay

387
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,640
while you still have it, what do I do now? Right. Oops.

388
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,299
And of course, with digital stuff, there is an inherent

389
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,700
DRM is pretty much baked into everything at this point.

390
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,659
-- Like
-- I want to say one thing that I think is

391
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,960
important to this conversation is yesterday while making my lunch.

392
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,820
I was thinking about this and I thought,

393
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,080
why, like,

394
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,719
why didn't, like, why were companies,

395
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:47,299
why did companies feel better in the past in this context and then I realized

396
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
every company 50 years ago that could have

397
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,619
screwed us over like this totally would have.

398
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,599
It's just, they couldn't.

399
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,469
Exactly.

400
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,219
And I, I think it, it's easy to think about the past to some amazing,

401
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,679
awesome place and it kind of was, but it was because they couldn't,

402
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,440
not because they didn't want to.

403
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,390
Right.

404
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,849
Well, oh, I, what was I watching? Oh, I was watching, uh I'm not gonna name this

405
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,570
because it's embarrassingly terrible on Amazon Prime video

406
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,090
and

407
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,260
there was ads in it and I'm like the ok.

408
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,070
First of all, I thought I paid for prime so I didn't have to watch ads,

409
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,520
but there was an HP ad that

410
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,169
was essentially a guy buying sushi. So os H I at a gas station

411
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,369
and

412
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,090
then getting violently ill and puking into a toilet and

413
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,450
it was an HP printer ink ad basically saying like,

414
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,369
you shouldn't buy off brand ink you

415
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,150
to buy like the HP stuff because according to the risk of, and I'm like,

416
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,380
my takeaway was like buying HP printers results

417
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,570
in like violent vomiting in a toilet and

418
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,090
disagree with that hot.

419
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,859
Right?

420
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,400
And like they were just positioning themselves as the,

421
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,619
like they straight up were trying to position themselves as the less evil,

422
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,500
terrible printer ink company,

423
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:56,539
right?

424
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:00,979
And again, a perfect example, HP and HP Enterprise, right? They basically

425
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,219
the HP printers were making something like

426
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,608
80 plus percent of the operating profits.

427
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:08,420
And so they split the company in two into like the printer

428
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,858
ink division that also happens to make printers that you put the printer ink in

429
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,569
and

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,989
oscilloscopes and servers and everything else.

431
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,430
And what was also fascinating is that I got a second hp commercial for a printer that

432
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,229
it said like ink trays and they're good for up to two years.

433
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,368
So you don't have to worry about your investment in the ink.

434
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,750
Oh, interesting.

435
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,949
And I'm like, that's exactly why I buy a laser jet.

436
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,829
Well, yeah, I mean, we know that, but laser jets are really expensive to buy.

437
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,989
This one was like

438
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,709
-- 3, 400 bucks,
-- which you can buy the

439
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:38,449
crappy

440
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:39,349
in chat for like

441
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,319
100 bucks.

442
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:42,420
But speaking of which I just remembered,

443
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,579
I need to turn off automatic updates on my printer

444
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:48,040
because my printer still allows me. I'm still using that same chip.

445
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,349
It's now been through three cartridges.

446
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,880
It's really on a low toner setting now.

447
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:53,390
Like, it's very, it,

448
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,030
every time I print it's like low toner, I'm like, I know it's fine.

449
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,430
But no, but they might push out an update that breaks it and says, let's

450
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:00,119
printed

451
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,640
like this ink cartridge chip says it did 50,000 pages or

452
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,229
whatever.

453
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,290
I'm not gonna talk to them anymore.

454
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,420
I mean, I guess my

455
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,579
-- date,
-- what

456
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,140
would be the downside to them doing that for them.

457
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,130
Uh, people would get mad.

458
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,670
It would probably look bad from apr perspective, which they might,

459
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,869
-- or might not like HP is
-- such a popular, good company.

460
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:24,390
They're not totally terrible, but it could tarnish

461
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,349
what little goodwill they have left.

462
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,540
-- I mean, there is some,
-- I'm buying a brother printer next time.

463
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,420
Like I've been reading and everybody says brother printers are just,

464
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,000
they manage to, like, not mess it up.

465
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,300
Right. Right. Which is ironic that,

466
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,650
but it's probably more expensive than an HP is my suspicion

467
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,260
the

468
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,699
last 10 or 20 years and I will spend not the amount

469
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:50,180
of just the, the cost of the toner like the cost of the HP toner versus the,

470
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,099
the non chipped toner.

471
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:56,459
-- It's $100 difference. I want to
-- tie it all up and I want to bring blender back in now

472
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:57,670
because I think

473
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:02,150
we have this like universe we exist in now.

474
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,650
That's all about trying to extract value, let's say from everything going on.

475
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,229
And a lot of companies look at things this way and it's

476
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:13,040
how they're paying their bills and whatever it is what it is.

477
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,829
And then

478
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,380
we look at something like blender,

479
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,469
which is, and I, I, you know, we should hold on, let me, let me reset for one moment

480
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,040
and explain what Blender is. Right? Blender is a GP L

481
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,150
3D rendering software

482
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:31,050
that was started by a company, it was sold as a product until the company couldn't

483
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,349
basically fund it. It, it, it didn't make it, which happens to companies.

484
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,479
And then the guy who runs the Blender Foundation now to,

485
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:44,121
he created like AAA crowdsourced effort to say if we raise,

486
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:45,641
I think it was a million bucks,

487
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:49,121
we can buy the source code to Blender and make it free

488
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,462
and make it, everyone can use it.

489
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:54,832
-- Well,
-- make it open source, which is even better than free, to be honest

490
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:59,682
-- because it could be free in commer like closed license.
-- Well, Blender was free.

491
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:00,741
I put free, it was like

492
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:01,852
shareware but

493
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,161
right, and it worked and people

494
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:06,933
for it and now it's considered uh an amazing piece of software

495
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:08,573
that anyone can use.

496
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,553
But one of the things he talks about in this

497
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:14,494
presentation is how people say like, oh,

498
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,874
I don't want to use Blender because it has this

499
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,223
license and I can't add my plugins to it.

500
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:22,614
I can't, you know, change it and, and make a product out of it.

501
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:27,173
And he's like, yes, that's the point. Like that's literally the whole point

502
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:28,135
you shouldn't get to.

503
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,076
-- When you say people you meant companies are complaining
-- that's

504
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,505
-- it's, it's companies for sure
-- because I'm like,

505
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,395
no actual person would complain about it.

506
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,265
-- No, no,
-- for sure.

507
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,956
And one of the things he says that that was just like,

508
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:43,906
blew my mind is how if you're a developer working for a company on some Blender code,

509
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:49,105
like that code goes into the Blender community and if you change jobs,

510
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,066
you can keep using the code, you wrote somewhere else,

511
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:53,598
which is like

512
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:57,078
it. That's very cool and very amazing.

513
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:58,147
And there's,

514
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,917
but it's the GP L license which I know tons of

515
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,358
companies consider viral and lots of people don't like it.

516
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,187
But from like

517
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:09,067
from the perspective of I am a human trying to do a thing

518
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:09,998
like it is,

519
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:13,958
-- I know it can't go away.
-- Let's take a step back 30 years.

520
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:16,517
Why did Linux beat Bs D?

521
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:19,078
Linux was objectively

522
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,359
crap compared to BS D in the beginning, like

523
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,290
-- Bs D and free Bs D were far far superior.
-- They were forked from UNIX, right?

524
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,390
So they had a huge head start.

525
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,400
And my personal theory is is that while Linux

526
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,930
had a rough start and a pretty rough childhood,

527
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,650
the GP L

528
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,099
meant stuff got folded back in because remember back in the late nineties,

529
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:44,609
there was a

530
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:48,135
ton of companies shipping stuff based on BS D like F five

531
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,645
F five load bouncers, man,

532
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,305
those things were like 50 grand a pop and it

533
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:53,785
was basically glorified free Bs D box for sure.

534
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,834
And the thing I think that happened is is Linux got

535
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,944
that small but incremental compound interest

536
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,285
of developer contributions over time.

537
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,224
Whereas in the BS D world,

538
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:06,535
the companies

539
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,844
vastly improved free BS D

540
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:09,925
in their product

541
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:13,109
and then very rarely if ever

542
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:15,790
went upstream with it because honestly also back then

543
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,130
the velocity in the delta was a lot less.

544
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,819
And so keeping your own up, like your own kernel patches and changes was uh easier

545
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,510
air quotes easier, but still

546
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:27,400
a pain.

547
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,150
But like,

548
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,819
you know, keeping a Linux kernel 23 years out of date now is basically impossible.

549
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:35,300
Like I, I feel so bad for all the people that have to do this, like, holy cow.

550
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,209
Like it was bad seven years ago. I can't imagine what it's like now. For sure.

551
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:42,660
For sure. That's the thing is like with BS D, the license is

552
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,363
what led to it. Not it, it, the growth was slower than Linux

553
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,542
and Linux compound interest works.

554
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:54,562
-- That's all I'm gonna say.
-- Not just that if I am cooperating in

555
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:57,402
an environment like this, I don't want to think

556
00:22:57,762 --> 00:23:03,083
I'm going to contribute some changes that my competitor is then going to take modify

557
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:05,902
and then beat me over the head with later. Yeah,

558
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:10,052
which I think is a very real concern in many of these instances.

559
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:14,203
Oh, it happens all the time. Sure, sure, sure. And now I want to

560
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:18,015
tie this into like trains, let's say right

561
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,076
where if I am a train manufacturer,

562
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,936
I build a train, someone buys my train

563
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,395
and that might be that could be the end of

564
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:27,345
it right where I never touch that train again.

565
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,095
I never get another dime

566
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:30,105
off that train

567
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:34,495
-- and
-- your board is gonna scream at you because the shareholders are gonna have a like

568
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:36,526
a legal case against you to make sure

569
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,306
that doesn't happen because they want that sweet money

570
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:39,166
for.

571
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,306
That's the modern world.

572
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:41,265
That's the,

573
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,739
but I think it is,

574
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:47,229
it creates such a weird

575
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,300
incentive for some of these organizations.

576
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:54,510
I think when that is your, I mean, because the focus isn't building a good train,

577
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,780
the focus is making sure the train comes back to me for maintenance

578
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,739
-- and
-- financing it.

579
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,380
So it, it turns into this weird incentive now

580
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,430
versus,

581
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,650
and then the extreme example of this is, is I don't sell you the train,

582
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,800
I lease you the train and I not

583
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,250
lease you the train, but I lease you the train and the, the service and parts.

584
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,739
And this is even happening with like military vehicles.

585
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,550
Like I was, I remember watching a thing where

586
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,670
I think it's Ryan Mattel makes the dingo

587
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,300
and they will not only like lease you the dingo,

588
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,939
but they will send people to very strange parts of the world to fix the damn thing.

589
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:26,229
And I don't mean like send them to fix it on spec but like,

590
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,910
like we'll set up like a base camp motor pool

591
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,569
to fix these things and maintain them.

592
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,089
And the argument, it's like what the US did with

593
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,500
all of their uh food used to be kind of done in house.

594
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,119
Like if you went somewhere and invaded it, you,

595
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,770
you brought a bunch of people in green uniforms who did all your cooking.

596
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
Well, and then that was, remember in the famous thing, it was sold to, um,

597
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,520
Kellogg Halliburton or whatever it's called.

598
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,060
Right.

599
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,619
You know, and that's all those sorts of cheap contractors coming in from, you know,

600
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,680
other parts of the world that pay a lot less money.

601
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
And the argument being is that, you know,

602
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,319
the military should be doing military stuff, not making breakfast.

603
00:24:59,329 --> 00:24:59,719
-- I
-- mean,

604
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:04,510
-- you can make that argument
-- and there's this kind of core competency focus where,

605
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,290
you know, you're seeing it now with public private partnerships. Like,

606
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:11,520
do we really want the city to like employ 5000 people to fix the road system

607
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,380
or do we just want to do like a PPP to build the Anthony Hende portly?

608
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,839
Well, that's what we ended up doing,

609
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,800
right?

610
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,689
Because it allows you to, to shift costs into the future, present value of money,

611
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:22,530
future value of money.

612
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,609
And I think the problem is everything is boiling down to

613
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,680
a spreadsheet with what can we maximally extract money?

614
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,869
And I don't mean maximally over like 10 or 50 years, but like, you know,

615
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:39,449
my, my incentive or my view might be this quarter or this year to get my bonus.

616
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:41,099
There's a lot of that in

617
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:44,609
-- industry,
-- we were just talking with a software vendor and they're like, oh,

618
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:48,609
if you sign by this date, like uh January 31st,

619
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,255
you don't even have to pay until like May or whatever but if we can get you signed by,

620
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:54,204
like January 31st, I'm like, oh, is that your year end?

621
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:56,364
He's like, yeah, how, how'd you know? And I'm like,

622
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:58,045
-- everyone
-- does that.

623
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,244
-- I'm like, this is not a secret. Like, come
-- on,

624
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,295
that's just, that's meeting a quota and, and whatnot.

625
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:08,795
But now, II I think the incentive structure of all of this is, is a good topic

626
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,380
and this is also where we can kind of

627
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,020
tie security into the larger conversation as well,

628
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,260
right?

629
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,060
Because we,

630
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,979
everything that happens, you've got basically you have upfront costs,

631
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:23,619
you have long term like total cost of ownership, we say, right?

632
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,099
Like that's what

633
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,319
unknown risks and

634
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:25,660
there's

635
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,324
all kinds of stuff like that, right? And, and you can

636
00:26:28,614 --> 00:26:33,364
shovel some of that onto other parties if you're like leasing or you're,

637
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,665
you're saying like we're going to pay you

638
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:37,765
-- a flat fee for yearly maintenance and fundamentally
-- no

639
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,224
company is gonna eat that cost.

640
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:41,954
Like it always drives me nuts when people talk about renting a house, they're like,

641
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:43,724
oh, I want to rent a house because what if the roof breaks?

642
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:45,234
I don't have to pay for a new roof. And I'm like,

643
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:49,410
if you think your landlord is simply eating that cost and be like, oh silly me,

644
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,310
I have to pay $10,000 for a new roof.

645
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:54,280
I guess my tenants, you know, get off free.

646
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,459
-- No, no, it's baked into the cost of renting like,
-- for sure,

647
00:26:57,469 --> 00:27:00,630
but it's not a cost you have to pay immediately.

648
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:00,910
Right?

649
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:01,364
No,

650
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:04,525
-- it's like the free phones from your cell phone company.
-- Yes.

651
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,484
The phones are a great example of that right where they're always like, oh,

652
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,324
you get a free phone.

653
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,045
It's like, no, you don't.

654
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:12,324
That's why your phone plan costs $20 more than this other phone plan

655
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,045
where I bring my own phone

656
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:16,324
and, and anyway, anyway,

657
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,125
I feel like

658
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:20,170
there is

659
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,630
a definite art

660
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,069
and understanding to this whole like figuring out the spreadsheet,

661
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,630
the magic spreadsheet that explains how all of this works.

662
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,969
And there's actually a really good video I will put in the show notes

663
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,750
that Matt Parker who does stand up maths

664
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,650
did an episode with Climate Time

665
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:41,834
where they talk about the city of Chicago leased

666
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:43,974
the parking meters

667
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:49,035
to AAA banker. I forget what company it was. But anyway,

668
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:51,484
and Matt Parker basically breaks down the math and

669
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:53,625
the city of Chicago screwed this up pretty big.

670
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,439
Like

671
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:56,760
there's, if you look at the graph,

672
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,430
they basically start getting screwed at like 35 years.

673
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:02,089
And prior to that, you can make the argument that this wasn't a terrible,

674
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,520
the top Google result is parking meter deal gets

675
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,150
even worse for Chicago taxpayers annual audit shows.

676
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:11,369
-- I gotta read this because these numbers are amazing. It,
-- it's bananas for sure.

677
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,500
Parking meter revenues are nearly back to pre pandemic levels.

678
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,660
Levels with 61 years to go on the 675 year lease.

679
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,510
Chicago parking parking meters,

680
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,750
LLC has now recruited its entire $1.16 billion investment plus 502.5 million more.

681
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,780
They're making

682
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,390
profit in 14 years and with

683
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:35,589
-- 61 to go
-- and it's a 75 year lease, I think. Right.

684
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,469
It's, it's bananas. The, the whole video is bananas.

685
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:39,310
But anyway,

686
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,189
anyway,

687
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,560
this is a challenge and I feel like, especially in security,

688
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,010
total cost of ownership is one of the favorite things

689
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,869
people love to talk about in the world of security.

690
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,079
Right.

691
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,660
We're like, oh, if you use this tool,

692
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,439
your total cost of ownership is half of what that tool is and,

693
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,920
and this and that and another.

694
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,359
-- And I feel like
-- they've never shown me the spreadsheet for that though.

695
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,380
Like, I've never seen this,

696
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,859
-- of course not.
-- Right. Because I'm like, I'm like, what are the assumptions here?

697
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:04,930
And like the assumptions are,

698
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,180
you'll buy, like, the cheapest version of our product,

699
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:09,089
you'll buy the most expensive version of their product,

700
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,000
then you set it on fire and buy it again.

701
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,689
Exactly. That's right. Exactly.

702
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:15,839
And it's run by monkeys who don't know how computers work

703
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,650
and for sure

704
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,439
it's,

705
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,050
it's bananas and

706
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,369
when you put all of this together, sometimes it feels like we're living in this,

707
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,579
like, bizarro dystopian universe.

708
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:27,959
-- Right.
-- No, it doesn't feel like,

709
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:28,839
ok, we kind of are.

710
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,930
No, no, we kind of are

711
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,979
printer, ink cars,

712
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,800
like, like

713
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,119
something like in some US cities now, 10% of house sales last year were to

714
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,250
-- hedge funds and other large entities. Yeah,
-- that's true.

715
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,839
I did hear about that and lots of cities are trying to fix that

716
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,949
well, past it feels like dystopia.

717
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,469
That's fair. That's fair.

718
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,280
And now, like, look,

719
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,319
we're running out of time and we basically dug ourselves into a giant hole of manure

720
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:00,920
of incentives.

721
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,589
And the thing is as long as these incentives exist,

722
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:05,229
like a perfect example is locally,

723
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,900
there's a bunch of efforts to

724
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,109
essentially privatize profits and socialize the losses

725
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,229
for everything from like the Calgary, the new arena that they want.

726
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:17,660
Like the province is kicking in over $300 million. Ok?

727
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,359
So like they're supposed to put money aside so that when the Well is closed,

728
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:25,459
that it's remediated and you know,

729
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,000
shut down properly and there's an orphaned Well Fund because, you know,

730
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,349
some of these companies go bankrupt.

731
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:30,479
And,

732
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:33,550
but what happens now is they sell the non producing or

733
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,599
less producing wells to these companies for like literally a dollar.

734
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,810
And then that company weirdly has no assets and goes bankrupt. And so

735
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,930
we're now looking at potentially tens of billions of dollars

736
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:48,489
in orphan well, remediation here in Alberta like that the taxpayers will pay for

737
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,060
and there's 4 million of us. So that's a lot of money.

738
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,119
Your story is sad. We need to, we need to end this. On a, on a positive note,

739
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,239
I'm not going to let us go out like this.

740
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,939
Maybe the A is, will solve this for us by whipping us

741
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,599
out.

742
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,520
If we're lucky,

743
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,400
if

744
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,250
we're lucky the computers, the machines will take over. But

745
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,829
no, ok. Look, I, I want to,

746
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,349
I want, I want to send us out on this in a kind of reasonable way. Right. Because

747
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,989
it's easy to look at everything going on and be like everything is terrible

748
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,099
and it's all doom and gloom and nothing works and I hate it all.

749
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,959
And I think Blender is the thing to look at

750
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:30,849
to give us hope. Right? And there are other examples similar to Blender,

751
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:31,750
but

752
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:33,219
there,

753
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,229
when we work together and we try to make things

754
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:38,890
better and like there's lots of open source projects that,

755
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,839
that I would say right now,

756
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:42,260
my focus would be very open source because I think that

757
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,250
is a space that has figured some of this out.

758
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,689
We can do things together that do amazing things, right.

759
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:54,890
There are plenty of, of software products, security, not security, like whatever

760
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,640
that

761
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,369
I won't say we own them necessarily.

762
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,489
But I would say it's closer to this concept of ownership

763
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,890
that we're used to.

764
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,170
Well, see my concept of ownership now is

765
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,890
can I maintain it? Can I fix it? Can I change it? Can I sell it? Can I share it?

766
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,349
That's

767
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,579
right. And what blows my mind is like, I have physical books here and sharing it,

768
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:17,680
like, here, hand it over to you and

769
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,060
give me the book and I can,

770
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,550
you know,

771
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,290
and I have Pirated media content. Where can I share it? Absolutely super easy.

772
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,089
And then I have stuff I paid for

773
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:29,109
and like, holy hell, you can't share that for sure.

774
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,329
Or even worse, like the Netflix thing with the whole I'm divorced.

775
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:34,589
My kids have two households. They have a,

776
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:37,510
you know, they, they travel back and forth between the houses with their phones,

777
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,290
but not, you know, like there are some devices that they're logged in

778
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,579
on their Netflix accounts that stay, they, they'll never come over here to my house

779
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,189
and apparently they might get locked out at some point.

780
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,209
Yeah. That's right. That's right. You know, and I'm just like,

781
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,310
this is why

782
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:55,030
it's what the, the funny, I'm just going to leave this.

783
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,790
My, one of my sons, the one that has autism

784
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:59,750
now seems to understand

785
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,430
he wants all his important stuff on the pluck server.

786
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,109
Like there's stuff like he actually got upset the other day.

787
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,550
There's a movie on youtube, uh, the police, a little police car movie from Sweden

788
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,280
and it wasn't on Plex and he wanted it on Plex because I think he,

789
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,819
I don't think he can verbalize it, but I think he understands,

790
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,280
I want to watch this in the future

791
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,270
and it's on youtube and it may not be on youtube in the future. But

792
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,609
daddy's plex server magic, it's always there

793
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:27,989
for sure, for

794
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,719
sure.

795
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:32,089
So I think part of it is as a, as a culture in a society,

796
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:34,849
we need to start pushing back and working around this and like hiring

797
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,359
hackers to fuss with our trains to make them work if need be.

798
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,640
Yeah. Yeah. Hackers like man, I love hackers. They fix everything. It's so good.

799
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,959
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that's one way to look at it.

800
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:49,300
So I'll kind of end it on this quote from Cory Doctorow. Right. He says

801
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,469
if buying isn't owning piracy isn't stealing slow

802
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,199
clap, clap.

803
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,430
I kind of agree.

804
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,050
Like

805
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,359
-- that's well done, sir. I love it. All
-- I know is I, I paid for games

806
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,439
that don't work and I cannot down

807
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,854
-- and install.
-- You should look on the internet archive.

808
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:07,224
Actually,

809
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:11,324
-- they've done a marvelous job of making a lot of this weird old stuff work
-- ipad stuff.

810
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:11,574
No.

811
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,495
Absolutely.

812
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:16,695
100%. You can maybe get an A PK and kind of get it working. And I,

813
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:18,813
I've tried with that and it's just been so

814
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,715
temperamental and problematic that it's not worth it.

815
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:22,395
That's fair.

816
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,675
That's fair. Like it sucks because man, that kid misses some of his games.

817
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:27,895
No, I'm serious.

818
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:31,135
Like he just really wants to get that poor little Lego Duplo bunny,

819
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,043
his ice cream and help him with his friends.

820
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,449
That's it. He just wants to help the bunny

821
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,409
anyway. All right. And, and I'll end up one last note, please. Everyone run Firefox.

822
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,708
-- It's important. That's all.
-- I'm sure a tri troppo

823
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,570
of edge

824
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,750
safari for Mobile and Chrome is fine

825
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,020
run. Firefox. Kurt start running Firefox.

826
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,070
I'm, I'm specifically

827
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:53,239
the

828
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,340
manager

829
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,330
makes me want to go

830
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,610
-- run
-- it,

831
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,399
do it.

832
00:34:57,709 --> 00:34:59,159
I've tried and do it.

833
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,889
You suffer through it.

834
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,100
I

835
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,739
am.

836
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,739
I,

837
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,780
I just don't understand why they can't fix the persona manager

838
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,350
-- because that makes it unusable for me.
-- All right, I'm ending it. Thank you, Kurt.
