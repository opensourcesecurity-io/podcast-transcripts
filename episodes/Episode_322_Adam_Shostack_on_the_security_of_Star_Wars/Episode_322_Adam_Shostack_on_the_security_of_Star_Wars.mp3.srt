Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,149
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,479
Oh, back to Crime. I'm so excited today. You have no idea.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,520
So we're joined today. We have a guest,

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:19,329
Adam

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,459
Shostack who told me to introduce him as the leading

6
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,139
expert in threat modeling in Black Hat review board member.

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,000
But we all know he's a true legend of the industry who has contributed

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,020
an enormous amount of security. So, Adam, thank you so much for being here.

9
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:37,759
-- It is truly an honor and a pleasure.
-- Well, well, thank you. Thanks for having me and

10
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:38,540
yeah,

11
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,459
I'm excited to be here and we've been having

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,479
fun and I'm really excited to dive in today.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,880
-- Fantastic.
-- All right. So the, the, the real reason you're here

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,689
is

15
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:55,069
you told me you're writing a book and it is a topic I am extremely interested in.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,540
-- So why don't you tell us a little bit?
-- So,

17
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,720
so let's start with the title.

18
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,509
It is Threats.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,870
What every engineer should learn from Star Wars?

20
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:06,109
Awesome.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:08,959
You know,

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,379
II I have to giggle a little bit when

23
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:14,940
I say it because I'm just really excited about this

24
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:20,779
and it comes out of, I'm so excited to be able to talk about this. Finally,

25
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:26,959
the last three years I've been working on this because when I train,

26
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,120
when, when we'll talk about what, three years of working on a book is like, it's not.

27
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,300
Wow, it's, I'm sorry,

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,720
this is actually why I never wrote a book. I, I was, yeah. Right.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,300
I did the lasg and then that was enough.

30
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:47,239
But, but when I train people in threat modeling,

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,919
the number one question I get is where do I go to learn more about the threats?

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,319
And this,

33
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,800
the reason that this has been a multiyear project

34
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,120
is this is

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,779
in one sense, it's a lot of fun and I'm really excited about it.

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,720
And in another sense, it's

37
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,119
an organizational process to take all of this information

38
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:18,639
that the three of us and many of your listeners get by

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,970
osmosis over the course of becoming an expert

40
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,160
and

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,479
put it in one word after another and you don't get hyperlinks because it's on paper.

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,119
So it has to start at one point and go to another.

43
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,039
That's something I've noticed the way my Children consume media

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,369
is very nonlinear because that's a possibility for them.

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,759
Whereas we all grew up in a linear world.

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,919
And I, I think there's still a lot of value in

47
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,479
trying to figure out what is important and not important to tell people. Because

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,460
one thing I've noticed is when,

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,770
when people are learning something they don't know what is,

50
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,910
and is not important and they have a tendency to skip the

51
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,360
things that are actually important because they're also the things that,

52
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,500
you know, tend to be tricky.

53
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:57,619
Hm.

54
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,279
Well, I mean, look, if they knew it was important

55
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,050
they wouldn't need to read the book.

56
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,169
Well, exactly. Yeah.

57
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:03,910
Yeah.

58
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:04,759
I mean,

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,970
awesome. All right.

60
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,339
So, now I, I just, I need to pick on you for a moment, Adam,

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,429
because you've written books before you knew how much work this was going to be.

62
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,809
Yes,

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,380
that, that, that's it. You're, you're just pointing that out to

64
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,509
just that, that's fine.

65
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,419
The point about it being

66
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,839
what's important and what isn't

67
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,279
when

68
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:33,199
I've given myself a really high bar for this one

69
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,970
because when I say what every engineer should know about security,

70
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,399
that's really my target.

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,990
And so

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,639
in a sense, everything there

73
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,070
is important and everything is, needs to be made accessible.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,100
Y you know, just the other day

75
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,460
I decided I had to take out the three pages I had on how to store password as well.

76
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,630
You know why?

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,330
Because the framework, it's 2022

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,039
the framework ought to be doing that for you.

79
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,009
So you don't need to know about salts.

80
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,329
You don't need to know about Rainbow tables and they're so much fun to talk about.

81
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,299
You can learn so much

82
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,558
by going through

83
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,209
the work that people have done

84
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,699
analyzing how to store a password safely.

85
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,009
It's a great topic

86
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:39,799
for a cybersecurity expert or for someone

87
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,569
who wants to be a cybersecurity expert, but it's not a great topic.

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,880
Yeah.

89
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,690
So, well, question then. So, uh I'm of two minds because yes, I agree.

90
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,029
It should be done by the framework and not the engineer just like crypto.

91
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,440
But then the question becomes,

92
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,750
is how do you give them enough information so they can make an

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,250
intelligent choice about which framework they pick or is that out of scope?

94
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,500
It's not out of scope.

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,429
And the way that I'm taking that on

96
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,100
is by focusing in, on the threats.

97
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,149
So

98
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,109
here, here's sort of the hypothesis that underlies the book

99
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,510
over the last years,

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,279
engineers have become responsible for more and more

101
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,609
things we used when I got started,

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,369
quality assurance was a separate discipline.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,500
No, we had Q A engineers.

104
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,589
No, I remember those days and now it's just like whatever man, Dev

105
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,500
ops YOLO,

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,549
Dev

107
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,899
ops YOLO

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,019
-- test,
-- just write tests, it's fine,

109
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:40,459
but also yes, but also write tests

110
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,059
and make sure you have things like smoke tests in your build.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,339
We've got, we've got ideas like test driven development.

112
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,279
And so my belief is that if we teach people about the threats,

113
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,299
the threats motivate the defenses.

114
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,630
And so if they know about threats of spoofing

115
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,829
and they know about threats like

116
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,250
password theft, leading to spoofing and fishing, leading to spoofing,

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,739
then they can ask the question. Does this package I'm picking up,

118
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,149
help me deal with this problem or not?

119
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,880
That seems fair. I mean, I, I like that. Ok. So if you pull the pages on passwords,

120
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:26,829
I don't feel bad asking you to spill some beans here so that this,

121
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,950
this book fundamentally is using Star Wars as the lens we're going to learn through.

122
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,829
-- So I'm curious what the Star Wars lessons were around passwords.
-- Did they?

123
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,950
I'm sorry, just did they even I don't, now that I think about it,

124
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,149
I don't think I ever saw a password in Star Wars.

125
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,760
There is a scene in Jedi

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,260
where as the shuttle is flying toward the stolen

127
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,510
imperial shuttle is flying towards the new death star.

128
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,059
They,

129
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,399
it's an older code, sir, but it checks out.

130
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,500
So

131
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:07,059
is that an authentication code? Is that like they're using an expired certificate?

132
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,700
But you don't want to fire on your own ships?

133
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:15,570
And so that scene, let's stick with this scene for just a second, right? You can learn

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,950
about,

135
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,670
ok, we need flexibility

136
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,790
in these systems. We've detected a problem. What decision are we going to make?

137
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,269
Because the downside of this going wrong

138
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,350
is that the star destroyer that's there blows a shuttle craft

139
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,410
out of existence and a bunch of people are dead.

140
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:35,899
-- Well,
-- I

141
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,829
mean, what always got me is, couldn't they just tell him to park out signs?

142
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,359
-- Send someone to look? Yes.
-- Your movie sucks. Kurt,

143
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,109
I watch a lot of cinema sins in my defense.

144
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,089
A recurring theme of this book

145
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,850
is Star Wars would be a much sadder movie if

146
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:57,950
I love that.

147
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,350
I love that.

148
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,700
I mean,

149
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,440
ok. Ok. So

150
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm, I'm II, I want to keep on this because I think it's funny.

151
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:07,910
So

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
they, they have a code,

153
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,700
it's old but it checks out.

154
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,839
But then

155
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:13,350
the,

156
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,829
I guess we'll say maybe the guy in charge of security in the cape and the helmet

157
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:23,149
knows that it is Fred Actors on board the shuttle and he still lets them go.

158
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,320
It's true.

159
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,230
It's true. And this is not something I'm going to chase in this book.

160
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,450
But if you want a Star Wars geek here for a little bit,

161
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,119
Darth Vader is clearly an insider threat

162
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,169
at this point who is manipulating the system

163
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:43,020
so he can reconnect with his estranged son.

164
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,409
-- Ah, that's
-- true.

165
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,789
That's true. That's a good point.

166
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,010
Where do we sit on Jar Binks then?

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,150
Um,

168
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,719
because, like, I personally ascribe to that, he is a Sith Lord. I, I mean,

169
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,890
it basically makes everything make sense.

170
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:56,890
I,

171
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,239
I try and minimize my opinions about George Rinks to the extent possible,

172
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,609
-- but he's
-- such a beloved character.

173
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:10,369
Oh, ok. So let's, let's talk about, let's talk about this part of it.

174
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,669
I am very focused on using the three core movies,

175
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:18,059
ah,

176
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,150
the real ones

177
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,710
for this book.

178
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,280
So, the three good movies we'll say, right.

179
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:28,510
So. Ok. So I think Rogue 1 may be the best Star Wars movie.

180
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,969
It, it was pretty good and in fact, uh, I don't know if you know this,

181
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,200
Kurt and I actually did a whole episode on Rogue

182
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,309
One because it has so many information security parallels,

183
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,659
like everywhere in that movie,

184
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,210
I did not know that.

185
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:45,299
But, but you, you need to, you need to send me a pointer to that after this if you,

186
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,380
if you will.

187
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,619
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

188
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,690
But for teaching purposes,

189
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,770
I don't want to get into

190
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,590
right. Here's

191
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,390
this episode of the Clone Wars in which something happened or in this book,

192
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,559
something happened

193
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,109
because

194
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,770
it's a logarithmic fall off, right?

195
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,909
That the number of people who have seen all nine movies

196
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,210
is way way lower than the number of people who have seen the core three.

197
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:19,489
Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,049
And you know, look, I,

199
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:25,929
I am envious of like Tim's on

200
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,599
his worst book sells more than any of mine ever will.

201
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,890
But

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,349
the overlap in the readership, I don't want my read. I don't want to take a dependency

203
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,989
on these other things.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,989
I wanna make sure that these are accessible,

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,390
fun examples of that people can learn from.

206
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,690
So that when I give them the thing

207
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,330
just like you did with the, it's an older code but it checks out,

208
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,770
it clicks in their head and they can use that to cubby hole, the information

209
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:07,030
and chunk it and attach it to something they're familiar with.

210
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,929
I mean, I mean, for what it's worth, Adam,

211
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,349
I think this is a brilliant way to convey information.

212
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,049
I think

213
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,630
just from the, like the human wet wear experience,

214
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,229
we are a storytelling creature

215
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,330
and

216
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,469
I mean, it, it Star Wars is the, the, the three good movies

217
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:29,049
is unquestionably one of the most told stories, I think, you know,

218
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,390
probably in the modern age by far.

219
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,140
And so I, I absolutely adore this, this idea

220
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:38,739
and I, I'm not going to ask you to like, give away the farm here.

221
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,289
But I'm, I'm curious about like some of the, the themes and concepts and ideas that,

222
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:45,539
that are just sprinkled all over the book.

223
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:53,700
-- So
-- I think one of the fun things about this book is I can spend time and energy at work.

224
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,750
Star Wars. Gee.

225
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:56,440
And

226
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:57,530
yes,

227
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,719
and one of the things that,

228
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:08,840
that I've learned about is George Lucas's obsession with Kurasawa as a director,

229
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,080
which I knew about a little bit.

230
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:13,869
But,

231
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,150
and, and this ties to your question, I swear, just give me a second.

232
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,650
The,

233
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,070
there's a movie,

234
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,599
The Hidden Fortress,

235
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,869
which is told from the perspective of

236
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,130
the two least significant servant characters.

237
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:36,070
And Lucas has acknowledged that those characters are R two and C three po.

238
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,869
And

239
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,320
so

240
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,789
the, the theme that, that recurs is I am trying to use

241
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,979
more R two and C three po

242
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,650
and less of the other characters

243
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:54,719
which also has this advantage

244
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,650
that they're droids and droids are sort of like computers.

245
00:12:59,909 --> 00:12:59,940
Oh,

246
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,020
nice.

247
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,070
And so

248
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,549
I can follow and, and, and by the way, I,

249
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,150
I just want to be clear

250
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,630
listeners. You do not have to be a Star Wars geek like this to enjoy the book.

251
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,960
But as I delve into some of these things, it helps me think about as an author.

252
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,159
What structures do I want to use? Which examples do I want to use?

253
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,289
And for some of them, they're really,

254
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,169
I, I go way deep in sure.

255
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,690
The question that opens the book

256
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,479
is how does R two D

257
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,520
two know who Ben Kenobi is?

258
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,030
And, and that one question, by the way,

259
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,039
I spend pages on

260
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:47,830
because there's so much there that relates

261
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,710
to how computers identify people

262
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,299
ranging from biometric I DS to passwords.

263
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
And from there, we can get to what, you know, what you have, what you are.

264
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:06,190
And now we're into some pretty significant computer security concepts,

265
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,380
but we're having fun with them.

266
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,679
Yeah, I actually, I just had that discussion on Twitter with, you know,

267
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,900
there's that whole thing about the incident

268
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:16,890
response where apparently the Attackers have figured

269
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,460
out if they get into your incident response loop when you do incident response.

270
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,500
Well,

271
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,140
it's not going to go real well for you if the Attackers are inside your decision loop.

272
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,099
Um

273
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,929
And you know, and so, so what's kind of the alternative? Right?

274
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,539
Because everybody's like, you know, and I'm like, well,

275
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,929
basically we use a signal group, worst case scenario.

276
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,330
We can just like text or phone each other because we have the phone numbers and

277
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,840
well, we know each other well enough we can use like personal stories or, you know,

278
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:41,000
like, hey, remember that time, that thing where Kurt, you know,

279
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,460
almost fell asleep in the front row.

280
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,539
Remember that? Yeah. What,

281
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,719
you know, how much money do we spend on beer the night before? What's the number?

282
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:47,340
Right?

283
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,880
You know, there's, there's people I work with that know that number and it would be,

284
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,559
even though I haven't seen these people in five or 10 years.

285
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,200
Yeah. How, how do I know that, that person at the end of that line?

286
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,500
Because as we've established, I don't know if you've seen but the,

287
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,309
the whole voice faking thing, that's a thing now, like there's services for it where

288
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,000
I, well,

289
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,849
they could just feed in the podcast recordings and they'd be done in a minute and

290
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,750
same thing with video. And, you know, this is

291
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,890
mildly terrifying to me because Josh is what, like,

292
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,729
300 hours of recordings of us online,

293
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,450
you know, I, I have enough.

294
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:18,969
We'll call it enough.

295
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,549
Yeah.

296
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,289
So like, yeah, how do you actually know I'm me without, you know, being face to face.

297
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:29,250
-- Although
-- I'm not sure when I last saw you face to face.

298
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:35,049
But yes, you're right. This is an emergent problem and it's a dangerous one.

299
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,090
That's a hard question. Let's talk about Star Wars instead.

300
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,520
No. But so, so nobody ever fakes

301
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,070
voice

302
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:46,960
or a

303
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,590
hologram in Star Wars,

304
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,750
right. They dress up in costume.

305
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:53,299
Leah

306
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,659
when she goes into Jabba's

307
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,390
palace is dressed as a bounty hunter.

308
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,710
That's true.

309
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,659
-- Well, they are constantly knocking out storm troopers
-- and,

310
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,659
and what they're storm troopers on the death star.

311
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,390
So, like those, those uniforms are one size fits all. Hey,

312
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:09,809
you know,

313
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,979
um, Spandex is amazing stuff.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,609
That's like my favorite thing from die hard where the shoes don't fit

315
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,659
because it's like, that's what would happen in real life.

316
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,130
But,

317
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:26,340
but they, they never fake a message

318
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,840
in Star Wars. They jam messages, they intercept messages,

319
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,219
but they don't go there.

320
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:33,799
And,

321
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,099
and I think that the challenge and one of the things I

322
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:43,010
love about Star Wars is that the technology feels like technology,

323
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,739
not magic in support of the story.

324
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:46,280
You know,

325
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:51,429
there's other science fiction shows and I'm not going to r Josh over the coals here.

326
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,419
Oh, no, that's fine. I was, I was, no, no. Ok. So I want to set this up. So

327
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,679
I actually, so we're talking to Adam on a Wednesday evening

328
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:05,339
and in two days I'm giving a talk called Next Generation Enterprise Security where I

329
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,130
watched a lot of Star Trek and embarrassing amount.

330
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,660
And I basically wrote a talk where I just pick out a bunch of like,

331
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,858
why is security terrible on Star Trek.

332
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,790
And,

333
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,390
and when Adam and I were chatting on Twitter, he mentioned that, oh,

334
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,670
he thinks Star Wars is a better vehicle for conveying security lessons than,

335
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,449
than Star Trek is.

336
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,079
And I'm like,

337
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:28,510
it's on like, II I wanna know. And so anyway, this is it. I'm excited for this answer.

338
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,430
So please, please, please I explain. I'm I'm very excited.

339
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:32,760
So

340
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,619
like the older code that authenticates

341
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,880
or like the tape being stolen.

342
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,420
It's not.

343
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,530
And I say this with love for Star Trek just to be clear.

344
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,689
I think most Star Trek is tremendously well written. We're, we are re-watching next

345
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,359
gem

346
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,880
right now.

347
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,349
But

348
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,060
most of the tech

349
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,089
in Star Trek is something like

350
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,020
the

351
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:02,709
Tachyon emitter has gone mis polarized.

352
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,020
Huh?

353
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,390
They, they call that techno babble in the like writing spheres of Star Trek.

354
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,160
Well, that's what they literally put in the scripts.

355
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,560
Exactly. Exactly. And so

356
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:16,500
it,

357
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,550
it's just something went wrong and we need our people to have some

358
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,250
human conflict over the thing that's going wrong and then to collaborate,

359
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:26,300
which

360
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,969
OK, fine. You know, you, it works as drama.

361
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,479
But in Star Trek there's a data tape that's been stolen from an

362
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,180
off site backup facility and they're chasing people to get it back.

363
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,260
It's, it's just

364
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:41,469
a

365
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:41,810
different,

366
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,349
I can't believe I just did that. All of my.

367
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,989
That's OK. I won't edit that out. At least

368
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,869
now if this was actually Star Trek,

369
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,170
you would malfunction in your head would explode.

370
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,150
No, I mean, no, OK. No, no. I think this is

371
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:03,959
a completely valid explanation. In fact, because you are a, now that you say this,

372
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:08,599
I, I totally see it because technology in Star Trek is fundamentally magic

373
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,560
and I think they put almost an overemphasis on a lot of it. And in fact,

374
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,239
there is most of my talk. I'm just laughing at how

375
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,170
completely idiotic everyone on the ship is like they,

376
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,089
they make the same mistake over and over again.

377
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,500
They have no passwords.

378
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,800
The, the the robot mimics the captain and takes over the ship and it's just this,

379
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:32,760
it it's insane event after insane event. And II, I will agree with you that I think the

380
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,699
stories and

381
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,349
backing material of Star Wars is probably a little more grounded

382
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,739
and you can focus more on the core concepts of what's going

383
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,739
on versus the just hilarious stupidity of everyone on this ship.

384
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,229
-- I think
-- more simply just the, the technology and stuff

385
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,339
Star Wars or Star Trek is, you know, it's uh whatchamacallit deus

386
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,040
ex

387
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,579
machina,

388
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,500
-- right?
-- It's just like we reverse the polarity of the tractor beam and push them away.

389
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,689
-- Boop. Done.
-- So,

390
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,739
so you know, it's the most unbelievable tech in Star Trek

391
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,989
transporters.

392
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,839
Nope,

393
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,349
I'm,

394
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,459
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go with the fact that they can just hail an alien species

395
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:19,920
and magically talk to them without any your mic isn't working. I mean,

396
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,319
is this on,

397
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,319
at the beginning of this recording we were getting echo.

398
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,239
Why do they never have an echo?

399
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,319
And this is, this is with species who have never met before.

400
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,400
That's,

401
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,160
that's freaking magic.

402
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,689
Yeah. The universal translator is pretty amazing.

403
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:44,680
-- Now.
-- I mean, in, in defense of that though,

404
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:50,030
there is a fair bit of long range communication happening in the Star Wars

405
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,459
Universe and we also don't see any of the holograms asking if it's working.

406
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,520
Yeah, but you have one standard like you have the imperial standard,

407
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,979
right?

408
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,680
-- I would assume now
-- that you bring it up.

409
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:07,739
I think what you have is the old Republic standards which are still in use

410
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,060
and the Standards Committee is no longer available to make updates to it.

411
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,099
So if someone found that vulnerability, it would be impossible to get it patched.

412
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,300
I mean, you know, so that's actually funny you say that because

413
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,089
I think history has shown that generally speaking,

414
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,979
when you have a totalitarian regime in charge,

415
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,420
they don't do the little stuff and it's

416
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,150
like boring and annoying as like communication protocols are

417
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,949
they're the functional basis of modern society, right?

418
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:41,010
If we didn't have TCP/IP, like nothing would work

419
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,790
well, just logistics and pallets,

420
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,420
it matters a lot.

421
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm not letting you rat hole us into pallets. Kurt, we're talking about Star Wars.

422
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,160
But no, I think you're right where it's, there's,

423
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,989
there's to make things run efficiently.

424
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,199
In a modern technology based economy which, you know, both Star Wars and Star

425
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,839
are clearly technology based economies.

426
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,449
Yeah, you, you need somebody to write an iso standard on like

427
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,079
screw threads

428
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,209
or, well,

429
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,349
the fact that R two D two can just keep

430
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,829
jacking into all those computers with that spiky thing,

431
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,140
like whoever designed that was a bit of a maniac, but like,

432
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,339
apparently it was successful

433
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,469
and it works,

434
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,349
you know, I love your point about

435
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,510
authoritarian regimes not doing the little things well,

436
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,439
because heck, I

437
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:36,609
can't even keep a USB device with the same cable for five years. Never mind 20.

438
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,020
It's actually, it's funny that came up today.

439
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,880
My son wanted a universal standard like cable. I'm like, yeah, USB,

440
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,599
that's, that's, that was the plan but

441
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,180
-- didn't work
-- out someday someday.

442
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,209
-- There's,
-- there's that XK CD about standards.

443
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,540
That's right. Now, there are 15 standards.

444
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,479
Exactly.

445
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:01,040
Oh, don't give me, I, uh, I'm in the middle of something like that right now.

446
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,410
I, I won't go to detail anyway.

447
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,790
Ok. So

448
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,270
this is, I don't even know where to start.

449
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,010
I, I feel like we just got going and, and we're, we're running ourselves to the end.

450
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,670
But, ok, I'm curious and Kirk brings up R two D two little spiky thing is, is like,

451
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,709
like, tell us about that.

452
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,689
How is that

453
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:21,949
-- used as a learning tool in this book?
-- Ok. So

454
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:26,729
R two uses that little spiky thing to plug into the Death Star.

455
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,650
Ok. I, I want to ask you're a Star. Star Wars nerd. Does that have a name?

456
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,739
-- The plug
-- that AR two has? I don't know that it has a name.

457
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:35,640
Ok.

458
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,119
It

459
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,449
is. Someone's typing in the background so maybe we'll get an answer in a minute.

460
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,089
Oh, it's an S

461
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,189
comp link. SCO MP.

462
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,050
Ok.

463
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,609
-- I love it. A computer coupler.
-- Well, there we have it.

464
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:51,170
The magic of the internet. So ar you plugs in

465
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,839
and starts running quarries,

466
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,920
right? He, he discovers that

467
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,239
there are, there are these power couplers that will cause the tractor beam to go off

468
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,829
and then moments later discovers where Princess Leia is being held.

469
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,939
-- What user ID to those quarries run under?
-- It's easy.

470
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,979
Just use root for everything, you know.

471
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,359
No. Well, there we go.

472
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,479
Just saying,

473
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:22,189
you know, why is there no authentication step that happens?

474
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,520
So one of the questions you can ask is this so

475
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:26,310
thing

476
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,410
like HDM I

477
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,530
where you plug in and the thing on the other side just gets data

478
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,530
or is it like USB when you're plugging in your phone?

479
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,260
And so we can use that to start thinking about concepts like trust boundaries

480
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,209
right? Here's, here's this plugging that happens.

481
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,489
What is the designer expect is plugging in and what can we learn from that?

482
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,609
Sure.

483
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:52,609
So,

484
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,369
so that's how that little spike thing he plays into the book.

485
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,869
I mean that that's a fair point because he not only finds out all the information,

486
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,209
but then he also uses it to shut down the,

487
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,969
the what? The garbage, the trash compactor at some point as well.

488
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,890
Right. So, yeah, it's like reading and writing. Obviously

489
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,770
the trash compactor is the thing that screws

490
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,030
up my utterly geeky theory about what's happening.

491
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:17,489
Oh, you gotta tell us.

492
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:21,459
Here's my utterly geeky theory. It's a little bit like that.

493
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:24,699
That other character is a sith Lord. I'm not even gonna say the name.

494
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:25,420
I

495
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,280
thought

496
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,140
everything

497
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,459
makes sense if you believe

498
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:35,150
that Archie plugs into a honey pot

499
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,660
because

500
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:42,770
the goal of the plan is to allow the princess to escape

501
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:47,339
and follow her to the rebel base. Ah,

502
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:51,380
in order to do that, they put the tracking device on the falcon.

503
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:55,020
They tell R two where she is

504
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,599
and they allow

505
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:02,089
ob one to disable the power coupling but falling into a trash compactor.

506
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,000
Your honey pot doesn't connect to the trash compactor.

507
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,040
Well, what if the trash compactor due to health and safety had to have, you know,

508
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,479
an E stop that could not be disabled or

509
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,930
access to that esop

510
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:14,119
could not be removed?

511
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,640
Oh

512
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:17,400
Right. Because like let me put it this way.

513
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,829
What happens in a data center if you cover the esop?

514
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,089
Like put like it has, it can be behind breakable glass but you can't like wall it off.

515
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,150
Like because you're gonna,

516
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,500
like the fire marshal is going to have harsh words for you.

517
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,339
You have harsh words for Darth Vader.

518
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,140
Go for it.

519
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,500
But I mean, if it,

520
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,010
if you look at it from that health and human safety overriding kind of everything,

521
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,369
then,

522
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,260
then I think it kind of makes sense.

523
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:45,140
That's true. So, our R two D two did not disable the trash compactor.

524
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,489
It just conveniently didn't kill anyone because that's its job.

525
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,729
-- I
-- think you overestimate the, the impact of the Imperial OSHA division

526
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:57,290
and protected lives of work.

527
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,060
Well, in fairness, they weren't real big on safety railings. Huh?

528
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,119
-- They were not big on safety rail
-- legs

529
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,130
like that. That one always got me like, just

530
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,410
like,

531
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,229
I mean, they're not cheap but they're not that expensive.

532
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:12,270
-- I'm
-- pretty sure they're less expensive than having

533
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,849
your staff accidentally fall to their death,

534
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:18,930
especially at crucial moments on a battle station.

535
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,010
If, if you've ever been on like a modern naval warship,

536
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:31,089
the amount of safety gear in place is actually quite large

537
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,650
because when you're gonna go do dangerous things,

538
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,089
you want your people to be safe

539
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,040
when they're doing things under

540
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,250
emotional pressure,

541
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:46,489
when things might be literally blowing up around them

542
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,930
when they might have to be moving quite quickly.

543
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:49,369
Well,

544
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,869
the one counter argument maybe would be is

545
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,589
because they originally started with the clones,

546
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:52,780
right?

547
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,270
And the clones, if memory serves,

548
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,609
they had their emotions damped down a bit and they were just quasi

549
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,180
functional robots in a way. So, maybe

550
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,729
their safety culture comes from that where, you know,

551
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:04,500
they weren't so concerned about the, the cost of human life.

552
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,060
I think their safety culture comes from the s

553
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,660
who enjoy killing people for sport.

554
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:11,510
I,

555
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,510
I think the sith just think this is funny.

556
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,670
Right. It's, well, and, and look, uh, the movie you two are making is gonna suck.

557
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,219
I'm just saying so

558
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,030
fundamentally like, like that's what it comes down to.

559
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:27,430
All right. So

560
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,939
my goodness, I love this.

561
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,189
I, I feel like we've talked about nothing. We've talked about everything,

562
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,349
I guess, Adam,

563
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:38,349
I'll give you the last couple of minutes to just dump some knowledge on us all and,

564
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,540
and then we'll take it home.

565
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,510
Ok.

566
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,369
So

567
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,030
one of the things

568
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,300
that I that's been fun for me

569
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,739
is thinking about

570
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,900
how do I organize all of this

571
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:55,479
and the place that I've ended up is

572
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:00,660
surprising to some people because we don't have a lot of things in computer security

573
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:04,130
that last a very long time that really show

574
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,300
that really age well.

575
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,209
And a lot of people ask me isn't Stride old and creaky

576
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,739
and Stride was created by Lauren Kon

577
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,619
Felder and Preet

578
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,020
Garg in 1999.

579
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,369
Uh You're gonna have to tell the audience what Stride

580
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,239
is because I suspect a bunch of them don't know.

581
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,410
Oh, thank you. Stride is a

582
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:28,739
mic

583
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:34,319
that helps us remember, key threats of spoofing, tampering, repudiation,

584
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:38,660
information, disclosure, denial of service and elevation of privilege.

585
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:40,719
And

586
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,660
so when R two is plugging in, maybe he's spoofing someone.

587
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,260
Ben Kenobi tampers with the power converter that supports the tractor beam.

588
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,699
I think Stride has stood the test of time

589
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,300
and I'm adding to it a couple of additional threats.

590
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,219
There's a threat of predictability.

591
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:07,400
This covers randomness, randomness in cryptography, randomness in memory,

592
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,520
randomness in sequence numbers as things are going across the internet,

593
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,680
predictability

594
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,430
is in and of itself something of a threat.

595
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,839
And I think that's something people need to know.

596
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,400
Another big thing that I cover is parsing

597
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,189
any time

598
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:29,140
parsing happens at trust boundaries.

599
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,829
And so

600
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:34,079
we have to think about why is parsing hard.

601
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,489
And there's a lot of good knowledge from the LST

602
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,109
community

603
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:44,790
that I think is in the category of what every developer needs to know.

604
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,790
And then the thing that brings it together at the end of the book is Kill Chains

605
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:56,979
and Kill Chains are at the end because until you understand the component steps,

606
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:59,420
Kill Chains are hard to understand.

607
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,530
And so sure,

608
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,589
I feel that this is a good organization.

609
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,839
And as I'm announcing the book,

610
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,849
I'm also doing

611
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,119
some beta reading. And so if your listeners are interested

612
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,229
and wanna go to Threats book.com,

613
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,650
we're taking sign ups for people to be beta readers.

614
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,500
You'll get a chapter or two over the summer.

615
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,040
If you've got great feedback, I'll acknowledge it.

616
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,920
If you've got really great feedback, I'll send you an inscribed copy of the book.

617
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,699
And

618
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,140
so

619
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,510
that's the organization that's there.

620
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,000
And

621
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,949
yeah, I this has been so much fun

622
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,439
and I'm hopeful that

623
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,439
this response

624
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,119
extends beyond the three of us

625
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,069
to

626
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,859
every engineer

627
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,939
that even if you're not a Star wars geek,

628
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,400
you have the

629
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,069
basic story, you've run into spoofs,

630
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,420
you've run into an homage.

631
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,469
You've, you've,

632
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,270
you've seen the movie once

633
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:10,709
and that this will make

634
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:14,869
the security concepts accessible to you

635
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:17,589
so that you can actually deliver

636
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,089
more secure systems.

637
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,270
I love that.

638
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,849
And, and I will just for, for anyone listening,

639
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,270
I will put the link to Adam's site in the show notes.

640
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,489
So you don't have to

641
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,150
remember what it is because I've already forgotten it.

642
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:30,930
But

643
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,869
fantastic. This has been an absolute treat.

644
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,140
Adam, I want to thank you so very much for coming and talking to us about your book.

645
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,319
Thank you for having me. I, you know,

646
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,020
I, I apologize but I had no idea that you had done an entire episode

647
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,979
on rogue one.

648
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,479
-- It's been a while.
-- It was five or six years ago. It was episode 29.

649
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,180
This is like 300 something. Was it that long? Holy cow.

650
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:58,469
I

651
00:32:58,619 --> 00:32:58,640
know

652
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,939
when I saw that I was like, oh,

653
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,209
my kids were like, not really talking back then.

654
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:05,560
Wow.

655
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,270
Yeah, it's been a while.

656
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,770
-- These classic stories stick with people. I
-- agree.

657
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,400
I agree. All right. All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna end this one.

658
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,479
Thank you so much, Adam. Thank you everyone for listening.
