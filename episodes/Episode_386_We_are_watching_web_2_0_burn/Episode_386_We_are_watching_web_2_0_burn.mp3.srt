Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:12,100
Kurt Siefried and my partner enjoying the web browsing experience.

2
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,050
Josh Pressers. We'll get to that.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,290
All right, before we start part of the research I did for this episode.

4
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:23,170
Do you know how to spell the word Wildebeest? Wildebe Est? Ok. So you got it right.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,799
Be Est. I was like, there's no way. That's right.

6
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,870
I thought it must be some weird British spelling or something.

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,009
No, that's like the actual way you spell Wildebeest be Est.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,360
And that's apparently how the Dutch spell beast.

9
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:37,979
It's a Dutch origin.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,220
The Dutch are even cooler now, in my opinion than they were before this.

11
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,974
You just called the Dutch? Cool. They are. The Dutch are very cool.

12
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,994
Come on, I'm German. So like,

13
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:46,514
uh

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,674
I'm very Dutch. I'm very Dutch and the Dutch are cool because they have good cheese.

15
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:57,095
Amsterdam is a lovely city and now they spell beast. Be Est.

16
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,875
Yeah. Well, that's how you spell the word beast

17
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,794
in, in Dutch.

18
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:03,465
Anyway. All right.

19
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,824
So we're gonna talk about

20
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:07,955
Google's

21
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:11,224
insane web browser proposal, but

22
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:16,599
I'm going to make it much bigger than this. Well, actually, it's worse than that. OK.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,669
You start with why it's worse and then we'll go. Well, no, let's start.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,760
I actually, there are some elements of their proposal that I enjoy in the sense of.

25
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,230
So in cloud computing, for example,

26
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,250
we're finally making inroads with confidential computing,

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,839
which means I can compute a workload

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,519
and I don't have to worry about Amazon sticking

29
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:33,250
their grubby little paws in it in theory.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,230
Yes. And

31
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,360
some thing along

32
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:40,254
those lines would be good for the web where the browser could attest

33
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:45,165
to certain capabilities or like I am a public computer for the love of God.

34
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,964
You should never log into your bank on me,

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,605
right?

36
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,095
Or something like where it could block stuff like that or conversely,

37
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:52,684
I am a very private computer, very secure.

38
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:53,235
So like

39
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,555
stop harassing Kurt with his BS two fa and just let

40
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,675
him log into his bank and pay a bill also.

41
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:01,074
He has no money. So if anybody breaks in, it's fine.

42
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,059
The problem is

43
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,110
that's my banking security strategy man. I'm just, I don't have any money in there.

44
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:07,720
I

45
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,059
I

46
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,600
spend it all on bills. There you go.

47
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,360
So Google had this idea for the web environment integrity.

48
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:15,960
Oh no, it,

49
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,389
it we I web environment integrity which like on the surface is like honestly, we,

50
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,960
the industry as a whole needs to move to the level

51
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,369
of maturity where things can attest to what they are.

52
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,929
Am I a human. Am I a bot?

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,820
Am I

54
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,860
do? I maybe theoretically have an ad blocker installed. And, aha,

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,500
here's where things start to go off the rails. Right. Because

56
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,679
everybody views this

57
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:40,639
and Google gives the example of, you know, websites,

58
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,479
some websites are expensive to run and, like,

59
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,919
supported by ads and if you have an ad blocker then

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,369
they can't afford to run it. Like, I wonder who that's geared at.

61
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,800
Yeah.

62
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:53,080
So, Google, everybody's like Google, this sounds a lot like DRM to lock people out of

63
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,789
using ad blockers and Google's like, no, no, no, no, no.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,000
We, we would never do that except,

65
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,229
except for the time they did last year with

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,919
the V three manifest and the extensions ignoring that.

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,649
But as you said,

68
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,889
none of that matters for a simple reason. And can I

69
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,839
read the reason if I said no, would it matter?

70
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,729
Well, you can always edit it out of the show.

71
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:15,850
So Google,

72
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,520
so Google dropped their financial results today. I've not seen these.

73
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,809
This is completely new to me. Uh

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,429
OK. So

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,729
from 2020 to 2021 because of COVID,

76
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,860
there was a massive surge in online advertising like 40%.

77
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:30,169
So

78
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,910
sorry. Um Google's numbers.

79
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,695
So they went from 146 point 92 billion to 209.49 billion.

80
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:39,945
So like a 41 point whatever percent bump like, wow,

81
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,074
some people got some bonuses that year.

82
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:46,145
Uh But from 2021 to 2022 209 to 224.

83
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:51,145
Ok, I mean low single digits improvements. It's still respectable.

84
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,464
I would say this year's looking maybe not as good.

85
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,535
Is it flat or is it going down? It's probably still going up but

86
00:03:58,744 --> 00:03:59,654
less.

87
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:00,904
And that's,

88
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:01,714
this is,

89
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,945
but this is for a business

90
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,490
in

91
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,259
tech

92
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,000
with the pe ratio of whatever Google's pe ratio for their stock is

93
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,490
this is the apocalypse.

94
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,759
The view of the, the companies like Google and Facebook and, well, I'll,

95
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,169
I'll say Twitter cheekily,

96
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:15,740
but

97
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,468
it was always like that double

98
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,509
digit. I love that. You meant meta and a

99
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,468
like you're, you're like now six years behind renames. I am, I'm, I'm old now.

100
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,209
I could do that.

101
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,609
But get off by law, you kids,

102
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:30,598
these companies have experienced like 10 and 20% growth forever.

103
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:31,739
Well, and that's the thing. So

104
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,759
Google, Amazon and Microsoft

105
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,449
Azure. So their cloud stuff is still growing between 16 and 28%

106
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,440
year on

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,269
which is nice and healthy. But here's the problem.

108
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,859
How much money roughly did Google make

109
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,230
off advertising last in their financial results?

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,299
I bet it was 80% or more. Well, yeah, exactly.

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,820
And so the problem is they made like 56 billion off advertising and

112
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,500
about 6 billion off cloud and about 6 billion off other stuff.

113
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,790
So

114
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,010
like, yeah, 26 or 20% increase. That's great.

115
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,040
But a 20 26% increase on and I say only 6 billion, like I have any money.

116
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,790
Right. But, but for these companies, that's,

117
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,790
that's not a lot of money I get. That's one or 2 billion a year in growth. That's,

118
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,980
that's a, that's literally a rounding error on their advertising revenue.

119
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,630
Oh, yeah, for sure, for sure.

120
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,670
But, but here's,

121
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,820
and that's the thing I love is they're trying to technology their

122
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,709
way out of an economics and it's not even an economics problem.

123
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,470
It's a human behavior

124
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:33,100
problem. Yes, that is exactly where we were going to end up.

125
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:35,950
Or at least I, I hoped we would, I can never guarantee anything

126
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,559
but

127
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:37,279
like, no

128
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:37,989
bottles.

129
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,619
They paid my

130
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:38,910
street,

131
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:39,959
no

132
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,160
straight up. They paid like two blocks of the street. That was really bad.

133
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,160
It's lovely. Now, it's like as flat as a pancake

134
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,890
here is why I was looking up Wildebeests

135
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,000
because I didn't know how to spell it.

136
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,790
You didn't watch Wild Mutual of Omaha as a kid. I did.

137
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,649
But it's not like I knew how to spell Wildebeest.

138
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,769
I assumed Wildebeest

139
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,440
was W

140
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,450
I LDA beast

141
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,980
because I'm from the Midwest and we spell everything the way it sounds

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,790
and if it's not, we, we change the pronunciation to match what we think it should be.

143
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,089
I was about to say

144
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,410
like, welcome to the Midwest. Everyone come to our French towns

145
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,390
like

146
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,500
anyway.

147
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,880
So I think we are experiencing

148
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,720
the end of what we'll call web two, which was the advertising fueled everything.

149
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,480
And I think the behavior we're seeing everything,

150
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,640
literally everything.

151
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:40,529
I think the, the behavior we're seeing from the likes of Meta and X and Google

152
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,200
and

153
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,980
Amazon and literally everyone because a lot of these companies,

154
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,779
it looks like they're being run by lunatics,

155
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,859
they're making decisions that are bizarre

156
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,010
and they're clearly, they don't have like a good solid direction,

157
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,239
they don't know what's happening.

158
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,869
And I think this is my, my,

159
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,500
my comparison is that the people in charge

160
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,500
and the investors and the venture capitalists,

161
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,609
some of them know what, what is happening.

162
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,739
I bet a lot of them don't. It's kind of like how, when you have a herd of wildebeest,

163
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:14,785
they don't know what they're doing, they go where the food is.

164
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:18,345
Right. And I think that is what we're seeing is this ad revenue

165
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,385
is starting to dry up

166
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:24,174
and you're seeing investment in things moving somewhere else.

167
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:27,265
And a lot of people don't know what's happening and they don't know why

168
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:30,494
it's not that it's drying up. It's that it's growing

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,220
slower and it's slowing down enough that while it's technically not flatlining it,

170
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,769
anything less than 5% growth a year is basically dead.

171
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:39,600
Right.

172
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,519
And so

173
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,579
it doesn't have to flatline or even be that bad.

174
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,899
It just if it's less than 5% growth a year, you have a real problem.

175
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,200
The other thing

176
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,559
I think that's happening is a lot of

177
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,470
these subscription services are increasing their prices too

178
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,239
and offering, you know, like lower tier

179
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,000
ad supported ones because,

180
00:07:59,470 --> 00:07:59,940
well,

181
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,890
to put it bluntly getting $10 a month from somebody

182
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,010
and showing them ads is a lot better than getting

183
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,630
nothing from them.

184
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,720
Right.

185
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,299
Because like you, let's be real, your incremental costs on digital goods are

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,489
as close to zero as they can be without,

187
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,489
you know, needing a math degree to express.

188
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,570
No. Really? Right.

189
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,820
Like I know.

190
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,559
So,

191
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,750
and

192
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,429
the other thing is I, I feel like one of the things I think you missed

193
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,959
and that just occurred to me is we also have a new generation coming in

194
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,600
a generation that has grown up with web two and advertising

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,099
and the minute they see it without the, without the ads with an A blocker and stuff,

196
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:37,239
they're like, oh, I like that more.

197
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,440
But

198
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,590
my son still,

199
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,080
like he just has muscle memory for that skip button is on, on youtube

200
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,409
because when he's at school and it's on the digital projector,

201
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,369
he literally will just like shuffle over to where that button's gonna show

202
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,880
up because they're not logged like they're not logged into a premium account

203
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,510
and, and it's funny because

204
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,200
like the other kid be like, you're blocking the way and, and the teacher will be like,

205
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,280
he's going to hit the ad skip button.

206
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,200
They're like, oh, ok.

207
00:08:58,669 --> 00:08:59,270
Right.

208
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:00,880
You know,

209
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:02,570
they're,

210
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,429
they're, these kids are digital native, like

211
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,630
they've had ipads and high speed internet since

212
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:12,849
they were in diapers. Oh, yeah. They don't know any better. Absolutely. I really, I

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,950
can't help but think the advertising doesn't work as well

214
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,369
to some degree on them and more to the point

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,190
they're savvier at blocking it well, and not only that they don't have any money.

216
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,049
I mean, I don't want to be, like, in a hole or anything but, like,

217
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,390
the young generation is totally being hosed over

218
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,739
by the old people between rent and all.

219
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:33,934
Oh, my God. I bought two potatoes today and I, well, I texted you. So or I signaled you.

220
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:34,015
So

221
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,275
this sounds like the most Russian story ever. Yeah.

222
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:43,325
So I bought two large potatoes today to do baked potato skins and they cost $7.47

223
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,424
and minimum wage locally is $15.

224
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:49,565
So half an hour of work at minimum wage to buy two large russet potatoes.

225
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:50,414
That's

226
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:55,400
insane. That sounds like some like communist Russia stuff right there. I know.

227
00:09:55,489 --> 00:10:00,159
But it, it literally means I could buy 16 potatoes a day if I worked minimum wage. And

228
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,359
that doesn't include rent or anything.

229
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,039
Like, yeah, the,

230
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,919
the younger generation advertising is not going to work on them because

231
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:07,969
they don't have two Kopec

232
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,760
to rub together or two potatoes. In this case.

233
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:11,950
I think this is, oh,

234
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,710
my goodness.

235
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,239
Again,

236
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,359
I think this comes back to not a lot of people don't understand what's

237
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,650
going on and they don't know why they're doing things and I think this,

238
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:25,299
this Google proposal is a great example.

239
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,559
Right. Well, first of all,

240
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,570
they did it with a

241
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:29,400
non

242
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,200
Google Github

243
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,960
repository. Right. Then

244
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:35,760
they got some hilarious issues filed, like one that's like, are,

245
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,869
are you the bad guys?

246
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,729
They lock it.

247
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,450
So, first of all, if your open source project has to have the,

248
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,210
the repository locked from external contributors,

249
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,489
like you're doing something wrong,

250
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,530
but then

251
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,330
they had a hacker news thread where they basically did their best to say, oh, no, no,

252
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,690
we're not the bad guys here like we're the good guys.

253
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,690
And here's the thing.

254
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,169
I have no doubt

255
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,609
the people who put this proposal together

256
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,570
think they're doing the right thing

257
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,469
because I think they are stuck in the middle of

258
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,710
the herd and they don't understand what's happening around them.

259
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:10,309
I think they have nothing but good intentions.

260
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,070
But obviously anyone on the outside looks at this and you

261
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,830
see exactly what the cliff they're all going to jump off of

262
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,159
this will be the literal death of Web two because all of a sudden we'll be locked. Like

263
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,840
when I browse the web on my mobile phone,

264
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,799
I try not to because I don't run an ad blocker

265
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,489
on my phone and it is horrifying like it is,

266
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,539
it

267
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,159
is almost impossible to navigate some of these sites. And I'm pretty nimble,

268
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,320
you know, you can install the duck, duck go Browser on your phone.

269
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,729
And it does a pretty good job.

270
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:41,219
But, I mean, more to the point I don't want to go to those sites really.

271
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,359
And I'm trying to be a bit anyways.

272
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,580
The majority of sites I actually go to are like

273
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,780
people's blogs and stuff that actually don't have advertising.

274
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:49,549
It's quite lovely.

275
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,010
No, I get it for sure.

276
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,840
That's why I love, like, lemme and Mastodon have become my favorite sites because

277
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,989
I give Jerry Bell money and he gives me

278
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,270
amusement.

279
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,010
And I mean, how do you explain people's $100 cable bill? That's

280
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,179
people will pay for

281
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,299
you pay for ads.

282
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,760
So I know, right, remember called the whole premise of cable TV,

283
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,239
early on was it's you pay for it.

284
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,179
So there's no ads and that's,

285
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,030
I think that's part of the challenge is the cult like I've been looking at the,

286
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,625
what's fascinating to me is

287
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:24,895
so we have now the cloud, the hyper cloud players, right?

288
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:25,994
There's three of them Google,

289
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:29,135
Amazon and Microsoft and they are three different companies, right?

290
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:32,114
Google is an advertising company that happens to have cloud, right?

291
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:37,145
Amazon is a merchant, right? They're all about that high volume sales.

292
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:38,614
That's their culture

293
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:41,565
that happens to have a cloud and their cloud really does reflect that.

294
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,434
And then Microsoft of course,

295
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:46,215
is the classic business solutions to the point of throwing chairs at people

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,989
and their cloud really reflects that right? It's all about Business Solutions.

297
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Right.

298
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,580
And well, let me put it this way. Like

299
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,690
Gmail will Gmail still be around in 50 years. Would you bet a kidney on it?

300
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,760
I would not bet a kidney on that. I would not take that bet. Ok,

301
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,489
Microsoft Outlook. Will it be around in 100 years?

302
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,000
For sure. Absolutely. Absolutely.

303
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,890
It'll probably still be named Outlook, but it'll be like, oh, look 1000

304
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,359
and you'll probably still have to rebuild those PST files

305
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:16,520
for

306
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,000
sure.

307
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,000
And, you know, and,

308
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:20,619
and looking at

309
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,830
like the whole A I thing and the, the web two thing and where all this is headed.

310
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,849
I mean, fundamentally, here's the thing we have tried for 20 years

311
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,390
to find a way to make websites, make money. Right. Right. That's right.

312
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,280
The answer is advertising. Well, even then it was a tall hill decline.

313
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:38,599
Yeah.

314
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,400
But, I mean, we tried micropayments many, many times.

315
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,190
We've tried it again with Blockchain

316
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:44,000
and

317
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,039
ignoring the technology that doesn't work.

318
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,960
But let's assume for a moment that somehow

319
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,869
micro payment technology works and it's efficient enough that

320
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,419
you can actually do a one penny transaction

321
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,880
without paying like a dollar in transaction fees.

322
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:58,200
But the cognitive load for a human being

323
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,280
to, like, like I said to you earlier, like, people,

324
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,840
I, the thing I find most offensive about tipping is I have to think about it a lot.

325
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:05,200
Like,

326
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,940
and I've come to the conclusion that, like,

327
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,039
if I'm asked for a tip before I'm given service.

328
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,679
I'm not tipping because how do I know how good service will be?

329
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,559
Well, it's going to be bad if you don't give him a tip.

330
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,340
Right? But that's the thing, right?

331
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:20,510
So there's this cognitive load and I just, you want spit in your coffee,

332
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,159
Kirk because that's how you get spit in your coffee pretty much.

333
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:27,679
So, when I think about, if I had to like cognitively think about,

334
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,000
do I want to see this web page or not for a penny?

335
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:30,760
Oh,

336
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,599
man.

337
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:32,580
Problem though is,

338
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,039
is that we don't have any other path to monetization for websites.

339
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,000
That's OK. So this, I think is part of the discussion

340
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,320
and this is something I've been thinking about. So

341
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,739
the old way of the internet is going to die.

342
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:47,380
The,

343
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,210
the way Google and Facebook and Twitter and all these

344
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:52,919
services have worked in the past is going to,

345
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:53,820
it is failing.

346
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,229
We are watching it unravel. That is why

347
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,419
it

348
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,349
ignoring that. Like it feels like

349
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,380
no one is driving the bus

350
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,919
and they are,

351
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,809
they just don't know what they're doing because the

352
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,229
way they used to work no longer functions.

353
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,210
And so they're just literally throwing spaghetti at the wall.

354
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,330
Now something is going to

355
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,770
replace

356
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,109
all of these things.

357
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,619
And like it's funny because people talk about,

358
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,320
oh I need a Twitter replacement like no Twitter is dead forever.

359
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,835
You, you're never going to replace it. Mastodon is not a Twitter replacement.

360
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:27,315
Mastodon is a totally different thing. That's ok.

361
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:30,255
And it's never going to replace, nothing will ever replace Twitter,

362
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,494
which may be good or bad.

363
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:32,294
But anyway,

364
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:36,294
what comes in and, and kind of, I guess takes over now,

365
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,434
we don't know because it doesn't exist and

366
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,135
it's going to be something we can't imagine

367
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,455
because the reality is, if you looked at the internet in 1997

368
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:48,289
right? Like it was very new, it was very different.

369
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,340
I mean, I remember the dial up and Netscape one point. Oh, and all the stuff

370
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,039
we could not have even explained

371
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,489
where we are today. How would you explain an iphone to somebody from 20 years ago?

372
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,190
Whatever man, I would have like literally sold my siblings for an iphone back then.

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,770
Like I would have given anything to have the internet in my pocket.

374
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,130
I think most of us would sell our siblings for a sandwich.

375
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,609
It did have to be an ok sandwich. Like, but

376
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,700
anyway,

377
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:17,809
but anyway,

378
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,719
anyway, oh my goodness. I

379
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,630
think about sandwiches.

380
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
You have to, you have to sell something you actually care about.

381
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,590
Ok. Ok.

382
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,150
So

383
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,159
I

384
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:30,799
do like my dog a lot. I just, anyway, that's another story. So. Right.

385
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:34,320
You've derailed me. But anyway, so something is going to replace these things.

386
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,570
We don't know what it is and we can't imagine what it is at this point.

387
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,400
And so I dare not speculate.

388
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,309
Well, and the beautiful thing too is, is Facebook and Google and all that won't

389
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,669
like they can actually die, die because they're a company.

390
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,330
But something like Irc still chugging along like

391
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,630
there are still Irc networks now there,

392
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,080
I would call them dead even though they actually have tens

393
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,369
or hundreds of thousands of people using them every day.

394
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,760
But in the global context of like half of all adults owning a smartphone

395
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:04,680
that it's a,

396
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,550
it's not even a rounding error. It's zero, it's zero for sure.

397
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,618
And I think Mastodon is going to be the same thing where the people who

398
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,189
use Mastodon are going to love it and they're going to be very successful with it

399
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,750
from the perspective of how you define success in the context of Twitter,

400
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,750
Mastodon is a failure.

401
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,670
But luckily Mastodon doesn't care what you think. Exactly.

402
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,189
And so that's one thing I find fascinating

403
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,030
is something like Google can actually die,

404
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,630
die.

405
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:32,349
And whereas protocols can't, and that I think is the other thing is

406
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,079
still exists. Exactly. You know, and like, dig is a weird music site now. It's

407
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,500
super,

408
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,300
like I went through the, I went through like a couple of years ago

409
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,670
and I was like, what even is this?

410
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,369
Oh, it's no, it's not a music. What is this?

411
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,380
Oh, it's buzzfeed. Ok. Never

412
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,000
mind that explains it. Yeah. It's basically,

413
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:55,650
I think based on the whatever it doesn't matter, quit, quit browsing the web on

414
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:55,920
a pod.

415
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:02,959
The thing is the problem though is in this sort of death throes and thrashing around.

416
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,635
Are they going to hurt you people

417
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,885
and make things worse or maybe, you know,

418
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,675
just hasten their demise or are they actually going

419
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,375
to maybe take out something good with them?

420
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:10,994
I mean, it,

421
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,625
one of my concerns

422
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,155
is like we've,

423
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:17,875
I think we've firmly as a species decided that the web browser is the thing.

424
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:18,984
It's cool like it,

425
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:23,484
it is a thing. So actually, on that note, I literally just found out

426
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,594
right before we hit record,

427
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,000
there is a new thing. You'll have to look it up and we'll talk about it some other day.

428
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,520
It's called the island browser.

429
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,489
It's claiming it's an enterprise web browser that has all these

430
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,020
like weird enterprise features about like at a station and,

431
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,160
and some other details.

432
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,469
So like Microsoft Edge with GPO.

433
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,380
Um

434
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,359
I don't know, does edge do that? I don't know,

435
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,459
Microsoft edge is integrated with

436
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,569
windows and you can apply group policy objects to it.

437
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,250
There you go.

438
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,589
But anyway, we were

439
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:50,880
doing

440
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,010
15 years ago.

441
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,280
OK. I mean that could be, I don't know. I'm, I'm not hip with enterprises

442
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,949
Microsoft proxy one point. Oh

443
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,180
I passed that exam.

444
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,790
I I don't want to.

445
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,750
But anyway, though,

446
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,680
your point being right about kind of all

447
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:06,030
this enterprise stuff and what's coming next.

448
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,500
Yeah,

449
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,030
I, I don't know. It's, it's fascinating

450
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,270
and it's terrifying

451
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,280
because we live through the.com crash. Which I think was the death of Web one

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,910
point. Oh,

453
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,609
now we see the rise of Web two point.

454
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:22,709
Oh, I'm not going to talk about Web three because that's a poison term. Now,

455
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,630
I don't know what we'll call the next thing,

456
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,829
but it's going to be fascinating. It might not be the web. That's the crazy thing.

457
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,670
No, that's true. Actually, that's a good point.

458
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,760
Like there might be a new protocol that comes out. That is no, you know what?

459
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,469
I don't think there is. I think HTTP is too good to replace

460
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:41,069
it, solves too many problems that are hard and it does it well.

461
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,569
And I mean, you've already got all this

462
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,984
instructure where you can pay or not even pay cloud

463
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:47,375
flare to distribute all your junk without getting attacked.

464
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,135
And that's a big thing people underestimate

465
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,334
is like there's not even the chicken and the egg problem of getting people to

466
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,204
install the client because there's no service and

467
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,474
there's no service because there's no clients.

468
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:55,905
But like

469
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:56,614
just

470
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,285
running a site and doing global data delivery

471
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:01,795
is hard.

472
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,055
Yeah. No, look, I firmly believe

473
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:06,494
so. Here's

474
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:10,734
one way to look at this when the birth of sites like Google

475
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,415
and Facebook and all this,

476
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,569
you had a massive amount of venture capital come in

477
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:18,410
and it funded

478
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,410
this essentially giant R and D division

479
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:25,869
that for whatever reason landed on ads as the revenue source.

480
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,290
And I don't know if they tried other things. I think it's because it's easy

481
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:30,099
because

482
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,979
it's easy to convince people to spend money on advertising through just a,

483
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,189
simply a different channel.

484
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,040
Sure. And, uh, probably,

485
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:37,530
and a

486
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:39,239
lot of companies had

487
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,989
the infrastructure and mindset for spending money that way exists. Right. Right.

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,469
They're not selling them a new thing. It's ads on the internet. It's, that's right.

489
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,239
According to the patent, it's ads with a computer system and they had budgets,

490
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,569
right?

491
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,589
They had budgets for ads like, ok,

492
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,150
let's just take some of our ad budget and give it to these

493
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,875
people over here and they say they're doing things and maybe they are,

494
00:20:58,885 --> 00:20:59,385
we don't know.

495
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:02,265
And then that led to a virtuous cycle of like, oh, we can do more,

496
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:06,724
targeted, targeted advertising by knowing that you're a white male that whatever,

497
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:07,094
whatever.

498
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:11,655
And of course, that has led to one or two problems but, you know, nothing too major.

499
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:15,145
But now, now here's, here's the thing and I don't want to burst any bubbles.

500
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:15,885
But I'm gonna,

501
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:18,425
because there are people who think

502
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,574
things like the Fetta verse are going to be the next thing.

503
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:24,025
And I love the Fetta verse more than I should.

504
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:24,859
Yeah,

505
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,810
I don't think it's gonna be that the, the, the thing that pisses me off.

506
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,560
We've had the Federer.

507
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,959
Like, do you not remember Irc Federer

508
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:31,849
is cooler?

509
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,209
But I'm saying like we, it's a similar concept, right? The

510
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:36,030
defer

511
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,369
multiple servers, blah, blah, blah. And, and here's the reason I say this though,

512
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:44,380
there was a story, I read one time about this guy who was creating a company

513
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,670
and he was doing it

514
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,630
entirely self funded, right? Where he had a good idea

515
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,500
and he was controlling costs and he was hiring slow

516
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,469
and he had a couple of customers and he was making money and doing well.

517
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:00,319
And then one day the CEO of a competitor shows up and says I'm going to,

518
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,589
you can sell to me now or I'll kill you in a year.

519
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,209
And the guy was like, what do you mean?

520
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,680
And he said, look, I've got venture capitalists behind me lined up.

521
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm gonna hire more sales people in a month than you have employees.

522
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,380
We're going to go to every one of your customers. We're gonna undercut, you

523
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,040
know, more than you can even reasonably fathom.

524
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,310
We're going to steal all of your customers in six months.

525
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,810
You'll have zero revenue in a year, like sell to me now or go out of business.

526
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,439
And that is what is going to happen because you're going to see some company

527
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,380
a merge that's venture capital funded, that can afford to do

528
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,280
weird things like they don't need ads with A I

529
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,609
now you can do super tar like I'm looking ok,

530
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm gonna do a little disclosure of private stuff I have,

531
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:48,020
I'm kind of incubating a product, um, a project I'm calling concierge at the CS A.

532
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,630
And the idea is

533
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,880
so, for example,

534
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,719
I could take your resume, go through it with you,

535
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,135
talk to you about what you want to do with your career. Do you want to work from home?

536
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:56,984
Do you want to have a family?

537
00:22:56,994 --> 00:23:00,204
And we could figure out like, what is an ideal sort of job for you?

538
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,844
And so what do you need to do to get that job?

539
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:03,425
What certifications, what training, what,

540
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,025
how do you need to bump your resume on all that?

541
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,135
Right. We could do that today.

542
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:09,814
The problem is it would take me two or three hours and so it doesn't scale, right?

543
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,675
I am 99.7. 3%. Sure. We can design some chat GP T prompts that will do most of that work.

544
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,084
I mean, that could be, and then basically,

545
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,760
like, sell that, for example, for 100 bucks

546
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,599
and make a lot of money. Like, there would be a good margin on that product.

547
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,560
Well, the margin is $100.

548
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,819
Well, no, no, no, the API calls are actually quite not cheap.

549
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,640
Are they really?

550
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,349
Yeah, it'd be like five bucks.

551
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:34,160
Um,

552
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,550
you know, but that's the point.

553
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,969
Like if, if, if you had a service that could really, like, there are career coaches,

554
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,250
they charge a lot of money.

555
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,069
But if you could have something that would actually, like,

556
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,270
help you in the infosec industry, get a much better job

557
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,800
with a, like, even a 10% chance of that working. And it only costs 100 bucks,

558
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:53,515
like a lot of people jump on that.

559
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,635
And that's an example. I'm not, I don't think we'll maybe do that. But the point is

560
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:02,704
with A I, you can scale out really complicated heavy tasks.

561
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,704
And I think that is gonna,

562
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,265
that is what's going to be coming next because somebody's

563
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,454
going to figure out the killer app where the A I

564
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,630
tells you a personalized bedtime story or

565
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,089
tells you a personalized newspaper based on,

566
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:15,880
I, I don't know.

567
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,609
Right. But it's,

568
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,510
there's, there

569
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,079
are

570
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,750
things that are capable. Right. Exactly.

571
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,469
But the point is there are things that are capable now that we couldn't even imagine.

572
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,310
But, but here's the challenge.

573
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,109
So the challenge though Kurt, and this is what is going to be the issue. We see

574
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:34,709
the challenge is always going to be, what is the road to monetization? Exactly.

575
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:35,569
Exactly.

576
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,390
If it's not ads, which

577
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,630
I don't know if, I mean, it is completely conceivable.

578
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,589
There will be a new company that invents, I'll put in events in quotes, air quotes,

579
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,219
invents a new way to sell online advertising that all

580
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,150
the advertisers flock to and say this is it,

581
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,030
this makes sense.

582
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:52,060
Well,

583
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,390
advertising reminds me of let's encrypt in the

584
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,160
sense of even if our concierge projects,

585
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,469
whatever charge a penny,

586
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,849
that's a massive amount of money and hassle for everybody versus advertising.

587
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:03,329
Is just,

588
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,989
you consume the advertising but you, you can't,

589
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:07,369
most of this,

590
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:11,859
like, web scale stuff you can't charge for because

591
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,839
when your target audience is in the billions of people, billions of people

592
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,520
can't spend money.

593
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, they don't have credit cards even if they have money.

594
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,119
Yeah. Right. Right.

595
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,040
It's, it's just not practical and, and that's why ads have been the key.

596
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,630
But of course, we've also, like,

597
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,520
all of our personal details are now in Mark Zuckerberg's basement and like

598
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,339
this sucks and everyone knows everything about me and I hate it.

599
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,050
I don't know,

600
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,500
maybe it's just,

601
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:39,300
no, it sucks. People used

602
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,359
to small villages and everybody knew everything

603
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,699
that's,

604
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,319
that's totally different.

605
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:44,760
Yeah.

606
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,800
But uh no, I think the thing that's gonna happen is I think fundamentally,

607
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,880
like you said, the problem is not the technology, it's

608
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,349
the path to monetization and how that interacts with basic human behaviors

609
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,560
because

610
00:25:58,069 --> 00:25:58,550
not just that

611
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:01,369
just that people to make any decisions is hard.

612
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,189
That's not, that's not even the issue. The issue is

613
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,479
many good ideas

614
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,790
won't be back for venture capital

615
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,880
and the things that venture capital backs will murder the other stuff.

616
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,689
Well, I shouldn't say murder,

617
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,910
murder is the wrong word because things like the Fetta verse,

618
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,310
the Fetta verse is going to be fine,

619
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:18,010
but the Fed

620
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,250
Averse is never going to have 6 billion people using it.

621
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,910
Average people will hear about threats because

622
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,420
they have an advertising budget and even people

623
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,729
in tech still don't know what the heck Mastodon is or the Fed Averse is.

624
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:32,969
Sure. Right. Exactly. There's no advertising budget. Absolutely. And it,

625
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:37,055
you know, again, Mastodon doesn't care like it's hard to use. I don't care.

626
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:37,854
Not my problem

627
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,135
to me. That's a feature.

628
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:40,265
No,

629
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,074
seriously, because I

630
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,334
disagree.

631
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:46,655
I don't mean to be a jerk. But like Irc, remember Eternal September back in what?

632
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,415
9899?

633
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,420
Well, that was use net eternal September was useless.

634
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:56,869
Irc definitely had its own set of complications we'll say

635
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,400
over the,

636
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,930
oh my goodness. I remember some of the trolls you do on Irc. It was so good. Hunter two.

637
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,290
Hunter two comes

638
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:04,885
IC

639
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:07,454
I will put a link to Hunter Two

640
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,714
in the show notes if you don't know what that is

641
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,125
like, I I know like no one clicks, show notes.

642
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:17,844
You want to click this one because Hunter Two is the best story you will ever read.

643
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:19,944
I think it goes back to the defining success.

644
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:25,224
And what like fundamentally people have a basic human need for connection,

645
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:28,775
storytelling, story, listening, connecting, eating food together,

646
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,484
sitting together on a park bench, holding hands, right?

647
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:32,655
Basic human connection.

648
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:33,729
And that

649
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,589
if you look at sort of these killer apps,

650
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,780
they've always been kind of wrapped around human connection, right?

651
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,060
The fax machine, email, social media.

652
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,969
And one of the things I kind of hope for is I worry that these things end up getting,

653
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:47,479
like, really mangled and perverted, like Facebook started out.

654
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:50,219
No, I'm not going to say Facebook started with good intentions. But,

655
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,069
you know, you chat with your family and stuff and now it's become

656
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,540
the horror show that Facebook is.

657
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,609
Oh, well, Twitter is a better example where Twitter went from,

658
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,689
like something that was kind of cool

659
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:58,704
to like,

660
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,484
oh my God, it's,

661
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:01,785
I don't know what happened to you.

662
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,714
Well, no, we know exactly what happened, but

663
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:07,005
the right wing moved in and nobody kicked them out

664
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:11,834
and then that's the owner like, and now they're, now they're X

665
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:12,444
Yeah.

666
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:13,645
And I love that.

667
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,214
There's so somebody was like, oh,

668
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,795
Facebook owns the trademark X as it pertains to social media.

669
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,055
And then somebody else was like, oh, but also Microsoft and then somebody's like,

670
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:20,954
no, don't worry about it.

671
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,724
There are 700

672
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,250
registered ex trademarks of which a bunch of them are social media

673
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,989
and

674
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,689
companies that are, I was gonna say on par with

675
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,510
X or Twitter or whatever.

676
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,670
But no, they're actually a lot larger now,

677
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,400
Twitter fired half of their people

678
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:38,209
or more.

679
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:41,069
And my first thought when I read that was like,

680
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,270
I'm shocked the lawyers let them do that.

681
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,550
And I was like, oh, wait, there are no lawyers anymore.

682
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:50,349
Did you hear there apparently something like $700 million in pending

683
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,939
lawsuits regarding severance pay? I have no doubt. Like the number was, I think,

684
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,530
I think it was 700. It was a big number.

685
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,400
So,

686
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,890
I mean, just now when I

687
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,300
die alone, let's, let's bring this one home. We're out of time. To me.

688
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,439
The hopeful news is things like the fetters.

689
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,520
Now, somebody like Jerry Bell can run

690
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,660
a system

691
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,380
with multiple servers for tens of thousands of people affordably

692
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,920
like a less than a buck a month per user.

693
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:22,359
And so if even like 10% of his users donate a bit of money,

694
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:23,800
it's sustainable.

695
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,349
And

696
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:24,939
that

697
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:28,930
I don't know if it's sustainable. I think Jerry's still paying a lot out of pocket,

698
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,500
but regardless, just have him turn it off for an hour and screen test everybody. No.

699
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,589
Seriously. Right. Like,

700
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,000
like just screen test.

701
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,819
Like the thing is like Wikipedia, for example,

702
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,020
is at the point now where they actually have a huge endowment,

703
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:44,579
like an absurdly large endowment over $100 million. I know we talked about this.

704
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:45,329
I'm ok with that.

705
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,290
So

706
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:47,569
it's, it's,

707
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,810
I, I think

708
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,359
that

709
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:49,640
I

710
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,109
think a lot of fed uh,

711
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,280
servers or systems will be sustainable. Either

712
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,589
they'll make enough money to pay for themselves or they'll be somebody just like,

713
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,819
I don't care about wasting 50 or 100 bucks a month.

714
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,329
I mean, maybe, I don't know this podcast. It's a hobby.

715
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,760
You waste money on it.

716
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,290
It's so what some people earn in a month. Waste is a generous description. But,

717
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,359
well, I mean,

718
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:13,170
but the money you spend on this podcast is what some people earn in a month.

719
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:19,329
Uh That could be, that could be. But regardless, I am excited to see what comes next

720
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,689
and I'm

721
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,030
apprehensive for what the destruction will bring with it

722
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,010
because

723
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,069
no,

724
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:32,640
when you, when destruction happens, there are always side effects.

725
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,989
And that is what scares me a little bit.

726
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,510
But I'm also, it will be,

727
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,079
it will be very interesting to see what rises from these ashes.

728
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,630
So

729
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:47,150
time will tell and I learned how to spell wildebeest. So all in all pretty good day.

730
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,030
I'm curious, what would have happened if I'd gotten it wrong?

731
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,839
Would you have laughed?

732
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,829
No, actually, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have because I didn't know either.

733
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,790
And I was hoping you would have gotten it wrong

734
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,589
because I feel like it's a very strange word.

735
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,589
And I was going to use that as part of my anecdote of such a strange word.

736
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,589
But lo and behold, you know how to spell it. You ruined my day.

737
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:06,354
But you also got to remember I speak some German. So that's kind of

738
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:11,185
what is, what is the quote? My disappointment is immeasurable. My day is ruined

739
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:12,484
him.

740
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,305
I like his reviews.

741
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:18,555
At least it's the end of my day. So only a little bit of day is ruined. But anyway.

742
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:20,314
All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you both for listening.
