Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 183 with myself,

1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,369
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,680
-- So, what's new?
-- Well, today, I'm working from home.

3
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,879
-- We work from home every day.
-- Kurt

4
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,610
only for the last 22 years for me.

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,959
Has it been that long for me? I don't, I started working from home in 2004.

6
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,400
-- You're a late adopter.
-- It is 2020 now

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,650
it is 2020. Actually, I keep forgetting that

8
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,080
I know and yet the world still hasn't ended inexplicably

9
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:40,040
to

10
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,450
all the evidence we've seen so far.

11
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,110
Yeah, I know.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,849
Apparently the world's largest work from home experiment is happening

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,290
as we record this.

14
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:53,639
Yeah, you, you sent me that link and I'll of course, put it in the show notes.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,209
There's this fascinating hacker news discussion and Kurt sends me an email

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,439
and I hadn't really thought about this, but

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,639
uh for kind of future reference for anyone listening across the sands of time,

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,949
the Coronavirus outbreak.

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,099
The

20
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:08,440
novel

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,089
Coronavirus.

22
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,089
The what

23
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,830
I believe the official name is the novel Coronavirus.

24
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:13,459
Coronavirus.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,430
-- Oh,
-- is it? I don't know. I don't know anything about viruses.

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,430
Well, computer viruses. I know a little bit, but,

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,330
ok,

28
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:23,440
so we're just going to call it Coronavirus for the rest of the show because

29
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm not going to say novel Coronavirus over

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,910
and over again because that sounds annoying.

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,610
It is what it like, like a month old,

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,879
-- maybe at this point a
-- month and a half to almost two months old it looks like because,

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,989
yeah, some information might have been.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,690
Well,

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,089
we'll say

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,699
widespread panic is about a month old.

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, yeah, we're firmly, we're definitely like on the Gartner hype curve,

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,470
we're definitely at the peak of inflated expectations.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,669
The only difference being is that pandemics sometimes

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,809
it's not like a tech product where it's like, oh, it didn't work, right? And didn't

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,110
succeed.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,610
It's like pandemics have this bad habit of, yeah,

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,589
sometimes wiping out a good chunk of humanity.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,029
Let's hope this one doesn't work. Right.

45
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,720
But anyway,

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,629
because of just kind of everything,

47
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:12,259
an enormous number of people are starting to work from home, especially in China.

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,169
It's not so much that it's the, the, the country is largely being shut down. Like to

49
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,279
put it bluntly,

50
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:22,130
the easiest way to stop a pandemic is social distancing which

51
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,410
you and I are good at because we work from home.

52
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,970
We don't like people. So we already do this naturally.

53
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,029
Right. Exactly.

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,429
You know,

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,130
you and I tend not to go to big meetings of people and big groups and rock concerts and

56
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,169
whatnot.

57
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,210
But that's the reality. Right. You get

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,029
somebody with something like this coughing and sneezing in

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,389
a crowd of a couple of 1000 people and,

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,729
well, like, honestly go watch the movie Contagion.

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,490
It's actually

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,979
-- reasonably well done. I
-- don't know if I've seen that one, I've watched

63
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:51,059
with the disease. Movies were hip. What was that, like, 5, 10 years ago?

64
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,779
And

65
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,259
I watched some of them.

66
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,119
Not all

67
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,369
but. Right.

68
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,119
Right. Right.

69
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:56,979
And I mean, I,

70
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,199
I suffer from this on a regular basis where I will go

71
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,639
to a conference and then I come home with the con flu

72
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:04,380
and

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,990
it blows. And actually one time I legitimately caught the flu on a business trip.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,660
And that was like the worst thing ever. And

75
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:12,649
the,

76
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,750
we knew who patient zero was because like, 10 of us caught the flu.

77
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,029
It was,

78
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,789
it was

79
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,889
an unenjoyable experience. I will say so.

80
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:26,669
Yeah, I mean, basically all major public events have been shut down and

81
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,419
Google has shut down all their offices.

82
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:32,710
Apple has shut down all their offices and stores in China. I mean,

83
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:32,899
a

84
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,660
lot of companies that it apparently got so bad that some

85
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,210
of the major Chinese tech companies were saying not only are

86
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,270
you working from home today but don't use the VPN because

87
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,369
we need to reserve what little bandwidth we have left for the

88
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,929
sad mins to make sure they can get in and keep everything from burning down.

89
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:48,360
I saw that. That's mind

90
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,410
boggling in a lot of ways.

91
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,850
Well, ok, it's a cloud provider by definition like Aws or something or, or

92
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,710
Azure has a ton of bandwidth going into their data centers, but the majority of

93
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,789
corporate on premises networks don't have a lot of bandwidth,

94
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,860
like maybe a gigabit at most.

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,750
Yeah, you're probably right, I suppose.

96
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,910
Which sounds like a lot until you get like 1000 people all trying to use it and

97
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:14,860
video conference at the same time,

98
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,298
right? And

99
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,670
additionally,

100
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,869
most of the people are probably using

101
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,070
some pretty heavy applications, right?

102
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,730
When you're transferring files, you might be doing some citric sort of operation,

103
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,709
you know, remote desktop and whatever

104
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:29,670
and

105
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,769
you're absolutely right.

106
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,279
Where if people are generally doing a lot of this in house,

107
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,059
you can have really fast networks in house

108
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:39,549
and then have we'll say less fast networks to the outside. Right?

109
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,630
Well, and there's a lot of applications that are web delivered and quite heavy,

110
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:44,910
right?

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,540
I mean, the front page of CNN is like what three megabytes now

112
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,779
and you look at a lot of web application delivery platforms and you know,

113
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,899
they have big fat heavy stalking web pages,

114
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,140
which who cares when you're on a local gigabit network.

115
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:58,839
So actually,

116
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,970
I have a funny story I can tell you about that is so obviously I

117
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,690
work at elastic and we have a kind of front end to your data called Cabana

118
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,230
and you can do all this interesting stuff with it and it's

119
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,049
a lot of javascript on the back end and the front end.

120
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,859
And the first time you connect to Cabana,

121
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,130
you download about five megabytes of stuff.

122
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,600
That's just all the javascript you need to basically make it work.

123
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:25,570
And I always chuckle because I will get these people love running those, you know,

124
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,670
blanket security scanners that look for all kinds of stuff.

125
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,290
And like these scanning companies, obviously,

126
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,390
the bigger the scanner report is the better it must be right kids.

127
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,609
And so you'll get these phone book scans and people will say, oh you're, you know,

128
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:38,690
you're using, you're,

129
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,410
you're sending me data that's being stored in my web browser cache.

130
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,690
We're like, yeah, because if you don't,

131
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,089
you got to download five megabytes every freaking time you

132
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,119
click something like you don't want to do that.

133
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,019
-- Like, oh no, my security team said I need it. Well,
-- it's also static data.

134
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,529
-- I mean, it's content delivery. That's how this is supposed to work.
-- That's right.

135
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,880
It literally never changes. And I'm like, fine, you know what?

136
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,899
Great, disable the cash. Go right ahead

137
00:05:59,309 --> 00:05:59,839
like

138
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,040
this is really slow and like, yeah,

139
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,549
we know like you're downloading five megabytes of

140
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,420
crap every time you click a button.

141
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,230
I mean, what did you expect to happen?

142
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,549
And uh

143
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:13,649
yes. So anyway, no, I totally get that and I can,

144
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm sure there are plenty of applications that are in

145
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,869
this exact same situation where the security team was,

146
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,269
like, oh, you can't cash anything because that's insecure.

147
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,790
So, like, hm. Ok.

148
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,799
And when you're on a corporate network,

149
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,040
downloading five megabytes might take half a second.

150
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:28,959
But when you're,

151
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,079
when you're on the internet it might take 10 seconds.

152
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,420
Well, the biggest thing too is when you're on the corporate network, your,

153
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,339
your latency to your on premises stuff is measured in like

154
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:39,160
single digit milliseconds.

155
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,940
But when you're VPN in, from your, like,

156
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,320
internet connection at home,

157
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,640
yeah, it's going to be tens or hundreds of milliseconds. And,

158
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:49,559
you know,

159
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,679
I remember

160
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,010
using an app that had something like 10 or

161
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,260
20 round trips to the database for each page request

162
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,079
again.

163
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,000
Absolutely fine when you're on the corporate network because it's, you know,

164
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,299
like five or 10 milliseconds per round trip.

165
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,119
No big deal.

166
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,160
But when you're some dumb schmuck up in Canada, like me.

167
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,899
And the round trip time is like 300 milliseconds.

168
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:10,640
Right.

169
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,609
You know. Yeah. Not so good.

170
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,410
Right. Right. Exactly.

171
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:14,929
Yeah.

172
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,230
Well,

173
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:19,640
and the other brutal thing is how many of these places do you think have ever done,

174
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,369
like a real world test of this?

175
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,869
Like, you know, Netflix has their chaos, monkey and chaos gorilla and they do their,

176
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,089
like, ok, we're turning, like everything in Amazon East one off.

177
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,690
Let's see what breaks.

178
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,410
You know, most companies don't do that.

179
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,250
Especially like, ok, everybody's gonna work from home today.

180
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:34,549
I,

181
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm actually trying to think of a single place

182
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,709
I've ever heard of doing a drill that way.

183
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,989
And nothing comes to mind

184
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:40,989
-- to my
-- knowledge,

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,260
I've never heard of it and I'm going through things in my brain and it's coming up dry

186
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,850
or an even more extreme. Ok. Everybody's working from home this week.

187
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,230
No, like straight up.

188
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:54,950
Like we're like, we're locking the office doors and none of you get to, like,

189
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,540
let's pretend we found asbestos in the carpets or something.

190
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:58,690
Right. Like the, the off,

191
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,170
you know, there are events that shut down offices,

192
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:07,179
like somebody has a fire or smoke damage or somebody spills something toxic.

193
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,700
Like, I don't know, like, for the sake of argument, like a big thing of, I don't know,

194
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,359
floor cleaner fluid or something, whatever.

195
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:12,769
Right.

196
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,739
So, or there's a gas leak or whatever, you know. And so how

197
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:20,825
places have actually done a real world disaster recovery scenario of like,

198
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:23,774
ok, let's pretend like our head office is gone for a week.

199
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,065
Well,

200
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:26,575
most places probably don't have to because let's

201
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:29,325
face it in the vast majority of situations.

202
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,945
The odds of this happening for more than one day are very

203
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,864
low and you could view it like a snow day where,

204
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,364
like, local places around here and I'm sure you have it too if you get, I mean,

205
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,744
we have to get a lot of snow but it'll happen.

206
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,335
-- Uh,
-- we generally don't we? Yeah, we,

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,559
you're expected to, you know?

208
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,419
Yeah, city plows get out and

209
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,289
-- you go to work
-- right where, where we live. But it does happen

210
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,049
where occasionally

211
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,770
people will say don't come into work because it's a mess.

212
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,349
And actually ice, ice is an easy one where you'll get freezing rain.

213
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:03,580
And we've actually had a lot of that this year because, like, the climate's broken.

214
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,469
-- Yeah. Sorry about that. Kids.
-- We've had a lot of freezing rain with ice.

215
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,940
There's like, there's nothing you can do. And so people just say

216
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,885
you just drive slowly, don't come.

217
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:17,474
Even if you drive Kurt, you have to get to a parking lot that is an ice rink and then get,

218
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:17,744
like,

219
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,655
not crash into anyone parking your car and then get from your car

220
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:24,364
to the office door without getting run over or falling and dying.

221
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,344
I remember one of my favorite memories is a few years ago

222
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:31,494
we had a really good freezing rain slash freeze thaw melt cycle.

223
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,575
And so I went to the, actually, uh, the best buy parking lot because they,

224
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,534
they have a really nice big flat parking lot.

225
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,190
And, uh, I was just doing lovely donuts in it at about five kilometers an hour.

226
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,570
Like, my speedometer wasn't even registering speed

227
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,869
and I was just kind of doing Piro, what's on the parking lot at two in the morning.

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,909
Yeah, that's how you get arrested. Kurt.

229
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:52,280
-- It was actually quite fun
-- because even if you're not blindingly drunk,

230
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,260
they're gonna assume there's something wrong with you

231
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:55,510
and they're pulling you in.

232
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,479
-- So, don't, don't,
-- I wasn't the only person I saw doing it.

233
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,030
-- It, it's just fun to take your car skating once
-- in a while. I won't disagree with you.

234
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,590
But,

235
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,270
yeah, anyway, anyway.

236
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,349
But, yeah, so this is, and, and clearly, you know,

237
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,270
for a lot of these companies and whatnot,

238
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,150
they don't have the technology to support everybody working from home.

239
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,909
They don't have

240
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,349
the business process.

241
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:19,280
And what makes me laugh is all these people are like, oh, but if people work from home,

242
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,909
how do we know they're actually working and it's like,

243
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,109
pretty sure that statement also applies when they're, like,

244
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,849
physically in the office and, like reading Reddit on the computer.

245
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,250
-- Right.
-- Right. Well, so this is,

246
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,969
this is one of the points

247
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,210
I feel like it's always interesting because when you, like, when I go to the office,

248
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:40,710
you might as well just count that as like, vacation days because I get nothing done

249
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,210
because I, I screw around

250
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,750
and

251
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,849
let's hope no one I work with listens to this.

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,679
But,

253
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,419
but right, there's, but when you work from home and you go to the office,

254
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,690
it's like getting nothing done.

255
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,520
And so I can see that as being kind of an opposite action when you

256
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,539
work in an office and now you go to work from home if you're not disciplined

257
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:58,590
and

258
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,190
I mean, I remember from, I,

259
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,479
I luckily I haven't had this problem in a very long

260
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,190
time but there would be instances where people would say,

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,619
oh, I want to be your own employee

262
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,559
and they become a remote employee and then they would just stop being an

263
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,390
employee after a little while because it's like you're not getting anything done.

264
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,390
What's the deal here?

265
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,919
Well, and somebody pointed out quite fairly in this instance it's

266
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,710
-- a little different too because everybody's kids are at home.
-- Oh, that's true.

267
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,750
That's a good point.

268
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,320
Right. Because nobody can go anywhere and, and

269
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,080
I will say

270
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,119
that when my,

271
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,260
it's better now that my kids are a little older because

272
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,559
they just go and play like video games or whatever.

273
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,719
But when they were young and I work from home and they were home,

274
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:42,080
there were times it was a nuisance and it'd be like, I'm shutting my door

275
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,580
and you're gonna leave me alone and then they're like, banging on the door.

276
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,400
Like, what are you doing in there? I'm like, I'm trying to,

277
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,895
I can get paid by doing my job,

278
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,414
like, get out of here.

279
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,015
So, I mean, that's fair.

280
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:52,575
But I,

281
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:56,734
I feel like there are probably places that will treat this

282
00:11:56,744 --> 00:12:01,205
as maybe a disaster scenario from this point forward because I

283
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:03,494
think the odds of making people work from home for long

284
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,974
periods of time is not unrealistic as it's happening now.

285
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,034
But I mean, practically speaking,

286
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:09,664
I,

287
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,419
I

288
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,539
think prior to this, has it,

289
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,390
has anything really happened that would create a situation like this?

290
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,479
Well, SARS,

291
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,179
I don't feel like that one

292
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,109
-- was as bad.
-- Well, they didn't shut down the country.

293
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:28,260
-- I
-- remember we were, we were traveling, we both had a trip. I think we were in London.

294
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,320
We had a work trip in London when we worked together during the SARS epidemic.

295
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,900
I got hired after the London trip.

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,780
You were not in London. Ok.

297
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,500
But I, I remember it,

298
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:38,200
we,

299
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:43,489
I was traveling internationally during this and there was a crazy amount of

300
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,830
documents and signs and everything everywhere you went like it was bananas.

301
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,530
Well, I mean, you know, they're predicting that this is, well,

302
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,510
this has already hit global oil markets, right?

303
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,890
Demand has fallen and the

304
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,780
price of oil has dropped. Like

305
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,479
that's,

306
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,359
yeah, like that's,

307
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,200
wow.

308
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,549
Actually, you know what I realized about that, that got me thinking is

309
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,760
it's been a month and we're already concerned about

310
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,200
oil demand and oil supply

311
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,599
which tells you just how kind of

312
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,989
this is like on demand supply chain, right? Where in a month?

313
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,429
-- Well, everything's on demand now it's efficient,
-- right? That, that's pretty cool.

314
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,349
Well, and, and this is one of the things that kind of freaks me out about modern

315
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,250
disaster preparedness is here's the reality, right?

316
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,150
And UPS even has commercials for this, you know, let Brown be your warehouse.

317
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,580
If you have, let's say $50 million in medical supply,

318
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,700
sitting in a warehouse just in case something bad happens,

319
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,469
that's $50 million of capital sitting there depreciating.

320
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,390
Plus you have to pay for storage and whatnot.

321
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:42,979
Now,

322
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,750
it's great when a hurricane hits and you can just haul

323
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,619
it all out of the warehouse and get going real fast.

324
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,599
But, but most companies

325
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,960
have to be efficient now. And a great example of this is like Power Line repair.

326
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,960
Most companies have cut back on Power Line repair and maintenance.

327
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,039
And so now when there's natural disaster,

328
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:00,849
like there are literally Canadian Power Line crews going

329
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,299
down to the Carolinas and stuff to help after hurricanes

330
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:07,500
because it's part of they have like a mutual assistance set up, which is great.

331
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,659
But you know, this, if you want efficiency,

332
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,780
then you don't have like $10,000 of canned food

333
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,580
in your basement because that is not efficient.

334
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:18,580
I mean, this is an interesting discussion also,

335
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,059
especially in the context of security

336
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,010
because

337
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,489
you can make the argument

338
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:26,969
that investing in your infrastructure isn't necessarily efficient,

339
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,059
-- having a hot disaster recovery site.
-- I mean. Right.

340
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,049
-- Yes, that's a great example
-- until you need it. It's just a waste of money.

341
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:34,450
Right.

342
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,289
It absolutely is. And

343
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,609
when you need it, you need it.

344
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,330
And if you don't have one,

345
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,630
your dr plan might be, get a new job.

346
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:51,309
So this is a tough one, man. I mean, it's always difficult to, to juggle.

347
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,599
What's a good investment?

348
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,229
Well, so this is why, for example,

349
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,190
I've always tried to sort of get dual purpose disaster gear, like

350
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,450
camping gear because occasionally I do go camping or

351
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,309
actually I did buy a bit of extra food that

352
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,630
will last a long time because they had steak

353
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,250
canned chili on sale and craft dinner on sale.

354
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:11,929
And the stuff lasts long enough that I'll eventually eat it regardless

355
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,770
of it being.

356
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,239
But I was looking online at, you know, like Mountain House and whatnot, you know,

357
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,044
the dried food buckets and it's like, man, I'm never gonna eat that, like,

358
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:23,734
as much as I enjoy, you know, like watching Steve, uh MRE info on youtube,

359
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:29,094
I don't really have a great desire to eat 50 kg of, you know, freeze dried vegetables.

360
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:29,354
And

361
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:34,455
what I love is the one place had freeze dried buckets of uh variety meat.

362
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,760
So I'm assuming it's just like whatever random

363
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,080
scraps they can get at whatever cheap price,

364
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,039
you know, be it pork or beef that week?

365
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,869
Is it called variety meat? Is that the name?

366
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:46,989
That's phenomenal?

367
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,909
Oh, my goodness.

368
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,909
-- Yeah,
-- if you Google, yes, it's,

369
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,820
it's the nutri store freeze dried meat variety bucket.

370
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,989
Part of me wants to buy one just to see what the heck is going on in there.

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,880
-- You'd probably just go eat at Taco Bell or something.
-- Here we go.

372
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,830
They're 200 bucks and they're out of stock

373
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,890
probably because everybody

374
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,969
Well, right now, I bet, I bet the prepper people are going crazy.

375
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,880
Not even prepper people but like, just people trying to buy N95 masks.

376
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,159
Yeah, that's probably true.

377
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,479
Oh, my goodness. The mask, the masks are a great one.

378
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:21,890
Especially from a security perspective because

379
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,960
I believe it's the, the, well,

380
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:27,140
I'm sure multiple disease organizations have said this but

381
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:27,510
legitimate

382
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,900
-- ones like the
-- CDC. Right.

383
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,979
I know in the US, the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, I believe it's called

384
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,280
plural.

385
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,770
OK. Whatever.

386
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,760
It's fine. CDC.

387
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,679
The CDC gave advice that basically said washing your

388
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,159
hands is more effective than wearing those masks.

389
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
And I'm not shocked to learn this,

390
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,309
but I feel like this is the ultimate security lesson of is

391
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,440
anyone going to wash their hands more instead of buying masks?

392
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,979
I am but probably no one else.

393
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:03,500
And the reality is wearing a mask has a couple of effects. It's a very active thing.

394
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:06,339
So you can feel like you're doing something, it

395
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:09,130
shows off to other people, you're doing something

396
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:09,939
and

397
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
you're spending money

398
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,689
on a new thing that's going to make you feel better. Like

399
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,318
I have soap, I have a sink. I have hands just

400
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,218
use it all more than you did yesterday.

401
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,818
Well, there is one rather ironic benefit of wearing a mask and,

402
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,708
or glasses or face shield, which is people touch their face less,

403
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:32,218
which really helps when they're not washing their hands enough.

404
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,418
-- And
-- that's true. That probably does.

405
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,270
I'll agree with that because I'm like, I'm notorious,

406
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:39,550
-- basically
-- boils down to it.

407
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,469
You are better off washing your hands like some crazed little raccoon.

408
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,380
Which is

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,579
again,

410
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,250
but again, at the same time, how many, I mean,

411
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,109
we can all say this where we've gone into the bathroom,

412
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,349
we're standing there washing our hands and we see a guy just like, leave

413
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:00,390
the worst is the airports because it's like you're gonna now touch

414
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,160
all the things I'm going to touch to your filthy ape.

415
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,550
Just this is terrible.

416
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,119
I've considered wearing gloves in public, but you know,

417
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,739
especially when you wear latex or nitro gloves, your hands get super sweaty

418
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,130
because by definition you're wearing gloves.

419
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,520
But I,

420
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,800
I actually have been thinking about wearing gloves out in public again because

421
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,050
not because I'm so worried about Coronavirus.

422
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,329
But again, yeah, I literally see people like use a toilet

423
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,810
come out of the toilet and like walk out of the bathroom and it's like, uh,

424
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:27,979
you know, like

425
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:28,510
they,

426
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,189
they pulled the door open and now I have to, you know, I,

427
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,640
I'll do the thing where I like get my sleeve over my hand and you know,

428
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,910
hook it with two fingers with the sleeve over it.

429
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,209
Right.

430
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,969
I,

431
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,770
you know, that's one thing. Shout out to Costco. Their bathrooms don't have doors.

432
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,369
I love that.

433
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,099
Do they not? I haven't been to their bathroom.

434
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,630
They have like a 90 degree bend and you're in the bathroom.

435
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:51,849
I mean, and I'm, I prefer that I don't want to touch a gross door.

436
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,890
It's also faster and you don't get a door in the face.

437
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,729
-- It's like they know what they're doing or something.
-- It's ironic. Right.

438
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,650
Because if you look at bathroom technology,

439
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,160
we've been the steady march of progress of not

440
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,750
having to actually touch stuff in the bathroom.

441
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,589
Right. Like sensors for the urinals and the toilets to flush it automatically.

442
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,770
So you don't have to touch the handle,

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,489
which by

444
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,300
definition you can't have washed your hands yet.

445
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,959
I'm going to complain about this because every time I go,

446
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,280
especially for whatever reason,

447
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,300
airports are the worst offenders of this where you go to use it.

448
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,040
And the stupid thing just flushes like 30

449
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,930
times and it's like shooting water everywhere.

450
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:23,550
It's like this is gross. You're wasting water

451
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:27,689
-- and like, you're just making everything worse for everyone. In
-- most places.

452
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,030
Water is a renewable resource. So you're not really wasting it.

453
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,130
It's, I mean, if you're using groundwater and pulling it from an aqui,

454
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,290
yeah, the, the, the replenishment time on those things is,

455
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,689
well, it's geological

456
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,140
but like for example, where I live, we have a river, we pull water out of the river,

457
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,359
we use it, we treat it, we throw it back in and that's how most places work.

458
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,020
No,

459
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,420
no, they don't. I get my water from Lake Michigan.

460
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,530
I know.

461
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,339
Yeah. And then you treat it and put it back in.

462
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,020
Yes.

463
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,969
But most places don't,

464
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:01,979
the vast majority of places in the United States that I know of have wells.

465
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,380
And you can imagine

466
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,119
they just keep drilling them deeper and deeper and deeper.

467
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,260
I would be curious to see that because I know like in Jakarta, for example, yeah,

468
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,040
it's such a problem that the whole city is sinking.

469
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,079
And Indonesia is actually talking about relocating

470
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,020
-- their capital, which is, that's just bonkers.
-- Right.

471
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,520
Well, in Cape Town is run out of water. They were using wells.

472
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,439
No, they had a rain and dams

473
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,449
and various reservoirs that are dried out.

474
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,079
This thing has water sources but the font is too small to read. That's

475
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,839
well. Ok. I should say, I'm pretty sure most major cities draw water, not from wells,

476
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,319
-- but the smaller towns definitely have are primarily wells.
-- So, yeah.

477
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:44,430
No,

478
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,920
I definitely don't want to be wasting that water

479
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,160
because it takes a long time to replenish.

480
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,369
But

481
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:52,150
I mean, back to this, that there is the reality is that's just a crap

482
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,630
sensor technology that could work, right? And should work. Right.

483
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,349
And I do love that more and more bathrooms.

484
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,390
Like there's less stuff I have to touch in there.

485
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,510
You know, because you do see a lot of people who are not the cleanest,

486
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,069
like they don't wash their hands or they don't wash their hands properly

487
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,290
because like washing your hands correctly is actually a nontrivial task.

488
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,469
Well, it's trivial if you know what to do.

489
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,930
-- Well,
-- but I mean, it's like brushing your teeth.

490
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,469
It actually takes one or two minutes and you have to, you know, get

491
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,709
kind of everything. Right.

492
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,660
You have to wiggle your fingers together and get all that.

493
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,910
Whereas most people kind of rub their hands together and rinse them.

494
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,650
I know.

495
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:22,170
I know.

496
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,719
I'm not, no,

497
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:24,290
I'm not going to go on this rant because I could

498
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,890
rant for a really long time about people washing their hands.

499
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,050
But I won't, I won't.

500
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,989
So we'll, I'll find a youtube video,

501
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,290
put it in the show notes that tells you how to wash your hands.

502
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,739
That is another classic security problem is that the,

503
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,859
the thing that is most effective is

504
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,670
something that takes constant vigilance and effort.

505
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,739
You know, it's like, it's like being a good driver, being a,

506
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:45,935
the driver means you're always paying attention and trying to

507
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:48,094
anticipate what's going to happen as opposed to like,

508
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:51,484
you know, twittering while you're making a left hand turn into a traffic circle.

509
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:56,084
Except we have acknowledged on multiple occasions that the only solution

510
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,464
to better drivers is not to let people do it.

511
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,770
And so for example,

512
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,290
hospitals and some places now are experimenting

513
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,569
with different door handles that have,

514
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:04,890
you know,

515
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,969
um what is it? Oh yeah.

516
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:10,040
Titanium dioxide when light hits it, it creates, I forget what it was,

517
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,849
but it basically kills germs and bacteria.

518
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:12,890
Quite effectively.

519
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,680
Brass also has, you know, properties of being sort of,

520
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,714
what is the word I want germicide or something.

521
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:18,145
Antimicrobial.

522
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:19,035
Antimicrobial.

523
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:20,125
Thank you.

524
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:20,864
But I've seen, you know,

525
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,555
like you can buy Japanese toilet seats that have like a lid that

526
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:26,035
comes down and shines a UV light on the thing to sanitize it.

527
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:27,515
-- I mean, that's pretty
-- cool.

528
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:28,795
And I saw one cool concept.

529
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,954
It was a sort of a clear glass door handle with like a UV light inside of it.

530
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:33,915
Interesting.

531
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:35,035
But then

532
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,030
that only solves the micro problem.

533
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,250
It doesn't solve the fecal matter on your

534
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,469
hands problem because you didn't wash your hands.

535
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,250
Well, it renders it hopefully sterile and safe.

536
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,439
-- Yeah,
-- that's probably fair.

537
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,430
So,

538
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,209
but yeah, I mean,

539
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,109
it's,

540
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,170
well, yeah, washing your hands is a classic, I mean,

541
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,599
and then there's the extreme case, for example,

542
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,930
there was an air Canada flight coming out of China

543
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,729
with no working water on the flight.

544
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,839
So apparently they just put a whole bunch of hand sanitizer

545
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,660
and wipes in the bathroom which they ran out of like,

546
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,530
four hours into the flight or something stupid.

547
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,040
That seems terrible.

548
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,540
-- I'm shocked that was legal.
-- How would it be illegal?

549
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,790
-- What's,
-- there's all kinds of regulations that talk about, like,

550
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,380
like you have to have a working bathroom for the airplane to take

551
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,469
off and I would think that doesn't count as a working bathroom.

552
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,530
Oh,

553
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,869
no, the bathroom worked. It's just, there was no running water.

554
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,469
-- No,
-- no running water is part of having a working bathroom.

555
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,510
Well, I mean, this is from literally yesterday, you know,

556
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,839
an Air Canada flight took off from Beijing to Toronto with no

557
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:34,609
running water on board last week amid the worsening novel Coronavirus outbreak.

558
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:34,949
A

559
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,739
move that has angered the union representing flight attendants.

560
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,010
I love that it's the flight attendants that are grumpy about this.

561
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,500
I mean as they should be. But

562
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,439
anyways it was a 13 hour flight, the washrooms ran out of antiseptic wipes

563
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:49,069
meant to replace the traditional hand washing after about four hours.

564
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,400
Anyways, blah, blah, blah, blah.

565
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,560
But um

566
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:53,469
yeah, I mean

567
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,180
now they're saying that they're not going,

568
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:56,670
oh Air Canada says it will no

569
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,910
longer operate international flights with water issues.

570
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,349
Like

571
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,510
good job guys.

572
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,560
You know what's funny is I remember flying on an Air Canada

573
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:05,310
flight from Toronto to Sao Paulo and onwards to Buenos Aires.

574
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,989
And I noticed like the curtain rod at the back was

575
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,329
broken and I like pointed that out to one of the flights

576
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,689
like then they're like, oh, ok and they like wrote it down.

577
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,060
I'm like, oh, you know, they're going to fix that and he's like, yes,

578
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,270
we have a zero defect policy and I'm like, no, you don't like I noticed a defect.

579
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,630
Well, no, you can have a policy.

580
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,295
You just don't have to enforce it.

581
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:27,454
But I'm like, clearly you don't have a proper zero defect policy because

582
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,305
I'm noticing this broken thing,

583
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:32,074
your cleaning crew should have caught that you'd think.

584
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,364
And it's one of those things that look like it

585
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,645
-- had been broken for a while and
-- that could be,

586
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,354
it wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me.

587
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:42,474
-- God bless
-- airline. Why do we think business would, taking a plane out of services?

588
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:43,675
That's a lot of money.

589
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:46,824
And they have regular maintenance. They're probably, I mean,

590
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:50,395
and, and that's how it's going to work. Right. If they have a zero

591
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,140
defect policy, they aren't going to like,

592
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,829
take a plane out of rotation to fix a curtain rod, they're going to say,

593
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,229
fix it next time you're getting maintenance done,

594
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,349
which I'm sure happens like once a month or once a quarter or whatever.

595
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:03,599
Yeah,

596
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:07,270
I get that. I mean, I would imagine unless the defect is something that ground

597
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:09,439
the plane, it's not getting fixed.

598
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,060
Well, I mean, there's now been what,

599
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,589
two cases of Air Canada flights with the wheels falling off of it,

600
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,439
that's safe.

601
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,380
Well, I mean, in the one case the wheel fell off and, um,

602
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,949
but the good news is that the way that it's like a turbo prop and it's got two,

603
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,030
you know, two main landing gear on each side with two Ws each.

604
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,569
And so it's actually like,

605
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,199
you know, this is why I love engineers because

606
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,030
engineers occasionally ask awkward questions. Like what if a wheel falls off and?

607
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,630
Ok, well, let's put two on each side so one can fall off and we're still ok.

608
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,709
That's wasting money on backup infrastructure.

609
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:42,189
Yeah.

610
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:42,949
Um,

611
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,589
well, plus it makes it easier to change tires and stuff. There's other benefits

612
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:46,939
too.

613
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,640
But, um, regardless and then there was, I think a more recent one.

614
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,800
but, uh,

615
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,699
no, I mean, it's,

616
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:57,680
it's clear that maintenance and disaster preparedness typically costs money.

617
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,079
That is just sort of,

618
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,380
I don't want to say wasted,

619
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,239
but it's wasted unless you need it and you may never need it.

620
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,750
Right. And I mean, that's the ultimate

621
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:11,939
kind of security problem to solve is what is the right amount of investment

622
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:18,239
in terms of your secure? Let's assuming your security investment is a cost.

623
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:21,670
Where do you draw that line? Because obviously you could have no security

624
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:22,339
and then you're,

625
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,640
there's a very high probability you're going to have a problem

626
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,400
that's going to cost you a lot of money to fix.

627
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,949
But if you have too much security,

628
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:31,609
you're basically wasting money because you've made it to the

629
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,270
point where you're spending money on problems that aren't real.

630
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,760
You may not be because for example,

631
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,869
let's say you spend a whole bunch of extra money on physical security

632
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,109
and you never get a break in.

633
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:41,579
Well,

634
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,380
is it because nobody ever tried to break in or is it

635
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,599
literally like people were going to try and break in every day?

636
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,410
Went to your property?

637
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,969
Oh, wow. They have so much physical security, I give up.

638
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm not even going to try and it worked.

639
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,959
One of the biggest problems with security is you don't actually know,

640
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,459
kind of how often it worked or didn't work necessarily.

641
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,780
Although I would bet you in terms of physical security,

642
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,189
I bet the insurance industry has those numbers where they know if you have

643
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,739
like a camera in your lobby,

644
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,900
this is what it means in terms of having physical security issues.

645
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,400
-- Well,
-- the classic, you know, what's the best home security thing? A big loud dog?

646
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:14,680
Right?

647
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:19,160
Because every, like, every time I've read an interview or seen a documentary about,

648
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,640
you know, house break ins and burglary, every single one of them is like, yeah,

649
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,760
I don't want to deal with that dog.

650
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,239
It's loud and it might bite me.

651
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:27,689
My dog would betray me for a hot dog.

652
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,930
And I guarantee he is very loud though, when,

653
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,359
when someone shows up at the house he makes any noise.

654
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,880
And he's actually really funny because he's a really big,

655
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,310
really scary sounding dog.

656
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,780
But, yeah, like for real, if you gave him a hot dog,

657
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,180
you now have a best friend for life guaranteed.

658
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,619
It's, yeah.

659
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,219
Yep. Yep. Which whatever, please don't rob me. Now, people,

660
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:51,619
I don't know, I, I, I'm willing to bet quite a lot of money but this

661
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,479
pandemic, even if it is

662
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,560
quite bad

663
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,109
will have no real appreciable

664
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,920
effect on sort of how we do things long term,

665
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,560
like,

666
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:03,949
will hand washing rates go up probably in the low single

667
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,869
-- digit percentages
-- for a little while it'll go back down.

668
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,920
I mean, this is human nature, I think is we are creatures

669
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,199
of enormous inaction

670
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,400
and you can look at countless things that have happened before in

671
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,329
the past and we have a remarkable skill for ignoring problems.

672
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,819
I mean, SARS happen,

673
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,380
well, especially if they go away for a bit.

674
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,219
Right. Right. Yeah. Like, because SARS happens, do we do anything?

675
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:27,849
No,

676
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,760
-- in
-- fairness.

677
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,680
One thing I have seen is there's more and

678
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,689
more hand sanitizer stations all over the place,

679
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:35,420
like, especially at grocery stores and other stores.

680
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,000
Although, I mean, that's,

681
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,839
that's an example of studies are showing that

682
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,810
overuse of hand sanitizer has a similar kind of

683
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:45,540
effect on the universe as overuse of antibiotics

684
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,699
do where we're basically killing the weak bacteria.

685
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,680
-- So the strong can survive
-- actually worse than that. The overuse of it.

686
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,880
The alcohol dries out your skin cracks and makes you more susceptible to infection.

687
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,359
Of course it does.

688
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,319
And, but again, this comes back to that human problem of,

689
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:00,880
we feel like we're doing something.

690
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,219
So let's keep doing that some more when the reality is actually no,

691
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,060
you're not helping at all by doing that thing even though it makes you feel better.

692
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,859
And, I mean,

693
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:13,795
this is like the eternal challenge for just security people dealing with humans is

694
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:17,015
we are notoriously bad at actually understanding

695
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:21,494
any sort of real risk and knowing what to do about it and I mean, pick on anything.

696
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:24,814
You know, I've, I've done my, that research where you've got, you know,

697
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:27,805
automobile safety, you have airline safety, you have mine safety,

698
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:28,655
you have pollution

699
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:32,984
and like we have literally waited till people were getting killed, left and right,

700
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:35,125
and things were lighting on fire before we cared.

701
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:38,564
And it's because like, it got so bad, we couldn't ignore it. And

702
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,609
in, in this particular case,

703
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,170
the Coronavirus might get so bad

704
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:46,589
that we can't ignore it. And I think it is in some places.

705
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:50,900
Well, it's already been declared a global health emergency slash pandemic.

706
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,150
-- Like it, it looks like it's not going to be like a fizzle.
-- It's,

707
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:57,369
but, but at the same time, like where I live and I don't know about where,

708
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,119
where you're at, but like where I live it has not had a drastic effect on

709
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,900
anyone's behavior yet because we don't have it here yet.

710
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,400
As soon as it shows up.

711
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,920
Well, there's nothing you can really do to be honest.

712
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,839
-- Well,
-- not right now, but as soon as it shows up, man,

713
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,520
I bet you all the canned meat at the grocery store is going to be gone in 15 minutes.

714
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,760
-- Well, on all the gloves and masks.
-- That's right.

715
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,469
That's true.

716
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:18,739
I should,

717
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,780
I should start hoarding masks and then I can sell them for an enormous markup

718
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:26,939
then probably get beaten to death by a can of meat or something. But

719
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,719
anyway,

720
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,189
we should wrap this one up.

721
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:30,380
I

722
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,680
think we've,

723
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,130
we've rattled enough for one episode.

724
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,380
It's, yeah, I don't know.

725
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:40,560
I guess it will be, it'll be interesting to see if any long term changes happen.

726
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,430
But I'm,

727
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:45,079
I, I have faith in humanity's ability to ignore everything.

728
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:46,859
So I don't think, I don't think it will.

729
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,670
This isn't our first rodeo.

730
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:50,359
That's right.

731
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,180
We,

732
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:56,000
we have thousands of years of ignoring problems behind us as prior art. So,

733
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,310
yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, we'll see, I guess,

734
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:00,109
I, I

735
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,979
-- don't know, I don't know what else to say. I guess. Go working from
-- home

736
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,400
and wash your hands

737
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,189
and wash your hands. That's right. You can't wash your hands too much.

738
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,540
Oh, the other thing I, and this is funny,

739
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,510
I've actually been very conscious about not shaking hands and,

740
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,089
and it was not really the Coronavirus.

741
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:17,310
It was more that again, I see people not washing their hands in the bathroom

742
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,829
when I'm at like a conference.

743
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,520
And it's like, so statistically I'm just gonna have to shake hands with somebody who

744
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:23,869
just went to the bathroom.

745
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:25,599
Yeah.

746
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:29,160
So, as we've discussed on previous shows, I'm now offering to do the elbow bump.

747
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,260
Oh, elbow bump. That sounds weird.

748
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:31,829
Well,

749
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,959
it's so even a fist bump can have transmission

750
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:36,109
whereas an elbow bump typically because you're wearing clothing

751
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,670
and you're not touching your elbows much like,

752
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,030
people generally don't touch their elbows.

753
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,095
It's kind of odd when you think about it.

754
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,975
I'm going to make a point to touch my elbows more now.

755
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:42,666
But, um,

756
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:44,706
so that's what health professionals are increasingly

757
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:46,215
doing apparently is the elbow bump?

758
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:46,975
Ok.

759
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:47,885
So,

760
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,566
yeah, so I don't shake hands anymore.

761
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,145
And like I said, it's also, it's just more that like,

762
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:55,336
what my favorite thing is when I see people covering their sneeze, it's like yay.

763
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:58,446
And then I see them covering their knees with their hand and it's like, oh,

764
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,696
now I'm a little sad.

765
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:04,592
Makes it easier to transfer the disease particles everywhere you go.

766
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:09,651
