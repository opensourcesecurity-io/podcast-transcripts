Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 95 with myself,

1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,270
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,020
Josh Bresser

3
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,630
and the world continues to burn.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,649
Right.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,950
Pretty much. Which story should we talk about first?

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,340
-- How
-- about the simple one

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,889
that, that's not helpful?

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,440
Is

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,559
-- it Twitter,
-- Twitter,

10
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,579
Twitter, Twitter.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,709
So, your, your Twitter password is in log file somewhere, apparently.

12
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:31,700
Yes. And I

13
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,189
changed it, which

14
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:36,389
was nice and easy because I use a password manager.

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,389
Right. I, I don't know what it was. I don't know what it is now,

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,790
one of the, one of the interesting things. So I changed it right away. Right.

17
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,490
And then maybe a couple of hours later, the Twitter app on my phone, like,

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,240
basically said, go change your password.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,580
And I thought, oh, that's interesting.

20
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:50,750
They,

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,119
they're not paying attention if you change your

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,650
passwords when they send out this notice.

23
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,299
So they just, like, probably blanketed

24
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:55,959
the world.

25
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:59,669
Um, I, I didn't change my password immediately because it's, well,

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,029
it's a single use password

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,430
and I think I have some of the two of a stuff enabled.

28
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,138
Right.

29
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,400
So, but yeah, I got that big honking notice saying, like,

30
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,360
go change your password and I'm like, ok, whatever.

31
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,790
Yeah. Do it. And of course,

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:12,790
now I'll, I'll give them

33
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,339
11 of the cool things that password notice said was, oh, and while you're at it,

34
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,730
double check the linked

35
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:18,849
applications.

36
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,980
-- Yes, that I appreciated. Yeah,
-- that

37
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:21,529
-- was
-- awesome.

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,220
And I took a look and there were a couple of

39
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,519
things I had listed that I'd forgotten about and weren't,

40
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,519
I wasn't using them anymore, so I took them off.

41
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,180
So, I mean, that was, that was cool.

42
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,529
Yeah, I do a periodic review of my Google account for that because obviously,

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,319
you know, once in a while I'll want to generate a PDF or read a PDF or, you know,

44
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,970
do something like that and it's like this application wants to like,

45
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,879
and I get it that it needs to, like,

46
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:46,779
touch everything on your drive because that's how the security model works.

47
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,940
But it really,

48
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:51,099
so, you know, in that case I'll try typically, what I'll do is I'll,

49
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,599
I'll give it access for like an hour and then take it away

50
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,110
if it's really amazing.

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,919
But in general,

52
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,440
-- I've stopped that because so many of these apps just need way too much
-- access a lot,

53
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:00,739
right?

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,559
We must be able to send emails you

55
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,169
-- to edit a
-- PDF.

56
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,260
My favorite was, yeah, the,

57
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,660
the ones on Twitter that want to be able to send tweets as me or,

58
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,800
or the linkedin ones that,

59
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,788
like just want all the access to my linkedin

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,020
account and to scrape like everybody else's account.

61
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:13,860
It's like, no,

62
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,300
seriously, man.

63
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,229
Although, although I, I found there's a PDF,

64
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,660
uh I use it to highlight PDF S because uh so my, my son is a swimmer

65
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,850
and in the swim meets, there's like hundreds of events

66
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,979
and I don't like to print off like 700 pages of crap to carry around.

67
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,990
So I take the PDF and I highlight his particular events

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
so I can easily just scroll around and find them.

69
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,639
And there's an app on Google, I forget the name of it.

70
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:39,779
That,

71
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:42,750
that does this where I can take the PDF and then highlight it and then it re

72
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,050
saves it and actually the permissions only give it

73
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:48,570
permission to files I open with that app,

74
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,160
which is like, that's awesome.

75
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,020
Like that's totally the way it should work.

76
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,490
But anyway, anyway, so back to Twitter and, and here's, here's my,

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,199
my quick thoughts on this is there are some people, not a lot, actually,

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,270
people are pretty good, but there are some people that are, you know,

79
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,550
complaining about Twitter.

80
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,270
-- Of
-- course, there are, there's people complain about everything.

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,559
That's true. That's true.

82
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,630
But here's the thing,

83
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:08,889
I'm pretty sure Twitter didn't have to tell

84
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,199
us this because this isn't really an incident

85
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,169
depending upon how you define it. But I mean, it was under their control.

86
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,710
They don't believe these have been lost.

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,619
-- And so
-- what's interesting is there,

88
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,199
there may have been an incident and they may not be telling

89
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,350
us or they may not know because one thing I'm curious is,

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,860
do they?

91
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,619
So, for people that don't know exactly what happened or maybe don't use Twitter,

92
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,020
Twitter accidentally logged passwords in clear text to an internal log file.

93
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,009
Ok. That's a bad,

94
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,529
apparently 300 million of them.

95
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,449
So I'm assuming it's like,

96
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,929
yeah, basically everybody, yeah, everybody who used Twitter and like, oh,

97
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,210
the last forever.

98
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,600
Anyways.

99
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,910
Now, my, my concern would be like, what the permissions and access to this log file?

100
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,830
How, how is that constrained?

101
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,639
Now, obviously,

102
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,509
a log file of this size is not just some text file sitting on a file system, I'm,

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,229
I'm guessing.

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,350
So I'm guessing it's in some back end kind of storage thing which may or may

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,679
not have strong access controls and strong logging

106
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,000
plus then replication of that system plus,

107
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:05,309
then,

108
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,800
you know what underlying systems is this thing sitting

109
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,669
on that other people manage plus backups plus,

110
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,570
you know, just empty gazillion

111
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,520
chains of, you know, where this stuff ends up, right?

112
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,829
Because that's just how data is,

113
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:17,858
right?

114
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,890
And it sounds like it was going on for a while because, I mean, if it's everybody,

115
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,529
if it's 300 million affected people, that's, that's a lot of passwords,

116
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,220
you know, that's a lot of activity over, over some time.

117
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,040
Right?

118
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:29,529
And now I'm,

119
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,649
I just pulled up the blog post here and it does say we have no

120
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,320
reason to believe the password information ever left

121
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,559
Twitter systems or was misused by anyone.

122
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,070
So I, that that's a pretty concrete statement.

123
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,079
I think along the lines of this was not,

124
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,709
-- it, it would, it wouldn't qualify as an incident by most standard definitions
-- of an

125
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:49,839
incident, not an external incident.

126
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:55,265
Right? And, and generally speaking, it is all about kind of the external incidents

127
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,454
that people are expected to report on. So I think Twitter doing this,

128
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:03,505
it's a very difficult decision but I applaud them

129
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:06,225
for, for what I would say is doing the right thing

130
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:10,225
and I'm hopeful that many other organizations will follow suit in the future.

131
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,070
Yeah. And, um,

132
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,739
no, II, I am happy that they reported this. It, it,

133
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,799
the problem is I'm paranoid enough to not completely trust them and be like, oh,

134
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,470
they reported this, they must be doing fine,

135
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,850
you know.

136
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:25,970
Um, but I mean,

137
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,089
the good news is now external incidents do tend to

138
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,649
end up in the news pretty quick because they're,

139
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,250
they're quite

140
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:33,119
-- obvious
-- because Brian Krebs posted

141
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,519
all

142
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:33,750
of

143
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:33,899
that.

144
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,049
Yeah, exactly.

145
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,839
My one piece of, uh,

146
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,200
sort of frustration though is that they're

147
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,410
not pushing two factor authentication more.

148
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,790
Right.

149
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,429
And I mean, because really there's, there's two answers to the password problem.

150
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,929
Number one is password managers,

151
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,450
right?

152
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,769
Because the reality is there's so many systems that

153
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,410
will just only ever have passwords and not two fa

154
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,950
and, and also one thing to keep in mind too is

155
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,209
there are some cases where I'm not a big fan of two fa because, you know,

156
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,950
maybe I don't want to have to schlep my phone around

157
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,369
with me all the time or rely on that phone,

158
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,260
you know,

159
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,609
whatever you get a U two F key.

160
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,440
Well, I have those too, but at the same time, you know, what if I lose my key ring

161
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,529
or what if my kid chucks it down a sewer hole?

162
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,049
Like if you've left your, if you've lost your keys in your phone,

163
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,839
like the least of your problems is going to be logging through Twitter.

164
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,690
Yeah. True.

165
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,720
And, and so

166
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,160
I do like tu of

167
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,119
a and I think I wish more places would use it.

168
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,989
But again, you know,

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,679
that so that we have this dual sort of

170
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,880
two pass password managers and two factor authentication.

171
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:33,869
And then the third thing that we've largely ignored is account recovery.

172
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,040
And I would lump password resets under account recovery because that's

173
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:39,980
sort of a form of password or of account recovery.

174
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:43,220
And what worries me is, I've, I've never seen a really,

175
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,010
uh good account recovery with one exception being Instagram, uh,

176
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,320
a friend lost access to her Instagram.

177
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:54,070
And so what they did is they had her, basically, they sent her like a numeric,

178
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,630
uh alphabet code

179
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,339
and she had to write that down on a piece of paper

180
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,149
and take a picture of herself with that piece of paper.

181
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,429
And, because,

182
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,589
well, and, but see, here's the Catch

183
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,959
Instagram is one of the few services where they Instagram

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,140
typically has one or more photos of you.

185
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,649
Right.

186
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,040
Like, I, I don't really have that with, say Twitter.

187
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:18,600
Well, no, there's my profile pic, I guess. But you get, you know what I'm saying?

188
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,609
-- Right. Like that's
-- mine isn't me.

189
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,089
Well, exactly. Yeah. So I'd have to get my kids to re stage that.

190
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,000
And so, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting because that's, that, that,

191
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,179
to me is a very clever way of dealing with that.

192
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,809
You know, it's like for the sake of argument, you know,

193
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,399
90 some percent of our real accounts post pictures

194
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,170
of themselves so we can use that as authentication.

195
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:37,260
Yes,

196
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:37,750
I

197
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,989
-- think that's actually pretty
-- smart.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,869
I'm gonna, I'm gonna end this just because we've been rambling on it.

199
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,609
So, I guess fundamentally Twitter, good job, guys, two thumbs up

200
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,049
everyone else.

201
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,989
Pay attention and, and I guess also as kind of a side note,

202
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:52,899
if you're running an organization that has, will say more than four servers

203
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:57,200
or for services, you have passwords in your logs, go look for them, you'll find it

204
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,589
anyway, we'll keep going.

205
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:01,880
So, speaking of things and logs and things that shouldn't exist.

206
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:01,899
Uh,

207
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,269
I wanted to talk about name spaces today because that's a

208
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,299
thing that we don't really think or talk about enough,

209
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,709
I think.

210
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,320
Uh Yeah, you, you said this earlier and that seemed very

211
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,109
kind of cryptic to me because when you said Name spaces,

212
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,160
the first thing that popped into my head was like kernel name spaces

213
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,119
just because I was so involved with those when they came out.

214
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,420
Well, that would be a kind of a subset of this.

215
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,940
But what I'm talking about broadly is more of the global name spaces.

216
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,160
So, as a simplistic example, DNS is a great one.

217
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,910
I go to Walmart dot

218
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,840
something.

219
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:33,880
Well, what is that?

220
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,159
I don't even know

221
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,880
if it's walmart.com.

222
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,250
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,119
So like if it's, you know, and, and so for example, it's a great example,

224
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,500
there's an expectation that if it's something.com, it's, it's quote unquote legit

225
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,210
ish

226
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,090
probably.

227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,380
But if it ends in like dot And then some wonky, you know,

228
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,630
country in some place I've never heard of.

229
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,809
-- It's like maybe that's not the real Walmart
-- Walmart that totally not hackers.

230
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,520
-- Right.
-- Exactly. Walmart dot uh what is it um

231
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,729
dot Museum?

232
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,479
-- Right.
-- Right. Like, I don't know.

233
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:04,369
So

234
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,349
um other things are name spaces like for example, in Python, when I type

235
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,359
import

236
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:09,630
f

237
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,460
well, where does that come from?

238
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:14,770
Man, you just hit on a can of worms with that one

239
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,450
and see,

240
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,809
and some of them like Python and Ruby Gems have sort of an established name space.

241
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,859
But some others like uh

242
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,940
go is a great example. Go

243
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:26,380
uh went with, instead of relying on a central, like single service,

244
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,059
like say Ruby gems.org or something,

245
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,929
they use DNS as their name space.

246
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:31,539
And then

247
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,989
um essentially a path that is optionally there.

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,239
So like, you know, something something.org/and, then that if that's get

249
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,789
repo, that's the repo where this code lives or it can live down the tree a bit.

250
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,929
Um

251
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:47,429
And so they went with DNS as their global name space.

252
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,309
But then part of the challenge becomes, you know, I,

253
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,659
I know the name of the library is LDA.

254
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, which one is it?

255
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,750
Right? There's a bunch of those,

256
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:56,679
you know,

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,479
so hopefully the person specified the total like the full name space, you know,

258
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,679
and, and I'll be blunt,

259
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,590
chances are I'm going to go with the one on github because

260
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:07,440
that's the one that will show up in Google results first,

261
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:08,049
right?

262
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,090
But so this came up. Uh Well,

263
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:13,030
you mentioned this was the uh the N PM.

264
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,960
Uh somebody made a malicious module.

265
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,640
The Get Cookies.

266
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,320
Yes, this is a fascinating story.

267
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,960
Apparently several other uh packages with similar names, express cookies,

268
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:26,440
http fetch cookies.

269
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:27,940
Uh Oh,

270
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,619
sorry, those are the ones that depended on those.

271
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:31,520
Right.

272
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,210
Right. Right.

273
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,219
So,

274
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:35,099
yeah,

275
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,169
and so this is a great example of sort of,

276
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,880
I guess you could call it name space pollution in a way because so

277
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,380
what happened here is somebody wrote a malicious N PM module called Get Cookies.

278
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,489
Well, awesome. How do you get people to use it?

279
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:50,210
The answer is you don't you get other software to use it

280
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,400
that people do use? Right?

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,219
So essentially the chain was he got get cookies

282
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:59,000
to be used by Express cookies and Express cookies.

283
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,539
In turn was used by http fetch cookies.

284
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,270
And http fetch cookies in turn was used by

285
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,239
a very popular module called mail parser which well,

286
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,010
parses mail

287
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,109
and I'm not 100% certain why

288
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,830
-- needs cookie support.
-- Who knows?

289
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:17,280
My understanding was it? There's a new,

290
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,359
the mail parser that, that ended up being updated to use. This was old.

291
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,659
It was deprecated essentially by something newer.

292
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:26,239
The whole story is, is super weird

293
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,880
in, in the way it reads and it sounds like this could have probably been done better.

294
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,440
But fundamentally, the fact that we kind of got to where we are today is,

295
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,559
I'm, I'm not gonna say

296
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,359
the supply chain is, is bad

297
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,580
in, in the way this stuff works in like N PM and whatnot. It's just,

298
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,479
this is an interesting problem that has it.

299
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,890
It feels like it's happening more and more often

300
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,520
and I have a feeling it's going to continue

301
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,919
to happen more and more often and we don't have a really good answer to it today.

302
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,599
Right.

303
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:57,440
Yeah.

304
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,119
Well, I mean, part of the answer would be, is being able to upgrade your, well,

305
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,090
having rapid response when something like

306
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,250
this does happen because here's the reality

307
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,500
does it,

308
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,450
if it's a back door,

309
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,900
then that's kind of bad because somebody intentionally put it

310
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,440
there and chances are they're going to intentionally use it.

311
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,909
However, if it's just a simple coding mistake,

312
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,669
that results in a security vulnerability.

313
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:23,190
Well, again, now when the bad guys find out they're gonna start using this,

314
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,710
this was totally new

315
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,809
-- coding mistake.
-- Well, yeah. No, this is a back door.

316
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,150
But, um, you know, there's,

317
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,609
there's been coding mistakes that have been

318
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:33,150
equally like remote code execution very easily,

319
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,190
level of terrible.

320
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,630
Um I mean, one, well, the best example of this that's old was, you know,

321
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,609
member shell shock,

322
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,299
right? That code got put into bash in 1995. And then

323
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,130
as it turns out, why is my, you know,

324
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,429
my web server needs to process environmental variables.

325
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,590
So they use ba

326
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:49,609
I,

327
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,390
you know, when I first learned that I was like, what, like what

328
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,969
like literally, I don't understand what's going on. I have to, you know,

329
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,630
I thought somebody made a mistake, explaining it to me.

330
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,109
And

331
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,549
yeah,

332
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,349
so backdoors are definitely a problem because backdoors see

333
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,960
the problem is there's threats and threats are bad

334
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:07,880
but

335
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,200
uh sorry, risks are bad, right? And security vulnerability is a risk.

336
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:14,690
But then there's threats, you know,

337
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,020
where you actually have somebody or something who's going

338
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,770
to have a reason

339
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:20,989
to exploit this

340
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,859
and you know, the the means to do so,

341
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,179
right?

342
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,919
And, and, and by definition, you don't accidentally, well,

343
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,359
I'm gonna say by definition,

344
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,590
typically you don't accidentally put a back door and stuff.

345
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,289
But then there's been those manufacturers that have

346
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,640
just really done boneheaded things or accidentally left,

347
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,239
you know, development code in production systems

348
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,520
and, and they're always gonna do that.

349
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,580
And, and this is actually where when you said we should talk about name spaces,

350
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,929
I kind of got excited because

351
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:51,849
uh a lot of the name spacing we see happening kind of on,

352
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:54,619
on a low level is all about segregating

353
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,179
resources where let's say you have a malicious package

354
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,960
and it is going to start running arbitrary code.

355
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,619
Well, if it only has access to a very limited amount of data

356
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,500
due to, you know, various technologies, obviously,

357
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:10,114
there's like kernel name spacing being one of them. And like

358
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:13,515
in Kernes, you've got your pods and, and whatnot, but you get the point is

359
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:18,354
that's really the future of everything is making sure that once somebody gets in,

360
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:21,304
they can't move laterally because in, in most networks,

361
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:22,984
there's the corporate firewall.

362
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,065
And if you get past that, like it's done,

363
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:25,965
it's

364
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:26,684
done.

365
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:28,065
Yeah.

366
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,585
And, and even tying this back to our earlier discussion, for example,

367
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,424
why can't I set up a folder

368
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,585
in Google Docs that I can then give that app permission to?

369
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,030
And that app thinks it has access to everything.

370
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,289
But in reality, it only has access to a, you know,

371
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:43,190
a very specific subset of what I want to give it access to.

372
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,429
That would be great. You know what I mean?

373
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,309
Um I've looked at, you know, I,

374
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,719
I really wish I could set up sort of these fake roots

375
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,270
and fake environments for these other apps to have access to.

376
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:52,320
Um,

377
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,179
unfortunately, you know, I, I just can't Google doesn't support that,

378
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,760
so I'd have to set up other accounts or something.

379
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,450
Um, but tying back to this is

380
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:03,109
there's a lot of assumptions made around name spaces, like, for example,

381
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,780
a, a lot of name spaces are

382
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:09,380
somewhat curated in that they're not 100% curated,

383
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,090
but, you know, like sort of the important stuff is curated.

384
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,590
There's healthy security teams maybe behind it, there's,

385
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,419
you know, it, it's healthy.

386
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,340
Um But the problem is,

387
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:18,859
you know,

388
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,390
you end up with something like this where maybe mail parser was well

389
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,349
curated and then it kind of depended on H TB fetch cookies which,

390
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,280
you know, you get these chains of dependencies

391
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,270
and eventually you end up somewhere that's probably not the best part of town.

392
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:32,909
Right. Right.

393
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,580
Um And I've seen some pretty crazy dependency chains where

394
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,869
I mean, like my favorite is always, you know,

395
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,789
like R PM dependencies whenever I install some package.

396
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,619
And it's like, why, why are you pulling in like this random,

397
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,679
like library for image parsing?

398
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,229
Like what,

399
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,900
like just why, you know, and it turns out

400
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,090
that something depends on something depends on

401
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,030
something depends on this thing and it has

402
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,070
image parsing as an option,

403
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:56,969
right?

404
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,690
And, and this is a huge problem, especially in,

405
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,750
in places like N PM because once you start pulling in N PM modules, man,

406
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,030
it's turtles all the way down

407
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,419
and things get out of hand.

408
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:10,349
-- Yeah.
-- And I like, I mean, and then the other concern too with these

409
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,909
is not even from a security point of view but that that whole like

410
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,900
left shift situation where somebody removes a package and breaks half the world.

411
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,450
Yes, like straight up. Right.

412
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,580
So, you know, even at this point,

413
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,489
we don't even have to worry about like militia security actors, just somebody

414
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,119
delete something or decides to kill a project. And,

415
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,080
and then the problem becomes, what are the rules around the name, space ownership,

416
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,030
right.

417
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,169
You know, can I go take o can I basically, for example,

418
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,700
could I create a company with a name of

419
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,809
a popular module and then bully that name space manager

420
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,739
into giving me that name space? And the answer is, well, that's happened.

421
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,169
You're right. Right. It, it can totally be done.

422
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,880
And that's,

423
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:58,609
that is less concerning to me because that's a very public and open process.

424
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,409
What we saw here with get cookies.

425
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,460
This was clearly meant to be malicious in secret.

426
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,800
And, and I think that's the difference, right?

427
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,348
Is there is openly malicious in some cases, which is generally easy to see

428
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,010
and, and I actually I, I say openly malicious,

429
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,699
but it's generally just like stupidity that that is the result of much of that.

430
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,439
But then there's like the sneaky stuff

431
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,439
and the sneaky stuff is what's really concerning

432
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,358
and you must get cookies thing, man.

433
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:25,219
It is super sneaky and the things these people did, like

434
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:29,400
they knew, like these are pretty smart folks that put this all together.

435
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,199
Like, like I've, I've been looking at some of the files for this and

436
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,810
there is

437
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,949
to my knowledge this was not on github anywhere, there was a user account on github.

438
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:44,420
But, but the actual Get cookies source wasn't there. It has a change log

439
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,660
that goes back to 2015.

440
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,420
So I don't know if they like found something

441
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,739
called Get cookies or they found something that they,

442
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,260
they took and, and changed.

443
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,180
But like that was really fascinating to me. So it's essentially a forged change

444
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,209
and let's face it. If I was looking at a project, I would,

445
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,969
I would look at the change like, oh, this has been around for a couple of years.

446
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,550
That's legit.

447
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,290
No, sure hasn't. It's been around since March, you know.

448
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,969
Yeah. No, I've taken a look on Google for this and, and even the, the user name is very,

449
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,959
I got three pages of Google results.

450
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,650
This is,

451
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,439
this is pretty clearly

452
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,369
a beautiful setup

453
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,329
and, and I guess at the same time

454
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,160
they made enough of mistakes

455
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,229
that they got caught,

456
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,420
but it would not surprise me if there

457
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,020
are smarter people that aren't making mistakes.

458
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,550
Right?

459
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:31,569
And

460
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,000
one of the,

461
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,040
one of the beautiful things too is if you look at the timeline published by, you know,

462
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,709
in the N PM Js guys,

463
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:41,739
well, people, sorry, uh you know, the initial report

464
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,819
to unpublished it

465
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,280
two hours, three minutes.

466
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,619
That's pretty solid, right? So,

467
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,199
and, and now we don't know, you know, the

468
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,819
how many people

469
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,989
uh we're affected by this, right?

470
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,890
-- Because they
-- kind of do it says up earlier that the mail parser

471
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,329
received 64,000 weekly downloads and it sounds like it was there for a while

472
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,609
where, where this was an

473
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,609
like a month or more.

474
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,650
Yeah,

475
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,089
but

476
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:12,369
we don't know is that some developers workstation doing

477
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,089
builds or is that like a production system?

478
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:14,449
Right?

479
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,560
That's what I mean by we don't know how many people are affected because that's

480
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,089
measuring this is like I've literally seen case. Well,

481
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:23,359
there are some major companies, for example that they, they download these things,

482
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,530
put them into an internal repository and then use them,

483
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,410
you know, things like that.

484
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:28,709
Yeah.

485
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:32,050
No, I mean, this also speaks though to the to the health of the community, right?

486
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,150
Like two hours and they

487
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,069
dealt with it.

488
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,050
-- I I really can't ask for much more than that,
-- right?

489
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,290
And, and the the thing I keep thinking about here is

490
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,619
as much as people want to rail on open source sometimes

491
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,040
and, and it's funny because I, I see more attacks as of late than I did for a long time,

492
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,619
which is

493
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:51,689
whatever.

494
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,180
But, but here's

495
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,300
-- where
-- the money is now.

496
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:54,920
Let's

497
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,939
face it. Right. Like, no, no, no. Think about it. Like let me put it this way.

498
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,140
Is there any major

499
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,660
cloud service built? Not using open source?

500
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,689
No.

501
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,369
Look, man, even the people I see

502
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,729
talking about how open source is insecure.

503
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,800
Like you go to their website and you go to

504
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,160
the like included library section and it's full of stuff

505
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,500
and it's like you guys are just a bunch of

506
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,050
annoying hypocrites that don't want to compete on level terms.

507
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,130
Like that's what this is.

508
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,349
But anyway,

509
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,609
yeah, I challenge anybody at this point to write

510
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:26,609
-- anything nontrivial in house like a web server or, or like, you
-- know, don't do that,

511
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,599
please please don't roll your own

512
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,410
crypto. It's easy, right?

513
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,829
Says

514
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,189
anyway,

515
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,209
-- that was, that was a joke, by the way.
-- Yes, please don't,

516
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,199
don't write your own crypto unless,

517
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,180
unless your last name is Rivers Shamir, you know, like somebody like sneer

518
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,599
-- or somebody like that
-- dude,

519
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,400
-- I wouldn't trust any of those people to write crypto anymore because
-- they,

520
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,160
-- they would be smart enough to say no,
-- that's true too.

521
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,510
Anyway, anyway,

522
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,969
here's the thing I keep thinking about

523
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,930
is

524
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,540
there are

525
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,869
hostile insiders

526
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,839
at any large organization.

527
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,430
This is, this is a known fact just statistically speaking,

528
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:09,290
if your organization has more than probably 10,000 people.

529
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,250
You certainly have one or more hostile insiders,

530
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:15,869
meaning there are certainly closed sourced applications

531
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,150
that have purposeful backdoors.

532
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:20,420
Well, there,

533
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,550
there's, there's like, search the CV database. There's a ton of these

534
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,900
and, and some are quasi

535
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,369
like, oh DEV code slipped out. Whoops. A dod.

536
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,250
But like some of them are pretty clearly malicious

537
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,880
but, and, and malicious from, and in some cases it's worse. It's not even an insider.

538
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,589
It's clearly not an insider threat.

539
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:39,989
It was pretty clearly

540
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,750
that the actual maker,

541
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:46,719
-- like, this was a sanctioned back door.
-- But here's, my point

542
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,920
is

543
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,119
the open source community took

544
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,579
a little over a month to figure this out.

545
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,160
Right.

546
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,920
Well, it's more that it's like a lot of things, you know,

547
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,160
a lot of things people don't notice, like, we, like,

548
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,880
literally driving around the city and, you know, my partner is like,

549
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,530
when the heck did that thing building get there.

550
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,199
And I'm like, uh, that's been there for, like, ever.

551
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,719
Like, I've never noticed it and I'm like,

552
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,729
and then I check Google street view because now I'm getting paranoid.

553
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:14,109
I'm like, yeah. No, it's been there for at least 10 years. Right.

554
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,410
It's, it's actually legitimately a weird looking building and I'm like,

555
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,339
how have you not noticed that?

556
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:19,349
Right. I've done that.

557
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:20,550
And so

558
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,790
part of it is, you know, we don't,

559
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:26,510
people, people generally,

560
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,109
if they see a little bit of weirdness they generally ignore it

561
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,560
if it's not immediately dangerous to them. Right.

562
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,930
That's how we're wired because if we reacted to

563
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,189
every single thing that was potentially weird and dangerous

564
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,290
dude, I wouldn't be able to get out of my chair.

565
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,989
Right. Like, seriously.

566
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,089
And so that's just part of the human psyche. Right?

567
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,939
Is we, we have some really great filters for danger.

568
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,459
Like, think about when you're driving.

569
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,709
How many potentially dangerous things are there?

570
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,670
Well, by definition, every single other car

571
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,390
and you just sort of tune them out.

572
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,849
If they're not swerve

573
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,550
-- around,
-- you're getting a little more philosophical than I hoped.

574
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:58,729
But

575
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:03,479
fundamentally, it's, it's from the time what I've noticed in the open source world,

576
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:07,469
at least from the time of somebody actually spotting the weirdness and raising it

577
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:10,770
to it being dealt with is, is getting increasingly short.

578
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,770
They're, they're moving very quickly.

579
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,689
And that, that's one of the things I've been thinking about now is so

580
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,939
if you look at the source code and I, I found the source code to get cookies and I'll,

581
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:21,770
I'll maybe throw some up on the show notes,

582
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,209
but I don't see how I can do any harm. I mean, I

583
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,410
don't like

584
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,219
no one's gonna use it

585
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,760
anyway anyway,

586
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,199
that

587
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,689
no one's gonna use it, please don't use it anyway. Anyway.

588
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,250
So the point is though that if you look at this,

589
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:36,890
it's really weird what it's doing

590
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,780
and

591
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,890
a normal person would look at it and be like, oh,

592
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,880
that's just some weird cookie processing.

593
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,839
No big deal there.

594
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,250
But it's the sort of thing that makes me think

595
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:48,219
normal applications don't look like this.

596
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,540
And so I bet you could take, uh, what, what's that? What's that thing? Uh Truffle Hog.

597
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,180
That, that looks for entropy in your, your G repo?

598
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,890
I bet you could use something like that

599
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,130
to look for

600
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,890
SATED code like this.

601
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,890
So, anyway, something I was thinking about for this weekend is to take Truffle hog

602
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,959
and to look at this particular source code,

603
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,579
which appears to be high entropy to me as a human and,

604
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:14,579
and see how it compares to other things because I have a suspicion

605
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,660
that

606
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,060
when someone builds a backdoor,

607
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:23,510
the code is going to be weird in ways that normal code isn't because

608
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,290
obviously the goal of a backdoor is so a human doesn't see it,

609
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,579
right? But we can build machines to see this stuff. And so

610
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,209
it's, it's just my, my brain has kind of been racing about this just because like,

611
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,380
I feel like we have a huge opportunity here to build some

612
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,359
tools to help make this not be a problem in the future.

613
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:40,939
Yeah.

614
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:41,300
Well,

615
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,839
what I've noticed about code in general is code that is cleanly and simply written

616
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,579
tends to be more understandable and thus

617
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,619
more maintainable and less prone to errors.

618
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,140
Yes,

619
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,939
the the probably the biggest problem I would say is

620
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,689
where people start fiddling with code logic and not the,

621
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,739
not the syntax or the form of the code

622
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,530
but sort of the actual flow of the law

623
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,505
itself.

624
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:02,844
Yeah, because that code can look completely correct.

625
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,854
And then the logic is like you actually chart it out and it's kind of like what?

626
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:07,025
Oh man, you know what I'm gonna,

627
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:10,385
I'm gonna yell at Python for lambda functions here because man,

628
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:12,074
some of those lambda functions people write.

629
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:16,344
It's like you're either a crazy person or you, you just guessed until this worked.

630
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:17,824
Like I don't know which it is.

631
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:22,204
It's, it's but, and, and I agree with you and I feel like

632
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,859
the, the way the universe is heading and this is funny enough.

633
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:27,329
I don't know why I remember this but I was thinking

634
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,250
about this while I was brushing my teeth this morning.

635
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,849
Is that if I created a language today,

636
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,410
I would make these syntax super simple, like to a point of being hilariously simple

637
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:40,270
and make the ability to plug things together

638
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,239
like one of the fundamental features because let's face it.

639
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,020
Like what, what didn't the last XK CD talk about that?

640
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,660
My new job is just gluing things together and I've known

641
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,239
you can name them work like that's totally what's happening.

642
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,569
Now.

643
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:57,079
I, I'd even go one step further. I would, I would forcibly make every single um

644
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:00,479
thing wrapped in a little web container and everything would be a rest api

645
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:02,520
like at the function level.

646
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,829
Exactly.

647
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,390
Hyper,

648
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,790
what's smaller than micro

649
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,910
nano

650
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:09,239
nano

651
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
services? There you go. Nano

652
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:14,880
services. You heard it here first we better we should copy our data

653
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,189
or trademark that, I mean,

654
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,229
but uh you know, because clearly the future is gluing stuff together

655
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:24,449
because it's just, well as open source shows, it's faster to glue something

656
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,869
than to recreate it and then glue it in.

657
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,119
Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,609
Well, in all seriousness,

659
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,189
I think gluing things together has been pretty hip for a while.

660
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,150
It's just, it's becoming an art form whereas before it was

661
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,209
like, it was external libraries

662
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,349
and that was, that was more work, right?

663
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,880
And then they randomly changed.

664
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,569
That's,

665
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,810
that's what the versioning was for, right?

666
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:48,119
Which totally always checked out.

667
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:48,920
Yeah.

668
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:50,170
Yeah. So,

669
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,280
no, I think this is a, like you said,

670
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,270
we're seeing more of these attacks but we're

671
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,010
also seeing better response to these attacks.

672
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,949
And so fundamentally, I'm ok with that.

673
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,670
I, yes, I, I don't think there's a way around it.

674
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,390
I think this is just part of the, the evolution of,

675
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,209
of open source and security and development in general and,

676
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,359
and there's gonna be some,

677
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,560
some weirdness that happens and I think we're gonna

678
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,869
see more backdoors and we're going to see more attacks

679
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,369
and, and here's the thing, right? Is

680
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,040
as much as I would love to say, oh, well,

681
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,760
we just have to design our processes to deal with this or we have

682
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,750
to design our tools to deal with this or we have to do.

683
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,709
Here's the thing,

684
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:31,099
you're never going to design something an attacker can't circumvent.

685
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:36,400
So the, the absolute best way to deal with this is to move fast, which M PM guys can do

686
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,859
and then make sure whatever happened doesn't happen ever again. Right. I mean,

687
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,420
make it hard definition

688
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,099
or yes, that's fair. Make it, make it hard enough.

689
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:49,260
They go, they go to Ruby Gems or somewhere else. Right? Like that's,

690
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:50,459
that's the plan.

691
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,189
It's, it's like the old saying. Right.

692
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,589
I don't need to, I don't need to be able to run faster than a bear.

693
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,180
I just have to run faster than you.

694
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,449
No.

695
00:27:58,859 --> 00:27:59,599
Right.

696
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,310
And, and this is one of those things that,

697
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,079
that I think about constantly is the fact that we love to talk about.

698
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,239
We're, we're building our defenses and we're,

699
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,109
we're doing all these mitigations and all this stuff.

700
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,170
But if you look at

701
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,439
like the really good security technologies

702
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,189
and even processes that, that exist,

703
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,520
they exist because they basically reacted to things from the past.

704
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:23,609
I don't know of any of them that were, were forward looking and said,

705
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,079
we're going to stop these things from happening in the future because again,

706
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:27,780
well,

707
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,390
and I guess it's twofold because let's say you do

708
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,829
build a technology that stops something in the future.

709
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,050
That's great. Now, they're just not gonna do that.

710
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,920
They're gonna attack something else. Right.

711
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,390
It's, it's just, it's the,

712
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,670
the cat and mouse game that never ends and that's what we're stuck in it.

713
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:40,989
It's

714
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:41,540
our, yeah,

715
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,459
where everyone's on their hamster wheels and no one's going anywhere

716
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:49,030
anyway anyway. All right, man. Any, any last parting thoughts before we go,

717
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,390
uh, just, you know, be aware of what software you're actually using,

718
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,989
maybe take a look at it once in a while.

719
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,150
Look for weirdness and, and

720
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:59,780
-- more importantly, if you see weirdness, tell somebody don't just
-- ignore it.

721
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,930
-- If you see something, say something. Right.
-- Exactly. Like file an issue on github

722
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,300
or wherever it lives

723
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,949
anyway.

724
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,140
Alright, sweet. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks everyone for listening.
