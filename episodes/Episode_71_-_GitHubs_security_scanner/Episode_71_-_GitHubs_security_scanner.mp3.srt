Hello and welcome to episode 71 of the open source security podcast

1
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,350
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,789
I am so excited. Kurt.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,909
We actually have some good news to talk about, like for the first time ever. Maybe.

4
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:20,760
Yeah.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,290
Well, probably it,

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,329
it's not the first time ever but,

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,649
but we, we do tend to talk about bad things and, and we'll get to some more bad things.

8
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,579
But no, no, I'm excited about the github

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,780
security scanner.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:32,360
Yeah.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,029
-- No, that's actually really exciting. It's
-- super awesome.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,220
So, would you like to explain it or shall I?

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,380
Uh Well? Ok. Um I can.

14
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,000
So as you know, github hosts a lot of code,

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,299
like a lot, a lot, a little

16
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:45,619
bit

17
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,680
and more to the point.

18
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,400
Github

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,849
encourages people to uh fork code,

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,709
right? Uh You can basically take a project, fork it

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,009
and then monkey around with the code on sort of your own side

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,529
for your own need.

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,930
Uh And if you want, you can also, you know,

24
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,959
uh do a poll request or merge it back into the upstream one

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,529
and make code better for everybody.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,690
Um

27
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,690
And a lot of modern

28
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,790
languages and code uh especially things like go no Js, you know, those guys

29
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,230
really have a heavy model of

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,440
uh libraries that you

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,250
import and use

32
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,750
um quite often for like really, really core stuff.

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,069
And so like a lot of these projects kind of really end up

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,019
basically being just a bit of glue with a whole pile of imports,

35
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:35,459
which is

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,110
we should clarify that when we say import,

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,470
we mean basically copy the code into your own project.

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,459
Yeah.

39
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,540
Yeah, sorry, like a literal,

40
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,309
like not an import space something but an actual like cut and paste or copy of the

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,629
the the raw source files in.

42
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,419
And so the problem becomes then is if you have a

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,260
flaw on a piece of code that is widely copied,

44
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,730
forked, imported, whatever,

45
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:00,970
how do you tell everybody?

46
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,410
And the answer is traditionally we don't,

47
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,889
-- it's a simple solution.
-- It is and, and you're absolutely correct,

48
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:10,508
right?

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,679
I mean,

50
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,380
because part of the problem was until recently

51
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,509
figuring out where did that code go is,

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,729
is really quite difficult, right?

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,600
Because a great example is like um

54
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,000
Gzip, right? Very nice little compression utility

55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,169
not available by default on windows.

56
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,520
So a lot of UNIX programs that use J Zip has ship a copy of it

57
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:31,740
with their source code so that the copy like the code will build on Windows.

58
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,009
So the problem becomes when there was like that Fla

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,399
gzip that resulted in a denial service, whatever, you know. How do you mean Z

60
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:38,899
Lib?

61
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,199
Uh,

62
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,550
no, some of them just actually tossed in the whole G

63
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,860
and that's fair.

64
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,869
Yeah, you, you would hope that they, I think a lot of them,

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,229
these people actually don't even know Zed Lib exists,

66
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,639
right? They just think of G zip the command line and they're like, cool. Grab that.

67
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,600
Right.

68
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,779
Um Anyway, so, yeah, long story short, they either grab

69
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,490
Gzip or

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:58,669
Zed

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,570
Lib or whatever,

72
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,809
jammed it into their source code so that, you know,

73
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,509
now you can have your VPN decompress and compressed data or whatever, you know,

74
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,050
data,

75
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,690
you can make data smaller easily.

76
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,169
And um you know, it's quietly forgotten about and how do you detect this?

77
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:13,820
Well, you know,

78
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,410
do you Google search for strings in the code and like try and parse all of Google?

79
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,229
Do you download everybody's source code? And

80
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:27,710
uh there's a um there's a text searching stuff, uh Google, text search shingling.

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,029
And the idea is that you, you kind of create shingles,

82
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,580
like you take chunks of the code and kind of hash them or

83
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,710
otherwise analyze them and then compare it to other shingles and see how

84
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,559
similar they are, you know.

85
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,830
Um it's, it's basically just,

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,690
it's a borderline impossible problem because of

87
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,369
not so much the complexity but the scale

88
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,940
and this is where github

89
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,639
comes in is that when you use github and fork something, for example,

90
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,029
github knows exactly what happened, right.

91
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,639
They have a log,

92
00:03:55,649 --> 00:04:01,279
like Kurt went to CV project slash CV list and created a fork of it into slash,

93
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,000
you know, Kurt Siegfried slash CV list.

94
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,229
Right? So that is now a fork of the,

95
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,729
uh master, you know, the, the miter one.

96
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,419
And so

97
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:11,520
github

98
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,570
knows kind of where all the code went.

99
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:15,449
So there's,

100
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,630
yeah, so if there's like a flaw in something popular like,

101
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:22,108
uh, no GS library, for example,

102
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:25,378
they then know kind of where that stuff went.

103
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,519
Um And they can also search, you know, their g

104
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,229
relatively easily for it, right? There's, you know,

105
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,989
using shingling or just even straight up good old timey grip, whatever.

106
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,669
Um You can kind of find where it all went. Now that's kind of useful except

107
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:42,769
github actually went and did something actionable, actionable about it

108
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,899
in that quite simply

109
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:45,950
they warn people,

110
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:47,940
which is a huge step forward. It,

111
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,149
it's amazing to me and I've already experienced

112
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,269
the power behind this.

113
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,859
And so I'll tell my story is

114
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,679
there's a library called Math dot Js, which is part of the whole node ecosystem.

115
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,540
And at work we're looking to use it. And actually, I've got kind of 22 fun

116
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,470
to, to talk about here.

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,309
So first of all, uh someone shows up and says, hey, we want to use this library.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,070
What do you think of it?

119
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,410
And so the first thing I did was I go to

120
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,329
the, the Miter CV E database and I search for math dot Js. Nothing.

121
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,630
I'm like, it can't be that bad. Sure. Let's use it. Right.

122
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,679
And then of course, someone else says, uh,

123
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,619
I search for security in the change log and there's a whole bunch of stuff.

124
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,739
Maybe we shouldn't use this.

125
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,859
And I said, all right. Uh, number one, I didn't look there but good job. Right.

126
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,589
Because that's something I didn't even think of, like, in my brain.

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,450
I figure if it's not in the whatever, no CV ES it's probably ok.

128
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,220
And I should have known that, that, that's actually bad.

129
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:47,220
But, yeah, like these guys are actually fixing security issues.

130
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,070
So I said the fact that they have security flaws in their chainsaw, that's really,

131
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,790
really good.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,059
Right. That's,

133
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,019
-- that's
-- not bad

134
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:55,380
stuff. Yes.

135
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,779
Correct. Exactly.

136
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,790
And so,

137
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,959
and, and again, I should have known when there were no CV I DS.

138
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,619
Nobody has no CV I DS right

139
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:03,619
there.

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,950
It hasn't been covered yet.

141
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:06,529
That's fixed now.

142
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,390
But then, so I emailed these guys and I said, basically, hey,

143
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,019
uh, can I work with you to assign CV I DS for your security issues? Right.

144
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:17,440
And they said, well, we don't know what CBE is, but ok, that sounds fun.

145
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,420
Right.

146
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:22,529
And of course, my usual, like, how does someone know what CBE is kicks in?

147
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,079
Which is fair?

148
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,209
And then what's funny is shortly after that, they emailed me back and said, hey,

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,410
Github

150
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,390
just told me, I've got a bunch of CV ES in my dependencies.

151
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,839
Like, what is this stuff?

152
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,130
And I'm thinking this is amazing, like these are people that,

153
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,440
that at the beginning of the week didn't know what CV ES even were

154
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,230
and now they're not only getting them, but they like,

155
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,160
have a very acute interest due to these github

156
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,119
warnings. So

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,570
the vision I have here is that

158
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:50,239
github

159
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,420
is going to raise the awareness on CBE in a way none of us could have

160
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,390
on our own

161
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,359
over 9000.

162
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,880
Well, and this kind of slides into

163
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,239
the next topic.

164
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,609
So there's a lot of people like Linda tools

165
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,679
who essentially look at security bugs and say,

166
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,269
why are security bugs so magically special, right?

167
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,420
They're just bugs, fix them, be, you know,

168
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,079
deal with it. Yo,

169
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,399
security is not some magical special property.

170
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,320
It's, you know, it's about correctness, right?

171
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,440
If the system is correct and we designed it correctly

172
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:25,519
and it behaves as expected, assuming we didn't, you know,

173
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,799
design some system that's designed to let somebody in or

174
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,200
designed to allow somebody to do something they shouldn't do.

175
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,369
Um, you know, it'll be fine and,

176
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,660
and this kind of feeds that in that, I think that

177
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,339
one of the problems is, you know,

178
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,899
security bugs do have a slightly special property in that.

179
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,429
Uh, some of them can really result in very, very bad things.

180
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:49,619
Right?

181
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,350
A great example being right now,

182
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,359
you can now search the CV database and, and plug in the term medical device or airbag

183
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,179
and there are CV S for those now.

184
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,429
And that's a little scary. Right.

185
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,329
Because, you know, like worst case scenario,

186
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,480
my laptop does something terrible or a piece

187
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,230
of software on my laptop does something terrible.

188
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,470
It's not going to kill me.

189
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:09,320
Right.

190
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,869
Might bankrupt me by cleaning up my bank account, but it's not going to kill me.

191
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,799
Whereas, you know, um,

192
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,450
a remotely exploitable security flaw in like the system

193
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,579
that controls the air bags in my car,

194
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,700
that's bad

195
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:25,459
that, you know, that can kill me literally. Right?

196
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,299
And so

197
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,660
I think at a minimum,

198
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,470
we need to understand how bad the security problem is,

199
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,570
right? Like

200
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,130
how, how bad is it really? And part of, and that's a big part of where CV comes in is,

201
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:41,599
um, CV is about, you know, telling people, hey, here's a security flaw.

202
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,679
You maybe need to pay extra special attention to it.

203
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,119
But something we often forget is that,

204
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,679
you know, we also need to get some data going so that we know, like

205
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,679
is

206
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,059
software package a actually objectively better than software package.

207
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,359
B for security properties.

208
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,559
Which library should? I

209
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,479
-- like?
-- 10 topics

210
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,369
that you've been on

211
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,080
here? Let's, let's start here.

212
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,500
II I, you've got me thinking about this to a degree is so

213
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,719
you say security bugs are sort of special, sort of maybe, right?

214
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,869
-- Some of them are sort of special.
-- So, so let's think about it in this way.

215
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,919
Let's pretend

216
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,409
that, that security bugs are just bugs.

217
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,159
Are there,

218
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:20,010
are there bugs

219
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,210
that

220
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,450
could kill a person? But not get a CV ID?

221
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,460
Uh, there are, and have been the Thor

222
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,650
Radiation machine

223
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,340
that had that, um, oh, it's not a, a security flaw because it's not really trigger,

224
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,409
but it was like

225
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:34,570
a programming error.

226
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,780
So, instead of using a hardware safety cut off for the radiation dosages,

227
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,289
they decided to do it in software

228
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,010
and there was a flaw which, well, you know,

229
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,510
it would get a CV because it was user triggered now that I think about it.

230
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,969
Um, but for example,

231
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,599
um, a software flaw that prevents the airbag from working at all,

232
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,190
right, the thing is just completely defective

233
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:59,869
and those sort of things happen where like randomly an airbag will fail

234
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,150
and, and it may not be trigger, but they would also trigger

235
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,669
-- a recall.
-- I suspect it could be just a simple manufacturing defect.

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,150
So, so this is, this is where my brain sits now is

237
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,890
let's say we call security bugs just bugs.

238
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,359
Then we're going to say that some

239
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,049
bugs deserve a thing called a CV E ID.

240
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:28,080
I think one aspect that does make them slightly special

241
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:32,030
is that they can be intentionally triggered

242
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,450
in

243
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,409
and then they can result in some

244
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,640
uh

245
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,159
negative thing like additional access or deleting people's data.

246
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,000
And so it gives people

247
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:50,849
control over a system that's simply put, they should not have. Right.

248
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,150
I'm always reminded. So I've been running Linux for

249
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,440
going on 2324 years now.

250
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,119
And I remember running like Slackware 1.0 or 1.1

251
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,150
with like uh the Linux kernel 0.99 patch level.

252
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,989
And it was like, it just went up to some ridiculous number. I remember

253
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,469
and I remember one of those patches

254
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,820
fixed my network driver

255
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:12,840
and, oh my God,

256
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:16,940
it was glorious because I went from heavy network utilization would cause

257
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,020
the system to just lock up weirdly after 10 to 15 minutes,

258
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,159
pretty much guaranteed

259
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,280
to. It actually ran for like a day or two before crashing.

260
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,809
And it was fantastic because now I could use NFS.

261
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,349
Right. NFS was previously unusable

262
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:32,299
in that.

263
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,979
Well, I could use it and every 15 minutes I'd have to reboot my system, which,

264
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:36,340
you know,

265
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,190
it's a workstation, so

266
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,700
bearable but not great.

267
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,169
And so, you know, should something like that get a CV.

268
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,659
Well, it's not user, like it's not

269
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:46,419
trigger,

270
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,070
it's, you know, an attacker doesn't really cause it, it's just,

271
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:49,760
it's a,

272
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,979
it's a product of the system because there's like a defect in kind

273
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,849
of how the software is talking to the hardware or whatever it was,

274
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:56,809
you know, I forget.

275
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,599
And, you know, and, but like I said, though, once it was fixed, holy cow,

276
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,419
this was so much more usable

277
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,630
And so, for example, if, if somebody introduced a flaw in the Linux kernel,

278
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,419
it caused it to reboot every five minutes like clockwork,

279
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,830
that wouldn't necessarily get a CV. Because it's not,

280
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,039
you know, it, it can't be triggered by an attacker.

281
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,869
It's just a, a defect in the system,

282
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,349
you know.

283
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,169
Yes. And

284
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,210
I agree with this,

285
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,169
but it, it, it's one of these things that I keep rolling around in my brain

286
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:29,929
and

287
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,570
ask the question.

288
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,619
So, so let's say we do say that there are certain bugs are special for some reason.

289
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,090
Then we're back at the point of, well,

290
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,070
they're not just bugs,

291
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,679
right? They are special.

292
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:49,820
And the second aspect though is most software bugs propagate relatively easily.

293
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,539
Like, for example,

294
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,020
if you have a network driver that poops out after

295
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,960
say 10 or 15 minutes due to whatever reason,

296
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:57,840
like a counter hits the end or, you know, something, whatever,

297
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,979
it's going to propagate itself quite reliably like it's gonna be in your face.

298
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,140
And the thing is a lot of security bugs are not really in your face.

299
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,900
They, they quietly sit there

300
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:13,440
and it's not until somebody takes some specific action to exploit them,

301
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,000
but they then become a problem.

302
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,169
Right? Because let's face it.

303
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:19,659
If you have a flaw that causes your system to reboot every five minutes

304
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,580
you're going to notice and take action.

305
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,140
But there are, there are different levels.

306
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,369
Well, yeah, agreed. But

307
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:29,140
that, I think that's one of the other aspects of a lot of security bugs is that they,

308
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,640
they don't trigger

309
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,000
typically until an attacker specifically triggers them.

310
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:35,659
Ah,

311
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,520
yes, I think, I think you might be on to something now is right, because there's,

312
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,190
there's accidental bugs and then there's attacker oriented bugs. Right.

313
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,349
Yeah.

314
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,280
Um,

315
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:49,919
you know,

316
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,530
and so, like, and like I said,

317
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,539
the one aspect of security flaws is that security flaws tend

318
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,989
to not really be up in your face as much.

319
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,530
Um, for example, a great example is like a buffer overflow nine times out of 10,

320
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:02,369
if you don't exploit it right.

321
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,450
-- The, the process or whatever, just crashes
-- or keeps running sometimes.

322
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,330
Yeah, that too.

323
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,969
But every once in a while

324
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,359
the person triggering the flaw remotely now has control of that thing.

325
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,809
Ok. So I, I think we're in agreement here and,

326
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:22,849
and in, in Linus's email, that is the root of this discussion.

327
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,539
He says security bugs are just bugs but I think,

328
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,099
-- but
-- he's also not wrong. I think,

329
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,489
I think that particular argument is wrong

330
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:32,770
because

331
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,750
because security bugs

332
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,570
are well, yes, they are bugs, they are bugs that have

333
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,809
serious

334
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,570
results from them being exercised, right?

335
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:47,270
And they, they, they, but they have to be maliciously exercised for those results.

336
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
I think part of it simply is

337
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,880
is that

338
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,239
people live in different

339
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,780
kind of versions of reality with different cultures. And

340
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,400
you know,

341
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:02,479
where Linus lives with kernel development versus where a bank

342
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:06,349
lives with having to make sure customers are protected versus

343
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,630
an IOT device maker who is literally going to make an IOT device that

344
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,960
will be installed in a well casing at the bottom of the ocean,

345
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:14,250
right?

346
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,000
They live in very different worlds, right?

347
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,640
-- Linus can literally say run current
-- or or they're making a light bulb for $1.

348
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,239
Yeah.

349
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,979
And that's part of the problem is I think to some degree,

350
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,599
Linus is not wrong. He is actually completely correct in the context of his world.

351
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,359
But then for example, you go and talk to a bank and a bank is like,

352
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,880
we can't just run current on our system because it's, it's for sure,

353
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,679
something bad will happen every other week and we're gonna get, it's fine,

354
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,270
it's fine.

355
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,989
They just, they put everything in the Blockchain and it'll be fine, right?

356
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,539
It will happen. That's all you have to do.

357
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
And so I think that's part of the problem is we need to

358
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,770
uh in a way it's a form of empathy in that. I, I look at security from say Lin's

359
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,750
point of view and you know, also like the open ssh and open BS D guys

360
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,090
who have this culture of a bug is a bug fix it, make the system correct,

361
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,130
run current. And

362
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,390
I agree with them, but the problem is run current doesn't work for everybody.

363
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,390
That's not even the core of this argument though, from Linus either,

364
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,150
I think it comes down to the fact that a lot of the security

365
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:25,140
is, is first of all, it, it ends up being very fundamentally low level, right?

366
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,539
Where we like the hardening issue in question from case cook

367
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,429
is

368
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,090
super low level.

369
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,400
And anytime you change something kind of in the bowels of the kernel,

370
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:39,460
you run the risk of, of literally breaking everything.

371
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,640
And in this particular patch,

372
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,940
it sounds like was designed to literally break

373
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,010
things because when it detected a problem,

374
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,979
it just, you know, murdered the process instead of

375
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,330
letting it maybe continue on. And, and

376
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:58,039
I would argue killing the process that is acting incorrectly is OK.

377
00:16:58,049 --> 00:16:59,729
But Linus disagrees.

378
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,260
-- And now at the
-- same time, it depends how you define incorrectly, right?

379
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,289
A

380
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,239
buffer overflow, right? Let's say, let's say a buffer overflow gets triggered.

381
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:08,319
And in

382
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,290
this case,

383
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,239
the colonel would kill it instead of letting it

384
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,949
basically kill itself eventually by doing something insane.

385
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,510
Right?

386
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:16,598
And

387
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:22,628
I would side with case on this one in saying something bad has happened,

388
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:26,338
if there is a buffer overflow and you should almost certainly kill what's going on.

389
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,239
And, and Linus disagrees. Now, at the same time, this is also Linus's project.

390
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,579
So he's allowed to disagree and have his own opinion here. Right.

391
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,699
Well, I would say part of it is it kind of,

392
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:40,680
I I suspect part of it goes back to Linus's argument of we don't break user space

393
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,790
and, and I think that is a good argument and I also suspect that's

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,869
part of the reason that Colonel has been so successful

395
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,099
right now.

396
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:54,660
Now we take this idea about not breaking things and what

397
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,219
is a security bug or what isn't a security bug?

398
00:17:57,229 --> 00:18:00,979
And how do we, how do we fix these low level things? And then we think about

399
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:01,630
github

400
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,219
and the things they're doing now where they're going to start pointing

401
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:07,949
out a lot of this stuff and they're going to point out problems

402
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,579
and now we, we end up in a weird place,

403
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,739
interrupt you for a moment because I think that's

404
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,760
also an important part of security bugs is that

405
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,579
pointing out problems.

406
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,420
For example,

407
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,900
any piece of software you import is going to have a change log with a ton of changes.

408
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:24,530
And

409
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,579
fundamentally again,

410
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,560
a lot of them you're probably not going to care about.

411
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,020
And then essentially typically kind of one of three things will happen.

412
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,420
Either one, the library will do something like they'll,

413
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,410
they'll add something to the library like a feature that is so awesome.

414
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,380
You will definitely want to upgrade it because it's just so much more cool. Right.

415
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,939
So that's easy. Right.

416
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,079
Number two,

417
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,819
the library has a problem that manifests itself

418
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,260
enough and is problematic enough that you're like,

419
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,189
I need to deal with that and go fix it.

420
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,180
Right. Like it crashes every five minutes.

421
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,439
But then number three,

422
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,719
the security problem there's a security problem in the library.

423
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,719
You as the person importing it and using it aren't

424
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,119
going to notice typically until an attacker triggers it.

425
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,829
Right. And that's the problem

426
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,069
and that's why I think we sort of need,

427
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,760
I'm not going to say so much special treatment of security bugs,

428
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,479
but special notification of security bugs.

429
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,089
And that's a

430
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,949
big part where CV, and what github

431
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,109
is doing come in and

432
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,640
-- makes it so much better. I
-- think, I think that's an amazing argument right there.

433
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,359
I, I love that because you're absolutely right

434
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,089
because

435
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,979
-- of those three things. Why would you upgrade the library? Yes,
-- I, I agree.

436
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,489
And this ties back exactly to what I was trying to bring. This is github

437
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,260
is going to start telling people why or,

438
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,780
or rather if they have security problems in their,

439
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,420
in their library, well, in their product, I guess, or project because it's,

440
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,260
it's using someone else's code

441
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,819
and you're right,

442
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,380
this, I like this because really now the

443
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,540
github alert

444
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,060
is the same thing is having a, a latent bug or crash or whatever from a,

445
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,030
another miss feature

446
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,119
that you might be looking for

447
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,500
a fix for when you, when you upgrade your dependencies. So,

448
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,459
so I guess ironically

449
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,310
now we're kind of back to the argument about their, they're just bugs.

450
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,189
It's just, it just so happens that

451
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,920
it's, it's a bug you probably need to care about. Just not in the same way.

452
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,199
You care about a crash.

453
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,760
And I think part of the problem is the visibility of security flaws tends to

454
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,530
be lower than like other crasher bugs or a bug where half the screen is purple

455
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,150
because, you know, the people running the code,

456
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,780
are they going to notice a security flaw,

457
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,989
by definition, they're not going to notice a security flaw

458
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,020
at a minimum until it is exploited.

459
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,609
And even then if it is exploited, they may not notice.

460
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:45,329
-- I bet the Equifax people would disagree with you.
-- Yeah.

461
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,890
Well, and that, but, well, no, because they,

462
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,930
apparently somebody was in their systems for a few weeks or months.

463
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,089
That's true. Right.

464
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,030
And that's the thing, right?

465
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,869
If you have a user interface where half of it is an annoying shade of purple,

466
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,930
nobody's going to miss that flaw.

467
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,810
Like that's going to be in your face,

468
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:02,489
you know?

469
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,810
But like I said, like by definition,

470
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,310
a security flaw doesn't propagate until somebody exploits it.

471
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,069
And even when somebody exploits it,

472
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,829
there's a good chance you're not going to notice

473
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,109
because how many of these massive data breaches,

474
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,030
massive companies that spend massively on security spending.

475
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,170
It turns out the attacker was in there for weeks

476
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,800
or months or in some cases years before they noticed

477
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:24,130
it. It's very

478
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:24,569
common

479
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,920
and that's why I think,

480
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,709
like I said,

481
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,270
I'm not so sure that security flaws need special handling

482
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,010
from a fixing point of view in so much as,

483
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,170
like any security flaw needs or any severe bug needs to be dealt with

484
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,760
sooner rather than later. But I think they need,

485
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,170
you know,

486
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,489
that better notification because just otherwise people won't notice this stuff.

487
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,420
You know,

488
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,849
a great example is this weekend or last week

489
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:49,760
rather I upgraded from Fedora 26 to Fedora 27

490
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:53,920
and I ran into a relatively simple bug in that the updater wouldn't go

491
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:55,530
because I had X

492
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,170
Chat installed. Right. Good old time IRC client

493
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,420
because X

494
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,459
chat is no longer present in Fedora 27.

495
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:04,050
So somebody filed a bug saying, you know, blah, blah, blah, the update breaks.

496
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,030
And it's like, well, yeah, it does.

497
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,530
And the solution is you remove X chat and you install hex

498
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,359
chat.

499
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,540
That's it like, and they use the same config files. It's actually not too bad.

500
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,589
There's no way you're going to miss this flaw because everybody who

501
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,000
tries to upgrade Fedora is going to run into this flaw.

502
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,010
And, you know, it's going to be really obvious. Right.

503
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,400
But a security flaw on the other hand,

504
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,739
uh, you know,

505
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,369
I just upgraded my kernel and it fixed a bunch of security flaws that there's

506
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,660
the only way I would notice those is if somebody exploited them

507
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,780
and then hijacked my machine and then I noticed it and then I

508
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,030
somehow forensically determined that they exploited CV EF

509
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,739
in the kernel, which

510
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,670
even as a security guy that would be very hard for

511
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,310
me to do and for a normal person basically impulsive,

512
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,160
it is impossible.

513
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,589
It's not basically impossible.

514
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:48,109
Yeah.

515
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,589
And so I think that's why at a minimum

516
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,989
security bugs need better

517
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,670
-- sort of tracking and notification.
-- No. II, I like this though.

518
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,260
I think,

519
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,770
I think you're totally on to something and this is absolutely the right

520
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,469
argument is when you have other kinds of bugs you see them.

521
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:04,910
Yeah.

522
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,630
Like a cross site scripting flaw isn't typically going

523
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,079
to accidentally propagate until somebody does crazily say,

524
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,589
like, hey, I wanted to call that system,

525
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:12,339
you know,

526
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,229
javascript, take blah, blah, blah, which

527
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,430
typically is not going to come up as an issue,

528
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:18,670
right?

529
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,680
You know, or how many times has stuff broken because they're like, oh, I,

530
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:23,410
I stuck this weird character in,

531
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean, it's happening more now because people want to use unicode.

532
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,540
And for example, I was,

533
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,400
I was playing with some websites and I was like,

534
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,319
I wonder if I can put unicode in my user name?

535
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,579
I mean, can I make my user name a smiley face? Because that would be kind of awesome.

536
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:36,790
I,

537
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,089
yes. And it turns out at some sites you can and at some sites you can't.

538
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,209
And at some sites I'm pretty sure something went horribly wrong in the back end and,

539
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:45,469
and you need to use the unicode snowman.

540
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,869
Snowman is where it's at, Kurt.

541
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,569
Yeah.

542
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,119
You know.

543
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,260
Yes,

544
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,500
I, I love doing that. In

545
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,239
fact, I think

546
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,199
anyway.

547
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:01,150
And, and part of it too is with respect to special handling of security flaws.

548
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:01,680
We,

549
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,599
we can't even really have that discussion until

550
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,709
we actually know about the security flaws.

551
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:09,530
Right. We can't have a discussion. Do security flaws need special handling?

552
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,189
Because for example, for all we know the Linux kernel

553
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,239
has 90% coverage of all their flaws with CVS or

554
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:20,729
more likely in my opinion, has a much lower coverage of all their flaws by CVS

555
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:25,680
and they are accidentally or otherwise intentionally fixing security flaws

556
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,910
and not getting them CV S because either

557
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,859
they don't even realize it's a security flaw,

558
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,020
right?

559
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,920
They just fix some correctness behavior that

560
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,969
may or may not be exploitable,

561
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:37,439
you know, because there's a lot of stuff where it turns out that code change, hey,

562
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,479
totally improve the reliability of the system

563
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,910
in a way that could be triggered by an attacker. And oftentimes it

564
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,880
improves it in a way that like straight up the attacker has no influence over that.

565
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,369
It's just

566
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,949
how things are, you know, and like I said, we can't

567
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,430
really have these discussions until we have an idea of the scope of the problem.

568
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,560
And so, for example, for the sake of argument, you know,

569
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,069
maybe the Linux kernel has CV S for all the really bad stuff that we need to care about.

570
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,099
Great or maybe it doesn't,

571
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,140
you know, if we assign all this stuff CV S,

572
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,770
then we can have a data set we can look at and we can say, hey,

573
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:09,209
maybe this subsystem maintainer is terrible

574
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,699
or maybe these, you know,

575
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,869
every time you add a new driver it takes a while to shake down.

576
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:18,390
Right? Or maybe every time you add, I, I, the reality is we don't know.

577
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,930
Yes, I, I agree with that. And this is

578
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,650
where I'm super excited for the work github

579
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:24,849
is doing because

580
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,219
I have a suspicion

581
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,180
that as awareness goes up,

582
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,219
the number of security issues is going to increase exponentially,

583
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,729
which I guess it'll be really funny too because we

584
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,760
had how many CV ES came out last year?

585
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,329
It was more than

586
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,180
10-K, right? 12 or 13

587
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:45,380
or 13,000. And, and I'm sure that will be broken this year, but

588
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,020
it already has

589
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,170
it

590
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:47,599
already.

591
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:50,260
We're up into 15 or 16 already and

592
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,959
not all of them are assigned mind you.

593
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:52,369
So like, you know,

594
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,979
Microsoft has a block that they're going through an oracle and whatever,

595
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:55,819
right?

596
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:56,239
But

597
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,670
we are on track for more.

598
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,380
This is one of those things I just think about is

599
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:01,449
so

600
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,449
the dream has always been, let's give every security issue A CV E ID,

601
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:08,359
but it's also going to be a nightmare because how

602
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,520
are you going to deal with that volume of stuff?

603
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:14,589
Well, uh this is, for example, part of why I pushed a

604
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,979
JSON format for CV,

605
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:20,449
that includes an affected section where you define the vendors and the products.

606
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,930
So that, for example, you can say I only care about Xy and

607
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,569
Z and I can ignore the rest of it.

608
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,500
Right. And, and that's the reality, right? Like

609
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,579
for example, um I,

610
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,750
at one point tried to figure out how many skate

611
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,069
of vendors are there globally that write their own software.

612
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,069
-- And the answer is at least 1000.
-- You'll never know though.

613
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,410
-- You can't answer that question.
-- Exactly.

614
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,199
Well, so anyways my point, I'm just trying to get some scale numbers here,

615
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,500
usually within an order of magnitude, right?

616
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,609
That would be good enough for my back of the envelope. And so

617
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,619
I figured out there's at least 1000 skate of vendors writing software

618
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,569
and some of them are huge like Siemens and Schneider and those guys

619
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,030
and some of them are like literally 10 man shops. Like um I remember a

620
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,520
friend of mine worked for a company that literally started out as two guys got to 500

621
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,520
then was sold to I think like Honeywell or something, you know,

622
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,260
and it was a customer acquisition essentially, right?

623
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,640
They didn't care about their technology or software because all

624
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,319
skater software is basically the same at this point,

625
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,420
you know, you got a web gooey with a bunch of stuff. Anyway,

626
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,829
point being

627
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,510
like five of these skater vendors are CNAs and do CV S.

628
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,329
So like on the skate upfront alone,

629
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:31,530
we have thousands of companies making like like software that matters,

630
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,489
this is stuff, running power grids and

631
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,859
all that stuff.

632
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,030
And then, you know, you go to look at medical devices again,

633
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,319
there's at least several 100 vendors probably between 1000 and 10,000 globally,

634
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,819
that kind of matter, you know, they have more than one customer.

635
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,099
And so I was trying to basically get like essentially how many entities on the

636
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,229
planet are building software that we kind of care about the security flaws in.

637
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,780
And the answer is

638
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:59,479
if I had to guess I'd say between 100,000 and a million

639
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:04,500
and I don't mean just like companies but also like a great example curl, right?

640
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,420
That, you know,

641
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,500
Daniel from Sweden wrote a really useful piece of software as it turns out

642
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:10,849
and it's now embedded,

643
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:13,930
I think in all the UNIX operating systems like Apple

644
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,670
now man.

645
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,089
Is it?

646
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:16,540
Yeah,

647
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:17,430
exactly.

648
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,469
So, you know,

649
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,089
and he's a great guy for security because he, you know, fixes all security flaws,

650
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,770
he gets CV S, he patches them quickly, he sends out pre notifications like it's

651
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,119
the guy on, you know, he's doing a great job.

652
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:29,550
And so

653
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,910
my back of the envelope estimation says we need at least 1 to 10 million

654
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,400
CV S per year for stuff we care about and by stuff we care about,

655
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,400
I mean, kind of stuff that more than 10 or 20 people in the world

656
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,260
-- to
-- 10 million is a completely ridiculous spread

657
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,569
like it's an order of magnitude,

658
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,489
you know,

659
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,130
but it is a completely ridiculous spread. But at least

660
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:56,680
it's, I'm beginning to get some approximation of how big is the,

661
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,290
-- it
-- is in the millions. And I, I agree with that and, and that's,

662
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,000
and remember folks that's per year, that's not the overall number that's per year.

663
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,479
Right.

664
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,560
-- And,
-- and so anyway, the, the place this conversation will end,

665
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:13,250
which I'll get it there quicker is

666
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,319
people can't pay attention to this stuff because people don't scale. We need

667
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,589
automation.

668
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,280
And this is where I think things like what github

669
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:25,319
is up to is a huge first step.

670
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,689
It is going to be enormous long term, I suspect

671
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,069
because of we raise awareness, which is going to raise a number of CE I DS,

672
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,540
which is going to raise the amount of work,

673
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,020
which means we're going to have to automate because we don't have a choice.

674
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,569
Right.

675
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,060
It totally reminds me of, of how we used to deal with attacks.

676
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,729
We used to deal with attacks by having a human,

677
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,410
read the log file and chase everything down.

678
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,530
-- You know,
-- man, I remember,

679
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,339
I remember knowing people whose job was to read I DS log files

680
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,540
and, and,

681
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:54,890
ah,

682
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,479
I

683
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,339
just, I can't

684
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:59,609
ban them. That is a job.

685
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,319
I mean,

686
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:04,170
and anyone who did that, I, I apologize if I'm picking on you, but it just,

687
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,380
it sounds terrible and it's totally automat.

688
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:08,900
Right.

689
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:12,619
Yeah. And, and I mean, that's what's going to happen with.

690
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,729
This is part of it is we're beginning to understand the scale

691
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,650
of security flaws

692
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,739
and the fact that, yeah, Attackers do use these to do bad things.

693
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,310
It's, it's gonna get ugly before it gets better.

694
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,380
But, you know, the same was true of online attacks. And now, quite frankly,

695
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,709
you know, being online is normal, being attacked a million times a day is normal.

696
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,469
It's just, it's like the spam problem, right?

697
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:37,390
Remember when spam was unmanaged and I remember my inbox just

698
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,130
literally didn't work because I had so much spam in it.

699
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,280
And now honestly, it's a non issue. I got one or two spams.

700
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,859
No, that's because you use Gmail, which I do too.

701
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:50,459
And the reason I use it is because I used to run my own mail server

702
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:54,140
and I dealt with the spam and one day I threw my hands up and said,

703
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,900
II I give up like you win spammers,

704
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,790
which I guess, ironically by, by them winning,

705
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,040
I switched to Gmail and then the spam went away.

706
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,810
So,

707
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,290
and that's part of it is,

708
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,300
you know, we're going to figure out what parts of this can and need to be automated.

709
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:14,810
Uh The notification is definitely a good step because again, you know,

710
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:18,310
um how can we have people fixing this stuff if they don't even know it exists?

711
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,729
Right. Right. Exactly. Now, now let me ask you this

712
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:22,750
is,

713
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:27,079
do you what do you think this is going to do to some of the existing, like,

714
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,920
security scanning type

715
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,810
companies and products?

716
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:35,650
Well, ideally they should move up the food chain just as like firewall vendors did.

717
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,540
Right? Like no offense.

718
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,680
But looking at firewall products,

719
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:41,530
I remember when like non state full firewalls cost real money by real money.

720
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,369
I'm talking like five or six figures.

721
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,310
And now that stuff, well, that stuff isn't even built into anything because it's so

722
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:49,869
terrible.

723
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,229
You know, you have to at a minimum,

724
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:54,069
have a state for firewall that understands protocols to some degree.

725
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:56,959
And that is built in by default into everything

726
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:59,140
because everything runs Linux or BS D or,

727
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,060
well, uh, uh,

728
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,020
what you might call it, uh Minix as it turns out,

729
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,949
you know? Right.

730
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,609
And, and that's just a given. It's like having a TCP/IP stack that's reliable.

731
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:09,869
Right. It's just, that's,

732
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,410
that's how the world works.

733
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,430
Could you imagine an operating system without a firewall or a TCP/IP stack today?

734
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,270
Like you'd be laughed out of the room.

735
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

736
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,910
Well, remember the, the, the,

737
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,869
the Blackberry playbook that came without an email client

738
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,040
and when I heard that I was like,

739
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,089
yeah,

740
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,560
this thing is doomed because how do you get a device

741
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,239
out the door without an email client after the year 2000?

742
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,359
-- Uh, no,
-- you know, you know, that's actually a fine example.

743
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,619
And that, that's probably a discussion for another day. But like

744
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,790
that is a company that doesn't know who they're building the product for.

745
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:41,479
Right.

746
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,780
I mean, it will not only that, like,

747
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,920
that's even more confusing because Blackberry basically they,

748
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,560
they, they existed

749
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:51,680
because they gave people mobile email. Like that was the only thing it did.

750
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,489
Yeah.

751
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,910
But uh back to this. So, so essentially um

752
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,839
what's going to happen is like every other technology is

753
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,130
the simple stuff gets so ST

754
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,479
so simple. It's just baked in by default, right?

755
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:07,030
Like secure web servers, I spent 500 bucks buying one.

756
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,859
Now they're in my bathroom scale,

757
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:10,930
right? Maybe if you

758
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,489
ssl certificates used to cost real money. Now there's lots and crypt and cloud flare

759
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,469
and it's basically free.

760
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,579
And so that's what's going to happen with these companies.

761
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:22,680
They are going to either have to move up the food chain or perish.

762
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,479
But here's, I guess, yes.

763
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:29,619
And that's my initial thinking of this is you need to find a way to add new value.

764
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,939
But I feel like github

765
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,810
is,

766
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,869
they're coming in really early here.

767
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,500
I feel like because this is like security scanning

768
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,390
has really only been a thing that isn't it. And it still kind of sucks.

769
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,130
But, you know, it's only been a couple of years.

770
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,739
It's not like this is 10 years,

771
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,689
although maybe that's just the way the industry is going to move now is,

772
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:48,760
is a couple of years, the

773
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:52,449
beginning of the S curve for scanning. Like because there are people.

774
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:55,719
It is, it is actually reasonably widely used, you know,

775
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,510
a lot of stuff like license compliance,

776
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,969
make sure you don't ship something you shouldn't,

777
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,760
um, making sure you're not shipping stuff with like known CV S, make sure you,

778
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,410
you know, a whole bunch of other reasons.

779
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,199
And I feel it's kind of like antivirus right now.

780
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:08,120
You know, we're at that, like,

781
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,719
people examine the malware and handwrite a signature for it

782
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,949
and you know, plug it into the database and that's cool. But

783
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,600
you know, that kind of stuff is going to get heavily automated.

784
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,438
So for example, you know, the discovering of security flaws,

785
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,639
people are working on automation of that and

786
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:26,089
working on the automation for remediation for fixing it

787
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:28,009
on that.

788
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:31,958
This was at black hat, they've got a Blockchain based machine,

789
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:36,029
artificial learning intelligence that, that can scan the mal

790
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:36,648
before

791
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:37,108
I

792
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:37,928
downloaded.

793
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:39,518
Like, right,

794
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:41,208
actually,

795
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,378
that was one of my favorite things is like if

796
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:46,989
you ask a legitimate question to many of those vendors,

797
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,849
they don't know what to say.

798
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:50,329
And so,

799
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:54,039
you know, and, and part of it too is what is actually useful

800
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,398
because for example, for a lot of projects,

801
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:58,729
they don't really need source code scanning because they're like just

802
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:01,198
whatever we ship whatever is the most recent stuff this week.

803
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,969
You know,

804
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:07,330
like if you update your software every 24 hours to whatever the most recent stuff is,

805
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,770
I don't think most people know that, I think in

806
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:10,969
the

807
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:11,689
great

808
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,850
idea, but it's,

809
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:14,239
but

810
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,050
what I'm trying to say is there's different use cases and

811
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:17,800
no, no,

812
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,699
no, we need to talk about this actually because this, this,

813
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,949
this was a point that came up with the math dot

814
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,649
Js guy when I was talking to him because he said,

815
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:26,409
well, why don't,

816
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:30,209
why don't you guys just update to the latest instead of worrying about

817
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,229
a version that might have a security flaw?

818
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,260
And

819
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,659
so from my perspective, there's kind of two sides to this and,

820
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,570
and I think that the conversation is bigger, but

821
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,929
there is kind of older versions you have to support for a length of time.

822
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:48,270
And, and this is like the, the Linux kernel has the, what do they call it?

823
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,530
Do they call it LTs

824
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,610
the

825
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:51,850
stable, stable?

826
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,709
Like the Linux kernel basically has two versions.

827
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,209
There's the new version that they're working on today

828
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,929
and then there's another version they keep alive for like a year or two, right?

829
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,290
And

830
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,040
I think it's even simpler in the people.

831
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,239
Forget for end users, there is a real cost to update churn.

832
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:15,110
Yes, there is a real cost update even ignoring. And this ignores the fact

833
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:18,800
-- that sometimes the updates will break stuff.
-- Well, in that, that's right.

834
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,629
That's the second part of this is

835
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,379
even if you want to follow like like master or

836
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,669
whatever you want to call it for just like super DEV

837
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:30,280
ops let's pull things in every hour and rebuild and test and all this.

838
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,699
Uh, someday

839
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,560
the API or something will break and you won't be able to

840
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,629
pull in the new version until you patch and patching takes time.

841
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,459
Right.

842
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,540
And it might take five minutes, it might take five days, it might take five months.

843
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,379
It depends what's happening.

844
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,219
And so I think

845
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:47,860
in, in a perfect world,

846
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,729
everyone upgrading quickly and always running the latest version,

847
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,100
like is a great idea

848
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:54,179
and maybe someday we'll get there,

849
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,699
but we're not there today.

850
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,979
-- We,
-- we won't because even for example,

851
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,629
Apple doesn't support their devices forever.

852
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,564
Right? I have an ipad. Um

853
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:04,465
I had a gen one ipad that, wow, that thing's like dead.

854
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:09,264
I had a GEN two ipad that's stuck on I OS version. What is it? 9.3 0.5 or something?

855
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:09,925
Like you should

856
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:10,445
really

857
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:10,955
old version

858
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:12,245
basically.

859
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:12,304
Yeah,

860
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:16,745
I'm looking for somebody that just needs like a web surfer for their four year old.

861
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,715
Um And then, you know, I have some more ipads that are,

862
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:21,104
they're four

863
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:25,844
years old now, so they're stuck on I OS 10 point whatever the last 10 was.

864
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,239
And so now I'm, you know, having to upgrade ipads mostly to get a better CPU for the,

865
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,159
you know, the Augmented Reality and the 3D games and stuff.

866
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:37,000
But also so that I can keep an up to date I OS.

867
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:39,469
Yeah. You know,

868
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:40,709
um,

869
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,179
and it's not so much, I'm not so worried about security flaws,

870
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:45,469
so much as that the apps themselves

871
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,260
don't,

872
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:47,010
you know, the,

873
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,510
the app developers aren't going to support version nine and 10 for a long,

874
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,629
long time because like

875
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,679
supporting two or three streams of software is a lot of work, especially if,

876
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:58,510
you know, you're talking about a mobile app where most people are updating

877
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:01,310
relatively, you know, consistently.

878
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,949
Um And so part of it is, you know,

879
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,050
uh, just performance wise and, you know, software compatibility wise,

880
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,010
like I already ran into, I, I ran a software update and, um,

881
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,389
one of the apps broke on I OS 10 just flat, like it

882
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,219
turns on and you get a blank screen

883
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,870
just doesn't work awesome.

884
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,189
Right. Try explaining that to a seven year old.

885
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:23,340
I, I, have

886
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:26,560
you say it's broke and I can't fix it, do something else.

887
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,520
-- That's what
-- you said. I think that was word for word what I said,

888
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,280
you know.

889
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,399
And,

890
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,090
yeah, so I,

891
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:39,020
I love the run current argument but the reality is there's

892
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,709
a huge cost associated with that and like I said,

893
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,840
that and that's assuming everything goes well and you don't brick stuff,

894
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,719
you know, and then the cost just shoots up astronomically

895
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,870
and some stuff. Like

896
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,820
people, I think a lot of people forget because outside of niche industries,

897
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,129
you know, satellites run software and it's, as we learned from the Hubble, you know,

898
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,939
space telescope repair emissions,

899
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,159
that's really expensive,

900
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:03,399
uh, you know, or

901
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,969
like,

902
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,530
-- and wells or pipelines that are underground,
-- making sure you can update your,

903
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,209
your satellite from Earth is important.

904
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,070
Actually,

905
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,409
didn't one of the Mars Rovers have some sort of problem with the file system.

906
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,479
And they had to, like, it had

907
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,379
a, it basically put itself in a,

908
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:25,500
like safe mode and they were able to upload a new operating system which is

909
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,189
an integer

910
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,110
overflow or something,

911
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,860
-- something
-- really dumb. And

912
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,699
that's like, that's awesome. Right. That, that's where it's at right there.

913
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,500
But, but at the same time,

914
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,090
uh, this is a multimillion dollar thing. Maybe even in the billions.

915
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't know how much it costs.

916
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,669
So there's a certain incentive to make sure it can be remotely update.

917
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,810
Where is your, your $1 iot light bulb? Yeah. Nobody cares.

918
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,219
And there's also that incentive though, it's working. Don't touch it.

919
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,020
Right.

920
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,510
That's a huge incentive for people with software.

921
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,610
That's a huge incentive for everything. Kurt. I have so many things in my life that

922
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,889
it's like, I, I, this is working and I know I could make it better,

923
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:07,250
but I'll probably just make it worse if I touch it.

924
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,760
So I'm just going to do nothing. Like, nothing is easier than maybe breaking it.

925
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:13,739
In

926
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,229
fact, I feel like this. I've got my, my website, I have a website called breast.net

927
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,129
and

928
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,550
I've had it forever, like, like longer than I could remember.

929
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,969
And it's running on a AVM, like a VPs somewhere

930
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,379
and

931
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:31,040
I keep meaning there's like, it's just serving static content at this point. I

932
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:31,360
mean,

933
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:32,649
that's

934
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:32,800
the

935
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,050
thing.

936
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:33,860
Right. Like

937
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,860
it's enough work that it's,

938
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,969
it's easier for me to just pay the five bucks a month for this VP.

939
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,040
Like, I even have it, it's set on, on Cron to do,

940
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,659
like an auto update every day at midnight because I don't even care.

941
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,459
Like, I figure

942
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:51,820
whatever comes to distribution is probably secure enough.

943
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,610
But no, I, I right in here. This is exactly the point though. Right? Is

944
00:40:55,889 --> 00:41:00,989
my life would actually be easier and I'd say five bucks a month if I dumped it into S3,

945
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:02,020
however,

946
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,669
it's enough work to change it and like it's working today. So

947
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:10,199
why should I care? Right. And that's

948
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,320
the,

949
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,929
and, and like once a month, I think all right,

950
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,669
today is the day and then I start doing it and I'm like,

951
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,500
I can, I'm gonna go watch this

952
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:17,750
comes

953
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:18,080
back,

954
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,500
you know, people,

955
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:23,219
whether they realize it or not will do a cost benefit analysis and

956
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:26,139
a return on investment analysis for everything they do to some degree,

957
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,629
some, you know, consciously, some unconsciously.

958
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,699
Um

959
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,439
And again, though, you know, you can't make those decisions

960
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,219
until you sort of know what the problem is in the scope of the problem. Right.

961
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:38,989
So there's a great example, like a

962
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,550
lot of security bugs are not really that bad.

963
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,719
So hey, you know, we'll get them on the next major update

964
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,179
and then some security flaws are bad enough that no,

965
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:47,979
we're going to fix this in the next 24 hours

966
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:49,949
so that the world doesn't hopefully burn down a bit.

967
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,570
That's fair,

968
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:51,379
you know,

969
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,429
but we can't do that until we have the data to drive those decisions.

970
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,600
And the good news is now is that,

971
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,580
that's starting, you know, CV, we have the

972
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,860
JSON format, which has much richer data than the old CS V format,

973
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,610
which had like a description in URL S

974
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,159
and a CV ID.

975
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
And that was basically it,

976
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,010
you know, now we'll have richer data with what's affected, how is it affected?

977
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,919
You know, you can have sub containers. So vendor A is maybe strongly affected.

978
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:19,810
Vendor B is barely affected because of some decision they made or change they made,

979
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,250
you know,

980
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,479
and then that second part is have people like github

981
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:25,820
notifying everybody

982
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:27,459
that needs to be notified,

983
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:27,969
right?

984
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,070
Because that's the other problem is our notification

985
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,389
systems are typically incredibly coarse in that.

986
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,810
Here's a data feed. Good luck,

987
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,459
you know, that's it basically or

988
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,790
somebody selectively consumes it and, and you know,

989
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,469
they have to build something on their end to selectively consume it.

990
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,080
Whereas with github,

991
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,120
it's like I'm going to tell you just about the stuff you imported

992
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,060
Ergo, hopefully the stuff you should be caring about.

993
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,080
-- You know,
-- it's, it's awesome, man.

994
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,419
Now, I guess here's, here's the one other thing and we'll kind of,

995
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:58,260
we'll close on this one because I, I don't have an answer to it,

996
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,659
but this is going to cost github a lot.

997
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,969
This isn't cheap and it's not free.

998
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:05,699
So, what's the, what's the incentive here for them do you think?

999
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,199
Well,

1000
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,520
I think the reality is they have to start doing stuff like

1001
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,209
this because this is part of them moving up the food chain,

1002
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,729
just like every single web server on the planet now

1003
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,229
comes with SSL TLS support. Whereas that used to cost.

1004
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,409
I remember when a local company in Edmonton bought one,

1005
00:43:19,419 --> 00:43:21,149
they had the first secure web server in Edmonton.

1006
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:21,610
That was

1007
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:23,780
um actually, technically, it was the second one.

1008
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,780
The first one was the running room, had a secure web server. God knows why.

1009
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:32,030
But the second company, it was an ISP that had one, they spent $15,000 on Netscape,

1010
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,840
whatever it was secure server things.

1011
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,290
And so to sell access to it, they were actually,

1012
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,580
they seriously looked at like charging people a percentage

1013
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,639
of what they were selling online because they,

1014
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,030
they could not

1015
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,580
like if you told people, hey, to set up this web server,

1016
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,360
you need to pay 5000 bucks upfront or whatever they know.

1017
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:50,209
Right.

1018
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,090
And like I said, now,

1019
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,290
secure web servers are kind of the default rather than the exception.

1020
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,760
And I think that's with a lot of the security stuff. It's just like everything else.

1021
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,879
You know, how many people actually properly support I PV six now.

1022
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,530
And the answer is actually quite a few.

1023
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,929
Right. Whereas five years ago,

1024
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,629
I literally was talking with hosting providers

1025
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,209
and they're like, what's I PV six or? Yeah. No, we have no plans to support that.

1026
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:15,189
Like straight up. I was running a six bone tunnel for a while

1027
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,989
because my VPs host did not support I PV six.

1028
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,389
And that might not be the best example because I think I PV Six has a ways to go still.

1029
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:23,629
But

1030
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,510
it's

1031
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,919
-- all the mobile phones now
-- and it's coming, it's getting there.

1032
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:30,429
I think it's getting close.

1033
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:31,560
Yeah.

1034
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,159
Yeah. I,

1035
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:34,550
I don't

1036
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:34,830
think

1037
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,709
Six is.

1038
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,320
It's,

1039
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,899
and like, a lot of the security stuff,

1040
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:41,429
-- a lot of the security stuff that people do won't be super noticeable
-- and,

1041
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:43,449
and it shouldn't be, security should be boring.

1042
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:47,600
It should be like fixing bugs right where if you're fixing security bugs,

1043
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,669
you should just fix them and it's,

1044
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,469
it's not like the end of the world and some people might care.

1045
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:54,290
Some people probably won't. It's kind of,

1046
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,080
I know every time there's a new change log and something I run, I just, I,

1047
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,719
I skim it looking for the one or two things I care about if I don't see it, I say, ok,

1048
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:02,120
neat.

1049
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:02,919
You know, don't care.

1050
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,199
And, and security is the same way.

1051
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:06,000
It's,

1052
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:07,280
it's just a bug

1053
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:08,370
and, and I,

1054
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,399
I like this. I like where we ended up here where, where CV E is just,

1055
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:16,399
it is the, in your face example of

1056
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,209
the, the bug because we don't see him otherwise. So I love it, man. That's great.

1057
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,479
All right, Kurt, any parting thoughts,

1058
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:26,419
try to look at things from other people's perspective.

1059
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:28,360
Once in a while, it's not easy.

1060
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,679
But honestly, it's, I think something more people need to do more of,

1061
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:35,100
if they would only agree with me more, everything would be fine.

1062
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,159
Right.

1063
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:38,520
Well, that's one thing I,

1064
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,120
I say that freaks a lot of people out is I often say that I know I'm wrong.

1065
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,280
-- I'm always wrong.
-- I just don't know which

1066
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,760
part I always assume whatever I thought of.

1067
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,439
Like that's, that's the wrong answer.

1068
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,459
So let's look for other things that aren't that,

1069
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:50,959
you

1070
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:51,250
know,

1071
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,110
and then hopefully you find out you have the least worst,

1072
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,469
the least worst.

1073
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:56,399
I never

1074
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,800
do. I let a smart person fix it.

1075
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,320
It's just I know that whatever I've thought of, we can at least cross that one off.

1076
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,840
So, anyway, anyway.

1077
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:05,860
Right.

1078
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,570
All right, cool. Well, thank you, Kurt, thank you, everyone for listening.
