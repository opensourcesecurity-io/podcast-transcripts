00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,400
Happy December 7th, Kurt. How's, how's your, how's your December going?

1
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:03,809
Uh,

2
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,470
knowing 2020 probably stuff is

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:08,869
on.

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,399
Say everything's great. Everything is great.

5
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,039
I'm actually,

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,520
I am actually putting a little skating rink in the backyard for my kids and myself.

7
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:16,399
Right on, man.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,159
That's fun.

9
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:17,549
You kill

10
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:19,159
all the grass. You won't have to mow next year.

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,770
You know what? That's true.

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,889
-- Yeah, it'll all be dead.
-- It will all be dead.

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,209
I've done this before

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,409
-- anyway. Maybe I should just flood the entire backyard.
-- There you go.

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,430
And you'll just have weeds. It'll be perfect.

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:32,810
No.

17
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,040
Uh, green drop. They kill all the weeds.

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,909
I spent like last year

19
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,490
pulling all the weeds and then I hired green drop

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,830
and two sprays later. Boom. All the weeds are dead.

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,770
-- Better living through
-- chemistry. I don't want to talk about that.

22
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,770
-- So seven
-- is the best prime number.

23
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:51,779
And this is actually proven when you ask people to pick a number between one and 10,

24
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,450
-- they pretty much overwhelmingly pick
-- 77 is a lovely number.

25
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,009
I feel like it is the most real prime. But the, the real point.

26
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,729
Well, because you can't roll it on ad six. It's magic, it's secret.

27
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:07,449
That's true. You can't, you can't. But if you roll two it is the most likely number

28
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,690
two D six

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:08,900
s

30
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,730
-- correct. Because that bell curve.
-- That's right. Ok.

31
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:15,720
So the real purpose of this episode is just prime numbers. Why do we care?

32
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,879
What are they, we talk about?

33
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,419
People talk about prime numbers and security all the freaking time.

34
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,669
-- Yeah, because
-- crypto and Rs A and blah,

35
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:22,230
blah, blah.

36
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,919
That's true. Public key cryptography which, which may be behind a future door.

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,559
Yeah, prime numbers are a huge part of it.

38
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, actually there's a number of, I mean, in math, in general,

39
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,379
prime numbers are often magic but the point

40
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:37,040
is prime numbers in crypto are hugely important.

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,180
And actually prime numbers on computers are one of those things that

42
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:45,599
they, it, it, it's become simple to us because we're very used to it.

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,720
But calculating large primes has historically been a very difficult problem.

44
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,309
Well, and here's what I love is zero prime.

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,489
Uh

46
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,180
No one isn't prime either, dude.

47
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,339
What about two?

48
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,360
Two is a prime number sort of, but it is the dumbest prime

49
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,830
two is prime but is it the dumbest prime is

50
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:09,520
three is unquestionably a prime number?

51
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,820
-- And
-- I like, like, I love that like 01 and two. It's kind of like

52
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,000
-- those
-- are 00 is not a prime number.

53
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,520
So I've, I watch a lot of math youtube zero is not prime one is,

54
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:24,889
most mathematicians will tell you it's not prime but there's some contention.

55
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:25,309
There

56
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:29,190
-- two is definitely prime. But it's dumb.
-- Google says it's not prime.

57
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,940
-- So it's not prime. Does
-- Google say two is prime.

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,229
Uh

59
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,600
-- Google says two is not prime.
-- It says it's not prime. OK.

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,279
There you go.

61
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,270
I'll take it. I'm not gonna complain.

62
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,259
So three is the first prime.

63
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,789
Pause.

64
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,220
It says two is prime.

65
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,169
Oh, ok. I thought so.

66
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,320
It's just the worst prime because it's even like

67
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,240
prime numbers shouldn't be even two is even,

68
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,270
you suck too.

69
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:55,110
I know when I, when I come up like that, you know, like it's like ends in 246805,

70
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,589
not prime except when it's a 24 or a five or

71
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,710
-- uh
-- whatever, whatever, whatever.

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,789
So what,

73
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:07,470
OK. So here's the deal and this is why prime numbers matter. OK?

74
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,720
Is because

75
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,710
when we have a number, let's say it's an odd number.

76
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,399
That was weird. You laughing was funny.

77
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,240
So

78
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,820
in math, right?

79
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,520
You can obviously multiply certain numbers together and come up with a new number.

80
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:21,929
Yes.

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,710
Yeah, that's kind of the point of math is adding

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,169
multiplying

83
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,160
multiplication is just fancy edition.

84
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,990
And the point is, is true

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,190
when you're doing your math, right? And let's say you have an even number and

86
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,270
you can divide it by multiple things.

87
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:40,970
Two being one of them and get whole numbers as the result, right?

88
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,449
-- Unless it's 22 can be divided by two. I
-- am so glad you can't hit me from out there.

89
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,149
Whatever. I don't care. It's all good. You're keeping me on my toes. So,

90
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:52,949
and in December 7th, after all right, the world may have ended by now.

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,580
-- It is,
-- oh, a day to remember. Right.

92
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:56,100
Right.

93
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,169
Yes. So anyway, the point is

94
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:01,115
prime numbers are incredibly important because what you end up

95
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:05,436
doing in cryptography is basically multiplying two prime numbers together,

96
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,796
-- two gigantic prime numbers
-- together.

97
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,005
Well, right. And the result you get

98
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:14,985
is a number that only has two possible solutions if you were to divide it out, right?

99
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,156
Being the one of the two prime numbers.

100
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:20,435
Whereas if you had a number that was two even numbers,

101
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:22,205
let's say multiplied together,

102
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,216
there's actually going to be more than

103
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:27,316
two possible solutions to that division problem.

104
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:27,996
Oh, pretty much

105
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:32,242
-- there's going to be potentially a lot,
-- probably seven or eight solutions or more.

106
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:33,402
It depends, right?

107
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:38,372
-- Some even like 12 is a great example where 12 has like six divisors.
-- Right.

108
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,032
-- Well, and that's why we use it for clocks and Sumerians. Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

109
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,562
-- That 60 is ridiculously dividable.
-- Yeah, exactly.

110
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,562
-- And so this is why prime numbers matter.
-- Oh my God.

111
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:53,601
-- Can you imagine a clock system based on prime numbers? Oh, sweet
-- Germany.

112
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:57,832
We should make one up. I feel like this has this has legs cart, we could do this

113
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,130
anyway, it has, it has no purpose. All right.

114
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,820
So the point is prime numbers seven is the best. And

115
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,089
in the universe of cryptography,

116
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,850
primes are hugely important and I would be shocked if

117
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,850
anyone can learn anything from the last five minutes.

118
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:12,160
Yeah.

119
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:17,910
-- Also three is a close, is a close second to seven
-- maybe. I mean, 123, more than three.

120
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,609
Exactly. Three is a good one.
