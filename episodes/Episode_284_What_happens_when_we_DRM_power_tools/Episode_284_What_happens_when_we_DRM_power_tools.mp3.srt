Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,930
and my partner in package tracking crime. Josh Bresser

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,239
package tracking crime.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,680
So I have an anecdote to tell you before we get on to the topic of the day.

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,280
So I lost power the other night

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,329
and

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,959
it was out for a couple of hours and power comes back on it.

7
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:27,770
Storm.

8
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:30,790
Yeah, that horrible storm. Crazy storm

9
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,889
power comes back on at 5 a.m. And I know this because

10
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:36,490
when everything turns on the bell beeps and it, like,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,180
woke me with a start and I was awake awake.

12
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:40,610
Right.

13
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:45,330
So I, I do my usual go around the house, check everything and of course, I've got my,

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,090
like, rack of computers in the basement

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:53,069
and I dread looking at it and power was out long enough. The ups shut it down. Yeah.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,849
And I dread this because obviously anytime something starts up,

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,650
something breaks and of course,

18
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,659
one of the computers doesn't start and I

19
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:01,490
name all my computers after Mario character.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,869
So this one is named Luigi

21
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,569
and I'm like, this is the oldest computer I have by

22
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,970
a wide margin.

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,209
So I'm thinking

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,680
maybe something died for real this time. Like this is it, I plug it in.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,379
I plug in a monitor because obviously there's no monitor on anything.

26
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:19,680
So I've got to get my monitor, find the right cables and this is a really old computer.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,949
So I have to find a VG, a cable that I can plug in. I have, I have an old TV.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,069
Yeah, it's old, I have an old TV. I keep as my like basement monitor

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,074
just because it is a VG, a plug on it. Like, just for this computer.

30
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,025
That's literally the only reason I have it.

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,584
-- You should probably replace that computer with a Raspberry Pi four.
-- So I, I want to.

32
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:41,305
But the reason I don't is because I run

33
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:44,894
a Bitcoin demon on it to download all the Bitcoin Blockchain.

34
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:48,894
And so I need a huge disk in a lot of memory. It doesn't need to be fast.

35
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:53,625
I just need the RA M and so it's got 32 gigs of ra M in it. But it's really old. Anyway,

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,029
machine is dead. Plug it in and it's like keyboard air.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,059
It says I'm thinking keyboard air. What?

38
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,180
I've never seen a keyboard air in a bio, like in a long time.

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,330
So anyway, it says Press F one,

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,379
right.

41
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:05,099
Yeah,

42
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,209
I hit F one

43
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:07,180
and

44
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:10,110
it tries to do Pixie Boot and I'm thinking,

45
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,830
what,

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,089
like, where did this even come from? So anyway,

47
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,740
bio battery died. Yes,

48
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,649
that hasn't happened to me in so long. It took me

49
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,229
significantly longer than I want to admit to realize that

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,990
battery had died and all of the settings were lost.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
It had no time. It didn't know where to boot from.

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,880
And of course I replace the battery. Everything's fine again.

53
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,190
But it's like, oh, my goodness, what?

54
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,919
It was just so silly.

55
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:36,479
Like I,

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,880
that's one thing I hate about my motherboards now is the two Windows machines I have.

57
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:41,940
Every time I upgrade the bios,

58
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,610
they lose a bunch of bios settings.

59
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,820
Not like all of them, like they keep their boot settings.

60
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,669
But for whatever reason, every time I upgrade the bios,

61
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:50,679
it

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,059
disables the secure virtual machine setting.

63
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,690
So I boot into windows and I try and start up a virtual machine and it fails

64
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,860
actually. So fun fact too. The other thing that made this exciting

65
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,899
was when it reset all the bios settings

66
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,940
it re enabled secure boot

67
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:10,380
with. And I know I'm using an old Legacy Bios

68
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,380
boot loader because the machine is ancient.

69
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,559
I don't, I don't even think Shakira

70
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,429
was enabled in Linux back when I installed this thing.

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,679
And I've been like, upgrading Debbie in for decades.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,369
But

73
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,850
yeah, that, that was another part of it. I'm like, why won't you boot?

74
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,279
And it took again?

75
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,809
I spent like an hour getting this stupid computer started just because I'm like,

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,410
stupid.

77
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,410
-- See,
-- and that's why I do regular reboots on my systems is to

78
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,610
actually see if they reboot or not. And if everything comes up, like,

79
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,750
like on my desktop, I, for whatever reason I cannot get slack, the slack client to,

80
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,509
to start

81
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,869
on boot. It says it does, but it's not running.

82
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,139
Ok. So now here's something to think about

83
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,270
if I had just rebooted that computer and I, I do reboot it occasionally

84
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:56,789
it would have been fine because the power was still applied to the system. Right.

85
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,970
It was only when I lost this battery.

86
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,949
Like, this computer has probably been powered for, for a decade or more.

87
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,229
I have no, this battery could have died four years ago. I don't think I've lost power

88
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,020
coin ones. The cr

89
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,500
2030 twos. I've got like a box of them because

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,970
I,

91
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,350
I needed, I needed one at one point and I forget when this was, but I go, I,

92
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,470
I think it was, I went to the hardware store

93
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,320
and one battery in 10 batteries were like a dollar apart.

94
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:29,149
So I bought a bunch of them and I will never run out.

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,769
Well, the, the,

96
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,429
the best part was a lot of those batteries will degrade over time because I

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,109
bought a whole bunch of really cheap 2030 twos and two years later they're,

98
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,109
they're all dead.

99
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,989
-- Uh,
-- I bought Energizer, which I, I purposely don't buy.

100
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,089
-- Ah,
-- well, yeah, you name brand.

101
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,000
I do not buy cheap batteries.

102
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,200
I've watched a lot of youtube videos where people take cheap batteries and,

103
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,519
and kind of compare them to non cheap batteries.

104
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,040
And

105
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,690
it is clear

106
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,459
that paying the extra money for Du

107
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,880
-- Cell and energizer is money well spent. Yeah.
-- Yeah, I know.

108
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,760
I've had to scrape white crud out of my kids' toys once in a while.

109
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,269
All right.

110
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,809
Anyway, anyway, we have a topic today that is not the old hardware in my basement.

111
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,399
-- Well,
-- it sort

112
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,570
of is, it's so what's interesting to me is that more and more equipment,

113
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,079
especially things like anything that runs on electricity

114
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,970
now is getting a computer jammed into it.

115
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,420
Why? Well, because honestly it's easier to jam a

116
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,630
computer and then have that like a little 16 bit or 32 bit micro controller

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,269
kind of be the on off switch and power settings than it is to,

118
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,500
you know, for example, have like an analog thing, like back in the old days where,

119
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,429
you know, the more you pull the,

120
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,559
like a Rio stat on the trigger where the more you pull the trigger on your power drill,

121
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,390
the more power it lets through that kind of thing.

122
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,149
And so what's fascinating is,

123
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,029
and this is a bit of a segue into economics.

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,179
I did not realize this when you buy power tools, for example, at Home Depot,

125
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,589
Home, Depot doesn't pay for those, how those power tools.

126
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,839
So I didn't know this, I don't, I didn't know this. Explain this

127
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,589
-- straight up
-- because I always wondered, like I get,

128
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:52,269
there's,

129
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,059
there's companies that are big enough that they send their

130
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,799
own people out with their own trucks to stock stuff.

131
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:58,010
Like Pepsi is a good example. And Coca Cola, right,

132
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,239
you go to the supermarket and

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,760
quite often in the bigger supermarkets you'll see a

134
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,230
guy in a Pepsi shirt with a pallet of Pepsi

135
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,630
stocking the shelves.

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,570
Right. And they get a certain amount of shells away. Same thing with Whole

137
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,959
Depot Lowe's, you know,

138
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,209
Milwaukee DeWalt,

139
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,489
all those that literally you'll see like a big red

140
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,440
or big yellow truck in the parking lot with branding

141
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,470
and you know,

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,410
the the person is slipping in a shopping cart full

143
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,079
of power tools and putting them on the shelves.

144
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,000
So literally the way it works is Milwaukee or DeWalt

145
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,950
get an agreement with Home Depot and they get a certain

146
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,070
amount of shelf space in a certain part of the store,

147
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,309
you know, the tool corral and they stock it

148
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:31,220
and

149
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,339
that's it. Home Depot doesn't pay them.

150
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,190
Home Depot then sells the tool scans at a checkout

151
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:43,350
and then I assume some 30 60 90 day type of payment occurs after that tool is sold.

152
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,720
So like and Milwaukee and DeWalt aren't even getting paid

153
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,170
at the time of the tool being scanned and sold,

154
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,690
you know, they're getting paid later.

155
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:54,380
So the thing is essentially if those tools get stolen.

156
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,269
Yeah, Milwaukee eats the loss, not Home Depot,

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,369
right? Because it never got scanned out.

158
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:03,779
And, uh, the BC A VE youtuber who, you know,

159
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,940
he takes apart power tools and shows you how they're going to fail and how to fix them.

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,299
More and more of these tools have an RF ID tag,

161
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:14,339
not on the box, not on the tool, but

162
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:20,059
in the tool, like literally there'll be a, a spot in the casting on the inside of it

163
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:20,980
where

164
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,739
the RF ID tag is inserted,

165
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:23,510
you know.

166
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,510
And so they, they, you know,

167
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,220
scan it at the checkout and run it over the powerful magnet or whatever.

168
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,299
So it doesn't beep on the way out the door. But the problem is you can do things like,

169
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,019
well bring your own magnet to the store and, you know,

170
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,700
kill the uh kill the tag or you can

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
stop, stop telling everyone how to shoplift.

172
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,179
Well, every dude this is,

173
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,779
I was about to say there's a scene in a movie where they buy two cast iron bathtubs,

174
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,299
flip them up on top of each other.

175
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,079
So it's like a giant Fay

176
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:47,760
shield.

177
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,200
And before they do that, they fill it with power tools.

178
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,950
So they pay for two bathtubs full of bath

179
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,109
uh power tools.

180
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,350
-- I think it's Boondock Saints or something because
-- the store would never check

181
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,750
inside of that.

182
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,640
No, they actually wouldn't because you're buying two heavy bathtubs.

183
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,790
What they're going to make you pull them apart and look inside.

184
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,750
I would hope they do.

185
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,079
-- I,
-- I suspect it would work anyways. The point is

186
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,799
so

187
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,920
then the next step is, well, what if we add DRM

188
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,739
and have

189
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,429
like an enablement step at checkout? Right. So you check out and for example,

190
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,399
they

191
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:25,619
Bluetooth, uh I believe it's Bluetooth uh connect to the tool

192
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,279
and

193
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,679
essentially turn it on like enable it so you can steal it, but it's not enabled.

194
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,289
It's a, it's a brick.

195
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,058
-- Yeah,
-- this is a wild idea and we obviously have a story.

196
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,450
We'll put a link in the show notes. I read this in my, so I've got

197
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,832
-- couple of thoughts and this is
-- a lot of high

198
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,234
end cars do this right with the anti theft systems where

199
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:47,773
you have like a valet mode where they can be driven

200
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:51,414
like a mile or you have literally like Tesla's apparently have

201
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:52,533
when they're shipped,

202
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,953
they have like a temporary access card that you get and you can drive the thing,

203
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,263
you know, tens of meters.

204
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,364
And so what's interesting is with high end car thefts is, you know,

205
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,424
they'll pull up a car trailer, like right in front of the car, start it, you know,

206
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:06,453
get it to move a few meters onto the truck and then take off with it and,

207
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:10,669
you know, electronically got it later and you know, hijack it.

208
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,419
Is this actually a problem? How many high,

209
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,989
I mean, how many Teslas get stolen per year?

210
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,390
I believe the number is like single digits

211
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,169
and that's because

212
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,669
they call home,

213
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,309
right?

214
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,770
And that's, that's the second part of this story is

215
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,429
you can now easily make a device call home because,

216
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,109
well,

217
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,309
the Wi Fi and the Bluetooth is generally getting quite publicly available, right?

218
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,909
We just did that show about Amazon's neighborhood thing,

219
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,340
right?

220
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,950
But for example, Apple did this with Apple air tags, right?

221
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,780
I I bought some tiles tags a long time ago and tile tags are ok. They do Bluetooth.

222
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:46,510
So you know,

223
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,190
you put them on your key ring and you can find your key ring in your house kind of thing.

224
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,390
Um But they're not

225
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,030
super smart and

226
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,710
essentially they can only be spotted by other people running the tile app,

227
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,500
which is pretty rare.

228
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:02,979
Whereas you know the Apple Air tags will by default, everybody's

229
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,830
iphone and ipad.

230
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,070
Oh, yeah, I see an Airtag.

231
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,809
I'm going to report it home to Apple and, and apparently it's all crypto ma

232
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,359
secure blah, blah, blah. It's fine. No privacy issues.

233
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,080
Yeah.

234
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,099
Well, in fairness, like if I'm carrying an airtag around this Bluetooth beacon,

235
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm kind of expecting it to be tracked because that's

236
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,960
kind of what it's for.

237
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,200
Well, but if, if I'm next to you now,

238
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,739
my phone is communicating with your Airtag against my wishes.

239
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,219
Yeah, I fully expect that.

240
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,729
I don't, I don't want it to, I don't want my phone talking to your filthy Airtag, Kurt

241
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,669
as I understand it. Does not communicate with the airtag.

242
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,229
It simply sees the, the, the Bluetooth beacon and reports it.

243
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,210
That's communication. No, no, no.

244
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:47,650
It's one way from, as I understand, it's one way from my, my airtag beacons,

245
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:50,659
your phone simply notices it and reports that to Apple.

246
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,010
Probably true. But again, I mean, we, I don't think we even know, but

247
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,260
-- regardless, regardless,
-- will there be no reason for my,

248
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,809
your phone to talk to my Bluetooth.

249
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:00,760
But it's,

250
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,429
it's collecting data from your Bluetooth and

251
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,479
then telling Apple about what it seems,

252
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,530
right? Which is something if I could turn off, I would. But I can't.

253
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,260
Well,

254
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:10,890
and

255
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,840
well, I mean,

256
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,020
and I guess that's the biggest part of this

257
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,429
whole problem is if you have a device that allows

258
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,950
software updates that you kind of have to install or are

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,619
in some Apple doesn't yet force software updates on you.

260
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,780
Like there are devices

261
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,539
and there are, there are hardware and network devices that

262
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,830
essentially are run by the vendor, right?

263
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,630
You, you cannot disable software updates on them, right?

264
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,280
-- There's that uh there's an HP product that does this,
-- there's lots of product.

265
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,719
I mean, easy example is Nintendo,

266
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,820
right? I own a Nintendo switch. I love Zelda and Mario games.

267
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,719
Like I my joke, I tell my kids always is.

268
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,080
Nintendo could literally put poop in a box and as long as it's called Zelda,

269
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,719
I will pay them for it like no questions asked.

270
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,979
Anyway,

271
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,359
there are constant hacks against Nintendo's hardware.

272
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,679
The switch obviously is, is the thing right now

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,609
and

274
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,190
they make it so you can't buy things from their

275
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,950
eshop unless you have the latest operating system update installed.

276
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,789
Because obviously, if you are running an old version, then you can hack it.

277
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,869
-- Whereas if you have the new one in theory,
-- I,

278
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,400
I don't like the word hack because it implies

279
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,765
some maliciousness. This is a device that you want.

280
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,625
I prefer the term root because you own this thing. Why, why can't you?

281
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:30,885
I don't think, I don't think rooting a device is a malicious act in any way.

282
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:34,484
But Nintendo has decided if, and, and the thing is they're not even

283
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,409
if you do it, they're just saying you can't play in our sandbox,

284
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:41,270
which they technically have the right to do it annoys me.

285
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,719
But whatever, I know a lot of people use it for piracy and stuff like that. But like

286
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,750
I, I have a three Ds that I've,

287
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,059
I've rooted because I love running homebrew stuff on it.

288
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,695
Like I think it's awesome. I've got emulators up the wazoo.

289
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,445
I've got weird homebrew things going on. I love it. It's awesome to work with.

290
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,905
Well, and that's, I mean,

291
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,375
that gets into a whole other argument about like people

292
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,844
pirating content because you literally cannot pay for it.

293
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:03,955
It's not available, but

294
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,085
that's another story.

295
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,625
But getting back to this sort of power tools thing.

296
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:11,044
What's interesting to me is number one, everything has a battery,

297
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,205
everything that has a battery by definition now has a computer jammed in it.

298
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:18,265
And that computer is often powerful enough to do Bluetooth and Wi Fi

299
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,924
and thus report if it's lost or stolen.

300
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:27,119
And what's fascinating to me is we're already at the point of

301
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,080
phones, for example, have long had, you know, the, the,

302
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,359
the find my iphone feature where I can remotely wipe it so that,

303
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,719
you know, the bad guys don't get access to my photos or whatever?

304
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:42,840
-- Well,
-- isn't there some sort of like global list of known stolen telephones? Right.

305
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,340
So the, uh, what is it ime, I, the international mobile equipment identifier.

306
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,179
Got it.

307
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:48,630
Wow.

308
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,090
Good

309
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:49,609
job.

310
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,239
Yeah, in theory there's a global IME I list of

311
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,710
phones that were reported stolen

312
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,359
that

313
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,169
you

314
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,739
actually used to be able to check publicly in Canada and that's all gone.

315
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,020
Now, I,

316
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,770
I tried finding it a few months ago because I

317
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,059
was actually buying a used phone for my son.

318
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,210
Well,

319
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,750
you know, this is like a year or two ago

320
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,770
anyways and I couldn't find it. Right. And it would have been nice because,

321
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,690
well, I could make sure I'm not buying a, well,

322
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,690
reasonably sure I'm not buying a stolen phone.

323
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,460
Well, I,

324
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:23,080
I think the purpose of the list was so cellular providers could just deny service.

325
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,580
Right.

326
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,380
Yeah, they would blacklist those phones.

327
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,859
-- So that, and
-- I would, I would hope they still do that.

328
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,210
Yeah.

329
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:29,940
So when you stole a phone, the idea is that,

330
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,309
that there's no more secondary market for

331
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,979
stolen phones because they just don't work.

332
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:34,679
Right. And

333
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,869
in theory that would, people would stop stealing phones because

334
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,460
people who buy used dodgy phones from a guy on the street

335
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,289
would know that there's a high chance it's not

336
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,469
gonna work so they would stop doing that.

337
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,070
-- So the demand for it would go down
-- and,

338
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,489
and I feel like I don't hear about phone theft very often these days

339
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,859
there's still a

340
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,150
bit of snatch and grab but by and large it's not as,

341
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,340
it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I think two factors. One

342
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,409
like Android phones especially are nowhere near as expensive as they used to be.

343
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,989
And number two, it's so easy to remotely brick them

344
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,440
also. True. Right. Like,

345
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,080
dude, we grew up with phones that you could not lock,

346
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,390
right? Like there was

347
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:16,229
-- like my first cell phones didn't have a lock function.
-- Oh,

348
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,630
I was thinking the phone on the wall like the,

349
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,169
you just

350
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,119
put it out,

351
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,070
you know, it's

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,599
so

353
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,599
that's the other thing, most people nowadays have a pin code

354
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,169
and

355
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,260
II,

356
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,270
I think

357
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,400
my first cell phone,

358
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,900
I don't think you could add a pin code to it.

359
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:40,700
I think it was just the like push star and push three or whatever to make it work.

360
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,280
-- I'm
-- trying to think my first cell phone was, it was a nokia.

361
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,530
-- It was a candy bar, nokia because
-- we all had nokias back then.

362
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,114
And it got 20 months of battery actually, in all seriousness.

363
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,525
My first cell phone I remember got more than 30 days of battery life,

364
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:55,405
but

365
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:55,705
we

366
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,085
-- use them nearly as much as we do nowadays.
-- That's true.

367
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:02,455
I used it like once a week maybe because text messages cost like $7 to sell.

368
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:02,984
So they

369
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:03,284
still do

370
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:03,844
in Canada.

371
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:09,174
I want, I want real all the way back to the beginning.

372
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,335
And I want to ask a super simple question about

373
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:12,544
uh power to.

374
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,174
So

375
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,489
once you start putting

376
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,770
DRM

377
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,140
in a power tool,

378
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,190
do you own the power tool?

379
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:25,369
I would say, and you're gonna hate this. It depends because if it's the kind of DRM

380
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,330
where, let's say, hypothetically you have a power tool with a Bluetooth beacon

381
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,710
and for the sake of argument,

382
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,349
a hardware fuse that gets blown once the tool

383
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,210
is activated and it's like a one way function,

384
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,729
then I would say, yes, you own that tool.

385
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,130
However, that's not what they're going to build because

386
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,039
-- that would be more expensive.
-- It might be where they start.

387
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,289
But that's, you know, you know where this story ends up.

388
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,599
Yeah, it ends up with the Peloton bikes that if you want that safety feature,

389
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,119
so you don't crash into a wall

390
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,390
or sorry, the Peloton treadmills, you know, they added that safety feature

391
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,690
and you got it. What?

392
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,159
I think it was, like, free for 90 days and then it was like part of a $40 a month package

393
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,920
after the fact, something like that.

394
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,140
And, and that's,

395
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,459
yeah, that's where it's like with TV. S right.

396
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:12,689
I am deathly afraid of having to buy a new TV

397
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,310
in the next five years because I just want a dumb TV

398
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,939
that plugs in a sound bar and an apple TV.

399
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,900
And it's a screen. I just want a screen

400
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:26,920
doesn't even, it doesn't even need to have speakers because I have a nice sound bar

401
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,339
and,

402
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,670
oh man, I

403
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,410
uh

404
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:32,109
yeah.

405
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:37,310
Anyway, I know the, the answer people give at this point is, oh,

406
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,630
just buy a TV and never hook it up to the internet.

407
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:39,790
I,

408
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:44,989
I think those days are maybe not over for TV.

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,469
S but in a couple of years they will be because these TV,

410
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:51,109
S are either going to use crap like Amazon's neighborhood or they're going to

411
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,869
just have a freaking cellular, you know, modem in them.

412
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,410
-- And so they're going to spy on you whether you want it or not,
-- you can buy devices.

413
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,880
Go on the, well, it used to be two G and three G networks,

414
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,020
but those are being phased out.

415
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,349
And I'm actually a little sad because I wanted

416
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,859
to buy one of those wristwatches for my son.

417
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,089
That was like, it's a two G enabled wristwatch that kind of lets you track where he is.

418
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,069
So if they get lost you can find them

419
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,670
and these things are crazy cheap.

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,609
Uh, but two G and three G are being phased out in Canada.

421
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,510
Uh, I think at the end of this year, actually three G goes away.

422
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,589
Yeah, it's, we're pretty aggressive,

423
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,819
getting rid of it because

424
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,239
come on,

425
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,780
like,

426
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,739
-- think about all that spectrum you get back.
-- Exactly. Right. That's exactly it.

427
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,020
Plus we really do need to move to five G and get, you know,

428
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,400
stuff working better because, well, that COVID ain't gonna mind control itself

429
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:36,829
that

430
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:37,979
you're leaving that in.

431
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,089
Um,

432
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:39,920
totally.

433
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,819
So

434
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,099
I

435
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,689
just,

436
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,869
there's like a great story where this guy has a relatively

437
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,349
nice e scooter and he put two apple tiles in it.

438
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,709
He put one in the wheel, well, where it was sort of obvious

439
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,839
it was like the decoy one and then he hit one in

440
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,619
the handlebars where it was much less obvious and his scooter got stolen

441
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,160
and so he

442
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:03,640
tracked, it wasn't able to retrieve it, went to black hat, came home,

443
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,180
alerted the police. This is New York City

444
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,810
and finally got the police kind of on site, went to,

445
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:14,630
uh find it. They found it at a used scooter and bike store and obviously

446
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,770
the scooter and bike store is like, oh, yeah, a lady dropped it off and uh, yeah.

447
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,560
No, we totally didn't get any information from her contact details.

448
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:21,589
Or anything, uh,

449
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,130
whatever. And my understanding is that's illegal in New York.

450
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,270
Like,

451
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,829
when you sell stuff you're supposed to get contact

452
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:29,949
details because funnily enough when people steal things.

453
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:30,569
Yeah,

454
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:33,609
they then have to monetize it and that the easiest way to

455
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,790
do that is to go to a store that sells you stuff and

456
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:36,989
sell it to them. Right.

457
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,390
Like pawnshops, there's a reason pawnshops have to keep logs of who gives them what,

458
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,989
especially jewelry and weapons because

459
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,349
that's what the bad guys do to turn their stolen stuff into cash.

460
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,040
Right. Right.

461
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,400
Same with power tools.

462
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:55,020
And so I kind of wonder about this future because,

463
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,689
uh, I know somebody that bought a really nice expensive AM G Mercedes from Germany.

464
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,010
And um,

465
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,239
it got lost

466
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:03,800
for a while.

467
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,839
Like, it didn't get lost forever, but like it, but, you know,

468
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,400
it's put in a shipping crate in Germany

469
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,119
-- while it's
-- being shipped.

470
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:09,959
They sort of,

471
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,199
yeah, they sort of lost track of it for.

472
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,780
It wasn't like,

473
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,319
it probably wasn't stolen, but it was just,

474
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,760
I remember Air Canada telling me

475
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,810
your bags are not lost. We just don't know where they are.

476
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,310
And I'm like, well, do you know which country they're in?

477
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,040
And they're like, no, I'm like, are they in Argentina or in Brazil or in Canada?

478
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,339
They're like,

479
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,290
they're, he's like, and I quote,

480
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,869
they're in

481
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,329
the system and I'm like,

482
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,079
well, like, what am I gonna do? Right. I can't, like,

483
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,989
ok. And then three days after I get home, a guy shows up at my door with my bag.

484
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,510
Right. Right. You know, it's kind of like, I'm glad this happened on the way home.

485
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,510
And holy cow, the border guys.

486
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,709
When you're traveling from Argentina with no luggage,

487
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,020
they do not care for that.

488
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,300
Oh, I bet. I bet. I never thought of that. Wow.

489
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,040
Yeah.

490
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,540
Yeah, that was, uh, that was not a fun trip home. But, yeah, so,

491
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:03,300
you know, if I could like, it blows my mind that when I order food on,

492
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,839
skip the dishes or whatever, you know,

493
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,020
I can watch the little Pacman delivery driver, you know, going beep, beep, beep,

494
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,979
beep, beep up the road and then he turns left and then he turns right and then,

495
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,729
-- you know, it's, there's about a 32nd delay on the feed. So, by the
-- time

496
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:15,040
that's,

497
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:18,619
-- that's a different problem. Right.
-- No, but what I'm saying is if I can track my pizza,

498
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,050
why, you know, why aren't we slapping a cell phone

499
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,849
or a satellite phone onto $100,000 car

500
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,300
for the,

501
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,910
let's, let's talk about power tools.

502
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,439
I think cars are a different story and that's, that's an easier conversation.

503
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:32,589
I mean, a power tool

504
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:35,619
is a great conversation because we're talking about a

505
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:41,530
tool that probably cost somewhere between 1 $100 and $1000. Generally speaking,

506
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:45,170
they hold their value for decades because

507
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,150
the good power tools. Like,

508
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,170
like I, I will tell anyone listening, like, if you're buying power tools,

509
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,079
the way I always do it is if I need, if I need a new thing and I'm unsure,

510
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,209
I go buy a cheap one.

511
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,599
You when it breaks, I buy the good one and the cheap one always breaks in like a year.

512
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,439
And I have, I have like 20 year old power tools made by DeWalt and like,

513
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,060
the,

514
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:07,949
the battery sucks. And I'm like, I wish I could buy a battery that fit this drill.

515
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:10,969
-- There's nothing wrong with it but it gets seven minutes
-- of life. I

516
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,359
wonder if

517
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,219
somebody 3d prints adapters

518
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:13,989
because you just,

519
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:14,910
I saw

520
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:15,989
-- on the
-- internet. I

521
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,099
anyway, it doesn't matter, whatever. All right. So,

522
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,819
so

523
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:21,500
the issue I see here is,

524
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,229
and this is from kind of

525
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:23,359
a,

526
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,410
maybe,

527
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,160
maybe a privacy angle is you've got a device that now has some sort of

528
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,930
embedded controller in it and maybe today the controller is basically on or off.

529
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,770
Right. Go to the checkout, checkout, turns it on.

530
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,089
But like you're saying, is the ability to do more.

531
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,099
Yeah, I mean, I, I is, is messed up as this sounds.

532
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:44,310
It would not shock me if someday there's like a, a

533
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,780
program

534
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:46,890
where you pay dal

535
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,890
$20 a month and

536
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,250
they make your power tools work and if you stop paying them,

537
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,420
none of the power tools work well, you know,

538
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,890
and, and that's the thing from a business perspective.

539
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,819
There's a lot of times where as a business I would far, far prefer to lease than to own

540
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,689
because maybe I only need it for six months or a year or more to the point.

541
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:07,449
I just want a power drill that works and when it breaks,

542
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,410
I don't want it to be my problem.

543
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,829
I just want somebody to show up with a new one and I'm not,

544
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,109
and that's entirely appropriate for leasing.

545
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,920
But as a home prosumer consumer, whatever,

546
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,369
I just want to buy a power drill that works

547
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,949
right. You know,

548
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,910
and I don't want to jump through hoops and I don't want to have

549
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,660
to worry about Dr And I don't want to have to worry about having to

550
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,939
pay some fee in the future to keep using the thing I paid for.

551
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,209
Yeah, I mean, so kind of one of the, one of the aspects of this

552
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,420
I, I think of is

553
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,579
so

554
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,339
I, I forget Sony is shutting down

555
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,079
the, I think they undid this because there is too much upper.

556
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,859
But there's, they have a little handheld called the Playstation Vita or the PSP.

557
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,780
No, I think the PSP is the old one

558
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,079
and they were shutting down the online store,

559
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,489
which meant anything you had purchased

560
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,329
that you hadn't downloaded, you would lose forever.

561
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:00,569
Well, I, I've already encountered that with my kids ipads. There's a ton of apps

562
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:04,609
that, for example, no, longer work on newer versions of I OS. So you paid for it.

563
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:05,489
Tough where,

564
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:06,954
that's a

565
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:11,655
great example or better yet. There's a really nice coloring app. I'm not gonna name

566
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,704
because it went from,

567
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:20,094
you bought it to now and I'm not making this up 3995 a month subscription.

568
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:21,824
Yeah.

569
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:23,925
And I'm guessing a few people accidentally

570
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,390
enable it

571
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,750
and thinking it's like, at first when I saw that number, I'm like, 0, 40 bucks a year.

572
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,459
Well, maybe.

573
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,930
And then I'm like, no, hang on a minute. Apple doesn't bill yearly. They bill monthly

574
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,810
40 bucks a month for this.

575
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,010
Ok. But anyway, anyway, so here's the thing, right?

576
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,989
So, historically, we have this view of purchasing stuff. Like I buy a drill.

577
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,780
I have a drill someday, the drill will probably die and then I have to buy a new drill.

578
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,359
But once we start putting computers inside of all this stuff,

579
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,349
it starts to get a little squishy because let's say I buy a drill

580
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:00,280
and

581
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:04,640
then I sell the drill to someone or whatever and, and the drill manufacturers, like,

582
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,829
-- wait, you're not authorized to sell that drill to someone else or,
-- well,

583
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,319
except you are for sale doctrine.

584
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:09,880
Well,

585
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:12,280
right,

586
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,040
Costco went through that with the watch people where

587
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,819
they were buying watches in Europe and selling them

588
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,900
in North America and Cartier or whatever was trying

589
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,760
to claim copyright to prevent them from doing this.

590
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:23,010
I think what's really interesting though is there are devices where legitimately,

591
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,719
there's like an ongoing cost to keeping it working.

592
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,119
So for example,

593
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:30,800
uh well, simple example, I, I buy an ipad, I buy software,

594
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:34,219
the software Apple still has to keep running the store so

595
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:36,420
I can download the software again after I wipe my ipad,

596
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,750
right? And so there's, there's ongoing costs.

597
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,459
Whereas typically when you buy a power tool,

598
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,109
the manufacturer has no ongoing cost to support it.

599
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,739
And if for example, the tool breaks and you want to send it back to get it fixed,

600
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,420
they're like, cool, that'll be 40 bucks for you to send it back and get it fixed

601
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,935
unless it's like a manufacturing defect. In which case, a recall and eat the cost.

602
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,234
Because I,

603
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:58,574
like I had a tool where, yeah, there's a manufacturing issue

604
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:03,135
and they had to not a recall but like a, a voluntary upgrade program.

605
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:06,364
And I cannot imagine that it was cheap because they

606
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,545
ate the cost of me shipping this tool to Ontario,

607
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,385
fixing it and shipping it back.

608
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,099
I mean,

609
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,060
ok, so

610
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,349
the more we talk about this, the more confused,

611
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,290
I think I'm making myself because you think about an ipad

612
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,479
and I think an ipad or a computer or whatever,

613
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,400
there's an expected

614
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,760
maintenance window, you have

615
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,130
the ipad

616
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,030
-- is useless without software.
-- It is completely.

617
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:30,880
And

618
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,349
like today you buy a drill

619
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,839
and you're gonna say,

620
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:37,050
ok, so the drill works,

621
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,420
no questions asked someday the drill's gonna have a computer in and now

622
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,619
the stories start to evolve and change and it's kind of a use case

623
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,619
that

624
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,250
we don't grasp because it's, it's too new and there's, of course,

625
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,920
the terrifying angle of the companies are going to screw this up,

626
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,939
which they probably will.

627
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:56,390
And there's a simpler sort of maybe scenario example that makes more sense is

628
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,010
you buy a tool that has some sort of computer vision system in it.

629
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,859
And,

630
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,859
well, yeah, you, you probably want that to get software updates and get better.

631
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,989
I mean, maybe, ok, let's, let's, let's take this to the absurd.

632
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,520
Just because we can't,

633
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,670
you buy a hammer.

634
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:16,630
Hammer is literally like the most simple tool. Like a rock can be a hammer. Right?

635
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,770
-- I buy
-- a hammer

636
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,430
that

637
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,530
we've all, we've all done it.

638
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,619
Every tool I own is a hammer at some point in time.

639
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,829
Every power drill I've ever owned is just scarred on that one side.

640
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,219
-- Uh,
-- you know.

641
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:34,390
Yeah, every now and then it's like I really shouldn't be doing this,

642
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,910
but I'm too lazy to go get the hammer.

643
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,209
So I just,

644
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,630
it away anyway. Anyway. Ok.

645
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,459
And on a ladder it's, you don't got time for that. Right. Right.

646
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:45,579
It's like, do not open paint, canvas screwdriver

647
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,300
anyway.

648
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,209
Ok. So a hammer,

649
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,339
let's say someone finds a way to add

650
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,500
a computer to a hammer

651
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,329
and adds DRM to it.

652
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,180
And now the hammer doesn't work unless you pay them as ridiculous as that sounds.

653
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,280
You mean initial payment or ongoing payment.

654
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,369
I don't know because

655
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,430
they want to stop shoplifting of hammers which

656
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,040
-- so
-- there's like a big spike in the handle and it retracts once you get it enabled,

657
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,229
whatever, something like that, you know, like

658
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,780
I feel like

659
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,250
when you there, there's like a line I think, whereas a human,

660
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,520
I feel like you're just adding crap to this for no good reason.

661
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,760
I feel like power tools are really close to that line.

662
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,030
I don't know which side they're on.

663
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,849
I, I think Home Depot might have an argument here for what they're doing.

664
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:39,489
I don't, I don't understand

665
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,930
the internals.

666
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,260
What's interesting is a Home Depot kind of doesn't

667
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,979
care because they're not the one eating the cost.

668
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:49,699
-- It's De Walter Milwaukee that are eating the cost.
-- Necessarily. My suspicion

669
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,349
is these power to manufacturers because if you read the article it talks about,

670
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,770
there's actually, it sounds like there's a lot of organized crime adopting power to

671
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:57,310
theft.

672
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,030
My suspicion is the,

673
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,339
the companies that make these tools because they're on the hook

674
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,390
for the cost have gone to Home Depot and been like,

675
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,489
you need to lock this crap up in cages

676
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,579
because we're sick of eating this and Home Depot,

677
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:11,000
it's like we don't want to lock it up in cages because then we think we'll sell less.

678
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,550
Right. And so you end up with this

679
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,189
and my guess is that's what happened.

680
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,160
And so they probably came to this compromise of like, oh,

681
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,979
let's put a computer inside of it and that'll save us all.

682
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:19,920
And

683
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,170
it's,

684
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,199
it is.

685
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,829
II, I can't say either way, I'm going to assume it makes sense.

686
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:30,959
I mean, a lot of people make security decisions on incomplete data

687
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:35,800
or they let their emotions take over and they end up doing dumb things and,

688
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,150
and I can't, let's assume this isn't dumb.

689
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,880
I kind of think it might be, but let's assume it's not. Right.

690
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,780
Well, and I think part of it is if DeWalt gets known for,

691
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,650
you know, you steal their tools and they don't work,

692
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,319
then hopefully people stop stealing them.

693
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,880
-- And
-- however, however,

694
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,390
DeWalt could become known for, if you buy

695
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,800
-- DeWalt tools, they might not work.
-- Right?

696
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,979
And I think that's one of the dangers.

697
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,760
Yes. And so I think a lot of this boils down to from the consumer side.

698
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,140
The one thing we do very clearly understand is am

699
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,839
I just paying upfront for this and I own this or

700
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:08,344
there's some sort of expectation of a recurring charge because

701
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:10,375
there are things for which a recurring charge is ok,

702
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:11,525
like the newspaper,

703
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,984
right? You don't pay upfront for the newspaper, you pay monthly

704
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,074
Netflix. Exactly. Like,

705
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:18,055
yeah,

706
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:23,084
and there's things where there's ongoing costs that are expected,

707
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:24,925
like I buy a house and there's maintenance.

708
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:27,925
So I think that's part of it is that doctrine of, for sale.

709
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:29,564
Traditionally, when you buy something,

710
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:33,760
you own it and that's it, it's, it's like if it's a car, yes,

711
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,400
you have to put more gas and oil in it, but

712
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,170
you don't need to keep paying the original owner,

713
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,739
like some sort of fee or something for usage or for driving to another country.

714
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,400
Tesla is trying to do this with autopilot where they,

715
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,920
they want to charge you like 200 bucks a month or something for,

716
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,400
for fully autonomous mode.

717
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,280
And that's,

718
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:54,439
that goes towards that argument wrapped around.

719
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:54,989
Well,

720
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,599
what about a thing that has a software component that you

721
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,729
want to get better and you want to be upgraded?

722
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:04,515
-- Well,
-- and that has to be paid for by somebody like that costs money to develop.

723
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,275
I hear you.

724
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,035
This one's again,

725
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,354
I think the conversation just comes back to the fact that

726
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:12,074
power tools are really close to that line of like,

727
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:16,584
-- does it really, I mean,
-- and so I think the reality is because, and this is,

728
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:20,824
I think why IOT security in general is so terrible is people buy iot light bulbs

729
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,180
and

730
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,020
unless you pay a recurring subscription

731
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,300
or,

732
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,160
and this is what Apple does, which I find in

733
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:32,410
Apple bakes the cost of upgrades typically into the product,

734
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,420
which is one of the reasons their phones, for example, cost a lot more.

735
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,140
But a perfect example,

736
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:42,339
we just, my mother's laptop was full like 99% disuse and I'm, like,

737
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:45,209
looking around and I'm like, ok, well, before I start messing with this too much,

738
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:47,109
like, what version of Mac Os is it running?

739
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,599
It's like some really old version of Mac Os. I'm like, what the heck?

740
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,359
Like, why aren't you upgrading this moment? And,

741
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,790
and I look at, I'm, like, hang on

742
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,109
2011. Maca.

743
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:57,729
Oh, that, yeah. No. Ok. Ok.

744
00:31:57,739 --> 00:31:59,329
We're going to Apple dot Store and buying you a

745
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,979
new laptop because this thing is 10 years old.

746
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:05,060
Right. And she got 10 years of use out of this laptop.

747
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:07,010
Yeah, it costs more than say, a cheap Lenovo.

748
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,469
But she got 10 solid years of use out of this thing.

749
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,770
Right. And Apple built in that cost same thing with their phones

750
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,400
and as a consumer, I'm, I'm, I personally am.

751
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,449
I understand that and I'm much happier with it because I don't,

752
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,060
I hate being nickeled and dimed to death.

753
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,260
So, here's, here's the example I'll use because we need to wrap this one up.

754
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:25,949
World of Warcraft.

755
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,160
In theory.

756
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,709
I'm actually glad I never got into World

757
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,400
of Warcraft because I have a strong suspicion.

758
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,239
My life would have turned out very differently because I'm,

759
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,099
I'm one of those people that takes things to an extreme sometimes we'll say,

760
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,839
and

761
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,833
World of Warcraft would have, uh, yeah, I'd probably be homeless and unmarried.

762
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,503
But, but anyway, anyway,

763
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:45,833
and I had been fired from every job I ever had.

764
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:47,223
But so like,

765
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,522
my complaint with the World of Warcraft is always you had

766
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,753
to buy World of Warcraft and then pay them per month.

767
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:56,912
And it was like, I will pay you once or I will pay you per month,

768
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,593
but I don't want to do both.

769
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:02,432
But those servers legitimately cost money to run. And my understanding is they

770
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:06,286
-- did improve the game and add stuff to it.
-- Right. Yeah, they're constantly adding.

771
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:07,625
But you understand my point,

772
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:10,855
I would be happy to pay the monthly fee if I

773
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:14,515
didn't have to pay the whatever start up cost is it,

774
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:14,875
it was like

775
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:15,526
50 bucks back

776
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:19,345
then. You know what I mean? Like that was always my complaint, one or the other.

777
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:20,505
Not both.

778
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:27,015
All right, I have more questions and I, I have anything as usual, I guess

779
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,430
we get to watch and see

780
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:30,369
that's,

781
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:34,800
I just realized that, you know what, I would love a nutritional label on the product.

782
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,780
This product costs X upfront.

783
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:42,130
Here are, for example, the minimum recurring fees here are other, a great example.

784
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,650
This is iphones, right, iphones. Here's, there's an upfront cost boom done.

785
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,619
But realistically you only get five gigs of icloud data and people

786
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,130
fill that up in about a minute of their personal photos and videos

787
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,180
-- so
-- survive without that.

788
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,329
Well, you can get your contacts and stuff in there. But,

789
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,714
but what I'm saying is realistically if you have an

790
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,655
iphone and you have your photos and life on there.

791
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,935
You kind of do want to spend the extra two or three bucks a month on icloud storage.

792
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:06,685
It would be interesting to see,

793
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,313
like total cost of ownership,

794
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:11,043
assuming you'll have the phone for three years or whatever.

795
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:14,813
-- I mean, that'd be kind of neat
-- given regular usage patterns, given,

796
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:15,254
you know what I mean?

797
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,764
Like here's an actual realistic,

798
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,839
like, you know, cars do that. Right.

799
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:24,138
Um, I saw one brand of car because they're quite fuel efficient.

800
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:27,049
They were saying on average you're going to spend X amount of fuel for this

801
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,398
car for a year and it's like a pretty low number and it was like,

802
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:30,039
oh, that's nice.

803
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,539
-- That's true.
-- They do do that.

804
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:32,759
Yeah, interesting.

805
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:36,239
Anyway, if someone knows there's something doing this, let us know

806
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:37,467
and

807
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:41,248
cool. All right, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

808
