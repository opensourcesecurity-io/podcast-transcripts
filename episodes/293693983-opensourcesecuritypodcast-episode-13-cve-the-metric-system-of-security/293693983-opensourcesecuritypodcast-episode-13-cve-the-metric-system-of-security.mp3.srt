Hi, this is the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,300
-- and my partner in crime. Josh Bresser.
-- Holy cow. Welcome back, Kurt.

2
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,440
It's been, feels like forever since I've talked to you.

3
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:21,260
-- It has been what about 2, 2.5 weeks.
-- I did two shows without you,

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,430
which uh Dave was kind enough to help us out and, and we won't

5
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,489
comment on the, the quality of those shows compared to the quality of our shows.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,270
No, they were fantastic. Dave. Dave is great.

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,849
I'm, I'm joking that uh you are uh a, a worse cohos

8
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:36,389
than Dave,

9
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,000
but, but I won't say that a lot.

10
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:38,979
So,

11
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,560
anyway, anyway, welcome back, man. It's, it's great to have you back. I'm ecstatic.

12
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,880
And,

13
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,450
and so why don't

14
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:52,240
we've got kind of AAA crazy show we've got planned today because this is the reason

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,400
you weren't able to help us out and, and we mentioned it was

16
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,720
CV E.

17
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:58,080
Yeah.

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,330
So as we all know CV E is the common vulnerabilities and enumeration database,

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,770
which is a fancy way of saying

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,580
it's

21
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:06,699
a number,

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,540
a description of the problem and then

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,589
a bunch of reference links which are really handy because you know,

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,029
when you wanna go looking at something

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,089
-- you want to find out about it, how do we do that? We do it
-- with the web?

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,099
And uh what kind of problems are we talking about here?

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,620
-- Like like uh security
-- vulnerabilities, so

28
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,620
security vulnerabilities.

29
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:28,709
So, so for example, you know, CV E hyphen the year number, hyphen some random number.

30
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,690
The description is something like, you know,

31
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,599
a buffer overflow in project version 1.3 0.4 and earlier

32
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,199
allows remote Attackers to cause remote code execution on the web server,

33
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,529
whatever stuff like that.

34
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,129
And it's really handy because as you know,

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,160
the industry currently deals with, you know,

36
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,290
thousands of security vulnerabilities a year.

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,379
Uh and the reality is globally, you know,

38
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:53,629
we're dealing with millions of these things and,

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,629
you know, it's, it's really, I mean,

40
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:59,860
how do customers know that stuff got fixed or that they fixed it properly, you know.

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,739
And so with CV E and this tracking system,

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,180
uh it becomes quite a bit easier, especially with vendors like Red Hat

43
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,660
where, you know, we have over 100 products.

44
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,479
So, so let's let's back this up. Just a tad is

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,020
you and I both have a,

46
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,419
we'll say special

47
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,949
history with, with CV E putting this word

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,830
special in quote. So, so first of all,

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,550
for those of you who maybe aren't familiar with this is the CV ID is something that,

50
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:33,630
that the identifier is literally the letter CV E dash year

51
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:37,169
of 2016 being the current year or 2015 was last year,

52
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,600
2017 will be next year as these things tend to go.

53
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,220
And then a, a number of integers

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,710
that follow that is kind of the unique identifier

55
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,089
and those integers are

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,039
starting at 0001 for the year and they can go to infinity.

57
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,919
There is no end. And so I'm confident

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,690
that we will not run out of CV E I DS

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,080
in any given year.

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,979
I won't say I'm 100% certain.

61
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:04,610
But,

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,330
well, I, I think we're ok.

63
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:09,690
So this is important because a lot of people see

64
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,570
this stuff and they don't necessarily know what it means.

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,529
And, and so the, the fun fact, some, a bit of trivia here is

66
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,039
a long time ago.

67
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,279
They weren't all CV E I DS,

68
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,990
there were can candidates

69
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,309
and what would happen.

70
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,380
And this is, this is so crazy to think about in, in today's universe,

71
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,970
an issue was assigned a candidate.

72
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,789
So it's like can dot dash, you know, year dash

73
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:33,710
ID.

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,940
And then

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,910
the CV E board would vote on every

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,899
CV E to promote it from candidate to CV E.

77
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,830
And you can imagine even back then they couldn't deal with them all. And so it's

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,009
someday I, I forget when this happened.

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,820
Uh I have to hassle Steve Christie, maybe I know he would know,

80
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,929
but they decided no more candidates it's just all CV E I DS

81
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,690
from this point forward and then hence it was all CV E dash,

82
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,449
which is also funny because

83
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,179
any vendor that had been working with this for a long time now had a bunch of cans

84
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,899
and a bunch of CV ES and all of a sudden everything was switched to CV E.

85
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,210
So you kind of had to go back and,

86
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,630
and posthumously change all your, your candidates to CBES in your,

87
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,869
your databases and whatnot.

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,320
So it was,

89
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,140
man, those are crazy days.

90
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah.

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,459
Well, I remember those days, well, when you know,

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,299
like one or 2000 CV S per year was like, I mean,

93
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,950
that was an amazing year for a lot of vulnerabilities.

94
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,649
Um And, you know, now that's like a normal month

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,029
and, and that goes to what a lot of the, the CV E meeting I was at last week was about is

96
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:40,130
we're essentially uh the meeting itself was a bit of the CV board meeting,

97
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,329
but more importantly,

98
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:44,820
it was a bunch of companies and entities that are what are

99
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,350
called CNAs AC N A is a CV E numbering authority.

100
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,239
And the idea is simply put, um you have this large company called Mir

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,600
that runs

102
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:58,109
the CV project and the ultimate, you know, database of truth.

103
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,890
Uh but they obviously don't do all the work that would be kind of silly.

104
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,739
Um So the CV numbering authorities are large companies like say, Red Hat Microsoft,

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,230
you know, IB MH P

106
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,630
uh that ship software

107
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,339
and when they

108
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,450
find a security vulnerability

109
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,130
or have a security vulnerability reported to them, they,

110
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,649
they themselves can assign it a CV number.

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,079
Right.

112
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,510
And then they

113
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,279
use that CV number for tracking purposes.

114
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,100
It goes into the advisory, it goes into the email announcements.

115
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,059
Um,

116
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,209
and then ultimately, in the past, the way it worked

117
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,250
is

118
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,730
that's it, that's all that happened, right? Nothing was passed back to Mir

119
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,679
and the, the one true database.

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,200
Um And so of course,

121
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,170
the problem there was or one of the problems was that

122
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,579
Miter's Database was not always complete or up to date.

123
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,410
Um So the good news is that's going to be changing now, Mir

124
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,160
uh is going to be having

125
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,260
CNAs pass back the information about CVS.

126
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,350
So the CV number, the description and the reference links

127
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,380
and that will be entered into the CV database.

128
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,220
And hopefully, you know,

129
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,260
we're looking at this being updated daily or more often than daily.

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,000
Whereas in the past, you know, uh

131
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,690
Dirty Cow is a good example.

132
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,730
Um you know, dirty cow was a pretty complicated issue. Mier

133
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,339
had to do some research to make sure they fully understood it.

134
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,260
They had to write up the description, they had to do all this work and it took them,

135
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:15,630
I think two or three weeks

136
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,459
after Dirty Cow officially became public for it to show up in the database.

137
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,290
Yuch, that's like two years

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,910
in

139
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:24,609
years today.

140
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah. So, so the good news is essentially

141
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,440
the people issuing these CV S will be able to

142
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,059
pass the description back to Miter in.

143
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,540
I'm not gonna say real time but very close to real time.

144
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:40,829
Uh And the way they're gonna be doing that is basically the same process that the,

145
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,709
an open source project called the DWF. The Distributed Weakness Filing project

146
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,720
does CV assignments and CNAs.

147
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,510
In that essentially, there's gonna be a

148
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,339
JSON file

149
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,260
and essentially you'll create like a little

150
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,529
JSON file with information about the CV, like the CV number,

151
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,519
you know the description,

152
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,029
uh the products that are affected

153
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,309
and so on and so forth, you know, reference links, um

154
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:03,269
things like that,

155
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,269
this will be passed uh over to Mir

156
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,149
who will then update their database.

157
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,239
The benefit here, for example is when AC N A issues a CV E number,

158
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,450
if it's already a public issue,

159
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,959
they can just pass that description and the information back to Mir.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,609
And so that,

161
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,459
that Miter CV database gets updated very quickly.

162
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,010
Uh And another big benefit,

163
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:26,739
for example is that every because the reality is everybody that uses CV

164
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,250
uh gets their CV S from two places, number one, the vendors that they use.

165
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,529
So for example, Red Hat customers see CV S being issued by Red Hat, you know,

166
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,329
in our security advisories and our email advisories and all that.

167
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,450
And

168
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,649
then the second source primarily

169
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,750
is the miter database

170
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,920
unless you also want some extra information, like say the vulnerability rating.

171
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:48,880
In which case you,

172
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,690
you go to this place called the National Vulnerability Database run by

173
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,000
NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

174
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:55,510
-- These
-- guys

175
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,559
-- love acronyms,
-- don't they? Oh they do, they do.

176
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:59,920
And so

177
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,559
nvd.n.org uh

178
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,730
pulls their data from mir.

179
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,910
So uh the, the problem has been in past, you know, is,

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,950
is if something doesn't show up in the Miter database,

181
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,320
even if like a company fixed it and made it fully public,

182
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
you know, if it doesn't show up in the

183
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,260
MOR database for a week or two, then it doesn't show up in the NVD database,

184
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,339
you know, and for example,

185
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,200
then the federal government officially doesn't really know about it.

186
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,700
Sure.

187
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,019
Well, in,

188
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,760
in the NVD database is also really cool because I know a number

189
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:30,089
of kind of vulnerability analysis and scanning

190
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,099
products rely on it because they provide

191
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,989
things like CV SS.

192
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,030
Are they doing version three now or still version two? They are doing three?

193
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,460
So CV SSV three scores for these issues and granted

194
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,250
there's a lot of issues and they don't always get them 100% right?

195
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,280
But they're close enough.

196
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:47,559
I

197
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:47,799
mean, you

198
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:47,940
know

199
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:48,119
why?

200
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,109
Because they're not giving the information,

201
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,590
right. You'll notice a lot, there's a lot of CV E vulnerabilities from,

202
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,969
well, typically not so much open source vendors because with open source vendors,

203
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,599
it's really easy to know what the problem is, right?

204
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:01,570
You just look at the code

205
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,349
uh but with closed source vendors,

206
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,869
sometimes they'll have CV S that literally say something like

207
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,590
an unknown flaw

208
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,260
is exploited through an unknown.

209
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,109
Yeah, with like an unknown impact through an unknown exploitation avenue.

210
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,130
But you know, this version of the product is vulnerable and they,

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,229
they say they fixed it in this other version of the product.

212
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,630
So

213
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,359
honestly, that's better than nothing.

214
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,549
They should just give those a, a CV SS score of 10

215
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,770
and then say we'll rescore it if you give us the info,

216
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,059
we we talked about that a bit and the problem is if they score something high,

217
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,090
they they

218
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,650
typically go to the worst case scenario because let's face it,

219
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,570
that's how security people operate, right?

220
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,890
If I don't know something, I'm going to assume the worst

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,820
and the problem there is is so that they do end up scoring stuff

222
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,400
higher than it probably should be scored and it causes people to freak out,

223
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:48,690
you know,

224
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,140
so there is actually a real cost for that.

225
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,400
Now, that's another part of the good news is mir

226
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,549
is going to be requiring their CV numbering authorities

227
00:09:58,169 --> 00:09:59,590
to pass back

228
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,340
data. Now that involves obviously the CV number and the description,

229
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,599
the impact of the vulnerability.

230
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:08,210
So like what is the impact, you know, is it code execution?

231
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,830
Is it a cross site scripting, you know,

232
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,799
is it a

233
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,739
-- denial of service. These are all very different.
-- What happens though.

234
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,059
I mean, there are security flaws that depending upon how you use them,

235
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,890
-- determine what the impact is,
-- where you would list multiple impacts. I see.

236
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,109
OK. OK. Right.

237
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,369
So yeah, I mean, that's a great example like there's, well, I mean,

238
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,409
every single time we see a um

239
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,570
uh you know, like a buffer overflow,

240
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,679
it it almost always can cause the program to crash

241
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,419
but can it actually be exploited for code execution? Well, that,

242
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,789
that's a different story, right? And that

243
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,099
the case is almost always, yes, they can be because you know Murphy's Law, right?

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,200
It's

245
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,770
complicated.

246
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,280
Yeah, but I mean, well, I'm I'm a pessimist.

247
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:55,640
Ideally long term, one of the goals is to have better quality data in the CV database,

248
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,789
right?

249
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,700
Because the reality is this is what

250
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,929
virtually all the security processes in the world run on nowadays.

251
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,340
If you're consuming

252
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,450
these vendor software and you wanna track the

253
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,049
security of it and you wanna patch it and

254
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,750
update it and make sure you're patched and updated

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,630
and you want your scanner to stop complaining,

256
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,169
you need to be tracking this data and using it.

257
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,289
Um And then the other goal is to scale this right.

258
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,159
Uh The dirty secret is um you know, Miter

259
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,900
does the CV project, you know, under the auspices of the US government.

260
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,669
And so obviously, it has a US centric focus, right?

261
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,080
That's what the US government uses

262
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,799
typically US software, right?

263
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:36,469
They're not running uh like a lot of Chinese word processors or whatever.

264
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,599
Um

265
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,429
Yeah.

266
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,400
Um

267
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,359
And so that's a challenge, right? Because the,

268
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,789
you know, the, the software industry used to be real simple.

269
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,239
It was America basically

270
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,309
the majority of it like 2530 years ago, commercially.

271
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,479
Um But now, I mean, holy jeez, like the, the software development houses in,

272
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,210
you know, Asia, I mean,

273
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,049
-- South America,
-- not even just that man.

274
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:57,869
I mean, this is, we could,

275
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,809
we could probably spend a whole show talking about supply chain issues.

276
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,270
But I mean, you have to think about

277
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,750
any system probably is running source code from more than

278
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,210
20 different countries just because you've got third parties,

279
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,830
have third parties, have third parties,

280
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,070
but then also you've got hardware involved.

281
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,349
You've, I mean, it's madness when you really think about

282
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,919
the fact that say, you know,

283
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:23,460
you and I discussing anything right now probably has literally thousands of people

284
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,340
have touched the, the hardware and the software and,

285
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:28,469
and the countries involved in it.

286
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:31,890
-- It's, it's mind boggling how complicated
-- everything

287
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
really, you know, in the last

288
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,554
five years or 10 years uh has occurred is, you know,

289
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,974
traditionally everything had software to some degree,

290
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,914
like your toaster had a little chip in it to control the dial and the,

291
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,255
the toasting stuff, right?

292
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,825
But your toaster wasn't connected to the internet.

293
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:47,395
It is now, right?

294
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:48,325
And that's the thing, right?

295
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,354
Like if you have software running on a device that has no network connectivity,

296
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,799
you know, it's probably safe because to, to hack into it or to muck with it,

297
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,059
you have to physically go there and, and muck around with it.

298
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,960
But as we've learned from like the Marai Botnet

299
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,760
and all that,

300
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,419
you know, when you connect stuff to the internet and it's not secure,

301
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,500
somebody is going to be helpful and take over it for

302
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,250
you so that they can use it in a botnet.

303
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:08,809
Right?

304
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,500
You know,

305
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,250
and I mean, we're seeing everything, you know, I was like, oh,

306
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,250
what was that stupid thing?

307
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,890
I saw that was internet

308
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,500
connected the other day. Um,

309
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,090
oh, which kitchen appliance? Was it

310
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,750
all of them? Oh.

311
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,070
yeah, basically.

312
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,530
Uh, well, no,

313
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,489
the microwave I get because you could put some food

314
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,640
in it and microwave it when you get home.

315
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,929
But I think it was a mixer.

316
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,750
I'm just

317
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,570
exactly right.

318
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,890
Like a fridge. I, I

319
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,090
guess I get because you can see the weather on your fridge but

320
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,979
looking out the window is too much more.

321
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,250
Um, but, you know, a lot of the stuff we're attaching to the internet now

322
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,729
is becoming stuff that could, you know,

323
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:47,450
if it's taken over by an attacker would be very

324
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,340
d so a great example being self driving car,

325
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:49,840
right?

326
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:53,450
A self driving car being taken over by somebody who wants to, you know,

327
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,289
cause a bit of a ruckus that, that would be very bad.

328
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:57,700
And so,

329
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,289
you know, the challenges with CV is we've got this huge global software industry

330
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,729
and outside of the English speaking North American and a bit of Europe,

331
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,580
they, they really don't use CV. And I, I don't know how they track vulnerabilities

332
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,729
or if they do.

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,890
Interesting. So that would be saying, you know, folks out there, if you have any idea

334
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:22,010
what happens in, in say non English speaking countries, we, we'd love to know if,

335
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,080
if there's something going on.

336
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,239
Uh

337
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,070
I think though obviously

338
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,309
given the fact that CV E is so ingrained

339
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,070
in the current industry, at least in the

340
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,309
say North American region and, and a good portion of Europe.

341
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:40,349
I think the goal for you guys is really to kind of bring it everywhere. Right.

342
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,659
Exactly.

343
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,919
So essentially what we're looking at

344
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,929
is a Federation model, right? So

345
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,179
currently we have one Star Trek or their favorite,

346
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,229
pretty much the United Federation is security.

347
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,719
Yeah, it's like DNS. So we've, we've got the old sort of

348
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,400
special CNAs that, you know, happened a long time ago, like Red Hat Microsoft IBM,

349
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:01,989
those guys.

350
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:06,840
And now we have a new hierarchy called uh for the open source world, right?

351
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:10,140
The the and that runs under the distributed weakness filing project.

352
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:15,510
Let's stop there for a second and let's talk about DWF because

353
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:21,080
I cannot stress the importance of this project. Nor the fact that you created it,

354
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,580
it is your project and you should be insanely proud of yourself for that.

355
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,479
And so let's start with the name

356
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,700
DWF. How did you get those three letters?

357
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,619
-- It's CV plus one.
-- Oh, my goodness. That's amazing.

358
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,239
I also realized the other day and this blew me away is, it's,

359
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,520
uh dad and then my kids names and that was unintentional.

360
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,690
That's it is. It is. Wow. That's amazing.

361
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,700
That's fun.

362
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,830
Oh, my goodness.

363
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,359
And the funny thing is I've been using this for a year and not realize that

364
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,419
it

365
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,859
is. So this is, uh, there, there is,

366
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,929
there's a word for this. I forget the name of it. But

367
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:55,619
serendipity, you can. No, no, no.

368
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,770
You see things that aren't really there right where you can look at words or,

369
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,229
-- or this
-- is

370
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:00,679
a big,

371
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,090
uh,

372
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,640
you see a fox and you think it's Bigfoot

373
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,299
might

374
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:06,650
be.

375
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:09,320
So,

376
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,250
and to be honest, the, the, the, the idea for the DWF, I,

377
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,849
I'll be honest, I just, I took, you know,

378
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,349
the open source models that I know work in this case.

379
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:18,809
Um,

380
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,010
one of the most successful ones being the Linux kernel

381
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,179
-- and, and just let's do that. Well,
-- what does that mean? OK. So, so you create DWF? And

382
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,260
why

383
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,780
did you go down this path? Why did you decide DWF needed to be a thing?

384
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:37,510
So two big reasons is number one, we needed better

385
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,049
standards and tooling and

386
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:44,700
you know, some data formats uh around the CV E data.

387
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,299
And number two, structurally,

388
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,099
we needed to distribute it and scale out. So,

389
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,859
one of the challenges I find in the security world is, you know,

390
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:56,500
we tend to operate on not trusting things, right?

391
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,530
That that's literally our job is to not trust

392
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,239
things and to make sure that they're correct.

393
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,290
Conversely, you look at something like the Linux kernel and they operate in a,

394
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,000
in a high degree of trust,

395
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,140
right? Linux, uh sorry, Linus has, you know, trusted subsystem maintainers,

396
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:12,578
but, you know,

397
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:16,479
in turn, have maintainers that in turn have guys actually writing code

398
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:19,458
and essentially, you know, it's, it's distributed trust.

399
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,848
So Linus trusts his lieutenants, his lieutenants, trust their sergeants,

400
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,128
their sergeants, trust their,

401
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:25,568
you know, the guys working for them.

402
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,538
And this allows, I mean,

403
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,678
because how many patches is Linus accepting into the average colonel release?

404
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:30,879
Now?

405
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,529
It's, you know, it's in the thousands, it's,

406
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:35,629
it's clearly more than he's actually reviewing.

407
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:35,889
Right.

408
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,808
-- Exactly.
-- There isn't enough time

409
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:38,448
in

410
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:39,848
the months

411
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,198
to deal with them all.

412
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:42,400
Exactly.

413
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:47,829
So, you know, if, if the DWF ends up doing hopefully tens of thousands of CV S per year,

414
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,699
you know, that's, that's hundreds per day,

415
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,739
right. No one person can or should review that.

416
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,510
And so the idea, you know, is to scale it out to trusted people, um,

417
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,329
and not only to trusted people but to trusted people who have, you know,

418
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,800
specific expertise.

419
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,369
So, so

420
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,319
trust these people, is it like uh I mail you $20 and,

421
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,599
and now I'm a trusted organization or

422
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,280
it's even simpler than that.

423
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,859
Uh Number one, you can already have proven trust.

424
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,199
Uh So for example, yourself is a great example, right?

425
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,280
You have already assigned how many hundreds of CV S on

426
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,900
thousands.

427
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,030
And, and,

428
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,760
you know, we should probably talk about that too.

429
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,609
Is, is a lot of people don't know, is so for a long time, Miter

430
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:27,239
was,

431
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,400
uh I, I don't want to use the word closed,

432
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,719
but they were,

433
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,780
I, I guess very structured might be the right way, right?

434
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,780
And so dealing with the, the speed and madness of open source was very difficult.

435
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,839
And so what happened eventually was

436
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,219
I became

437
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:48,010
the CN A for the OS S security mailing list essentially. And then I assigned,

438
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,459
uh I,

439
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:52,420
I remember Steve Christie told me this one time was Miter was obviously the

440
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,849
number one CN A and I was number two for a long time.

441
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,540
And, and proudly enough,

442
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:03,329
I had a lower rate of error than Miter did, which pleased me immensely,

443
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,189
but not that, that, that really matters. But anyway, I did that for a couple of years

444
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,550
and then I moved on to do some other things and you took

445
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,630
over for me as the new open source security CN A and then eventually

446
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,469
Miter kind of

447
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,000
rearranged the way things work internally and

448
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,010
they became the open source security.

449
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,640
CN A.

450
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:24,270
Yeah.

451
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,170
And that's, they're, they're basically miters back to being the open source, uh,

452
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,239
security CN A.

453
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,430
Uh, you know,

454
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,069
with the goal being to transition all of

455
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,800
that over to the distributed weakness filing project,

456
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,469
uh, you know,

457
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,400
uh, and primarily there what we need, what I need there is to, you know,

458
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,640
get a bunch of technology in place to essentially make these, uh,

459
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,359
assignments go faster.

460
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,380
Uh And the other thing is to have, you know, CV, mentors to scale out and have,

461
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,489
you know, dozens of people who can

462
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,719
look at an issue and say,

463
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,670
is this a security vulnerability? Yes or no,

464
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,000
you know, because there's a lot of issues that look like a security vulnerability,

465
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,869
but they might technically not be, they might actually be like

466
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,369
security related in the sense of it's a hardening issue.

467
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,079
And yeah, we should probably tweak that a bit,

468
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,599
but it's not strictly speaking of vulnerability.

469
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,839
And then once we've established that it is a vulnerability,

470
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,400
then the second thing they need to do is apply what we call the CV E counting rules.

471
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,979
So in past CV E has taken

472
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,420
a somewhat pragmatic approach to counting vulnerabilities,

473
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,729
right?

474
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:26,170
We don't want to count every single individual vulnerability separately.

475
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,770
Um because there's cases where, you know, somebody goes through a PHP application

476
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,609
and finds 50 instances of cross site scripting.

477
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,290
And is there value in having 50 separate CV S for those 50 vulnerabilities,

478
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,339
especially when the,

479
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:42,130
-- the project fixes all of them in the next release
-- or

480
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,390
even in a single commit in a lot of cases.

481
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,689
Right.

482
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,119
Yeah.

483
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,829
So in that case,

484
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,040
what we tend to do is there's some rules around

485
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,829
merging and splitting issues into sort of buckets of CV.

486
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,380
-- Si
-- really just,

487
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:59,140
I have this like flood of memories back into my mind from when I did this talking to,

488
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,310
to, to miter about all that stuff I'd forgotten much about.

489
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,479
And it's honestly, it's really simple. It basically boils down to

490
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:08,979
you want to separate out the vulnerabilities by

491
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,979
like what is the vulnerability, you know,

492
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,020
buffer overflow versus cross site scripting?

493
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,989
Because, you know, those are two very different vulnerabilities and impacts.

494
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,160
Um And then the second main thing is by which version it affects, you know,

495
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,869
because if you have two buffer overflow

496
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,540
vulnerabilities and one affects version 1.0 through 1.2

497
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,859
and the other one affects version 1.1 through 1.2. You know,

498
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,459
that's good to know for the people running one point. Oh, they're not as vulnerable.

499
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:34,939
Yeah, definitely.

500
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,569
And that's basically what that, that counting rule stuff boils down to. And it's,

501
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,069
it's just, it's a pragmatic approach to sort of collect things up. And

502
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,189
uh because the other thing is to,

503
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,150
that's important to remember is CV,

504
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,160
technically speaking is about counting vulnerabilities,

505
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,750
but where it really becomes important for most people is in tracking fixes,

506
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,280
you know,

507
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,290
because, I mean, it's nice to have this catalog of vulnerabilities.

508
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,910
Uh But, you know,

509
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,420
so we're vulnerable now,

510
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:01,989
right?

511
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,709
And so the idea is by making the vulnerabilities trackable, then you can,

512
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,310
you know,

513
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,300
you as an administrator can say, well,

514
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,849
I implemented this firewall rule which blocks CV

515
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,189
E whatever or I removed the software package.

516
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:14,489
Right?

517
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,719
That's,

518
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:15,959
that's one of my favorite ways to fix a

519
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,890
vulnerability is just to get rid of the software.

520
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,589
You know, because, well, quite often, you know,

521
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,130
you'll find software that you're like, well,

522
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,479
I don't really need that software and it's got this vulnerability.

523
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:24,790
So do we really need it?

524
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,069
Um, you know, or you or you fix it or patch it

525
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:29,290
and then, you know,

526
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,250
you have your little check box and you can show your boss and everybody's happy.

527
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,369
The auditors are happy. Your scanning tool is happy.

528
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:39,780
So the idea really being is that I wanna divorce the technical side

529
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,800
of security vulnerability analysis

530
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,209
from the process side of simply assigning it an identifier.

531
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,449
Yeah, I think that that makes a lot of sense.

532
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,140
So, so the idea basically is to have, you know, a bunch of people who can,

533
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,339
they know which questions to ask and they

534
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,540
basically know what the answers should sound like.

535
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,479
Um because one thing too that started to happen is people have

536
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:05,260
started to try and shop around things that are not really vulnerabilities

537
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,979
and they've tried to get them CV numbers so that

538
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:09,930
they can essentially use that to pad their resume.

539
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,290
Uh,

540
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,660
so I don't know if you remember, but the infamous,

541
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,439
um, the infamous Apache, I think it's their 404 error page by default.

542
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,300
Prints out the URL that you tried to access, right?

543
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,719
It says you tried to access this and it doesn't exist. I'm terribly sorry.

544
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:29,469
Uh, and there's been numerous people that have tried to shop that around as a

545
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,910
CV E worth vulnerability

546
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,569
because the other thing to remember now too is there's money in this, right?

547
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,790
There's bug bounties where if you have,

548
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,560
you know, if you come to a bug bounty with a vulnerability, they might say

549
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:42,849
no, it's not

550
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,030
and send you away.

551
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,349
But if you come to them with a vulnerability that has a CV number assigned,

552
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,630
it's much harder for them to send you away,

553
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,310
you know, without you get, getting some money potentially.

554
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,530
So,

555
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,729
you know, it's important,

556
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,369
uh, like any system where money is involved, you know,

557
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,089
people are going to try and game it and abuse it.

558
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,989
Yeah, definitely.

559
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,770
Well, and I think one of the other interesting things is,

560
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,219
and this is something we've had to deal with in the past is

561
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:06,459
there are non

562
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:10,130
issues that get CV E I DS for whatever reason

563
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,170
and then

564
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,770
you can dispute that which puts it into kind of disputed status,

565
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,010
but it still means that the organization that has had the CV E assigned against, it

566
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,130
has to do some level of effort

567
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,459
to deal with it

568
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,359
even if it isn't really an issue.

569
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,819
And obviously that carries a certain amount of

570
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,479
pain and suffering that comes with it.

571
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,640
Now, now your automated system, do you have anything planned to deal with that?

572
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,209
Well, so basically, well, when I say automated, it's not fully automated,

573
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:40,119
it's just more of the data collection and some basic validation is automated,

574
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,400
you know.

575
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,060
So the goal is essentially

576
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:47,060
to get people creating high quality CV request because a high quality CV request

577
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:51,560
takes seconds to deal with, you know, a high quality CV request looks like

578
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,050
there's a cross site scripting in this project in this version.

579
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,939
And here's the actual,

580
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:58,010
you know, get

581
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,020
repo link with the vulnerable code and even better.

582
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,020
Here's a link to the patch, you know, and the patch is just wrapping it in

583
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:06,739
html, special cares, right? So it fixes it

584
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,040
a CV request like that, you know, especially where upstream has fixed it

585
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:13,569
is super easy to, you know, deal with takes seconds.

586
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,099
And then I've had other ones where I've gone back and forth for

587
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,270
a period of weeks with the report of trying to figure out,

588
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,000
you know, what is the actual impact of this?

589
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,819
How does this actually a problem?

590
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,839
And so that basically coming back to your question of how

591
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,180
do you trust these people to do CV S correctly?

592
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,260
Like I said, number one, they've already shown that they can, and number two,

593
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:35,420
they will have to take some minimal level of training essentially around, you know,

594
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,339
the CV, is this a vulnerability or not?

595
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,989
And what are the counting rules?

596
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,030
And then essentially we will,

597
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,500
what they do has their email address attached to it as the CV assigner, right?

598
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:50,920
And so essentially, then, you know, if, for example,

599
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,170
we get somebody who issues 100 CV s and like 10 of them end

600
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,349
up being disputed or 20 of them end up being rejected because they're wrong.

601
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:00,290
Then we know that that person either needs to be retrained or,

602
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,689
or removed from the system.

603
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,829
Um And the reality is the majority of people myself included,

604
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,869
we typically have an error rate of under 1%

605
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:10,170
you know, which I feel is a reasonably,

606
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,530
that's an ok error, right?

607
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:12,270
And you know,

608
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,989
that that's actually something really important as well is we

609
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,670
are notoriously bad at this insecurity is people make mistakes.

610
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,150
People are going to make mistakes when they make mistakes,

611
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,800
like do not beat them to death with a shoe because they made a mistake,

612
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,790
like you accept it and you move on.

613
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,290
But yes, if their error rate is 75% like that person is clearly misguided

614
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,479
or, or just a bad person, you know, one or the other. And so they need to be dealt with.

615
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,790
And so that's a big part of what CV is moving towards is a bit more,

616
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,199
having a bit more data. So the DWF, we actually collect a bit more metadata.

617
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,650
Uh For example, we, we have who requested the CV.

618
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:48,390
Because

619
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,140
to put it on,

620
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,050
there are people that request CV S and they always request them perfectly.

621
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:53,819
You know,

622
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,790
a great example being Jeremy Ellison from the Samba project, right?

623
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,989
When he comes to me and says, I need a CV, I'm like, sure, because he,

624
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,349
he and typically when he needs one, he, you know, it's real

625
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,619
um or like Tristan from the open stock project, right?

626
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,709
These guys have done this enough, they have enough experience.

627
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,069
They, they just, you know, they know how to do it.

628
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,250
Sure. Sure. Sure.

629
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:16,329
Well, and let's face it too. I mean, when you're requesting a CV E,

630
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,670
if, if you are doing it right,

631
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,310
you're going to have less work for yourself as well because you aren't going to say,

632
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,290
give me all of this extra information.

633
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,510
I need to prove this is or isn't what you say it is

634
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,589
exactly.

635
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,339
Like I remember a great example is um I don't know if

636
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:35,589
you know of or heard of the uh the China 360 guys,

637
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,569
three sixty.cn.

638
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:41,680
It's a company that makes hardware, wireless equipment and routers and stuff.

639
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,329
Uh And when they initially started, their CV requests were terrible

640
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,089
and then after about six months, they got really good at them

641
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:51,969
and the other thing that happened is that

642
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,400
it's interesting is the quality of their request,

643
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,770
like the stuff they were finding, you know, these are the,

644
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,079
if you read open source security, the mailing list,

645
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,250
um you'll recognize these guys because they're the

646
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,680
guys that keep finding flaws with Zen and,

647
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:04,000
you know,

648
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,819
uh Queen,

649
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,670
right? And these are like really high quality bugs.

650
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,459
These are not like a cross site scripting error.

651
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:12,890
These are like breaking into the hypervisor or, you know,

652
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:16,780
causing the entire system to flip out and, you know, crash.

653
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:17,449
Um

654
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,869
So it's, it's really obvious that from a maturity point of view, they,

655
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,300
they've really matured and gotten good at this.

656
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,790
Well, I mean, let's face it too. I think the vast majority of people,

657
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,469
they want to do a good job and they want to do it right.

658
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,469
It's just in many instances they didn't know what to do.

659
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,459
And so

660
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:37,739
II I think this is, this is one of the disservices I see,

661
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,199
especially in the security industry and in open source

662
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:42,050
to a degree as well is the fact that a

663
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:45,750
new person shows up and they do dumb things as new people tend to do

664
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:49,619
and they get driven away instead of properly helped. And

665
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,339
it's,

666
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:53,000
that's kind of a shame always is when that happened.

667
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,530
And so this is one of the things actually,

668
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm kind of secretly hopeful with DWF is that

669
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,300
you can build kind of a AAA community of reasonable people. We'll say

670
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,209
that

671
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,739
is willing to have patience

672
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,819
with these folks when they show up.

673
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,140
Well, and that's one of the dirty secrets, right?

674
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,900
The uh up until recently, basically, there were two ways to get a CV number.

675
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,939
Either you came from the outside and asked for one

676
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,199
and you had to know how to do that

677
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,819
or number two, you were a fully fledged, credentialed CV,

678
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,150
numbering authority and there was nothing in between,

679
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:29,189
-- you know, there was no intermediate step.
-- I remember

680
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:33,969
a lot of people went back when I was AC N A. People would come and be like, I, I need this.

681
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:34,660
And there were,

682
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,000
you know,

683
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,140
because Miter had very strict rules about what we could or couldn't assign to.

684
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,910
And it was like, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm not supposed to help you

685
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,780
and then they'd say things like, but I've emailed me

686
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,729
six times and they still haven't gotten back to me. And I'm like, I,

687
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,569
you know, I really want to, but,

688
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,930
you know, this is what it is

689
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:51,689
now. Well,

690
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:51,920
that's

691
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:52,239
actually,

692
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,130
so,

693
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,349
so DWF,

694
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,520
are you only focusing on open

695
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,099
source software or are you willing to work with closed source vendors as well?

696
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,989
-- Uh The
-- DWF mandate

697
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:07,300
uh currently uh essentially as chartered by Miter is we are strictly open source.

698
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,630
Um Now that's, that's brought some interesting questions because for example,

699
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,099
there's

700
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,660
a lot of organizations that, you know,

701
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,959
I would call a hybrid where they do close source and open source.

702
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:17,920
You know,

703
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:21,280
I mean, the, the reality is virtually every

704
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,079
software vendor now has, you know, something on github.

705
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:27,550
At least one thing, some library they use or something they produce.

706
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,040
Not just that. Right. It's, it's crazy.

707
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,510
I,

708
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,140
I wonder if there are any software projects on the

709
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,800
planet anymore that don't contain some sort of open source.

710
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,640
I bet the answer is

711
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,089
probably not. At least nothing that matters.

712
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,219
That guy that wrote his own operating system in Assembler a few years back.

713
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,040
Was it open

714
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,290
source?

715
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:49,709
Oh, I think you might open source.

716
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:50,589
Yeah. Good point.

717
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:54,630
But that's like, cause yeah, that's the thing to do.

718
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,609
Like a clean room implementation of closed source nowadays would be.

719
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:03,170
-- Wow, where would you even begin? Let's face
-- it. What's the value

720
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,170
in not just reusing something that already exists.

721
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:10,069
There's, there is no value and well, let's face it too. So

722
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,770
uh some years back which you and I remember being old men now is

723
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,260
licensing was the scary thing because it was like, oh,

724
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,290
I'm gonna include open source in my product now.

725
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,250
I have to open source, my whole product and you know,

726
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,079
everything's running down whatever and, and people didn't quite understand it.

727
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,989
But I think we've reached a point now where

728
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,609
generally speaking,

729
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:33,670
what open source means and how these licenses work is fairly well understood.

730
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,959
And so I don't think it's near as scary for anybody. I mean,

731
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,979
it's, I mean, heck, what Microsoft and the Linux Foundation, right?

732
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:42,839
It's like these people are starting to understand

733
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:45,680
what this stuff means and it's not the demon

734
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,589
that it once was thought to be.

735
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,729
Yeah. No, I, I think basically, you know, based on the empirical evidence,

736
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,890
you know, nobody died,

737
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,449
nobody had to like open source, their crazy huge close source thing and,

738
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,099
you know, things worked out. Ok.

739
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,140
Um

740
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,729
And yeah, so like I said, one of my goals with this

741
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,770
is to, first of all, provide sort of a, a

742
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:11,760
ramp up from going from requesting CV S to becoming a full CN A

743
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,709
and, you know, have some intermediate steps for people

744
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,619
and then the most important thing. Secondly, is to

745
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,420
provide a way to bring people in

746
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,469
and,

747
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:22,270
you know, educate them and train them and,

748
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:22,989
and

749
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:24,319
have a mentor, right?

750
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:28,069
Because one challenge I find too is a lot of people I've, I've spoken to,

751
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,109
they don't want to do CV.

752
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,140
S because they're afraid they'll make a mistake. And I'm like,

753
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:31,500
huh,

754
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,380
you know, like, have you seen what I've done?

755
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,390
Um

756
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,569
Right.

757
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,579
And you know, but like you said,

758
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,489
the problem is you make a mistake in the security community

759
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,589
and the security community tends to throw shoes at you,

760
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,180
right? Because if you're unlucky,

761
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,650
they throw

762
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:44,930
shoes

763
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:47,650
and, you know, and, and the reality is, it's a challenge, right?

764
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,739
Because in the security community,

765
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,979
like an off by one buffer overflow or a

766
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:54,170
single missing character or a single wrongly typed character,

767
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,849
you know, can have a really significant security impact and cause a lot of problems.

768
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:58,650
And, you know, and that's,

769
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,849
that is how a lot of us view reality,

770
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,689
you know.

771
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:03,829
Um,

772
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,890
but the good news is the other thing that, uh we're working on.

773
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,410
Uh, and that the DWF does

774
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,329
is

775
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,319
in our CV database,

776
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:16,219
we explicitly have fields to deal with mistakes and messes.

777
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,969
You know, we have a state for the CV.

778
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:21,380
And typical states would be something like reserved where, you know,

779
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,380
the CV E has been issued,

780
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:24,699
but it's not yet public,

781
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,400
right?

782
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,979
Uh Another state would be public like the CV is now public.

783
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:29,579
Uh,

784
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:33,040
we have additional states like it's been rejected because it's not a

785
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,510
vulnerability or it's disputed or it's been replaced by a different number,

786
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,709
right?

787
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:41,640
Because uh this actually has happened. Uh Miter had already assigned a CV E

788
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,400
uh to an, uh, an issue some time ago and I missed that they had to sign this

789
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,989
and I was assigning a big block of CV S to a big pile of issues.

790
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:52,560
And I, you know, I, I checked,

791
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,939
uh a bunch at the beginning and a bunch at the end didn't check in the middle,

792
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:59,699
right? And worked on the assumption that, well, they didn't do any at the beginning.

793
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,839
They didn't do any in so the middle must be safe. Well, no, they they had done one.

794
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,849
So, you know, in the C in the DWF CV database, there's a CV that says, you know, CV, blah

795
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,080
replaced by and then the

796
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,899
miter CV number.

797
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,929
Um

798
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:15,429
And so the goal here is to

799
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,610
two big things.

800
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,780
Number one, when we do make mistakes, I want clearly label them as such.

801
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,489
And you know, why was it a mistake? How is it a mistake?

802
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,020
And number two,

803
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,688
what, what's the correct information?

804
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:27,898
Right? Make it

805
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:31,378
very easy to programmatically consume this, right?

806
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:35,498
It's very easy for a program to, to digest this file and go oh That's rejected.

807
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:38,489
So that means it's not real or? Oh, it's replaced by, oh, this one.

808
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:40,217
Go look up that 10 OK. Boom.

809
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:43,809
-- Now you have the correct data.
-- If I'm an end user,

810
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:52,118
-- do I need to snarf down the Miter CV E database and the DWF
-- database long term. No. Um

811
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,158
All

812
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:58,849
the hope is all CNA issued CVS will go to Miter

813
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,489
in as close to real time as possible.

814
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,780
And mir will then be able to put that information in their database very quickly.

815
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:10,719
The good news there is that the DWF had uh I created a JSON file format

816
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:15,129
and the miter guys created one and they're, you know, they're mostly compatible,

817
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:17,350
but you would still need like two parsers, you know,

818
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,389
one for each F format because they're a little different.

819
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,120
Uh The good news is we'll be using the

820
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:25,139
same format hopefully by beginning of uh next week.

821
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,489
Wow, that's soon.

822
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,250
Yeah.

823
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,409
Well, so basically, well, because the, the,

824
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,870
the formats were already pretty compatible but, you know, it was some minor things.

825
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:35,209
Um And so basically there will be the official,

826
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,399
what miter needs for a CV,

827
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:38,939
in that

828
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,739
JSON file, right?

829
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,929
And it'll be things like the CV number, obviously, things like the description,

830
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,699
things like what's affected, you know, what products are affected.

831
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,080
Um And of course, you know,

832
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,439
the DWF needs that as well. The DWF also has a super set of additional information

833
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,290
and so the beauty is you can just write a parcel that understands Mir

834
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,879
and you can also parse DWF stuff and get kind of what you need.

835
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,649
So let me

836
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:02,939
just

837
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,090
ignore

838
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,340
the

839
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,399
you have a library

840
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,939
that makes parsing the DWF

841
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:08,330
JSON

842
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:08,760
yet,

843
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:09,320
but we

844
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:12,399
-- will,
-- we should write one and then we can find security issues in it.

845
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,879
And

846
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:14,189
ID.

847
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:16,870
Yeah.

848
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,310
No, we'll be doing and that's the other big thing, right?

849
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,699
Is there's no tooling around CV S and CNAs every single CV E assigning

850
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,810
group does it differently? You know, some people use spreadsheets,

851
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:30,899
some people use a database, some people just added,

852
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:33,570
I think an extra field to their ticketing system or their

853
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:34,760
bug system.

854
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,469
Um And you know, and the challenge is especially with the open source world,

855
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:40,479
we're dealing with people that quite often don't have

856
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,820
a lot of extra time and effort to like,

857
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,260
put into process that,

858
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,360
you know, strictly speaking they don't need.

859
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:47,360
Right. Well, and let's also

860
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,370
too, if you're a small project, you might not even have a security team.

861
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,479
And so you don't, honestly, this isn't a high priority for you,

862
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,750
you want to get it dealt with and you go on to the next thing.

863
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,820
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

864
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,909
And so two of the ways we're dealing with that is number one, we'll be,

865
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,790
we'll be creating tooling, essentially CN A in a box,

866
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,219
you know, that'll ultimately just have a web interface.

867
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:10,070
So you can generate good CV requests.

868
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,600
And the second thing is a process where uh change where

869
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:17,020
to become a CV numbering authority under the DWF,

870
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:21,860
you don't actually necessarily have to be able to issue the CV S yourself.

871
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,629
So the idea being is that we'll have, you know,

872
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,669
the traditional old style CNAs where they have a block of CV numbers,

873
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,979
they have people internally that are trained to do it,

874
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,070
they just handle it all themselves.

875
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,409
The new way will be is once you get to a certain maturity,

876
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,550
you can

877
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,850
um essentially

878
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,659
get a CV E mentor.

879
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:44,989
So essentially somebody who will sign off on your

880
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,899
CV request and say this CV request is correct.

881
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:48,739
It's well formed,

882
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,080
it should get a CV E,

883
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,409
right.

884
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,429
And so essentially that way the CN A can have their block of numbers.

885
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,689
So it's easier to track kind of what they're doing, what they're signing,

886
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:01,590
but they don't necessarily have to have a

887
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,699
CV E process person inside of their organization,

888
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,649
they can rely on an external person.

889
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:10,280
So the goal is they can have one or more of the CV, mentors

890
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,320
who, like I said, essentially sign off on these requests.

891
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:18,040
And you know, if a CV mentor said this is a good well formed request, it is correct,

892
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,300
then, you know, boom, it gets its CV, it gets in the database and it

893
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,000
lives its merry life.

894
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,949
That brings a tear to my eye when I think about how this all used to work because you

895
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:29,330
know,

896
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:31,389
it, it felt like

897
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:31,929
I don't,

898
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:35,530
I don't know if you were ever a Simpsons fan but there were always like the uh the,

899
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,100
the people who were kind of in power where they showed in like

900
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,300
Dracula was one of them but you know, they were in their, their dark back room and,

901
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,060
and kind of doing the deals and that, that's what CBE felt like.

902
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,860
I think at one point in time because, and it kind of was,

903
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,679
but man, this is, this is awesome.

904
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,879
-- So,
-- well, see, one of my big goals is

905
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,030
I've assigned about 5000 CV S now and I don't want to do another 5000,

906
00:38:56,449 --> 00:39:00,560
but I want to enable other people to assign, you know, tens of thousands of CV S.

907
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:06,120
Well, and let's face it too, man. If you're talking about 10,000 I DS a year.

908
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,540
That's

909
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,899
an insane number.

910
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:14,360
And let's face it, we think it's way more than that that should be assigned.

911
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,070
But aren't,

912
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,149
which means

913
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,020
we have to get people out of this process. It has to be

914
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:20,969
machines.

915
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,120
Well, it's, yeah, and especially, I mean, if you look at the, so

916
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,139
the modern software ecosystem, I mean,

917
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:31,600
the last time I looked at Ruby Gems was about 34 years ago and they had 53,000 Ruby Gems

918
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,020
and I'm sure

919
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:35,459
-- none of them have security issues,
-- right?

920
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:40,120
-- You know, the Pie Pie project has I think also on the order of 50,000 Pie modules
-- and,

921
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:41,239
and you have to think about that.

922
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,030
I bet

923
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,520
a good researcher could find at least two issues in less than one hour

924
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,320
with

925
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,169
more than half of those,

926
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,879
which means we're talking about

927
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,290
potentially hundreds of thousands of CV E I DS in that case.

928
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:00,060
Well, especially when people start automating. So a guy named Larry Cash

929
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,600
Dollar who's also associated with the distributed weakness filing project.

930
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:03,850
Uh

931
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:04,610
He works for

932
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:04,810
Akamai

933
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,209
and

934
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:06,100
he

935
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,189
made some automated tooling to find flaws in wordpress plugins, right?

936
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,510
Um Because you know, this is something

937
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,489
-- Akamai cares about and wants to
-- block. Look

938
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:13,620
at

939
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:14,570
this

940
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:14,909
at,

941
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,250
at defcon this year, which I believe is on the internet.

942
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I will try to find it and put it in the show notes.

943
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,360
Yeah,

944
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,699
but so the problem is he's in the

945
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:25,610
situation of like I found 1000 security vulnerabilities.

946
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,719
What do I do now? Right. Like, how do you know,

947
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:33,340
how do you, how do you even physically contact 1000 word press plug in maintainers?

948
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:38,139
You know how you actually a problem that DWF isn't going to fix necessarily,

949
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,419
but it will potentially make it better.

950
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,300
We will make it less painful.

951
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,370
I don't know that we'll be able to make it better.

952
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,419
That, that would be an awesome thing to do.

953
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:53,510
Um I think part of it, what I wanna do is, is just make this more accessible and more

954
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,870
normal, right?

955
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:59,729
Because right now CV still has that like, oh, this issue got a CV E, right. That,

956
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,629
you know, and, and ok, back when we had 1000 a year, maybe that was kind of amazing.

957
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,419
But now, you know, we're

958
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,510
like, right now I just saw CV, what was it? 9180 something go across my email,

959
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,030
you know, like we're, I think we might actually break CV

960
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,909
10-K this year, like for real,

961
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,429
you know, last year we came pretty close. It's

962
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,239
cracking,

963
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:20,709
right.

964
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,870
I need your help.

965
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:23,689
Yeah.

966
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:28,610
So, you know, the part of it is the normalization of this, you know, it,

967
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,669
it reminds me a lot of traffic accidents,

968
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:31,290
right?

969
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,699
Traffic accidents used to be kind of a big deal,

970
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,179
especially since cars didn't have crumple zones or like airbags.

971
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:36,370
Right.

972
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,409
And people got hurt and, you know, every time you drove by car accident,

973
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:40,570
there's like tons of,

974
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,840
you know, police and ambulances and fire and everything.

975
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:45,820
And, you know, now, like, for example,

976
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,120
locally the police service is flat outside unless it's an injury

977
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:51,850
collision or, you know, some other special case

978
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,370
just

979
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,790
come to the police station and file the paperwork.

980
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,520
Right. We're not coming out to help you because that's insane. Right.

981
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:03,419
So, you know, I've been in, I've had one or two minor fender benders where, you know,

982
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:06,709
I rear ended somebody or somebody rear ended me at slow speed and it's just like,

983
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:09,600
you know, you drive to the police station, they go, why are you here?

984
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh, you had a traffic accident. They hand you, they hand each of you a form

985
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:16,500
they say please sit down and fill this out and they go ok, thanks. Right.

986
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,679
And, and that's, you know, traffic accidents by and large are not,

987
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:23,669
most of them nowadays are not that bad, you know,

988
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:27,300
and they, you know, they don't need a lot of special treatment and extra treatment,

989
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,840
but they do need to be tracked.

990
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,280
They do need to, you know, we do need a little paperwork around these things,

991
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:35,899
you know, for insurance purposes or, you know, in this case for making sure

992
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:38,959
that the vulnerability got fixed. Which version did it get fixed in?

993
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,320
You know, did it stay fixed?

994
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,510
So as as far as I'm concerned, you know,

995
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,510
CV E should just be a normal part of any software project, just like bug tracking,

996
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:47,110
you know,

997
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:47,600
that

998
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,030
everybody has bug tracking now that I remember back in the day when

999
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,989
a lot of software projects and even commercial vendors did not have bug tracking

1000
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,060
officially

1001
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:56,840
or source

1002
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:57,669
management.

1003
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,709
Well, yeah, I mean, like those are things that used to be black magic and now, well,

1004
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,270
everybody, well, not everybody has it sadly, but most people have it.

1005
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,429
Oh, yeah. Well,

1006
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,229
and it's free. I mean,

1007
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:11,330
look at that. It's crazy.

1008
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:13,080
So,

1009
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,959
I guess the one other thing we should mention is

1010
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,219
you're going to be giving a talk at the RS,

1011
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,959
a conference on all this.

1012
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,780
Yeah. No.

1013
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,649
Um, actually myself and Kent Landfield from Intel, who's another CV E board member

1014
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,899
will be talking about basically how we are

1015
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,540
saving CV E in the CV ecosystem with the open source way, the process, the methods,

1016
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,770
the technology.

1017
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:37,459
That's awesome.

1018
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,520
I imagine you, you have your, what,

1019
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,060
all your talk all written by now, right? It's already the middle of November.

1020
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,139
Uh, I believe the slides are due in

1021
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,530
three weeks.

1022
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:50,020
So

1023
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:50,439
that's

1024
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:50,719
a lot

1025
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,129
of time.

1026
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:54,449
I think it's in December sometime.

1027
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:57,330
Wow. Wow. Wow, that's, that's really soon.

1028
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,260
Crazy, man. Good luck with that.

1029
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,219
Yeah.

1030
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,159
No, I mean, the good news is, it's, it's an actual,

1031
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:04,870
it's a topic that's easy to talk about

1032
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:07,000
because we're actually making some progress for once.

1033
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,479
I like much of the rest of the industry. Right.

1034
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,919
No, I mean, that's true. That's true. It's,

1035
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:13,510
it's very

1036
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:13,899
exciting.

1037
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:18,729
It's CV, you know, the problem with CV is, is it was stalled out for a long time.

1038
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,199
It, and, and the problem is it worked well enough that that was ok.

1039
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,199
You know,

1040
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:26,169
and, but like a lot of problems, it then kind of,

1041
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,489
you know, it became a problem and well, then we fixed it,

1042
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,169
you know, and now we're fixing it And the other good news is, is, you know,

1043
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,850
DWF is not going to be the only CV hierarchy.

1044
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,179
You know, we're already looking at

1045
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:39,090
um having country

1046
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,229
related hierarchies because

1047
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,810
the reality is, you know, uh with time zones and language barriers, you know,

1048
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,250
it can be very difficult

1049
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,570
uh to deal with, you know, people

1050
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,280
um also cultural issues, you know,

1051
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,429
uh some countries security vulnerabilities are very sort of shameful, you know,

1052
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:58,860
they're very something you don't want to really discuss in public that much.

1053
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:59,189
But

1054
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,260
the good news is these people do recognize the value of CV.

1055
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:02,969
Or, you know,

1056
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,810
you've got entire industries like healthcare and

1057
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,239
aerospace and say the financial industries where,

1058
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:07,979
you know,

1059
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:10,860
they would probably love to actually have their

1060
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,989
security flaws dealt with a bit more openly,

1061
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,340
but like from a regulatory point of view, they can't,

1062
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:16,979
you know,

1063
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,060
um but there would be huge value in giving these people CV ES so that especially when,

1064
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:22,709
you know,

1065
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,600
you have to talk about a security vulnerability outside of your organization.

1066
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,699
And especially when you're talking about more than one vulnerability,

1067
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,620
which is almost always the case nowadays.

1068
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,229
You know,

1069
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,260
how are we,

1070
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:36,729
you know, which one are we actually talking about? Which one are we dealing with?

1071
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,860
And CV just makes that easy.

1072
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:40,979
-- It's like
-- the metric system of security.

1073
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:41,659
Oh,

1074
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,449
well, we're down to two countries that don't use metric.

1075
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:45,629
-- So, you know, hey, we're
-- getting

1076
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:45,939
-- there.
-- Oh,

1077
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:46,419
you know, I,

1078
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:50,370
I love the fact that I've been systematically brainwashing my Children into

1079
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:54,580
hating the English measurement system that we use in the United States because

1080
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,080
everything can't stand

1081
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,129
chains and hogsheads,

1082
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,260
you know.

1083
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,310
You know, that's something I,

1084
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,159
I thought about before is III I didn't do enough research to figure this out,

1085
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:06,189
but it would be awesome to make a tape measure

1086
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,669
with all the insane units of length

1087
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:14,189
that have been used in the past. Right? Like a rod or whatever, a cubit.

1088
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:14,590
It

1089
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,739
just have something you can pull out and, like, measure something like

1090
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:19,429
two cubits wide.

1091
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,469
Uh, it would, well,

1092
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:26,520
I would just pick the most hilarious unit of measure for the given distance we're at

1093
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:27,550
because

1094
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:28,790
I'm sure

1095
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,350
there are, there are, you know,

1096
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,729
some of these are very long and some of them are very short

1097
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,560
with its face and most are fairly long because back in the day,

1098
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,989
they just didn't have the ability to measure anything, you know,

1099
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,709
smaller than like a human hand,

1100
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:42,030
which is also a unit of measure.

1101
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,629
I just love the fact that we have things like the ton

1102
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,909
and there's Tontonne, there's the long ton, the short ton,

1103
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:52,550
the metric ton,

1104
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,399
the imperial ton.

1105
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,560
And if you look at the Wikipedia page for this,

1106
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,060
you'll cry because it's not like they're off by a little bit, they're

1107
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,360
-- in some cases off by like a lot.
-- Right. Right. Right.

1108
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,310
Well, have you ever heard of the metric inch?

1109
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,500
The metric inch is uh 2.5 centimeters per inch instead of 2.54

1110
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:16,409
-- that makes, that's like defining pie as four.
-- I

1111
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:16,810
know, I

1112
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:17,179
know

1113
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:17,610
it just

1114
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:22,129
-- makes
-- PP could be defined as three and is a reasonable margin of error at that point.

1115
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,120
But yes, it's madness, man. Anyway. All right.

1116
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:28,459
-- I'm sorry, I'm flabbergasted. I metric
-- inch.

1117
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,939
I've, I've just created a denial of service with Kurt.

1118
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,530
He's going to waste the rest of his day reading up on the metric.

1119
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:38,439
But, you know, I don't even know why I know that it's just one of those weird. Anyway.

1120
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,300
So for those of you out there,

1121
00:47:40,669 --> 00:47:45,229
if you want the show notes about any of this stuff, because this, this episode is,

1122
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:48,199
is actually quite informative and useful, unlike many of the others

1123
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,699
is uh open source security podcast.com.

1124
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,860
We will put all the show notes in there, whatnot, uh links to Twitter.

1125
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,500
You can hassle us, ask questions, all that kind of stuff. And obviously,

1126
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,209
if is the DW

1127
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:03,419
is the DWF project accepting volunteers yet? Are you there?

1128
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,189
Well, we're not quite there yet but, um,

1129
00:48:06,629 --> 00:48:07,879
I will be setting,

1130
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,040
at least there's a mailing list and stuff so people can stay in contact.

1131
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,139
Um,

1132
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,649
the good news is this will be rolling shortly because now we,

1133
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,350
we've essentially done a lot of homework and gotten the homework done.

1134
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,149
-- Now we can start doing the fun stuff. Awesome.
-- Good deal. So I guess stay, stay tuned,

1135
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,110
stay tuned. You'll figure it out and thank you everyone for listening.

1136
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,129
Welcome back, Kurt. It was fun as always and until next time.

1137
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,860
-- Yep. Have a good weekend. Everybody take
-- care. Bye bye.
