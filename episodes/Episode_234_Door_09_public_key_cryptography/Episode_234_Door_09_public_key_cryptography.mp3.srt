Hello and welcome to the open source

1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,840
security podcast where apparently public key cryptography

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,060
and using the number nine, which is not prime is fine.

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:11,470
You know, I suppose I could have moved it to number 11, which was prime, but whatever,

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,239
I don't care, this was,

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,659
this was the only free slot left when I

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,229
wanted to add public key cryptography as a topic.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,219
It

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,299
just deleted something.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,000
It's December 9th, Kurt, it's almost Christmas. Don't be a Grinch

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,299
dude. The Grinch was correct. Everybody else was wrong.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,450
He just wanted to enjoy his life and all those whoville

12
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,849
idiots were like making noise and wrecking his place off.

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,139
No, they were there first. It's fine.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,939
OK.

15
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:36,700
So

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,099
public key cryptography, what is it? Why do we care?

17
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:44,020
Public key cryptography is essentially magic

18
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,509
in the sense of I have

19
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:45,830
a,

20
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,639
I have a public and private key.

21
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,500
And fundamentally, this allows me to sign things that only I could have signed

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,799
and it allows you to encrypt things to me that only I can read,

23
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,630
which gives you two big properties, non

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,560
repudiation

25
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:03,819
and privacy,

26
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:04,410
non

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,550
repudiation, non

28
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,250
-- repudiation means only I could have done that nobody else could have done it
-- well.

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,430
So look, the,

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,040
the real magic behind public key encryption

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,260
is it literally runs the whole internet.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,790
It literally runs all of society at this

33
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,760
-- point.
-- It's true at this point. It really does.

34
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,900
I mean, and,

35
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,779
-- and it's amazing and it basically,
-- have you been paid by your employer recently?

36
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,459
That was public key crypto everything.

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,750
Like I bought crap on the internet yesterday and it

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,059
was public key cryptography that let me do that.

39
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,000
I paid for a car wash today.

40
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,059
That was public key crypto.

41
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,849
-- Not necessarily, you could use
-- cash,

42
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,730
-- no credit card, swipe machine in the wash
-- base. But yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

43
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:51,779
Public key cryptography. The idea being there's a public key, private key.

44
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,209
And in the case of the internet, for example, you go to a website,

45
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,029
the website has a private key

46
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,169
and there's how trust is created is complicated. We won't cover that right now.

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,669
-- But I mean, fundamentally speaking,
-- trust is created through

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,727
and happy little, you know, those kittens with the like big bright eyes.

49
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,496
That's how trust is created.

50
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,296
Look,

51
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,606
we'll just say there's maybe another door in this

52
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:19,427
house of madness where we'll talk about that.

53
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,776
Right. The point being unless tab

54
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,057
there it is. All right. Cool.

55
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:27,266
So the point is the magic of public key cryptography is before that

56
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,057
there was no way to share information

57
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,326
with someone securely without both parties essentially

58
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,544
-- over
-- an untrusted channel. That's

59
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:36,983
true.

60
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:39,623
That's true because you can share things over a trusted channel,

61
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:45,324
but fundamentally both sides needed the key, a private key in this instance.

62
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,944
And that obviously doesn't work in something like the

63
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:52,304
internet because you can't distribute private keys to everybody.

64
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:56,654
You can't really do trusted channels when there's 8 billion people on the planet.

65
00:02:56,664 --> 00:03:00,304
Because what is 8 billion times 8 billion minus one? It's a big number.

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,720
Yeah, exactly.

67
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,430
And,

68
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,830
and also that, that would be one hell of a key signing party.

69
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,830
No, it would be 8 billion factorial.

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,070
-- No,
-- it wouldn't be, it would be

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,041
8 billion minus one.

72
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,610
Factorial would be the number of private keys you would need to distribute.

73
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,830
It'd be 8 billion times 8 billion minus one. Not factorial.

74
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,781
It would be factorial because you'd have to, every,

75
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,350
every person would have to exchange a key with every other person.

76
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,791
Yeah. So 8 billion times

77
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,270
-- minus one
-- factorial factorial.

78
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,350
So factorials when you're shuffling cards. Yeah.

79
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,800
All right math nerds help me out.

80
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,229
You're

81
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:31,720
not

82
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,220
factorial is when you shuffle cards,

83
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,509
if you have seven people who need to

84
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:39,020
sign

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,789
-- to
-- distribute every possible combination of keys amongst all of the humans,

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,750
whatever doesn't matter.

87
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,300
Private

88
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,610
key,

89
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,220
you solve this problem but private key photography solve

90
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,149
-- this problem as
-- long as you trust somebody,

91
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,369
but you don't have to trust them.

92
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,029
Even you just have to say

93
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:57,350
here is the private, or here's the public key. I have the private key. Exactly.

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,589
Now we can set up a secure communication.

95
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:02,082
Public key has to be signed so that you know that

96
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,212
it's my public key so that you can trust it.

97
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:05,861
We're not talking about that right now.

98
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:07,692
That's another door. It's,

99
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,222
it's another day.

100
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,001
This is how advent calendars work.

101
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,981
You can't talk about the thing behind the next Advent calendar door.

102
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,380
That's just not how it works.

103
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,630
So the point is public crypto is magic because also it's highly inefficient.

104
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,394
So what you do is you use public key

105
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:28,683
crypto to encrypt a symmetric key which is stupidly efficient.

106
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:29,414
That's true.

107
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:29,783
That is,

108
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,723
and that is the magic to me of public key crypto

109
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:38,014
is that you use something horrifically inefficient because who

110
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:40,324
cares if it takes five or six seconds to

111
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,753
then encrypt something that is very efficient and bam

112
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:46,933
and that is where cryptographers did get things right?

113
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,205
Cryptographers have always gotten things right?

114
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:53,446
Because cryptography is one of the few things in the world that it's all or none.

115
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,536
There's literally nothing in the middle yet. You can't be sort of right?

116
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,175
-- In cryptography,
-- you are surfing a trusted site.

117
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:02,726
No, the answer is you are now surfing an untrusted site.

118
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:03,455
Crypto

119
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,286
one.

120
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:05,006
No, crypto

121
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:06,455
crypto did win. I agree. I

122
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:07,045
agree.

123
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:10,566
And it won in the web browser, which is,

124
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,839
wow, actually, yeah, that's pretty impressive.

125
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,690
I'm ending it.

126
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,820
-- We will see you all.
-- Thanks everybody

127
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,929
on December 10th.
