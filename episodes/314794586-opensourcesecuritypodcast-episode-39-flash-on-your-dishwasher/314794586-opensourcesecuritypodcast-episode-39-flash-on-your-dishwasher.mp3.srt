Hello and welcome to episode 39 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,710
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,560
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,909
Kurt. I have some amazing news to share with you.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,829
Did you get a Nintendo switch?

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,579
I, I got that a long time ago. No, no, this is

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,030
maybe it is good.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,989
Super Mario run has finally come out for Android.

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:27,840
I go

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,000
over the, the real one. That's right.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,349
The one from Nintendo, not the one from uh Super Mario run.ru, right?

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,389
This is the actual real Super Mario run from Nintendo

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,869
is now on my Android phone

13
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:45,069
and it amuses me, which gives me great joy.

14
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:45,849
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,060
My uh my six year old, one of them is pretty,

16
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:49,849
pretty emotionally invested in that game.

17
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:52,139
What,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,959
how are you emotionally invested in Super

19
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,139
Mario?

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,959
I, I, every time he die, you know, every time Mario dies, that's, you know, it's bad,

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,550
right? Every time Bowser dies, he's so

22
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,150
happy you need to get him on the original Super Mario Brothers. Then

23
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,900
you get to kill Bowser eight times.

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,349
We're

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:12,589
gonna be

26
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:13,209
doing that.

27
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:16,559
Uh I just don't know why I didn't figure this out earlier.

28
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:20,839
But I can use my Nintendo Wii controllers on with my Mac and open

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,300
emu.

30
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,900
Uh because the problem I've had is finding good Nintendo classic

31
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,690
controllers like they don't exist anymore unless you buy the originals

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
and the uh the, the connector to the USB and blah, blah, blah. And

33
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:38,059
honestly, the Nintendo Wii controllers are pretty faithful to the original.

34
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,940
They're not bad. However, I have something even better.

35
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:45,980
Is there is a company I believe they're called eight bit D or do or whatever

36
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,050
and you can buy a Bluetooth Super Nintendo.

37
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:50,199
Well,

38
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:56,279
and Nintendo controller remakes and I have the Super Nintendo one and I went and got

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,139
one of my actual Super Nintendo controllers out of the basement to compare it to.

40
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,760
And other than weighing a teeny bit more,

41
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,139
it's like spot on in terms of size and feel and everything. It's fantastic.

42
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:08,538
See,

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,300
the biggest thing that gets me about all of this original Nintendo stuff is just the,

44
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:15,220
the build quality like it just never breaks.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,339
And I, you know, and I used like the,

46
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:22,169
the heck out of my net like those things got dropped and stepped on and smashed and

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,399
they just always worked.

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,339
And then I'm really sad that I sold my nez and all the games, you know, back in the day,

49
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,119
you know what man, I still have them in the basement and I took them out one day

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,039
and it was such a headache to get it working and plug it

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,919
in and figure it out and I had to clean all the cartridges and

52
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,470
I don't think you made a mistake at all.

53
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,320
Well, just, no, I wish I would have kept the controllers

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,440
and

55
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,020
what would you plug them into

56
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:47,479
one of the USB adapter

57
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,009
things,

58
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,320
I suppose, I suppose. Actually, you know what's really funny is a million years ago

59
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,250
I built an adapter to plug a super

60
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,800
Nintendo controller into the parallel port on my computer

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,500
so I could use it as

62
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,080
like a joystick. Yeah.

63
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:03,399
And they were even, it worked on Linux,

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,139
even someone wrote Linux drivers to make it all work together.

65
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:06,750
Remember the?

66
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,570
Yeah. Yeah, it was great, man. It was great.

67
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,710
Yeah. Now we're all just trying to buy switches.

68
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,500
I have a switch. I can bask in, in the awesomeness of owning one.

69
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,940
I, I will say that the legend of Zelda game is

70
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:20,830
an amazing game

71
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,429
in almost every way.

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,610
And, and I, I don't, I don't, I don't wanna make you feel too bad here, but like

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,440
I've seen some of

74
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,190
the youtube play through stuff and like some of the tricks they use,

75
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,910
like attaching explosives to the floating stuff and then

76
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,110
shooting it down and blowing up the guys or

77
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:37,029
getting the chickens to attack the bad guys.

78
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,339
And I mean, it looks awesome.

79
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,949
It's pretty good. They did, they did a good job.

80
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:41,539
Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,119
And,

82
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,259
and part of the beauty of it is from the very kind of security perspective I always

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,550
like to take is there's a million ways to

84
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,059
do everything which is part of the fun because

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,339
I'll sit and watch my kids play and I would never dream of doing half

86
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,729
the stuff the way they do it or they'll watch me play and they're like,

87
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,800
why are you doing it that way?

88
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,240
That doesn't make sense. I'm like, it makes sense to me. Go away

89
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:00,990
so

90
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,470
well.

91
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,089
And that's what always frustrated me about these, uh,

92
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,839
sort of video games is like where you,

93
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,949
you, like have to use,

94
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,949
uh, like you're a ninja and you have like a sneak ability,

95
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,699
but at some point in the game you like have to set off

96
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,190
the alarm to get the guards to clear the room or something,

97
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,298
you know,

98
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:19,928
versus rather than just like sneaking into an event and dropping a

99
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,739
hand grenade into the room or poison gas grenade or whatever.

100
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,100
Right.

101
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,359
And that, you know, you have these like very linear storylines and it's not like

102
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,510
you kind of have that flexibility. Yeah, you have this effect on these objects.

103
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,339
So therefore you can do it like

104
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,869
17 different ways.

105
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,640
Yeah, it's super cool. I love it.

106
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,920
Yeah.

107
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:40,920
So

108
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:44,600
related to that I think would be Symantec versus Google

109
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:46,320
is that related

110
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,519
is,

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,750
well, in so much that we have, like, we have the old stuff, which used to be cool,

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,399
which is probably not nearly as cool as we thought it was.

113
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,160
And then we have the new stuff, which is actually cool and pointing out

114
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,320
they're both pretty old man.

115
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,440
I, I wonder what year was Symantec founded in, probably older than Google.

116
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,959
But I bet, I bet they're comparable.

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,019
I don't know, we'll have to check later.

118
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,640
But, uh, so, yeah, I mean, I, well, this seems to boil down to a classic case of, uh,

119
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,820
I guess of too big to fail really.

120
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,100
Otherwise they would have gutted them by now. All right.

121
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,899
So firstly, Symantec was founded in 1982

122
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,380
was founded in 1998.

123
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:25,679
So

124
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,459
neither is young,

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,500
in my opinion.

126
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,660
True. But regardless. So why don't you recap this crazy story?

127
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,070
Well, basically what's happened is as we all know, uh,

128
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,079
some cas are by C A si mean certificate, authorities, a certificate authority,

129
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,420
so fancy speak for people who essentially have

130
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:50,380
a root certificate that they managed to convince

131
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,779
the fine folks over at Mozilla and, or Chrome and,

132
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,739
or Microsoft into including in their web browser trust store.

133
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,600
And, uh, then they can use that to essentially create certificates, uh,

134
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:09,059
for websites, you know, for email identities, uh, for code signing.

135
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,369
I think that's really the three use cases we have,

136
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:17,380
they're the big ones and those are the ones that will probably affect people in

137
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,049
this context. So, yeah,

138
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,010
and so the deal is though, is like, well, well, like any business you know,

139
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,489
some businesses are, are good at what they do and they,

140
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,450
they put out a good product and they have good quality assurance and testing and,

141
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:29,920
you know,

142
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:33,160
the products don't randomly explode and kill you and then other companies,

143
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,799
you know, do less of a good job.

144
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,350
And so what's happened is, you know,

145
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:42,010
we've kind of always suspected that some of these cas were doing a really poor job,

146
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,170
but we had no idea what they were doing.

147
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:44,890
Right.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,170
And so Google was smart, came along and did this thing called, um,

149
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,190
certificate Transparency which really boils down to

150
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,109
is the certificate authorities had to,

151
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,690
uh, make a public record of the certificates they were issuing.

152
00:06:58,059 --> 00:06:59,809
Seems logical.

153
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,010
Yeah, exactly.

154
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,579
I mean, so that way a company like Google could, you know, watch the, you know,

155
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,399
watch which certificates are being created and be like, oh, you know,

156
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,000
Symantec just created a certificate for google.com.

157
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,609
Uh, no, we didn't buy that. So that's not us. Uh, that's a problem.

158
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,059
Um, and conversely too,

159
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,320
like there's some rules around what you can and cannot issue certificates for.

160
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:20,820
So, like,

161
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,320
theoretically speaking,

162
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:27,140
certificates should really be issued only for a domain name

163
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,619
that is generally publicly available or at least kind

164
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,700
of maps to a domain that is public,

165
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,630
right? So, like,

166
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:38,739
you know, microsoft.com or google.com

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,619
and not like, you know, some fake domain, like,

168
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,619
uh, you know, Microsoft dot Internal,

169
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,299
right?

170
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,940
Like those, you know,

171
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,059
internal domains that people use that should never be on the internet.

172
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,049
Um And also things like you should never like,

173
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,899
create certificates for like local host

174
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,170
or, you know, IP addresses, you know, and, and those are actually something,

175
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:04,059
there's this thing called the uh the Cab Forum, the certificate authority.

176
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,049
I don't remember what it stands for, like something, certificate, authority,

177
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,339
browser, whatever form,

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:09,989
you know,

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,790
and they have these rules and these rules have been around for over a decade and,

180
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:17,369
you know, it turns out some of these cas are violating these rules like a lot, like,

181
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,450
pretty consistently.

182
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,570
Um, and so they, you know, they get spanked a little bit, whatever, no big deal,

183
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,209
but it turns out like Symantec at least.

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,609
Ok.

185
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,440
So Google claims Symantec did something like over 30,000 bad certificate,

186
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,690
you know, issuances

187
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,109
Symantec, of course, claims it was like, oh, no, it was only like 100 and something,

188
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,789
you know, we totally have like, yeah,

189
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,869
we got a little problem but not that big of a problem,

190
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,458
you know, and Google is basically saying, like, look,

191
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:48,679
it's pretty clear that Symantec and, or their subsidiaries, uh,

192
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,309
don't really have control over what they're doing and see.

193
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,489
And here's the dirty secret.

194
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,739
Ask me how many certificate authorities your web browser trusts.

195
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:58,530
Oh,

196
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,659
man, it's a lot. I haven't looked.

197
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,450
No. The correct answer is we don't know

198
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,369
because

199
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,539
here's the beauty.

200
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,489
You can have a root certificate in your browser.

201
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:09,929
That's more than one company.

202
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,280
Essentially somebody owns that root certificate,

203
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,710
but they might essentially be reselling access to it to multiple sub

204
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,280
certificate authorities

205
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,190
who essentially through like whatever means an api snail mail pigeons.

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,950
I don't know what,

207
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,320
but essentially can, you know, talk to the actual root certificate authority

208
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,799
and get certificates issued.

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,570
So the act, here's the beauty is

210
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,080
the actual number of certificate authorities on

211
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,090
planet Earth that your web browser trusts.

212
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,010
We don't know.

213
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,400
We know how many like root certificate authorities are in your browser.

214
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,299
But how many of those are

215
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,239
a single company or

216
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,390
possibly more than a single company? We don't actually know.

217
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,940
And so these, some of these, you know,

218
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,340
sub cas that essentially piggyback on the real CAS,

219
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,190
you know, they do a really terrible job because like, what have they got to lose,

220
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,599
right.

221
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,219
You know, they're basically just printing money while they can

222
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:06,039
and, you know, 500 bucks is 500 bucks.

223
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,580
So,

224
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,539
yeah, I mean, we're essentially at a point where, uh, Google put out a posting,

225
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,320
uh, talking about how they're essentially going to be.

226
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,859
Well, I don't wanna say they're phasing out support for Symantec,

227
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,840
but what they're doing is they're allowing

228
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,219
the Symantec certificates to only be valid for, uh,

229
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:29,049
shorter periods of time than you would normally expect,

230
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,330
which, you know, essentially forces people to get new certificates more often,

231
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,539
which in theory

232
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,580
should be safer because it makes people kind of

233
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,239
prove again who they are to the certificate authority,

234
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:40,380
right?

235
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,020
Because one of the dirty little secrets is,

236
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:47,679
uh, let's say, you know, your big company.com and you go bankrupt.

237
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,419
Well, part of your assets could be your certificate authority,

238
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,979
you know,

239
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,580
and that gets sold off. Um,

240
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,150
you know, so by forcing these people to sort of reprove who they are once in a while,

241
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,799
uh that, you know, in theory could make it better for end users,

242
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,130
right?

243
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,530
So in realistically speaking,

244
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,950
the system is such a mess and such a disaster right now,

245
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,250
it just flat out doesn't matter.

246
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,770
Uh Yeah,

247
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,580
you're probably correct. Which is sad.

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,320
Well, you know, what got me is back in the day when I,

249
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,179
I tried to get involved in this to try and help make the world a better place.

250
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,820
And then after about six months I gave up because it was just such a mess. But

251
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,330
one of the things that really got me was when

252
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,299
you asked to be included as a certificate of authority,

253
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:32,299
essentially the process was you would be included unless somebody could

254
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,489
prove that you should not be included.

255
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,090
So it was essentially fail open instead of fail closed

256
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,479
in my mind, something like this should be,

257
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,169
you are not getting in until you really prove

258
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,789
that you can be

259
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,109
trusted and safe and secure.

260
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,330
And there were cases, you know,

261
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,440
where uh there was that certificate authority in Holland that was you know,

262
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,229
completely

263
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,919
like their, their,

264
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,659
the machine they used to do all the certificates

265
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,349
was like a workstation that was riddled with viruses.

266
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,900
Um, and they were totally certified out by,

267
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,640
I think one of the major accounting firms,

268
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,940
um, I looked at some of these other, you know,

269
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,140
certificate authorities and tried to track down their,

270
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,219
who had audited them and said they were, you know, ok to,

271
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,460
to be trusted.

272
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,070
And I found this one firm,

273
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,409
an auditing firm.

274
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:21,099
Uh and Google Maps showed it as an office in the middle of a farmer's field

275
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,239
in Texas.

276
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,309
Normal, I believe

277
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,239
when they don't know where.

278
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,659
No, no, no. It actually turned out it was,

279
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,880
oh no, it was a legit address. So I actually

280
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:33,159
I phoned

281
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,650
and it was a one man operation

282
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,219
that does not surprise me at all. And, and so here's

283
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,250
what I think we should

284
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,780
kind of steer this conversation towards is

285
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,270
regardless of what you think of semantic or

286
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,739
regardless of whether Google is necessarily right or wrong

287
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,869
in the context of semantic.

288
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,859
I think the fact that they're willing to stand up to

289
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,289
ac A in this instance is a big deal because I remember

290
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,109
when the digit

291
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,750
order thing happened, talking to the Mozilla security guy specifically and saying

292
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:10,869
we need to kill the C A

293
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,309
and

294
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
they didn't want to,

295
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:16,380
they were afraid to because they thought there would be

296
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,179
too much backlash against like axing a whole C a

297
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,219
because obviously this doesn't just affect one thing.

298
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:27,260
It's going to affect hundreds or thousands or as you say,

299
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,010
like we don't entirely know.

300
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,859
And so I give Google tons of credit for standing up here.

301
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:36,080
Now, granted, at the same time, like this is Google,

302
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,169
no one else could do this except for them because they are the

303
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,570
million pound gorilla in the room.

304
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,640
Even Microsoft probably would struggle here because I bet Microsoft and

305
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,969
Symantec have very deep partnerships that I I bet if the,

306
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:54,090
if the browser guys at Microsoft tried to pull this stunt,

307
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,270
there'd be some uh help wanted signs in the window

308
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:58,549
the next day

309
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,710
to

310
00:13:59,869 --> 00:13:59,890
be,

311
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,099
there'd be people calling people who wear expensive

312
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,869
suits and they would deal with this.

313
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,270
Yeah,

314
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,780
the biggest thing that's frustrating to me is

315
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:09,020
just the whole lack of transparency around this.

316
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,340
And

317
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,070
you know,

318
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,039
it has to be somebody like Google pushing really hard

319
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,349
for transparency and even then the cas are fighting it.

320
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:15,590
And

321
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,190
you know, it really strikes me that in,

322
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,429
in a situation where you literally have companies selling trust,

323
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,409
that's essentially what a certificate authority is,

324
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,659
is they are selling trust in the sense of like Josh came to us and said he owns,

325
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,530
you know, breer.com and we confirmed that he owns pressers.com

326
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,960
or.net or whatever I

327
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,070
own breast.net.

328
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:35,924
Sorry breast

329
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:36,854
was taken.

330
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:38,575
I didn't buy it.

331
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:39,094
Yeah.

332
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:42,325
So, you know, we've confirmed that he is breast.net through the following you know,

333
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,635
mechanisms and it's legit cool or, you know,

334
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,825
an extended validation certificate where we've actually

335
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:50,135
confirmed that he is Josh Bresser's and,

336
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:51,445
you know, all these things, you know,

337
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,969
and so they are literally selling trust and,

338
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,080
you know, the problem is that uh when it comes especially to things like

339
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,450
selling trust, you know,

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,780
things can go really wrong really fast

341
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,380
and therefore we need transparency,

342
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,809
you know, we need to know what's going on. Like who are they selling trust?

343
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,599
That's, that's part of it.

344
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,609
But regardless of transparency and this is where I think let's and crypt gets a lot of

345
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,570
this right is they use very short lifetimes on

346
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,330
these certificates because if something does go sideways,

347
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,770
it's only valid for what, 90 days.

348
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,880
Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.

349
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,210
Um, because some of these certificates that are being sold, I mean,

350
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,929
I think the last time I bought a certificate,

351
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,690
it gave me the option of up to five years or something.

352
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,200
It's, it's a long time.

353
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,650
Generally it's at least one year, sometimes even more, which is kind of crazy,

354
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,169
which also means the cas are trusted for

355
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,090
many, many years. Some of them are decades.

356
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,739
That would not surprise me. Some of them are 2030 years old.

357
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,989
Like seriously, I, when I looked, I was horrified

358
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,599
what could

359
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,010
possibly

360
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,260
go

361
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:54,469
wrong.

362
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:57,419
Um because, you know, this whole thing reminds me of that.

363
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,789
It's, it's similar to the whole crypto

364
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,710
agility argument. You know, if, if we find out it uh uh

365
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,369
an encryption, you know, algorithm or cipher is bad, we need to be able to, like,

366
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,119
use something else.

367
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,659
And same thing with certificates, right?

368
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,130
Like if this certificate is compromised or, you know,

369
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,440
turns out it was issued to the wrong person.

370
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,049
Um I mean, here's the dirty little secret, right?

371
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,090
All the mechanisms we have around certificate, revocation

372
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,650
don't work, right. Certificate, revocation lists don't really work.

373
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,890
And the online certificate something protocol, I know it's OS CP.

374
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,530
I can't remember what the s stands for ever.

375
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,409
You know, it doesn't scale and it also has privacy implications. Right?

376
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,750
Because every time I go to a secure website, I'd be like,

377
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:34,780
you know,

378
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,599
checking for that

379
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:37,950
thing. Right.

380
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:43,039
Um Funny enough to, you can, well, in, in the Os CP stuff fails all the time is

381
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,960
I, I remember at one point you could enable in Firefox basically, if it can't

382
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,465
OS CP info just fail

383
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,234
and the internet is un brows

384
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:56,184
if you turn that on because everything is failing all the time.

385
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:58,835
Yeah. Well, I remember when they were talking about the Os Co

386
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:03,284
CS P responders, there's no actual requirements about their up time or anything.

387
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:03,815
And, you know,

388
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,464
so I remember somebody measured it and I think

389
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,305
they were getting like one or two nines,

390
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:12,505
like these things work down all the bloody time. Nine fives. Right.

391
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:13,125
Yeah,

392
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,935
like 9.999.

393
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:16,094
Right. Right.

394
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:17,015
And uh

395
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,368
yeah, so the whole thing is just, you know, and, and

396
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,760
obviously we've come to the point where, you know, Firefox and, you know,

397
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,020
Internet Explorer and Chrome are

398
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,729
every month or two.

399
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:29,109
You know, you, you look at the updates notes and it's like, you know,

400
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,209
here's a bunch of extra certificates we revoked because it turns out, you know,

401
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,609
like this dude in China bought a microsoft.com certificate or, or whatever,

402
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,170
you know,

403
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,170
that's always a treat.

404
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,250
Although on that note, did you see somebody went through the let's encrypt

405
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:45,800
data and found what, like 400 domains that it

406
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:45,979
was

407
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:46,250
like,

408
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,290
oh, was it that many?

409
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:48,869
Well,

410
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,530
here's the thing, I mean, it's, they don't,

411
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:51,280
um

412
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,170
uh as far as I know, lets and Crypt doesn't have like a, a restricted list of keywords.

413
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,579
Like what paypal Bank Walmart? Like who decides that list?

414
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,260
You know, it becomes a pain in the butt because a

415
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:06,349
great example of this is cloud flare has um a list of restricted keywords.

416
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,989
And I know this for a fact because when

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,189
I moved the cloud security lines to cloud flare,

418
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,910
you know, part of the whole shick was everything's automated,

419
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,219
it'll take minutes to set up and I did this on a Friday and like it didn't work,

420
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,339
right. And so I flipped back and I was like, what's the deal?

421
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:26,459
Well, because the domain name includes the word security, it needed like

422
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:30,150
the C A, the certificate of authority that, uh, cloud flare goes through,

423
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,729
which I think was Komodo back in the day.

424
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:33,489
Don't quote me,

425
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,119
but essentially the certificate of authority was like, whoa, whoa, whoa,

426
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,599
we're not giving you automated issuance of this domain.

427
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:43,099
Like we are gonna have a manual check, which of course, a human being involved

428
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,050
would, it took several days,

429
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,579
you know,

430
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,410
which seems reasonable. I, yeah, I just looked at the story

431
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:55,385
14,766 L SSL certificates.

432
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,385
You do paypal phishing sites.

433
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:57,775
Yeah.

434
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:00,255
And see, that's why we need transparency because for example,

435
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,805
I think that's actually a good thing because then

436
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:05,055
that lets you take those 14 or 15,000 domain names

437
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,145
and like,

438
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,505
you know, blacklist them and, or look up, you know, where are they being hosted?

439
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:11,055
You

440
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:11,755
know, and maybe,

441
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,425
you know,

442
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:15,055
talk about like not letting people talk to those

443
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:16,564
sites or if they have talked to those sites,

444
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,025
go through your logs and warn them,

445
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,250
you know. Now, of course there's the flip side of all sorts of

446
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,150
snappings, you know, I,

447
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,849
I register fake paypal things and point them at your site to get you in trouble.

448
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,369
Maybe, you know, things like that, right?

449
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,750
But fundamentally, I mean, could you, I mean,

450
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,800
maybe it's uh it's, I mean, if you don't want to grieve somebody or troll them,

451
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,630
you know, it's like the old, you know, sending like Joe

452
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,310
dropping,

453
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,910
you know, Joe

454
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,050
dropping the spam email where I send it out is from, you know, Joshua

455
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,930
breast.net and then you get like a million angry replies,

456
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,619
you know, because people just hate replying, like take me off your list

457
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,609
and they still do that 20 years later.

458
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,739
Um But I mean, realistically it doesn't matter that much.

459
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,479
I mean, what I really want to see is that transparency. So

460
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:59,510
kind of we know how bad the problem is and then, you know,

461
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,729
people can take action like block those domains or check

462
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,380
their DS logs for those domains and you know,

463
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,250
notify whoever went there or clicked on those links.

464
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,250
Right. Right.

465
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,609
Well, and actually I suppose you,

466
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:13,770
you also bring up a good point is by publishing all this and making it easy to get,

467
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,229
you could

468
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,849
put something into your like threat hunting tool kit or log analysis or whatever,

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,390
looking for this stuff.

470
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,739
And additionally, then you can start correlating.

471
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,349
Well, why did they click this link? Did they get an email?

472
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,150
Was it, you know,

473
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,989
some sort of spear fishing thing or water cooler attack or what's the deal here?

474
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,550
So,

475
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,989
yeah, I mean, that is cool

476
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,400
and you know, you do something with that.

477
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,579
This is uh, well,

478
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,640
sort of commercial plug for the cloud secure lines and the true Star stuff.

479
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,550
This is, you know, this is some of what true star is doing, right.

480
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,670
It's like, oh, this IP is associated with this fishing campaign,

481
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,260
you know.

482
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,540
So if anybody at your network talked to that IP, uh,

483
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,219
you might have a problem with passwords being, you know,

484
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,880
being sent to Russia or whatever.

485
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,189
Um,

486
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,719
because I mean, that to me,

487
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:57,920
I think is the biggest thing is you can't keep the bad guys out all the time.

488
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,599
You know, and banks have learned this right. Banks aren't robbery proof.

489
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,849
But what banks have done is they've made it so hard to

490
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:05,319
get a large amount of cash out of them that it's,

491
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:05,760
you know,

492
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,040
you can rob a banker but you're going to get a couple of grand at most. Typically,

493
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,319
it's really not worth it. You'd be better off fishing people

494
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:13,810
for.

495
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,630
And as we were talking about offline, I remember, you know, there's, oh man,

496
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,060
I lost the article but there's that bank.

497
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,079
Now that's essentially

498
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,430
um

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,609
they're going to a model where there's like

500
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,930
the only cash on the premises is essentially like

501
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,430
in ATM S and it has to have like valid transactions to get the cash out,

502
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,819
you know.

503
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,000
So it's not like the teller,

504
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,619
like because they currently have machines where the

505
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,989
teller goes up to the machine and like,

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,630
you know, beep boop, boop

507
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,300
and like out comes 500 bucks,

508
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:43,660
but you know, you do it. So it has to be tied into a legitimate transaction.

509
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,239
So now, you know, the bank robber would have to like put a gun to my head and be like, ok,

510
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,310
I need you to, like,

511
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,589
do a cash withdrawal of like 500 bucks from your account. Right.

512
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,319
So, you'd have to, like, hope there's a bunch of high rollers in the branch, you know,

513
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:54,800
with

514
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,760
large, you know, withdrawal limits.

515
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,479
Um, so that you could then force cash out of them. And, I mean, you know, and

516
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,319
that's also going to cut down on fraud and that's

517
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:06,449
going to cut down on all sorts of insider attacks.

518
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,239
So, the absurdity of this

519
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,160
is, it would take 25 minutes to rob a bank instead of four.

520
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,630
And I suspect, I don't know what the number is.

521
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,160
I'm sure someone's done a study of this, but my guess is after about 10 minutes,

522
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,219
your odds of getting arrested by police are probably very close

523
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,400
to 100% bank robbery unless you're in the middle of nowhere.

524
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,680
I mean, and that's what's actually started happening here in Alberta

525
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,920
is, people are essentially stealing ATM S from rural locations

526
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,599
and by stealing atms.

527
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,000
I mean, like using heavy equipment to, like, go take the entire ATM.

528
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,959
Right, because you can't crack an ATM open on the premises without again taking,

529
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:49,199
you know, at least a few minutes or tens of minutes.

530
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,739
Um, so, yeah, they just basically steal the entire ATM, take it somewhere, I guess.

531
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,219
And, like, chisel it open or whatever.

532
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,069
Right. Right.

533
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,540
Which is not, I mean, the whole smash and grab thing has been a, I mean, that's,

534
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,829
that's not new.

535
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,140
No, it's a classic.

536
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,500
I think we've been doing it since, like, what

537
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:09,569
ages forever.

538
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,329
It's the beginning of the first person to pick up a rock.

539
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,439
Probably created the smash and grab Robertson.

540
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,310
So,

541
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,150
yeah. Anyway, anyway, we're, we're in the, we're

542
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:20,650
in good

543
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:21,099
times.

544
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:21,229
Uh,

545
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,099
so well related to the whole encryption thing I guess would be, uh, the open SSL

546
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,650
the licensing. That's crazy. This is such a wild story.

547
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:29,849
I'm,

548
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,670
I'm glad they're doing this because the open SSL license

549
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,410
is kind of a mess and silly and I hate

550
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,260
it. So explain how joyful this, this archaic license is to us

551
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,010
it.

552
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,780
OK? So

553
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,579
for those of you who don't know

554
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,030
most open source, well, all open source because it's not open source,

555
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,260
but it doesn't have, it comes with a license

556
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,060
which basically says

557
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,150
the copyright holders

558
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,989
and in most instances,

559
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,410
it's an s there's many copyright holders are giving you

560
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,189
permission to use their copyrighted source code in this way.

561
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:09,390
And so obviously, like the Linux kernel has a license, you know,

562
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,680
Firefox has a license.

563
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,150
Open SSL has a license.

564
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:12,969
Literally,

565
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:15,910
every piece of open source software has to have some

566
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,630
sort of open source license associated with it because obviously,

567
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,020
if it didn't, it wouldn't be open source.

568
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,969
In the case of open SSL. Open SSL is really old

569
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,780
and the license was kind of created based upon

570
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,829
the three clause BS D license very long ago

571
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:33,790
and

572
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,099
it's not an ideal license.

573
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:40,140
And there's a lot of people who suspect the current open SSL license,

574
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,500
which is called literally the open SCL license

575
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,859
is incompatible with the GP L for example.

576
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,380
And there's a lot of back and forth and

577
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,400
it'll probably never get actually tested in court.

578
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:50,959
Thank goodness.

579
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:55,510
But, but fundamentally to simplify this, the open SSL guys now want to relic

580
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,000
open SSL under the Apache 2.0 license, which is a very nice license.

581
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,410
That's very BS D ish in terms of just giving

582
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,819
a lot of permissions to everybody to kind of do

583
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:08,170
almost whatever they want to do with it.

584
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,420
Yes, my understanding is, it's generally the,

585
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,339
the Apache 2.0 license is one of the

586
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:18,420
most uh commercially acceptable licenses like in the

587
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,540
sense of that's what corporations that want to

588
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,239
ship this are willing and happy to accept.

589
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,459
Yes. Yes, that's absolutely correct. But, so here's the trick. You can't just say

590
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:29,630
I'm gonna relic

591
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:31,000
open SSL.

592
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,479
SSL

593
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,469
has more than

594
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,439
if they had assigned copyright. They could, but they did not, they didn't.

595
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,520
And the SFFFSF does that the free software

596
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,400
foundation does this for this exact reason?

597
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,770
Because here's what's happening

598
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,500
is in order for Open SSL to change their license,

599
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:51,699
they have to contact more than 400 contributors who are

600
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:55,780
also copyright holders on this code and they need their permission

601
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,339
to change the license. If one of them says, no,

602
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,140
they're kind of screwed

603
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,949
and they,

604
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,319
they basically have to either rewrite that

605
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,199
code and get the original author stuff out

606
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,560
or just not change it are basically their options at that point.

607
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,719
See, and I think that might actually not be the worst thing because, you know,

608
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:17,109
some of this code probably does need a rewrite a

609
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:17,369
lot

610
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,869
of it,

611
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,150
but I can help. I don't know if you remember. Um,

612
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,550
this is going back ways uh the channel,

613
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,089
you know, the channel tunnel between Britain and France.

614
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:30,939
So one of the strategies for the people that hated the channel

615
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,750
was to buy up the farmland at either end where, you know,

616
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,290
the entrance and exit would be

617
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:39,609
and then to further complicate things

618
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,650
to sell off that farmland in like literally one inch

619
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,689
squares to like just all sorts of random people,

620
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,829
you know, through newspaper ads and stuff.

621
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:51,760
You hate a tunnel so much you would like, try to,

622
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,609
there's somebody that hates every,

623
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,890
there's always somebody that hates something no matter what,

624
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:57,689
right.

625
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,520
You know.

626
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,500
And so the idea being that, you know, then they would like, try and, you know,

627
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,069
they want,

628
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,069
they need to acquire the land to build the train tracks

629
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,650
and the tunnel entrance and stuff and they'd be like,

630
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,040
nope, sorry,

631
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,750
you got like acquire this land and it's owned by like 10 million different people.

632
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,349
So good luck with that. Ha ha we win.

633
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,560
And of course, you know, the judges were like, yeah. No.

634
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:18,829
Right. Too bad. So sad. Uh, we're invoking eminent domain and off we go.

635
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:23,089
And so, you know, that's the thing, like, when it comes to land and all that, there's,

636
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,609
uh,

637
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,900
in most jurisdictions, a lot of history of, you know,

638
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,640
the courts invoking eminent domain basically saying, like, quit being a jerk,

639
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,869
we're going to let them build this useful thing over here because it clearly,

640
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,290
you know, it's in the best interest.

641
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,170
Right? I

642
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,859
don't know. And it's

643
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,770
copyright is very different. Well, exactly. And that's,

644
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,770
first of all, is there,

645
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,739
uh, is relicensing to the Apache 2.0 license? Is it like, clearly a good thing?

646
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,410
I mean, it's

647
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:51,689
better, I would say in many ways, but it's not like, you know,

648
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,229
you have Swampland and we're gonna build like a nice city there.

649
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,199
Clearly a nice city is better than Swampland in most cases.

650
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:02,199
Are you for the record? Are you calling Open ssl a swamp or

651
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,790
I will take the fifth even though I'm Canadian

652
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,040
anyway.

653
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Yes.

654
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,989
Like you said it, it's, we're now, well,

655
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,040
and the problem is we're not only into copyright law,

656
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,119
we're into multiple jurisdictions of copyright law,

657
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,640
potentially. Yes, copyright is very complex

658
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,290
and

659
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,260
I know far more about it than I wish I did for a variety of reasons.

660
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,959
But so the fundamental problem being that

661
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,319
if you write some software,

662
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,280
you own the copyright on that

663
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:41,510
and you can attach an open source license to it which gives certain rights to the,

664
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,699
I guess, user or receiver recipient, whatever you wanna call them.

665
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:48,760
But you still own that copyright and I mean, you could write,

666
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,589
you could write software on the moon

667
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,459
and

668
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,609
you still have that copyright. It doesn't matter where you do it.

669
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,369
Copyright.

670
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:56,949
Ottawa signs in.

671
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,660
I know the US and I believe Canada and then most Western jurisdictions,

672
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,969
for the most part, a lot of these,

673
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:06,300
these countries have treaties that recognize one another's copyrights.

674
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,630
In fact, I know the US

675
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,810
has done a fabulous job of strong arming most

676
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,949
other countries into accepting kind of their copyright terms.

677
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,829
Thanks to,

678
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,670
we'll say a handful of large media corporations that resigns.

679
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,050
Right.

680
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,699
It's, it's so complex though.

681
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:25,939
Well,

682
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:28,119
I'm actually glad in a way that copyright Auto was

683
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,640
signs because otherwise you'd have all these people who just

684
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,560
either can't be bothered to, you know,

685
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:35,160
go submit their copyright or whatever.

686
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:35,920
Um,

687
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,890
but the problem is now we've gone to the term where copyrights are what,

688
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,050
like 90 years plus

689
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:40,849
dead.

690
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,329
Yeah, exactly.

691
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,979
That's the problem.

692
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,920
This is such a complicated topic and

693
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:53,079
we probably shouldn't get in the weeds on this right here right now. But I think

694
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:54,439
fundamentally

695
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,140
this is a great move by open SSL.

696
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,079
I hope they're successful, but they have a ton of crazy pain

697
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,729
in front of them. I mean, this is, I know

698
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:06,359
there's been talk of this for example,

699
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,199
like in the Linux kernel to look at maybe relicensing it

700
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:12,599
as some something else other than GP L version two.

701
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:13,520
And,

702
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,109
and very quickly it was decided that this is impossible

703
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,550
and there is no way to actually do it.

704
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,349
And you have to think there's people are dead,

705
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,150
there are people who, nobody knows where they are anymore.

706
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,250
There's people who don't care anymore. There's people who wouldn't like it.

707
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,790
It's completely

708
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:30,119
crazy

709
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,739
question. How do you even know?

710
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:36,109
Like, I mean, in some cases these people are literally just an email address.

711
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:39,780
Yeah. Yeah. In a lot of cases that's going to happen. And

712
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:44,790
I, if I had to guess open SSL is trying to contact more than 400 people,

713
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,869
I bet 10 to 20% of them will be uncontacted,

714
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,979
which means you have to figure out what are we going to do now?

715
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,560
Well, they

716
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,780
put up a website where you can search to see if

717
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,160
your name or whatever your email address is in the,

718
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,099
you know, responsible for any of the code.

719
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,599
Right.

720
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,849
Yes. But

721
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:03,910
there are people who are dead

722
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:04,810
like

723
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:05,290
there,

724
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,150
I guarantee there's people who've worked on openness as l who are no longer alive.

725
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,680
And so now you have next of kin issues, for example, that you have to deal with.

726
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,589
See,

727
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,949
part of me wonders are they gonna go with sort of a best

728
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,400
effort to contact them and then just do it and see if anybody,

729
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,979
because the reality is, unless somebody, like, actually

730
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:23,300
complains and by complaints, I don't mean, just, like,

731
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,479
sends out a nasty email but actually, like, takes them to a court of law.

732
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,109
Right. I mean, you're basically gonna get away with it.

733
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,089
Kind of like Uber with their whole, like, oh, we're not a taxi company

734
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,859
and we're just gonna ignore all these rules and, you know, and until cities started,

735
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:37,000
like,

736
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,380
finding them and taking them to court Uber was while getting away with being Uber.

737
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,880
But here's the problem with something like open SSL is if they

738
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,199
don't have explicit permission for every line of code from every contributor,

739
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,229
you now have something that yes, they could say

740
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,329
it's covered by another license.

741
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,319
But what would happen if Lord forbid one of these,

742
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:03,780
we'll say disagreeable copyright holders showed up one day and started demanding,

743
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,790
you know, royalties or, or whatnot out of

744
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,449
some other organization.

745
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,150
Now, granted,

746
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I know there's a lot of nuance to this and that's really probably not

747
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,810
something that's even remotely plausible given it

748
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,160
already has an open source license.

749
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:16,680
But you can,

750
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,479
you understand the unknown

751
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:23,270
it's introduced here that would make this even less palatable I think,

752
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,800
which is the whole reason to change the license

753
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,959
is to make it more palatable to more organizations.

754
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:29,310
Right.

755
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,420
Well, I think realistically, one thing to keep in mind is, you know,

756
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,420
if somebody's written code for open SSL and that code has

757
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,890
existed in open SSL for say five or 10 years unchanged

758
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:40,069
and,

759
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,550
you know, obviously

760
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,140
not really maintained otherwise, it would have been rewritten by definition,

761
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,900
you know, uh

762
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,270
I'm guessing a lot of that old code would actually not be super hard to replace.

763
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,349
I mean, it would be a chore and a pain. Yes.

764
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,810
But I mean, from a legal point of view,

765
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,900
it's obviously it's probably gonna be a lot less work than trying to chase down next

766
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,599
of kin or some estate and trying to get them to sign off on this thing,

767
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,849
you know, and that's assuming you,

768
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,699
after you spend 20 hours explaining to them what the heck is going on.

769
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:06,140
Right. Right.

770
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:09,709
Because, you know, I know, even if I got a phone call like that, I'd be like,

771
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,689
what in there, you know,

772
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,650
like what's going on here?

773
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:13,770
Right. Right.

774
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:14,900
Oh, my goodness.

775
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,569
So I, I'm just, I'm also curious as to why they're actually changing the license.

776
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,270
Like, yeah, it's definitely a good thing that clarifies things, you know,

777
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,290
the A PL 2.0 is a lot more clear than the open SSL license.

778
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,050
But it's not like people aren't shipping open SSL because of the license? Right.

779
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,469
Or am I missing something?

780
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,000
No. Well, people ship it but there's some

781
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,609
shady area

782
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,680
kind of around this. And so I, I think this is the right thing to do

783
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:45,170
and I suspect that part of this is because open SSL

784
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,530
has very much had an awakening over the last couple of years

785
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,599
where they're, they're fixing a lot of things and like,

786
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,719
this has been an elephant in the room

787
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,869
forever

788
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:55,800
and I,

789
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,739
I commend them for tackling this because this

790
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,040
is monumental to the point of almost impossible.

791
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:02,910
So

792
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,800
good luck. God bless. Right.

793
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,089
Yeah.

794
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:10,728
No, I, I, personal preference would be because I've seen people use, like,

795
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,590
just made up licenses and it's, you know, it's just, it's annoying

796
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,659
because I'm,

797
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm not a lawyer and I don't know whether or

798
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,139
not this license is even remotely valid or complete garbage,

799
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,110
you know, whereas if they use an O si approved open source license, it's like, well,

800
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,139
I don't understand it

801
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,340
but these O SI guys claim that they do and they claim that it's ok and

802
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:32,600
really there's not a lot more I can do without spending like 50 to 100 grand on a good,

803
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,219
you know, lawyer.

804
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,340
Right. Which

805
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,550
nobody's going to do,

806
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,228
just try getting it into Fedora as part of the Fedora package review process.

807
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,629
It gets a legal looking over if it has a strange license and,

808
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,149
yeah, it's,

809
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:48,860
it's very interesting

810
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,978
reading the emails that come across the Fedora legal list.

811
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,270
It's, it's awesome.

812
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,300
I can't even imagine. I don't want to.

813
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,510
No, it's good. It's good. It's

814
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,219
all good fun. All good fun. Yeah.

815
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,179
So moving along, I guess we, uh, we have

816
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:04,199
World

817
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,030
dishwasher.

818
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,129
We have to talk about the dishwasher,

819
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,939
the directory traversal attack and a dishwasher.

820
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,449
See,

821
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:13,040
I love this because like a dishwasher is something you

822
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,729
could use to actually really mess up somebody's day.

823
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,120
Like, you know, fill it with super heated steam and say it's OK to open,

824
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,669
you know, you pop the dishwasher open and out comes a bunch of super heated steam.

825
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,320
No,

826
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,070
maybe, I mean, just

827
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,139
why is there a directory Dre

828
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,860
deck in a dishwasher? Because it has a web browser.

829
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,560
It has a, I don't think it has a web, web server. I don't think this was a

830
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,570
browser

831
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,739
or web

832
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:41,050
because there's,

833
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,290
yeah, I, well, there was that smart TV.

834
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,129
I was just watching that smart TV that has a built in web browser

835
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,929
that supports flash, right? Because it's a, you know,

836
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,550
well, no, because it's a smart TV. And you might want to browse the web on it because

837
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,629
flash.

838
00:35:56,429 --> 00:36:00,120
But that means that flash doesn't work on arm chips, does it?

839
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:04,409
Well, no, it wasn't quite, you, you could get flash, I forget.

840
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:07,449
But anyways point being is that you could attack it through flash, which

841
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,330
I mean, basically the second you have uh Adobe flash on something, it's,

842
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,290
it's just a matter of time until you get hacked.

843
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,409
Right. Seriously. You know, like that fedex $5 thing, right? Like,

844
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:18,399
so fedex

845
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,139
has apparently some label printing website or something or software. I don't know

846
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,500
that, you know, relies on flash to work and create these labels.

847
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,379
And of course, you know, like I, I've banned Flash from my household and it's,

848
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,850
it's actually pretty easy because, you know,

849
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,020
we're an Apple household so all the mobile devices by default just can't have it.

850
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,850
Thank goodness.

851
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,179
Um,

852
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:42,020
and so, you know, fedex is like, offering people, what is it,

853
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,360
like a $5 coupon if they install flash and use the software,

854
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,040
it's not worth $5.

855
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:47,649
Well, exactly.

856
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:52,620
I mean, just, just in, in the, the time you're gonna spend updating flash every month

857
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,195
or every two months or whatever it is, a

858
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:57,864
loan is going to eat up more than $5 of your time. The fact that you're gonna get,

859
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:02,854
you're, you're, you're definitely going to get hacked by a flash at some point.

860
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:05,824
Like it's just statistically, you know, it's not gonna happen.

861
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,625
And um

862
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,989
yeah, I mean, to, in my mind, like the III I don't have strong, like,

863
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,590
I don't ban a lot of things,

864
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,739
but the two things I've banned in my household are

865
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,290
like Java for the web browser and Adobe Flash.

866
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:22,429
I like how you add for the web browser

867
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:25,669
because there'd be no Minecraft if you banned Java

868
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,080
ipad man,

869
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:31,120
which probably still runs Java.

870
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:31,800
Yeah.

871
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,699
Anyways.

872
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,969
Um But yeah, I mean, it's, you know, I'm not anti Java per se. I'm just really anti

873
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,199
Java in the web browser.

874
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:39,379
Uh

875
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,179
Yeah, I, I think it's safe to say at this point that web browser plugins,

876
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:48,489
especially when they're running, turn complete applications are a bad idea

877
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,040
and especially when they're running in sandboxes that are, you know,

878
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,760
not very well done apparently.

879
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,899
Right.

880
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,780
Ok. So back to this dishwasher.

881
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,110
I love this story and

882
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,989
here's the real reason

883
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,790
that I love it is

884
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,570
ignoring all of the hilarious jokes we can make about a dishwasher with Wi Fi

885
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,239
that has a directory. Traversal flaw

886
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,030
is

887
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,330
the bigger problem is people who build

888
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,530
dishwashers probably don't know anything about computer security

889
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,489
and why would they? Right.

890
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:25,080
Well, that's, that's the reality. Right. Is, is

891
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:25,830
outside,

892
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,540
I was gonna say, outside of the it industry,

893
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,800
outside of a small part of the it industry, everything is now the it industry.

894
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,739
Correct. Exactly. That's the problem. Right.

895
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
Uh,

896
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,290
you want to build cars while they're gonna be self driving and

897
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,679
that means you're gonna have a ton of computers on them,

898
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:43,540
you know, you want to build apparently appliances now

899
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:46,790
where everything's gonna have, you know, a computer, like a,

900
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,449
a legitimate computer in it.

901
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,969
Not just like some little CP, uh, you know, not some little custom chip that, like,

902
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:53,209
controls your toaster, but

903
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:55,689
heck might as well put an arm CPU in there that can run

904
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,929
a, you know, uh, wifi and some other stuff so it can talk to other stuff.

905
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:02,030
Yeah. I mean,

906
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,010
so

907
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:08,889
the cost of installing flash, you too can have Wi Fi in your dishwasher. Right.

908
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,979
So, yeah, No, it's, I, I kind of wonder because, uh, at some point

909
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:18,489
are we going to be able to buy things without this capability?

910
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:20,129
No, we will not.

911
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,489
And I think we're, we're rapidly approaching

912
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:24,320
the,

913
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,870
I guess, universal iot

914
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,919
just point of no return that event horizon where now everything has

915
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,679
wi fi whether you want it or not

916
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,409
and more of a concern.

917
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,989
A lot of these things are running servers that are like,

918
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,739
really insecure or they're running update systems that are really insecure

919
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,469
with the web server. Yeah.

920
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,080
You know,

921
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,219
and that's true. You think that? I wonder if this thing has an update method?

922
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:53,489
I bet.

923
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,629
I, well, if it does have an update it would only be for several years.

924
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,010
And I, it's funny actually because CBC marketplace was just did, it did, uh, uh,

925
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,520
some articles on sort of this whole appliance industry

926
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,310
and how it's just a complete disaster now because,

927
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,669
ok, let me ask you this.

928
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,709
How many major appliance makers do you think there are globally?

929
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,780
There's, there's probably only, what, four or five, maybe

930
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,659
Bingo four.

931
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:15,959
Yeah,

932
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,189
it's really small

933
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:17,580
and

934
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,449
it's the same thing when people are, like, what computer should I buy?

935
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,209
And I'm like, there's like two companies that make them all.

936
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,070
It really doesn't matter.

937
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,129
There's Foxconn and the other one.

938
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,719
Right. That, right. Exactly.

939
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:28,389
You know, the reason, you know about Foxconn it's because of,

940
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:29,739
like Apple and the Happy Nets.

941
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,419
So,

942
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,419
the happiness catching nets.

943
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,580
Right. Right.

944
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,389
It's like a big hug to show we care.

945
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,139
Welcome to the future. This is the good news is they're replacing

946
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:41,100
the robots.

947
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,250
Yes, which is hilarious because obviously

948
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:49,649
the whole reason Foxconn is in China is because of the low wage

949
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:53,209
that they get to pay the employees. And apparently robots are cheaper

950
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,330
and they make lots of mistakes.

951
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:55,780
They

952
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,110
don't.

953
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,290
So I should.

954
00:40:58,669 --> 00:40:59,030
But

955
00:40:59,199 --> 00:40:59,429
no, it,

956
00:40:59,719 --> 00:40:59,959
it, it

957
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:00,560
really

958
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:00,889
is.

959
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,340
So. Yeah. No.

960
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,360
So there's basically four appliance manufacturers

961
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,679
and the majority of the appliances

962
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:08,389
that are being built now only last 2 to 5 years.

963
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,780
Like we're talking and we're talking major things like fridges, washers, dryers,

964
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,429
you know, and, you know, and granted,

965
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:15,719
I don't want an appliance now that lasts like 40

966
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:18,219
years because the thing is gonna be so energy inefficient,

967
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,830
you know, 40 years from now and

968
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,629
so laughably obsolete, you know, it's,

969
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,870
I don't necessarily want that, but on the flip side, I,

970
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:28,149
I would like to have a dishwasher that lasts at least 10 years,

971
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,080
you know, a fridge that keeps my food cold.

972
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,899
Like, fundamentally, I want my fridge to do two things, you know, have an,

973
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,879
I have like a freezer area and have like a cold area

974
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,469
and show.

975
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:41,040
But you can, you can have wi I in a web server for

976
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:43,959
the low, low price of, uh, you don't get to choose.

977
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:44,979
Yeah.

978
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:48,120
And I mean, what drives me nuts too is when I, I've looked at these smart fridges.

979
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,179
None of them have like a really good say for example, barcode scanner so I can like,

980
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,939
you know, drink the last cup of milk.

981
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:57,739
Barcode scan the milk and boom, it gets added to the grocery list.

982
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:02,840
That sounds like a useful feature. But I bet it can watch youtube. Yeah.

983
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,800
Well, and I've seen ones that have like you can kind of, you know,

984
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,669
talk to grocery list or whatever, but, you know, I want something a little bit more,

985
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,389
you know,

986
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:13,310
that I can integrate with my existing systems, you know,

987
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,399
and I mean, my classic favorite is there was that smart fridge that was, um,

988
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,889
it had software to talk to Google calendar.

989
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,290
So it could display like your calendar kind of like, you know, on your little

990
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,070
vaguely use,

991
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,560
you could do the same thing by just printing off a piece of paper.

992
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,770
No, but here's the problem. Uh, Google depreciated that api some time ago

993
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:34,770
even better.

994
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:38,409
And of course you're not going to get a fridge update for it. So,

995
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,330
well, that was a nice feature that you no longer get to have.

996
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,280
Whoops,

997
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,429
you know, and see,

998
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,689
that's why I'm really hesitant to go with these smart appliances is like,

999
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:52,679
um, didn't youtube have some API that they, they deprecated a long time ago and,

1000
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:52,979
you know, a

1001
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:53,429
whole

1002
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:53,709
bunch of

1003
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,560
Samsung or LG or

1004
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:58,610
one of their TV S quit working. I do remember that. Exactly.

1005
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,540
So, you know, and this is one of the reasons why I prefer having,

1006
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,129
say something like an Apple TV or a computer hooked up to my TV.

1007
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,679
Because I, you know, I,

1008
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:08,669
in general,

1009
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,189
I feel things like computers running Mac Os or Linux

1010
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:13,939
or Windows are probably gonna get updates for a while,

1011
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:14,699
you know,

1012
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,580
same thing with the Apple TV. And, you know, versus the Samsung TV.

1013
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,129
S or the LG or whoever.

1014
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:21,110
Um,

1015
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:24,219
well, funny story too is uh when we were talking the other day,

1016
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:25,860
I was trying to remember what brand of TV.

1017
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,270
I own.

1018
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:31,810
We and II, I don't know anymore. Right. They're, they're black and they're flat.

1019
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:35,649
I only know because mine comes with Roku built in and insignia

1020
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,770
is the only company that does that

1021
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,500
I've never even heard of them.

1022
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,669
After doing a lot of research, I think they're an off brand sold by Best Buy.

1023
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,050
They may only be sold by Best Buy.

1024
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,629
In fact, because like when I go to Costco now and I, I mean, I recognize,

1025
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,649
I think they sell Toshiba who I've heard of,

1026
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:55,889
but then there's all these other brands and I'm like, I never heard of them.

1027
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:57,959
Well, you, you know what part of it is though, is,

1028
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,260
it's probably this similar story of,

1029
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,850
I believe it's the giant mountain bike company is they used to

1030
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,070
make all the parts for all these other mountain bike companies.

1031
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,820
And when did you like, why are we making parts for everyone else?

1032
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,199
Let's just make our own bikes.

1033
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:12,620
And

1034
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,120
are they?

1035
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:13,639
Right,

1036
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:16,189
they basically started making their own bikes and now they're

1037
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,020
very popular and obviously they're high quality because they,

1038
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,060
they knew what the supply chain was.

1039
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,939
And I imagine a lot of these off brand things you see are just,

1040
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:27,629
the manufacturers are like, well, screw it.

1041
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,540
Let's just put our own logo on it and,

1042
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,889
and dump it into the US market and people will

1043
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:33,780
buy them and they will because let's face it,

1044
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,260
people generally don't care.

1045
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:39,860
But this also we can bring back to this dish dishwasher discussion of

1046
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:44,489
if, if these ODM type manufacturers are able to just

1047
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,149
make them

1048
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,520
ODM. Now there's like OEM which is original equipment and ODM

1049
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:50,159
original

1050
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:51,739
original device

1051
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,320
manufacturer,

1052
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,290
there's a level beneath the OEM

1053
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:57,300
and the ODM

1054
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:57,550
are

1055
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:57,719
just

1056
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,080
screw it. Let's just skip these guys and, and do it ourselves.

1057
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:05,050
And so this is what you're seeing happen now

1058
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:05,889
is

1059
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,209
and, and additionally, so here's the thing. So let's say you want to regulate

1060
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,929
the, the IOT and you say if you're gonna sell the dishwasher with Wi Fi,

1061
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:15,489
you need to get this license here.

1062
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,459
Well, what happens if someone just makes like, you know,

1063
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:21,050
whatever happy brand dishwashers and they,

1064
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,530
they dump a couple million of them on the market and the,

1065
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,120
and the regulator show up say, oh no, no.

1066
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:28,010
You know we're gonna come after you guys, you need this license

1067
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:32,290
like, oh yeah, uh Happy dishwasher went out of business. Now we're selling, uh,

1068
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,790
you know, joyous dishwashers and,

1069
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,629
and this is totally different and you know what I mean?

1070
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,510
Like, you, you cannot stop this.

1071
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,629
Well, and I mean, more to the point,

1072
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,100
I'm not sure it would legally be allowed because now with

1073
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,919
things like the WTO and various other trade deals that we've had

1074
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,030
internationally,

1075
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:53,300
uh, you could probably make a very strong argument that this is like, uh,

1076
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,689
essentially they're trying to do an end, run an end, run around tariffs and taxes,

1077
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,100
you know, by requiring, like, legal blah, blah, blah for Wi Fi enabled devices when,

1078
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,919
you know, they never did this before and they're not doing it for these other things.

1079
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:07,929
That

1080
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,199
would be

1081
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:08,520
interesting.

1082
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:13,159
I mean, I, I, if I, you know, if I, if I was the guy in China trying to get around this,

1083
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:15,750
that I would look at, you know, arguments around that because,

1084
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:16,389
you know,

1085
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,750
then it goes to like that wonky

1086
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,969
WTO arbitration which bypasses national governments.

1087
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,459
So

1088
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,100
I'm not sure we're even at a point

1089
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,530
where we could legally regulate this stuff anymore,

1090
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,949
even if we had like, the strength of will to do so politically and, and there isn't,

1091
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:32,830
I mean, we, yeah, I don't think any

1092
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:33,489
will be

1093
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,360
in the garbage dump in five years.

1094
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:35,919
Right.

1095
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,489
Right.

1096
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,800
Well, not only that everything changes so fast by the time you have a regulation.

1097
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:43,639
It is, it's going to be irrelevant.

1098
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,449
I mean, this would be like

1099
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:50,419
writing regulations about the internet via dial up

1100
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:52,800
and it's like no one does that anymore.

1101
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,520
Guys. This, this doesn't matter.

1102
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,360
See, and my one concern here is, uh,

1103
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:00,679
so the average age of a car in the US car fleet is I believe 11 years.

1104
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,739
That's what I hear.

1105
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,260
So, you know, somebody was talking about, um,

1106
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:07,679
essentially, you know,

1107
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:13,540
if we phase out like TLS 101112 and we move everything to 1.3 which is great.

1108
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:17,300
Kind of, when do we actually have to do that in cars to make sure, say 10 years from now,

1109
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,429
90% of them have TLS 1.3.

1110
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:22,290
And the answer is like we have to get it done in the next two years

1111
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:25,320
because of the cycles because the thing to remember

1112
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,879
too is the cycles for creating these devices.

1113
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:28,169
You know,

1114
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,169
this dishwasher company isn't going to, you know,

1115
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,090
be spending like an obscene amount of money on the software.

1116
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,070
They're gonna do like the bare minimum. Of

1117
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:40,399
course, you know, pull something off the shelf, get it working and boom, we're done,

1118
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:43,520
you know, and unless there's like a Showstopper bug where the thing catches fire

1119
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:45,080
even then, man.

1120
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:46,330
Yeah. You know,

1121
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:51,520
so I, I, I'm at the point where I, I don't think regulations will work. I think what

1122
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,360
I think the only thing that can possibly even stand a

1123
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,219
chance of making things slightly better is the consumer style reports.

1124
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:57,989
A thing where

1125
00:47:58,129 --> 00:48:01,330
we have to kind of get things so bad where people actually do start, you know,

1126
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,909
when they buy cars, they pay attention to what the consumer reports,

1127
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:05,169
safety crash rating is.

1128
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:09,439
Uh, maybe it, it could also something like underwriter labs

1129
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:12,909
when you, I mean, well, you, I forget what the Canadian organization is called,

1130
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:15,330
but in the US, we have UL and obviously

1131
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:17,949
you're, you're not supposed to sell

1132
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,979
electrical equipment without the UL logo.

1133
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,540
Well, and my understanding of the deal is there is like a lot of insurance and stuff.

1134
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,070
Well, you know,

1135
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,000
if you buy non UL approved stuff and plug it

1136
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,469
into your house and it burns your house down,

1137
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:29,389
it's kind of like, well,

1138
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:32,469
we're sorry you did that, we're not gonna cover it, you know,

1139
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:33,219
um,

1140
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:36,639
or if you like, rewire your house yourself and don't get, uh, you know,

1141
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:38,530
a licensed electrician to do it.

1142
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,520
They're like, yeah, that

1143
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:40,840
you shouldn't have done that,

1144
00:48:41,379 --> 00:48:42,250
which takes,

1145
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:46,120
you know, it makes sense. Right, because you can't have people randomly

1146
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:48,379
messing around with this stuff and, you know,

1147
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:51,169
expect it to not end in tears at least once in a while.

1148
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,280
Um,

1149
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,479
so, yeah, I think really the only way it's going to happen is that sort of

1150
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:01,330
because insurance is a really insurance is a big industry and they understand,

1151
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:04,169
you know, risk assessment, like that's their entire lifeblood

1152
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:05,159
and

1153
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:07,610
they do occasionally get it horribly wrong

1154
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:12,610
and, you know, they suffer for it and then they typically tend to, you know,

1155
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,570
change how they operate.

1156
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,010
So a great example being, you know, is, is these insurers used to,

1157
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,489
uh,

1158
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:21,320
you know, take on risk insurance and,

1159
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,879
you know, but occasionally you'd have a s, a

1160
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,810
really catastrophic event

1161
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,110
but they actually had to cover, you know, with, without being, you know,

1162
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,919
like an act of God or an act of war.

1163
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:35,070
And so these insurers would just get clobbered, right and lose a ton of money.

1164
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,070
And now, you know, they have this concept of reinsurance. So,

1165
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:40,449
you know, I as an insurance company will say,

1166
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:44,649
insure like $10 billion of property in where hurricanes happen,

1167
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,689
I will then take that $10 billion of, you know,

1168
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:52,030
insurance kind of load and split it up into say 100 packets

1169
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,909
and sell that to 100 different companies, right? So that

1170
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,110
they, you know, when there is a catastrophic event,

1171
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,550
you know, that, that,

1172
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,510
that damage essentially is spread out among multiple companies

1173
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,550
rather than just one big company taking the hit.

1174
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:05,840
Sure.

1175
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:08,989
Um And I suspect the same will have to happen

1176
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,879
for anything to change because

1177
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:13,439
yeah, politically it's not gonna happen technologically,

1178
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,750
it's not gonna happen because there's no economic incentive to spend

1179
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,669
money on being secure when you're pushing out dishwashers that,

1180
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,290
you know, people are going to throw it in five years anyways.

1181
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,080
Well, we've discussed this before.

1182
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:27,510
I mean, if, if you went to the store and dishwasher A said

1183
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:32,570
with added security and it cost $50 more. Dishwasher. B was like, regular security.

1184
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,389
I would probably buy dishwasher. B,

1185
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,250
yeah.

1186
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:37,889
Yeah, me too. I mean,

1187
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:41,229
it's not like, I mean, the reality is, I,

1188
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:45,199
I don't know what added security means and even if they put in, like, you know,

1189
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,610
I don't know, whatever version of TLS it supports, I mean,

1190
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:50,030
unless they put in something really specific, like, you know,

1191
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,449
this thing will get guaranteed security updates

1192
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,030
for, say, five years

1193
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,080
and here's how we define security updates and here's how, you know,

1194
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,290
the response time and everything.

1195
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:02,889
But at that point, we're getting into an area that, like, literally nobody does

1196
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,889
and

1197
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,120
I'm gonna save $50 and go buy a new game for my Nintendo switch.

1198
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:09,550
That's

1199
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,530
basically what would happen.

1200
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:12,419
Yeah, exactly.

1201
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,540
Um, so,

1202
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:16,889
yeah. No, it's,

1203
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,570
again, we're doomed.

1204
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:23,159
It's $5 dishwashers, sorry, $5 rebates for installing flash on your dishwasher.

1205
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:25,439
Oh, man. Flash in your dishwasher. I love it.

1206
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:30,659
So, and, well, and you know, and speaking of safety and security, right?

1207
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:31,919
There's like that recent, like,

1208
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:36,250
laptop slash ipad ban on like Middle Eastern carriers.

1209
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,540
Um, so for those of you that haven't heard, apparently, uh, the US government

1210
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:43,659
sent out something basically saying, you know,

1211
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:48,969
you cannot take anything bigger than, like, a cell phone onto

1212
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:54,379
an airplane for a certain subset of Middle Eastern comp uh countries and flights.

1213
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:56,600
And so, you know, the internet is,

1214
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,959
of course abuzz with rumors and it really seems to boil down to either a,

1215
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,840
there's like some plot by terrorists to, like,

1216
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,120
fill an ipad full of explosives and blow up an airplane.

1217
00:52:05,729 --> 00:52:08,389
Uh, b this is some sort of, um,

1218
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,300
punitive measure again to do an end, run around like, you know,

1219
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,929
treaties and stuff and to basically punish certain Middle Eastern carriers.

1220
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,199
Uh because, you know,

1221
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:19,600
the reality is like business travelers are not going to get

1222
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,699
on a flight where they can't have their laptop or ipad,

1223
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,479
you know, I, I would be hesitant to,

1224
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:27,580
it would, it would be a and that those are long flights.

1225
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,139
These are like super crazy long flights. Now,

1226
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,899
if you look though

1227
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,229
Schneer

1228
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:37,899
did some writing on this and he has some inside information,

1229
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,649
it sounds like we're basically,

1230
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:44,649
this is not politically motivated that there's actually some sort of intelligence

1231
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:50,050
decision behind this where they're using this to mitigate a real threat.

1232
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,919
Well, and then there's that third sort of thought process on this where it's like,

1233
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:55,709
well, maybe,

1234
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,709
you know, by separating travelers from their laptops and ipads,

1235
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,500
you can now, you know, stick in USB key, turn it on and, you know,

1236
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,949
compromise their devices

1237
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,379
and it is conceivable

1238
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:10,290
that something like that is part of this because

1239
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:13,419
that, that isn't necessarily politically motivated

1240
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,620
in that respect. And, and that's actually the first thing I thought of is

1241
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:19,560
I would be hesitant to let my laptop

1242
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,070
o off of my person in this manner

1243
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,110
because

1244
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:27,649
I mean, you always hear these stories about the baggage handlers essentially,

1245
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:31,540
you know, like, like rifling through bags and taking things and all that.

1246
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:32,310
Oh, yeah.

1247
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,239
Well, there was that case recently, that guy that, you know,

1248
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,520
got done up after stealing dozens of laptops.

1249
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:36,770
Right.

1250
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,030
I mean, and I know for myself, I've had those, those Ts,

1251
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,770
a inspection pamphlets or whatever you call them, the little piece of paper saying,

1252
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,189
you know, your bag was inspected by the TS A,

1253
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,270
uh, for whatever reason

1254
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,229
and, you know, and they smashed the heck out of that, um, tablet, you know,

1255
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:53,479
you got me like they just, oh,

1256
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,290
the poor thing was just destroyed.

1257
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:56,530
Um,

1258
00:53:57,669 --> 00:53:57,889
yeah.

1259
00:53:57,899 --> 00:54:02,290
So, I mean, I, I, yeah, I've on multiple occasions had my checked luggage, you know,

1260
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,040
rifled through because quite honestly, like,

1261
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,610
I'll typically have like a big pile of wires in there,

1262
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,429
you know. And so

1263
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:14,389
it keeps mine checked all the time is I use a safety razor

1264
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,949
when I shave and I will put safety razor blades in my check bag.

1265
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:23,239
And every time I've had safety razor blades in the bag it gets checked.

1266
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,949
I get one of the little tags regardless of country, even

1267
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,070
like I've had this happen in Europe and in the us. Yep. Yep.

1268
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:30,989
So, whatever.

1269
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:31,949
That's how it is.

1270
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,939
This,

1271
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,909
I don't know, man. It, it's so crazy.

1272
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:38,310
It's such a bizarre story and I guess here's part of the problem and this,

1273
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:41,629
we'll, we'll try to tie everything back up into this is

1274
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,330
it comes down to transparency

1275
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,530
when you tell people to do something and you don't give them a good reason to do it.

1276
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,350
They don't like that.

1277
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,449
Well, when you tell them to do something inconvenient to themselves,

1278
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,629
that's ok.

1279
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:56,399
That, that's, yeah,

1280
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,840
that's a very good point because the inconvenience is a huge part of that.

1281
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,000
Like in the case of Symantec versus Google,

1282
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,620
Google is being very transparent here.

1283
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:08,949
And so Symantec obviously has to be defensive.

1284
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:13,189
Whereas if Symantec somehow could become more transparent,

1285
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,830
Google would end up being defensive.

1286
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,810
In this case, you've got

1287
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:22,070
the government and this is, this is typical of intelligence, just it's how it is.

1288
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,659
They're not telling you why

1289
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,620
and they won't tell you why because that secrecy is part of their secret sauce.

1290
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,590
But because of that now people are saying

1291
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,719
what's going on is this politically motivated?

1292
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,500
Is this,

1293
00:55:33,669 --> 00:55:37,209
you know, are they stealing computers? Are they cutting data off computers?

1294
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:38,699
Are they, does this even make sense?

1295
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:38,909
Yeah.

1296
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,139
I mean, the problem is they can't say, well,

1297
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:43,469
we have a real world threat of people trying to pack explosives into ipads, you know,

1298
00:55:43,479 --> 00:55:46,310
and we spotted it last Thursday and everybody like, oh, ok.

1299
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:49,120
But obviously they can't do that, to be honest with you.

1300
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:51,750
I bet it's not even that because

1301
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:56,110
this, the way they did this makes that the logical outcome,

1302
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,830
which tells me that isn't the reason they're doing it.

1303
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,310
It's something else

1304
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,280
because

1305
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,149
the intelligence people are smart enough to understand what logical outcomes

1306
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,159
are when they make decisions and they make sure that's not,

1307
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:12,500
they, they, they make sure the logical outcome isn't the one they're looking for.

1308
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,659
So it's, it's craziness, man. It's all crazy.

1309
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:21,100
Yeah, I mean, my fear is honestly if that, if that policy spreads globally, I mean,

1310
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,219
that's gonna make flying just a pain in the ass.

1311
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,879
I don't even want to think about it, you know, like I don't want to get on a, like

1312
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:31,129
I don't want to get on a flight with my kids without their ipads.

1313
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,909
Oh my goodness. I can't imagine.

1314
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:33,449
Like

1315
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,169
hopefully

1316
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,719
please just let the Nintendo switch on.

1317
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:37,260
Yeah.

1318
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:41,239
Well, and that's what's interesting is I know for a fact, like they're always like,

1319
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,459
you have to open, what is it?

1320
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:42,919
You have to like,

1321
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:44,810
open your laptop and turn it on and make sure

1322
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:47,385
and show them it's working unless it's a Mac device.

1323
00:56:47,395 --> 00:56:48,465
I guess the theory being, you know,

1324
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:51,885
mac devices have like no space in them to hide contraband or, you know,

1325
00:56:51,895 --> 00:56:53,064
other shenanigans,

1326
00:56:53,395 --> 00:56:54,635
you know, same thing with um

1327
00:56:54,794 --> 00:56:58,415
because my, my Apple Air, right, my little uh laptop

1328
00:56:58,594 --> 00:57:01,264
I have um like a nice gel sticker on the front of it.

1329
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:02,929
And,

1330
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:04,020
you know,

1331
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,320
I've had them not recognize it as an Apple device and then I open it and they're, and

1332
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:10,139
they're like, 00, it's an Apple. Yeah, you don't have to turn it on. Right.

1333
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,550
I've never had that happen to me and hopefully I never will.

1334
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:16,439
Yeah. And so, and same thing with tablets. Right.

1335
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:19,270
You don't have to turn tablets on to prove that they work, you know.

1336
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:21,010
Um

1337
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,520
But I mean, and the ugly truth though is that, you know,

1338
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,469
with increasing battery capacity,

1339
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,290
we're we're approaching the point where batteries

1340
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,570
have the energy density of explosives.

1341
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,229
So like

1342
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,300
legitimately what happens then when somebody can like,

1343
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:34,929
you know, stab or

1344
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,510
essentially compromise the battery,

1345
00:57:38,479 --> 00:57:40,639
you're gonna get us put on a list, I think

1346
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,489
it's time to bring it home.

1347
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,179
We get ourselves into trouble.

1348
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:47,330
