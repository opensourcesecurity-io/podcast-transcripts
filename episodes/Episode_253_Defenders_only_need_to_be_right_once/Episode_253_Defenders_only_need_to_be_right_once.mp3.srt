Hello and welcome to the open source security

1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,810
podcast with my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:10,569
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,729
You hesitated there for a minute.

4
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,529
I don't think I have the energy to do real crime right now.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,030
That's ok. I understand my two levels.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,719
My sat levels are, they're definitely better.

7
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,170
They're like 9695 when I'm sitting and not moving and not talking.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,510
So they're probably going to dip to about 92.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,909
-- No
-- one knows what that means.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,950
Oh, I had bacterial pneumonia over Christmas.

11
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,409
Which seems funny because we've actually had,

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,250
we pre recorded a whole bunch of content prior to Christmas.

13
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:34,759
-- Good thing
-- we

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,119
did.

15
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,459
And then Kurt got, like,

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,979
-- deathly ill to the point I was seriously concerned about him. Uh,
-- not deathly ill.

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,240
Like, if I let it go another week then, yeah, I would have been deathly anyway.

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,330
Yeah, that's, it's the, I've had pneumonia before but typically I, you know,

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,520
go in very early and say, like, I'm sick and they go, here's antibiotics,

20
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:56,840
get better and I do.

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,349
But this time, obviously I didn't want to go to the hospital for obvious reasons.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,000
And so I got, yeah, pretty sick. Before I went into the hospital.

23
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,846
And then, I mean, good news is bacterial, pneumonia is easy.

24
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,555
They just crank you full of about a liter

25
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,585
of IV antibiotics a day plus a bunch of steroids

26
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:13,515
and, you know, +34 days later they kick you out. You're fine.

27
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:16,036
Well, I'm ecstatic to be talking to Kurt again.

28
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:18,776
It's been a very long time and usually we talk on a regular

29
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,295
basis and this is like the longest we've gone in years not talking.

30
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:22,755
So,

31
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,566
yeah, it's been like 34 weeks.

32
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:28,216
I wanted to open this episode with kind of a,

33
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:31,136
I don't know if I'd even call it a correction necessarily.

34
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:31,515
So

35
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:36,092
we get feedback every now and then from, from listeners, we love feedback.

36
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,711
-- By the way, I
-- would say clarification. Sure, that's,

37
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:39,202
that's fair.

38
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:44,272
So anyway, one of the, one of the email threads that we got kind of was discussing,

39
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:49,162
one of the comments we made, I might have been one of the advent episodes.

40
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,001
I don't even remember anymore. It's been so long.

41
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:53,552
But basically, we made the comment about if,

42
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,092
if all the security people stopped doing their jobs,

43
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:57,821
like nothing would really happen.

44
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,402
And for about six months

45
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:01,440
maybe.

46
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,489
But anyway, the,

47
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,210
the listener assumed we were saying we don't need security in organizations at all.

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,770
And obviously, our intent

49
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,850
was we're saying most of the security in an

50
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,210
organization is so ineffective if they did nothing,

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,229
it wouldn't matter.

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,139
Arguably in probably about 50% of organizations,

53
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:23,679
if the security team did nothing that would be better than what they're doing,

54
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:24,440
it

55
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:25,820
might be.

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,490
I mean,

57
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,399
I won't disagree with that statement, but the point is security is hugely important

58
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:36,785
questionably, but I think a lot of the security we do today is ineffective.

59
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:39,675
And that's kind of the point of that statement is that's the question

60
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,835
you should ask is if you stop doing your job for a week,

61
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,074
would anyone notice?

62
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,985
And if the answer is no one would notice,

63
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,764
it's probably time to revisit some assumptions

64
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,154
and make sure you're doing the things that matter.

65
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:55,264
Well, see, and here's the flip side. If I stopped doing my security job at the CS A,

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,020
yeah, nobody would notice for weeks or months. But that's because

67
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:03,380
I've set it up so that we're in a bunch of providers with single sign on two fa

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,869
and there's basically nothing for me to do.

69
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,220
Literally, the, the,

70
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,580
the biggest thing I'm working on right now is improving our email deliverability,

71
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,220
which will actually have the side effect

72
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,009
of giving us slightly better email security,

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,539
you know, through D

74
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,369
mark and D

75
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,220
and all that crap. But fundamentally, I'm not doing it for security.

76
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,279
I'm doing it to improve our email deliverability.

77
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,869
-- And
-- now I would, I would say in your context,

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,619
what you have done is outsource security for the most part.

79
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,440
Yeah, dude, I'm one person I need to sleep. I have to outsource it

80
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,729
and you have to get sick sometimes for a month. Like,

81
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,460
yeah, like I was not terribly effective or useful for about a week and a half.

82
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,660
I can imagine.

83
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:45,139
I understand that. Absolutely. No, not every organization is like that. Remember?

84
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,020
Well, and

85
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:49,059
-- I can't spend time reading log files and stuff.
-- No one should read log

86
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,339
files.

87
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,059
Numerically, most organizations are tens of people.

88
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,910
When I say there's a lot of fortune. One hundreds, there's actually

89
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,699
100. Fortune one hundreds.

90
00:03:58,059 --> 00:03:59,139
There's 1000,

91
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,210
1000.

92
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,039
But do you know how many small and medium businesses there are? There?

93
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,520
There's a lot, I, I know there's a lot millions. None of them have security people.

94
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,619
Number one. Where are they going to hire them? They don't exist. Number two.

95
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,720
No, you just outsource that like we don't make our own power.

96
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,020
We don't make our own roads.

97
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,988
You just, you pay for infrastructure. Absolutely and compute.

98
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,119
And it

99
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:20,950
is

100
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,170
infrastructure.

101
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,750
Any small medium business that says we want to hire a security person.

102
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,549
You know what my response would be? No. Spend that money on a social media marketer

103
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,040
-- and
-- roll your

104
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,260
bank.

105
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,820
II, I agree.

106
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,109
I think if you, if you're small and you have security people you've probably done,

107
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,899
screwed something up

108
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,579
unless you're some super weird niche corner case

109
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,920
-- which
-- I, no, you don't get to talk about corner cases.

110
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,399
You do this every time I'm cutting you.

111
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:49,247
But that's exactly my point. It's so like we can't even think of an example.

112
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,277
That's how rare it is. So it's ridiculous and stupid.

113
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,006
Anyway.

114
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,427
So the point of this is,

115
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:57,937
and I guess the lesson for everyone listening is as Kurt and I discuss

116
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:00,657
things and if you ever don't understand it or you think we're idiots,

117
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,367
I mean, by all means,

118
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,877
let us know because we will happily clarify what's happening or, I mean,

119
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:07,027
in most cases, we just, we literally are idiots.

120
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,954
Part of it too is sometimes we actually end up clarifying thoughts.

121
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,933
Like look at the whole S MS phishing thing.

122
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:16,174
Like we're both in violent agreement of, we think it's probably

123
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,194
a problem,

124
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:17,933
right?

125
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,194
And as far as the solution,

126
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:21,174
I got nothing,

127
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,734
-- it's
-- whatever, whatever anyway. Anyway.

128
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,384
So, so, but now at the same time,

129
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,634
here's what I will always say is when

130
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:30,454
you are communicating something and someone misunderstands you,

131
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,493
it is never their fault for misunderstanding you.

132
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:33,813
It is your fault for not commuting

133
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,010
it appropriately. Absolutely. In this instance,

134
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:42,601
100% Kurt and I didn't communicate our thoughts well enough.

135
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,960
And I mean, this is always, it's, it's a lesson, right?

136
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:47,490
Because now we know we need to do a better job of this

137
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,121
in the future and make sure we clarify some of what we're saying

138
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:54,131
because it makes sense in my head, but it probably doesn't make sense to anyone else.

139
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,960
And part of it too is we often don't give some of the context for the background

140
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,750
that we just take for granted.

141
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,269
-- Yeah,
-- because we've been talking about this topic, you know, on,

142
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,350
on slacker or signal or whatever for weeks.

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,190
And then all of a sudden no one has any of that backstory.

144
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,299
-- And, and so it's like,
-- oh, yes, you know what,

145
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,549
actually link this in the show notes where Richard

146
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,950
Femen explains why manhole covers around and,

147
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,230
and that is a perfect example of how to correct.

148
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,619
I answer the question in a way that essentially

149
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,820
I don't think you're stupid,

150
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,079
but I'm going to go through some background information to

151
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,700
make sure that we're both on the same page.

152
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,880
Feynman was lovely at that and he always did it in a way

153
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,489
that didn't make me feel like I was being talked down to.

154
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,899
And my absolute favorite is when

155
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,040
it's someone I think on the BBC asked him how meg

156
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,190
autism works

157
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,450
and he spends like 15 minutes explaining why he can't explain how magnetism works.

158
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,130
And it's like

159
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,130
I learned more from your not explanation

160
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,600
-- than I think I learned from any physicist
-- ever.

161
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,410
Well, and part of that is survivor bias too.

162
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,170
And that there's let me put it this way, how many of us had teachers

163
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,010
who are terrible at teaching,

164
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,059
but they like they know the material cold,

165
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,750
like you ask them to solve that physics problem or that

166
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,010
chemistry problem and they could bang it out in a second.

167
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,010
But as far as actually then teaching and imparting that knowledge to the class,

168
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,140
a bit of a train wreck,

169
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:14,609
knowing something and knowing how to teach

170
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,899
something are two very different skills.

171
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,250
And I think this is one of the problems security

172
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,500
sees a lot is we know a lot about security.

173
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,980
We don't know a lot about teaching people about security.

174
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:26,059
This is actually something I've been, uh, recently,

175
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,130
I've been looking for some classes on how to

176
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,877
things, right. Because I do this a lot with my Children.

177
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:32,727
Obviously, you know, my,

178
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:34,877
my one son asks some pretty deep questions

179
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,007
and will go through some pretty deep answers,

180
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,447
you know, with, with respect, adults are different than Children.

181
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,097
And also I'm not the boss of you.

182
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:44,088
-- Whereas I am the boss of my Children,
-- we need to move on.

183
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,028
But I want to clarify one important thing.

184
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:48,167
I don't think adults are different than Children in the

185
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,608
context that one learns maybe better than the other.

186
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,247
I think Children are willing to say, I don't know what you're talking about.

187
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,548
Please clarify that where adults want to nod along

188
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,058
and pretend they know it's happening because they don't,

189
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:57,876
I want to look dumb.

190
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:01,036
-- I
-- have
-- been consciously teaching my sons to say,

191
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,555
I don't know because that is the beginning of what we can find out.

192
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:08,485
-- Oh, I agree
-- completely. I think adults forget how to do that and kids don't.

193
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:13,036
Well, and also the embarrassment factor and even with vocabulary, I'll ask my son,

194
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,476
you know, I'll use the word and I'll be like,

195
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:17,635
and I'll see the look on his face and I'll be like, pause, Felix.

196
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:21,436
Do you know what word X means? And he's like, no, not really.

197
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:21,635
And,

198
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:23,536
and then you know what I will do is I will actually look it

199
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,493
up online before I tell him what it means to make sure I am

200
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,104
getting it right because there's been a few times where I'm like,

201
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:33,104
oh yeah, it's a little right. I've been using this not 100% correctly.

202
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:35,304
So actually, you know, what's more powerful than that though,

203
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,754
I think is the act of looking it up.

204
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:41,222
I think also shows the, the people you're talking to,

205
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:45,443
-- it's ok to stop and learn something new, then continue
-- well, or,

206
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,004
or make sure your facts are correct.

207
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:51,383
-- You know, the population of Canada is 17 trillion. Is it?
-- No, probably not.

208
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,624
-- No, it's a bit lower.
-- I don't even know

209
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,731
a couple of tens of million maybe

210
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:55,481
or

211
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:55,671
no.

212
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:59,492
-- Sorry. Sorry, I, I think 38.
-- Ok. Whatever. Tens of million.

213
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:01,171
-- Yeah, basically
-- it's about uh yes,

214
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:04,411
it's a rough estimate usually is about 1/10 of the US.

215
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,961
-- That makes sense.
-- And right now it's about 37.6 million anyway.

216
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:09,392
Anyway.

217
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:10,721
Ok, let's move on.

218
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:16,302
I want to talk about today. So this is sort of related to the whole solar winds fiasco.

219
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:17,291
That's happening right now.

220
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,552
-- But I keep seeing people say I
-- would say it's beyond a fiasco.

221
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,039
We're not talking about that right now.

222
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,739
I would, we, we will discuss it someday once we know more.

223
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,950
But I feel like there's still too much

224
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,719
hearsay and conjecture to have a reasonable conversation.

225
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:31,960
-- It's,
-- it's not even hearsay and conjecture. It's no,

226
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:33,059
no, we're not talking about it.

227
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,239
What we're going to talk about is people keep saying, oh,

228
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,940
Attackers only need to get in once or there only has

229
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,640
-- to be one tiny failure and then everything
-- is no,

230
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,299
no, they only have to be right once.

231
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,234
Whereas the defenders have to be right all the time.

232
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:45,934
And,

233
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,015
and I, I, this drives me crazy

234
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:49,854
because

235
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,395
nearly every successful attack in the history of humanity

236
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:59,195
is like hundreds of ridiculous mistakes compiled together.

237
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:02,155
-- It's never one thing.
-- It's airline disasters.

238
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:07,635
-- Yes. Exactly. Right.
-- It's just like banks, it's multiple failures

239
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,760
and the system eventually, once you find enough of these

240
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,340
small failures and chain them together, you know, the,

241
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,820
the whole oo the kill chain and all that.

242
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,440
Yeah, you get in and you, you own the place the reality is, well,

243
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,219
there's a couple of things at reality here.

244
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,109
Number one,

245
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,409
the Attackers actually have to be right more than once because quite

246
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,090
often it's not like they just log into your database server directly.

247
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:30,669
No, they have to like,

248
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,169
pop a web server and then they have to pop an app server and then they have

249
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,530
to bypass your laugh and then they have to explore your network a bit and blah,

250
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:36,760
blah,

251
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:37,325
blah, blah.

252
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,705
So, you know, the Attackers have to get more than one thing right, correctly.

253
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,335
You know, they have to exfiltrate the data. Like back in the day

254
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:46,726
I had, you know, our Amazon VPC S set up to

255
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:52,125
not allow essentially any outgoing connections, which made updates a bit of a pain.

256
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,866
That's what DNS smuggling is for, right?

257
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,245
-- No, outgoing DNS was allowed.
-- Oh, wow, that's hard core man.

258
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:01,495
-- But dude,
-- the web servers don't need DNS. They just talk to the load balancers.

259
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,825
-- I,
-- yeah, I mean, that's

260
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:03,166
fair.

261
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,435
Like unless you're processing log files, what do you need to do with

262
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:06,992
us? Look up on a web server for

263
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:11,052
unless that web server is making a call out to an external entity. Now.

264
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:14,851
-- I mean,
-- I think lots of web servers today do lots of things.

265
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:15,562
Well, yeah, yeah.

266
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:19,601
-- Nowadays they do but I, this is like 10
-- years ago, I hear you. I agree.

267
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:25,012
The other thing too is, is there are ways for defenders to flip the relationship.

268
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,791
The obvious extreme example being ll Airlines

269
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:30,781
and their security protocols where essentially you

270
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,171
get on an LL flight or well before you get on the LL flight.

271
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,580
A depending on how things are going for you,

272
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,080
they might stick you and your partner in an essentially an interrogation room.

273
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,179
And interrogate you and make sure your stories match up to people,

274
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,559
making sure their stories line up is a non trivial exercise.

275
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,849
It's completely impossible if it's not true.

276
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:53,340
-- Heck, even if it is true you're going to have differences.
-- Yeah, exactly.

277
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:56,789
-- All
-- right, you should, you should clarify this a little bit. What's allow airlines?

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,140
So, Ll Airlines is Israel's flag carrier,

279
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,780
right?

280
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,919
And they have some pretty stringent security protocols because, well, Israel,

281
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:05,869
let's just leave it at that.

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,270
And,

283
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,250
and I would like to clarify as well that their solution isn't by

284
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,590
a bunch of magic X ray machines and everything will be fine.

285
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,020
-- It's
-- things like training

286
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,669
all of their staff on reading body language.

287
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,119
It's there, there's a really nice,

288
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,530
it's probably, I forget if it's an article or a blog post or an interview or what I,

289
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,650
I will try to dig it up.

290
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,039
That explains a lot of this.

291
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,039
But the things Israel has done to secure their airports is absolutely amazing

292
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,239
and it's effective.

293
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,119
Right.

294
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,400
Well,

295
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:36,429
that's a good point actually because you could say the things

296
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,760
the United States has done to secure airports is amazing.

297
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,539
-- How
-- much
-- money is the TS A spent.

298
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,359
How often do they fail the FAA security test where they smuggle?

299
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,030
Well, like the infamous case of, you know,

300
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,559
somebody stole a sweater from a security checkpoint

301
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,450
and then later when they're putting that stolen sweater in the overhead bin,

302
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,619
a fake grenade rolls out

303
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,080
Oops.

304
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:54,799
Yeah.

305
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,429
You know, or even within, well, not

306
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,059
the last year, so much but you know,

307
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,020
where people literally get on a plane and they're like to the steward, like,

308
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,479
I'm so sorry, but I accidentally brought my gun on board in my briefcase.

309
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,359
I'm not a bad guy.

310
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,789
Please. Please don't tase me, but I don't know what the process is here.

311
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,979
So like you take the case,

312
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,280
you're getting tased. That's how, that's how that ends.

313
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,640
The other reality is,

314
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,130
is we can build systems so that they degrade and don't fail immediately.

315
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,580
Like my favorite example being

316
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:27,973
-- roads have potholes, I think we're all in agreement on that one. Holy
-- count.

317
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:31,612
No, I'm not going to let you talk about potholes. You talk about potholes too much.

318
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:34,882
A simple example being we have this thing called the high level bridge and it is a

319
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:39,002
high and level bridge because it's a rail. It's an old rail bridge

320
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,703
that goes across the North Saskatchewan from,

321
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,463
and it's, it's quite long because it goes from the,

322
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,242
the flat part to the other flat part.

323
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:51,552
Right? There's no grade and it was built just over 100 years ago. It's just a big old

324
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,015
I beams basically,

325
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:56,176
like it is just rusted, so nasty and you know,

326
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,065
they repainted it once about 1015 years ago, which was um,

327
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,676
like a year long project because

328
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,395
of course, it's covered in lead paint. Why

329
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:02,916
wouldn't it be?

330
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:06,435
Well, the lead paint actually is a, it's a, it's a bio,

331
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:11,806
it, it kills all the biological stuff that tries to destroy steel. It does.

332
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:13,466
That's why marine paint.

333
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:16,666
Like, it's great. It works great. Just not so good for the environment.

334
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:19,466
But, you know, that's ok because number one,

335
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,979
it's a rail bridge.

336
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:25,260
So the loads it was designed to carry versus what it carries now with just, you know,

337
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,340
car traffic like that thing was designed to carry mile long coal trains versus,

338
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,659
you know, 100 cars and maybe a city bus.

339
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:36,080
The reality is that bridge until it's probably 50% rust is probably fine.

340
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,659
No, seriously,

341
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,080
like because it's, it's over engineered for what the load it carries now.

342
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,059
So we don't actually have to maintain it that well.

343
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,940
And in probably 100 years it'll hopefully not fail violently, but, you know,

344
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,150
get rusty and nasty and we'll replace it.

345
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,190
And so that's the thing d we want degradation, not just outright failure.

346
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,159
And what's funny is if you look at these systems, like,

347
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,630
remember the home depot hack where

348
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,080
the,

349
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,590
the Home Depot they had that external security company

350
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,570
or something that like literally kept telling them,

351
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,549
look, there's like bad guys in your credit card system do something about it

352
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,250
and home people ignored this.

353
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,169
I feel like so many stories of breaches contain that,

354
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,780
-- that person warning willful
-- ignorance,

355
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,130
right? The person saying, oh, something's wrong, they're like everything is fine.

356
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,260
Go away. And

357
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,419
it's,

358
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,460
it's so funny you listen to these stories about disasters or you watch like

359
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,059
disaster movies and there's always like the

360
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,700
one guy warning everyone and you're like,

361
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:29,924
oh, that would never happen.

362
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:34,604
And it's like, that's literally what always happens in every single one,

363
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:38,994
every single bloody movie about a pandemic where you're like, no, that's stupid.

364
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,385
Everybody would just isolate and behave.

365
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:42,375
Nope.

366
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,044
The movies leave out the part where the

367
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:47,034
people run towards the zombies demanding to be bitten

368
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:48,284
-- my right
-- to.

369
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:49,364
-- It's
-- right.

370
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,280
-- Anyway,
-- almighty.

371
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,599
And I, I think part of that willful ignorance though is alarm fatigue.

372
00:15:55,609 --> 00:16:00,109
Like a great example being Josh, I have an automated scan report of your software

373
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,590
and it has some really bad serious issues and of course your

374
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:07,010
immediate response is yeah to groan and think bad thoughts about me.

375
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,309
No.

376
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,739
Well, one day in theory, maybe somebody actually has a scan report with like

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:11,849
a

378
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:13,033
really bad flaw in it.

379
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:16,263
I would bet you once a month I get a scan report

380
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,833
that has an actual legitimate finding in it that it's like,

381
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:22,963
oh, I mean, they're never anything super critical but it's usually like, oh yeah,

382
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,203
we should probably fix that

383
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:25,132
and

384
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:27,533
yeah, great. Like that's fine.

385
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:28,973
Now, granted, at the same time,

386
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:32,653
the things I'm doing would have probably picked it up in a day or two.

387
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,312
So I

388
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,825
happen to accidentally find out about it early,

389
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,005
but it can happen and I acknowledge that.

390
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,986
But at the same time, so what I've done here

391
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,065
is people send me scan reports and I have written a bunch of

392
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:48,676
automated tooling that I basically never have to look at them anymore.

393
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:52,505
I run my tool 99.9% of the time my tool

394
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,815
spits out a report that's like here are all the answers

395
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,679
and that's it. Right. And that's the right way to do this.

396
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,429
And now my, my goal long term is to just be like here is an API

397
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,020
don't talk to me.

398
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,709
-- Well, unless you have something new. No,
-- because my plan there

399
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,969
is you're going to submit something to the API if there's something new,

400
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,050
the API is going to shoot

401
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,170
it,

402
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:13,114
email to me and be like, go look at this

403
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,993
and then the customer will get back. Hey, oh, thank you for submitting this.

404
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:17,405
We found something we don't know about.

405
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:20,064
We're looking at it right now and we'll deal with it appropriately.

406
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,145
-- And
-- here's the funny thing.

407
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:25,785
So what you're saying is you have a job in it and you've used your knowledge of it,

408
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,454
automate some work

409
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,214
and have the computer do all the boring less value stuff.

410
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:34,375
-- That's basically the, the point.
-- Right. Well, but

411
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:38,984
my point is you're a freaking unicorn. How many people are doing that? Not enough.

412
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:43,300
That's what blows my mind is how many people are actually

413
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,880
like,

414
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:49,619
I have a simple rule in that I won't do any security

415
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,209
for the CS A unless it basically adds nothing to my workload.

416
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:56,270
I mean, that seems fair.

417
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,030
There's, there's an XK CD comic where they break down, like,

418
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,280
how often you work on something, how long it would be worth spending to automate it.

419
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,020
Essentially.

420
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,780
I've looked at some security stuff and it's like, oh, cool.

421
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,890
Except that will now take an hour of care and feeding every week.

422
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,119
Yeah, you don't want that,

423
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,180
like literally the, again, back to my email diatribe.

424
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,219
The only thing I've done recently,

425
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,579
like in the last six months that has added to my workload

426
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,319
is setting up D mark reporting and getting, you know,

427
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,060
I get a daily report and I look at the data

428
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,969
and again,

429
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:30,569
that's far less about security than it is about improving email deliverability,

430
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,569
which is, you know, critical nowadays if you want to talk to your customers, right?

431
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,810
Because uh last I checked,

432
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,369
I don't think there's going to be any conferences this year.

433
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,689
I would be

434
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:40,329
there.

435
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:42,209
There will probably be some,

436
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:45,790
I keep getting invited to this one in person conference in May in DC.

437
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,449
And it's like,

438
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:47,689
buddy

439
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,640
like, no,

440
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,119
yeah, don't, don't do that.

441
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,800
Yeah. This whole the Attackers only have to be right once.

442
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,359
I think if you have like really poor immature security,

443
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,880
can the Attackers punch through in seconds? Yeah.

444
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:01,209
Yeah,

445
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,109
because you're running out of date software and they

446
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,709
literally just fire up a copy of metas,

447
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:05,189
metas

448
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,010
it's like yum num num num num num num.

449
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,439
Right. Doesn't even have to try. It's, you know, we just use a bunch of known

450
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,660
exploits to punch through your six month old systems.

451
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,400
Easy. Peasy, rum and squeezy.

452
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,310
Right.

453
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,589
And, and, well, and the brutal truth is unless somebody

454
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,280
has an internal team maintaining their systems or like a managed service provider,

455
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,359
maintaining their systems,

456
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:26,979
well, that's how that works.

457
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:27,660
You know,

458
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:32,290
like hands up on the show who here has updated their bias in the last 12 months.

459
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,770
Let's say,

460
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:36,900
I doubt most people update their biases ever.

461
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,349
So I I will say actually something really neat is the

462
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:46,750
I I imagine this works similarly on Windows but in Fedora now on a thinkpad,

463
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,589
because the thinkpad X one Carbon I use is, is well supported.

464
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:54,069
There is in the software update tool thing.

465
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,359
It has a bios update button. I can click to install the new bios.

466
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,329
It's super awesome and it's convenient.

467
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,459
-- So I keep installing it
-- the way it works in the Windows world is

468
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,744
your motherboard manufacturer.

469
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:07,285
Probably had like if they're a major one,

470
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,675
like M SI or gigabyte and I use those two

471
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,594
brands because those are the two brands of Motherboard.

472
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:14,305
I have, they essentially have a Windows app,

473
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,984
either specific to just update the bios from within

474
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:20,505
Windows or like M SI has this horrific monster.

475
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:23,344
It's like 500 megabytes called Dragon Center

476
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,920
that does like R GB like control and bios

477
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:31,050
and a bunch of God knows what else. And you essentially fire that up.

478
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,890
And I love how it, it just like,

479
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,130
it literally shows you a screen with the auto updater thing running

480
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,900
and two giant signs,

481
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,829
one showing like a uh a red circle with a slash of unplugging

482
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,229
your computer and a red circle with a slash of taking the USB K

483
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,609
out that has the uh

484
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,060
the bios update on it.

485
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,410
And it's literally like, and so I,

486
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,550
yeah, because I just updated both my bios

487
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,760
because I'm hoping this year to be able to buy

488
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,469
one of the new uh Ryzen 5 5600 XCP US.

489
00:20:59,619 --> 00:20:59,640
If

490
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,369
you can find one,

491
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,050
I'm guessing around

492
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,410
June

493
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,640
or maybe October, I'll be able to get one.

494
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,260
So like, ok, I mean, it as exciting as it is listening to your recount,

495
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,439
the thrilling tale of a bias update

496
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,199
and how would most people even know this is a thing,

497
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:17,839
you know,

498
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:18,500
I

499
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,280
-- mean, you're,
-- you're a freak look

500
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:21,449
and autos

501
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:22,670
are getting better,

502
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,760
but the problem is auto updates.

503
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,719
Even if you only have a one in a million failure rate,

504
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,680
that's still a bunch of people affected.

505
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,699
Yeah.

506
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,579
And now at the same time, at the same time, if you don't update your bios,

507
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:36,599
does it really matter?

508
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,439
-- Well,
-- to quote every motherboard manufacturer on the planet,

509
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:40,910
if your system is working,

510
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,839
don't update your bios because updating your bios might break your system.

511
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,000
-- Let's be
-- straight. It, it doesn't matter,

512
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:49,280
not unless you want to, you know, upgrade your CPU at some point.

513
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,250
I mean, and there's,

514
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,949
every now and then you'll get some weird security issues where you've got

515
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,640
some, what was the Intel management thing came up or? There's,

516
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,530
yeah, Intel Management Engine and the lights out stuff. I

517
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:01,849
PM.

518
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:06,280
-- The C
-- PU side channel attacks. That it feels like there's a new one every week.

519
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,709
You know, some of those are bios.

520
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,890
-- Like
-- I'm pretty sure my bios updates aren't fixing anything security related.

521
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:12,719
I don't know.

522
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,630
I mean, actually, so when I, when I get my,

523
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,119
when I read the release notes of the thinkpad bios updates

524
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,959
every now and then it says it's a security fix.

525
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,040
-- So
-- stupid question. They are actually

526
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,939
there's somebody making an R PM package

527
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,079
and they're like downloading the bios update.

528
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,079
No, it's, it's not an R PM. It's like some service that I guess Lenovo

529
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,280
somehow works with. They basically,

530
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,079
I don't know if the service is downloading from Lenovo. Lenovo is pushing them out

531
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,099
and then

532
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,640
the, so

533
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,000
there's like a FW up D it's called in Fedora.

534
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,160
Yeah.

535
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,219
And it like magically downloads,

536
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:52,060
firmware and updates them and so far nothing is bricked

537
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,760
every time I run it, I keep thinking like this is the time,

538
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,699
-- this is the time it's
-- gonna

539
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,040
break

540
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,444
that old where I updated my bio

541
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:02,324
and it broke the delete key to get back into the bio.

542
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:03,895
-- Yeah. Right.
-- It's like,

543
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:04,665
right.

544
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:06,614
Anyway, anyway, it's,

545
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:08,925
we are off

546
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:10,775
on such a crazy tangent right now.

547
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:12,505
But the point is the point is I want to

548
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,594
bring us back because we're running ourselves out of time.

549
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:14,964
But like

550
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:19,160
the point of all this, of all this crazy discussion is the fact that

551
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,510
any time there's a failure, it's never one thing. Right?

552
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,390
It's the result of many poor decisions

553
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,969
when taken together create failure.

554
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,770
One thing I've learned in the last few months

555
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,500
and I don't remember when exactly I learned it.

556
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,880
Root cause analysis is wrong.

557
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,180
What you actually need to be doing is

558
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:42,849
root causes plural analysis because as you said,

559
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,859
it's never one thing.

560
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,310
Yeah.

561
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,420
Right. I mean,

562
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:48,979
-- yes.
-- And that has significantly changed my mind on how.

563
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,229
So I would say between that is there's always multiple root causes.

564
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,619
And number two,

565
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,109
we really want to look at

566
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,430
number one building systems that are survivable and

567
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,270
essentially ideally in a perfect world don't fail,

568
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,660
they degrade.

569
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,939
So actually Netflix has a great example of this

570
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:12,430
where Netflix is just a giant mess of microservices

571
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,140
and essentially they will degrade nicely. So it's like,

572
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,430
oh, you know, recommendation engine crapped out.

573
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:18,560
Well,

574
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,089
that still doesn't mean we can't just show you

575
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,589
like what's popular and what you watched previously,

576
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,280
you know, I've seen places where, well, a perfect example, Slack, right.

577
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,969
Yesterday,

578
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,040
-- Slack had a massive outage
-- except yesterday has

579
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,640
no meaning in the context of this podcast.

580
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,209
Uh The first Monday of 2021 of course,

581
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:35,599
I

582
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:35,760
had

583
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,599
a meter outage

584
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,319
the day. We all went back to work. It was a Christmas miracle cart. That's what it was.

585
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:44,300
No, what it was is Aws had outages

586
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,640
that affected a bunch of third party services. That slack was reliant upon.

587
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,359
-- No,
-- Kurt.

588
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:53,520
-- It was Santa Claus giving me a gift
-- because we also had overnight like Hiroko

589
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:56,439
was bouncing up and down like a kid on a trampoline.

590
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,849
There is actually a bunch of other stuff that I noticed was broken.

591
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,119
And so my assumption was

592
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,270
a

593
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,099
US

594
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,640
because like I used to do it to track a bunch of my personal

595
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,400
to do items and like to do it wasn't working and Slack wasn't working.

596
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,729
I was like Aws is messed up.

597
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,209
And of course, I looked at the Aws status page and they were like, everything is fine.

598
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:16,030
Everybody. I'm like, yeah, you're lying.

599
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,160
You know,

600
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,839
I've been thinking about that a lot because and this kind of feeds into security.

601
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,579
So let's say for example,

602
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:25,739
Gmail has a global outage where nobody can access your email for 50 milliseconds.

603
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,489
Does that count as an outage?

604
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,199
-- I mean, technically, yes, but I mean, realistically
-- no.

605
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,000
Ok. What about one millisecond?

606
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,349
Technically, yes,

607
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,040
an outage is an outage.

608
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,560
And what about if there's an outage for, let's say 1% globally for 50 milliseconds

609
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,520
outage?

610
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,280
I mean, look man, there's technical outages and there's realistic outages.

611
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:49,199
Well, what I'm saying is there's, there's a continuum of,

612
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:52,479
from 0 to 1 of where clearly we're not going to call this an outage.

613
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:54,680
Like one person was affected for 50 milliseconds

614
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,329
because of cosmic ray, hit a server versus, you know,

615
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,250
everybody on the planet can't access their gmail for six days.

616
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,750
-- Ok. That's an
-- outage. That would be lovely.

617
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,390
-- Yeah,
-- actually it wouldn't be that bad at all, would it?

618
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:11,010
But you know, and then somewhere in between where does it count as an outage?

619
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,239
You know?

620
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:11,670
Does it,

621
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,420
does it affect the same 1% of people for a day or

622
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,849
is it like a rotating pool of people affected for five minutes?

623
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,699
I mean, this is, what is it, the ship of, who's the, who's gonna

624
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,609
ship in these,

625
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:23,030
the ship? These,

626
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,540
right?

627
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,969
Like that's what this is, is at what point does if you start replacing parts on a ship,

628
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,739
does it stop being the first ship and turn to the next ship?

629
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:31,300
I mean, it's the same problem.

630
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:34,180
-- Well, same thing with Star Trek transporters,
-- right?

631
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,300
No, no, that's been C GP Gray has a video about that. Like it's not you,

632
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,099
it's a clone of you.

633
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,689
Yeah, exactly. Well, as we,

634
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,569
because we got the double riker issue

635
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,609
that one too,

636
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:47,699
man. I hate that.

637
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,189
Oh,

638
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,189
it was terrible.

639
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,369
But, um, same thing with security is

640
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,250
for example,

641
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,339
oh, my favorite is all these fishing emails,

642
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,349
we sent you a fishing email and you click the link.

643
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,829
Yeah, because that's what you do with links and email.

644
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:04,410
That that's a whole another story. We're not going to talk about fishing today.

645
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:07,530
But the point is is that a security failure.

646
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,239
-- And I would say not really,
-- that's human nature.

647
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,520
Like the security failure is the fact that clicking a link can p your organization.

648
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,030
That's the security failure.

649
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,560
You know, or a great example is

650
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,880
you have a fleet of 100,000 desktops,

651
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,869
is at least one of them going to be infected with something at some point in the next.

652
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,180
Like, there's probably more than 100 of them infected right now.

653
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,750
If you have a 100,000 desktops,

654
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,229
we can all agree that it's going to be

655
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,030
more than one and hopefully less than like 50,000.

656
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,619
This is what I keep coming back to with security is,

657
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,430
you know, ok, it's going to be more like,

658
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:43,969
is there a remotely exploitable code execution flaw in windows?

659
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:44,369
10,

660
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:44,719
at

661
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,170
least one lurking in there somewhere.

662
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,250
Well, of course, there,

663
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,810
there's a remotely exploitable code execution flaw and like everything.

664
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,170
Exactly. Is it less than 10 million? Oh, God, I hope so.

665
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,069
But more than one, you know, and,

666
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,170
and part of it is figuring out these ranges so that

667
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,489
we can figure out kind of how much risk we have.

668
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:03,760
And then,

669
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,829
you know, what can we actually do for defense because part of it is too is

670
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,689
we don't have to have perfect defense.

671
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:10,750
You know, the bad guys,

672
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,380
-- we will never have perfect defense and
-- we don't need perfect defense.

673
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,969
A great example is bank robberies, right?

674
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:19,170
Bank robberies now are essentially a non-issue because

675
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,890
the cash drawer has like $7 in it.

676
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,400
Like all the banks I go to now if you withdraw more than about 100 bucks,

677
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,369
they go, they, they do the transaction and then they go to that armored

678
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,729
box thing with a computer on it,

679
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:35,520
you know, swipe their card punch in their thing and then it like,

680
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,099
spits out a bunch of cash and it won't unless there's

681
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:41,510
a valid transaction attached to that for just auditing purposes,

682
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,910
let alone also making it harder to rob the bank.

683
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,209
And

684
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,390
I mean, so robbing banks is probably a great example and we can kind of end on this is

685
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,750
there's different kinds of robbing banks right.

686
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,250
There's going in and telling a teller to give you all the money.

687
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,060
Well, they don't have a lot of money, right. You know why?

688
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,099
Because people would go in and tell them to give them all the money like

689
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,130
they fix the problem.

690
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,479
But then there's also like, so you've got a vault,

691
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,400
the vault is full of valuable stuff,

692
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,489
but breaking into a vault takes like two days.

693
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:11,640
So

694
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,530
-- it depends
-- how you break into the vault because I

695
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,819
actually just opened a safe deposit box and she's like,

696
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:16,359
do you need the room?

697
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:18,599
And I'm like, no, I just need to fire some documents into this.

698
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,469
And so she actually turned her back to me like face the corner and I

699
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,040
put my documents in my safe deposit box and then, you know, put it

700
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,219
back

701
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:25,369
in

702
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,829
it. That's not the good stuff though.

703
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:30,439
-- Like banks have gold, they're not letting you in that one.
-- You know,

704
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,349
funny story.

705
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,349
My safe deposit box agreement says that I'm actually

706
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,550
not allowed to store stuff like that in my

707
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,430
safe deposit box unless it's like a collectible like a coin or something.

708
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:43,000
-- Well, they don't, they don't really know either.
-- Well, no, they don't.

709
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,229
But, but technically for example,

710
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,349
I am not allowed to keep cash in my safe deposit box.

711
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,780
I mean that I would be in violation of my agreement with the bank,

712
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,219
-- didn't
-- you watch breaking bad?

713
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:51,660
Like,

714
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,739
-- you know, yeah,
-- the guy with the cake pops in the suitcase full of cash.

715
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,339
Right.

716
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,569
Well, and that's how they were, that's how they were laundering the money around.

717
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,750
Right? Is they were, they had safe deposit boxes?

718
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,560
No, that's how they were paying people.

719
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,170
That's it. That right.

720
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,020
Yeah, they were putting cash in safe deposit boxes anyway. Anyway,

721
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,849
the point is, yes,

722
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,229
I I get that. It, it totally makes sense. So I guess

723
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,189
here is

724
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:20,930
my parting statement on this episode is that defenders only need to be right once

725
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,989
Well, they, yeah,

726
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,660
they only need to interrupt the kill chain once to kill that attack.

727
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:30,130
Yep. Attackers have to get it right. Every time defenders only have to be right once.

728
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,089
And that is,

729
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:35,420
I think the fundamental misconception we have about attacking versus defending.

730
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,660
I would say it's even more subtle than that.

731
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,420
Defenders can then choose to fix that and potentially in

732
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,160
a way that's very permanent or a perfect example,

733
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,410
being early on with the CS A I made the

734
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,300
decision that we're not going to be PC compliant.

735
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,286
We're not going to handle credit cards. We're just

736
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:49,895
gonna

737
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:50,145
use

738
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:51,576
paypal. Uh What is it?

739
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:54,586
Paypal's IP N instant payment notification api

740
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,485
we don't have your credit card number.

741
00:30:56,495 --> 00:30:59,416
-- That's my security solution to credit card numbers at the
-- CS A.

742
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,076
And that's the right answer always.

743
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:02,436
I will say though,

744
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:06,526
the one other thing is that saying defenders only have to be right once Attackers

745
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:09,526
have to be right every time that's not going to sell a lot of products.

746
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,235
So

747
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:14,302
I don't expect many marketing companies to, to latch on to that one.

748
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:17,202
-- I think
-- that whole interrupting the kill chain thing.

749
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:21,812
-- I, I'm, I'm seeing more of that.
-- II, I do think it's getting better. I agree.

750
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,521
I feel like we're making progress

751
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:26,362
-- in many places
-- and as we've learned from the solar winds hack,

752
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,842
having a strong offense is cute and all

753
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,802
but essentially having a strong offense means a bunch of

754
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,881
people can come into your house and rob you blind,

755
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,859
like literally, that's what happened.

756
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,939
And so you need to get much better at defense.

757
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,180
Uh Yeah, and, and luckily you only got to get right once. So I'm going to call it.

758
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:47,199

759
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,500
