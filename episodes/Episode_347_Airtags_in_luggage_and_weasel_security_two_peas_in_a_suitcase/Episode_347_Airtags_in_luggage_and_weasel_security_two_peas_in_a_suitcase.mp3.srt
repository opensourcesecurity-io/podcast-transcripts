Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,149
Kurt Siefried and my partner, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,550
Just your partner. Not.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,420
So I was gonna, I was,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,359
I was trying to think of something clever to

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,579
say about locational and knowing where you live.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,540
I mean, you do know where I live, you send me stuff.

7
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:20,329
Yeah.

8
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,329
Well, or do I like, is that like a po box? And you have somebody forwarded on to you?

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,309
-- No, it's an address, you know that
-- like,

10
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,569
do you actually live there or is it just like a like is it a Potemkin Village?

11
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,369
I guess just the front, like a picture of a house and you actually, you know,

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,729
live in a shack somewhere else?

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:34,290
-- I
-- mean,

14
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,439
I'm confident you could prove that relatively well

15
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,904
using like Google Maps imagery and satellite pictures

16
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:42,904
that my house is, in fact a house.

17
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:43,134
Yeah,

18
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,825
but I don't have like a picture of you standing in front of your house or whatever.

19
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:46,145
Like,

20
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:46,584
oh,

21
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,415
so my favorite thing is this judge thought that the defendant that was like

22
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,865
a virtual hearing and that he thought

23
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,025
the defendant was actually threatening the plaintiff

24
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:55,025
and he's like, go outside. Show me the house number.

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,939
Bam. Like, what a

26
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,240
clever way to,

27
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,860
like, where are you? Oh, I'm at home. I don't think you are. Go outside.

28
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,200
Show me the house number from the front.

29
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,319
-- I remember watching that. That was pretty wild.
-- Yeah, judges are smart.

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,110
-- Who knew
-- most of

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,160
-- them?
-- It's funny how such low tech things can.

32
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,540
Or, I love when the people do,

33
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,639
like the Reddit A MA S they hold up like the little sign with the date on it or whatever.

34
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,519
And like, that's very simple but it works. I mean,

35
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,319
-- and
-- that's my favorite thing about the Instagram account

36
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,550
recoveries. They can do that because they have pictures of you.

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,730
-- I know, I know anyway.
-- Well, and that, that actually feeds directly into this is like

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,360
we now have the technology

39
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,089
to put a, like because you could always put a tracking thing on stuff,

40
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,169
but it had to have like massive batteries because it had to like,

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,449
connect to the cell phone network to beacon out.

42
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,389
See, and that's my favorite thing about GPS, right?

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Everybody's like, oh, it's a GPS tracker.

44
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:48,970
And I'm like, well, GPS receives a signal and yeah, it'll, it'll know where it is. But

45
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,300
like either you have to physically go retrieve it

46
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:54,160
and download it or it has to beacon out.

47
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,260
And I guess your choices for beaconing really are cell Wi Fi Bluetooth

48
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:02,779
and, or you know, custom radio frequency stuff which probably like,

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,379
military and law enforcement has access to, but we don't.

50
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,760
And

51
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,750
the beauty is Apple built. Apple air tags.

52
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,100
Well, it's more complicated than just saying the beauty is,

53
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,660
but fundamentally the point we're going to focus on today is Lufthansa

54
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,570
tried banning air tags.

55
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,149
Can you say that again? Sorry, just say that word again. Lufthansa.

56
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,919
Ok. Look, I'm American.

57
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,270
You're lucky. I got it that close. How do I say it?

58
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:25,699
Yeah,

59
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,039
that's true. Ok. In fairness. Yeah, like

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,789
Luft

61
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,830
Luft,

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,479
we don't have the noise in English.

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,039
It's like

64
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,000
it's like my name,

65
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,699
-- you know, whatever
-- I give up,

66
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,360
say it again. Say it again for me,

67
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:38,850
Lufthansa.

68
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,000
I hear the same thing I just said, but whatever,

69
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,630
I

70
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,380
-- don't care,
-- I don't even care.

71
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:50,210
I apologize in advance to any German speakers listening to me pronounce Lufthansa.

72
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,789
OK.

73
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,729
Anyway,

74
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:56,580
anyway, now I want to, I want to also, but before we go on, I want to clarify that

75
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,350
apple air tags are clever

76
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,350
and I also recognize the negative aspects of it

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,649
from kind of the stalking and unwanted tracking perspective,

78
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,190
which is a very real thing,

79
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,529
but that's also not the thing I want to discuss today because I think

80
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,089
that is far more nuanced and there are people far more qualified than us.

81
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,789
And

82
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,470
I will put some links in the show notes. I know of people who have

83
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,720
about this and talked about this that have actually done a marvelous job

84
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,270
rather than curt and I spouting nonsense.

85
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,919
-- I mean,
-- to put it simply Apple at least has

86
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,050
the appearance of having thought about anti

87
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,089
stalking and added some basic capabilities.

88
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,350
It falls short in many ways.

89
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:31,889
Well,

90
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,009
the problem is it's a fundamentally difficult

91
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,139
-- problem to solve
-- which we're not solving,

92
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,240
we're talking about luggage.

93
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,639
And so it's, it's one of these kind of dual use technologies where it's just,

94
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:41,889
it's fundamentally

95
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,970
easy to abuse and hard to prevent abuse at scale, especially at scale.

96
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,520
But

97
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,750
so I don't want to say we're going to ignore that,

98
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,690
but we're kind of going to ignore that because yeah,

99
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,119
we're not qualified to talk about,

100
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:54,369
like you said, the nuances of it.

101
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,960
So like, for example,

102
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,979
I have a couple of air tags and I actually have one

103
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,929
in my car in case my car gets stolen that way,

104
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,570
I'll be able to find it hopefully quicker.

105
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,020
Um You know, and,

106
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,479
and like all my son's backpack and stuff just to make it easier

107
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,869
to find uh in case it gets left at school or something.

108
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,759
Yeah, like, so they're kind of magical because they have like a built in battery that

109
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,490
-- I don't know how long it lasts,
-- like

110
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,238
around a year give or take because my wife has a couple

111
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,079
and

112
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,548
I it, it just takes AC R 2032 that like

113
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:26,059
-- what American quarter size battery, I
-- call it the quarter battery.

114
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,559
Yeah, but we live in a place that has quarters. Most other people don't.

115
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,165
-- Ah,
-- that's a good point. Yeah. Germany 20

116
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:31,585
cents.

117
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:35,175
Which makes more sense. I'm not going to say it doesn't.

118
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,466
But that's another discussion

119
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,545
-- for another day.
-- Coinage.

120
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:40,135
Um,

121
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:42,936
so, yeah. And I mean, and if the battery runs low you can just

122
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:43,946
swap it out.

123
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:48,756
-- Which
-- is great because the old trackers had built in batteries and like a tile.

124
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,865
I remember I had a tile, I got at a conference.

125
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:54,446
It lasted one year and then Tyler was like, well, this is done now,

126
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:55,126
I'm like,

127
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:58,365
this is terrible. And the other thing too is, and the,

128
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,872
again, tiles were terrible for this. I had some tiles.

129
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:06,201
Their sensor network isn't nearly as big because Apple threw the magic of just like,

130
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,092
hey, here's a software update.

131
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,571
Now, you're part of our tracking network.

132
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:10,851
You don't

133
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,891
have. Can you turn that off? I think

134
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:13,992
you can't turn that off.

135
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:18,361
I, not that I'm aware of. Maybe they've changed. But I last, I checked, I,

136
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:19,342
no,

137
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:23,541
it's like the Amazon sidewalk thing. Right? Like it's like, can you opt out? No?

138
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:28,971
-- Sure.
-- Anyway, anyway, we're going to talk about air tags in luggage specifically.

139
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,709
But here's the thing. This is a perfect example of where it went from.

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,829
Yeah, it's possible, but it costs $1000 and it's a real pain in the butt.

141
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,279
To sure you order one online.

142
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,049
It's $30 you put it in your luggage and there's like no step too that it just works.

143
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:44,660
-- Right.
-- I mean, this is very reminiscent of the episode. We just did

144
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,470
a couple ago about

145
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,790
the basically all these hacking tools becoming extremely affordable. Right.

146
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,739
My understanding of what was happening is basically customers are putting air

147
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:55,876
in their luggage

148
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,226
and then inevitably your luggage gets lost at the airport,

149
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:03,395
which happens sooner or later if you travel any amount of time and then

150
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,575
they call the airline and the airline is like,

151
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:08,696
we have no idea where your luggage is and they're like, I can see it here.

152
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,635
It's like sitting at this place at this airport.

153
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,526
And then my suspicion is the airlines were like,

154
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,115
-- whatever. I don't, I don't want to hear this go away.
-- Nerd.

155
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,316
Well, it's embarrassing to them. Right. Like, because I, well,

156
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,141
for example, I've had luggage lost where I was on a flight from Argentina to, well,

157
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:24,641
Canada

158
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,321
and in Sao Paulo,

159
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:29,511
they popped the emergency slide when they were opening up the doors for first class.

160
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:31,332
So they basically had to clear out first class,

161
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,321
which meant they bumped a whole bunch of people in the back like us.

162
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:38,302
And so my luggage essentially wasn't an indeterminate state.

163
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,221
So I get to Canada and of course the the

164
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,201
customs guy is kind of like looking at me suspiciously, you know,

165
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,911
because I have like no luggage, just a little backpack.

166
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,510
And uh and I'm kind of shivering in the airport because it's like December and I,

167
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,929
I don't have winter clothes

168
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,850
and he's wearing rubber gloves and I'm getting a little nervous but, you know,

169
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,630
he let me go without incident,

170
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,390
but like, literally the airlines, like, well,

171
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,750
we didn't lose your luggage and I'm like, ok, cool.

172
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,170
Where is it? And they're like, well, we don't know.

173
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,970
I'm like, do you know what country it's in?

174
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,350
They're like, no, it's in the system somewhere.

175
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,630
And like three days later I get a knock at my door and a guy, you know,

176
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,070
from Air Canada hands me my backpack and it's like, thanks, like,

177
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,529
thank goodness I was going home

178
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:16,309
and you figure in an airport there are literally iphones everywhere.

179
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,130
-- There's thousands of iphones at every
-- airport

180
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,140
and the staff has them too. So that's the other secret is like

181
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,140
the, the areas that you and I do not have access to.

182
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,929
And here's the other clever thing,

183
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,130
like, if it's in a basement, yeah, I can't see a cell phone network or anything.

184
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,750
It's dead but somebody with an iphone walks by it,

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,790
beckons out the iphone does its magic and,

186
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,510
you know, like two hours later the data pops up.

187
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,429
Exactly.

188
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:38,950
Ok.

189
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,670
Anyway, I,

190
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,679
I don't want to talk about this part of this because

191
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,070
I think the far more interesting story here in the parallel,

192
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:50,605
-- think that we can tie into security is the fact that Lufthansa basically said,
-- well,

193
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:51,614
they threw a tantrum.

194
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,084
-- Well, they
-- got obviously

195
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:56,195
annoyed. Well, no, no, no worse. They got embarrassed.

196
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,385
-- I
-- mean, that could be, but regardless,

197
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,575
no, no embarrassed is bad.

198
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,385
Companies hate being embarrassed because, like,

199
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,355
when you pants a company they hate that.

200
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,885
My suspicion

201
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:05,795
is

202
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:06,614
the,

203
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,130
the airline

204
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,470
has very different ways of tracking this stuff in probably every

205
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,910
airport because I'm sure every airport is a little different.

206
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,470
It's luggage takes. It's right.

207
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,269
It's the barcode on the luggage take it moves through scanning devices.

208
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,470
So it's a point in time scan, just like the package.

209
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,390
And so the problem is if somebody takes it

210
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,070
off the conveyor belt throws it in the corner,

211
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,149
it's not lost.

212
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,119
Exactly. Exactly that and then no one's ever going to find it.

213
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,349
I remember seeing a picture on Reddit

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,380
some years ago of a, a suitcase like laying in the middle of,

215
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,900
of the runway or the tarmac, whatever you call the area, the planes move around and

216
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:44,460
it, uh it showed someone like just walk past it

217
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,049
and they were like, not my job or something like that. Right.

218
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,760
And, and there was someone who had a comment

219
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,840
that said, look when you work at an airport, like it's,

220
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:53,500
if it's not your job to touch stuff,

221
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,059
you don't touch stuff like that is how it works because

222
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,909
when you start messing with things that aren't your job,

223
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,869
people start asking weird questions and you have problems.

224
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,880
And so that is totally expected like there is

225
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,760
someone else's job is to come and pick up that

226
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,482
case. That was not that person's job.

227
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:11,752
And I kind of get that and I feel like now I wanna tie kind of all this back to

228
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,513
the world of, well, I should say there's one other piece of this. Right.

229
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:16,812
So Lufthansa gets embarrassed

230
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,562
and they basically end up walking it back and you're like, oh, I guess it's not, oh,

231
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,793
I should say part of this story is

232
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:26,932
the Lufthansa claims that the German government told them they

233
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,726
can't put these air tags in bags

234
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,286
because they're a transmitting device or something.

235
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:30,625
Right.

236
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,075
Well,

237
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:35,486
-- the battery and the transmitting aspect
-- and then people obviously start freaking

238
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,306
out and calling them out on it and then they're like,

239
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,546
oh, after all, I guess it's ok.

240
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,856
Which is the best part of this story.

241
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,815
Somebody pointed out that Lufthansa at one point was

242
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,185
trying to sell luggage that had built in tracking

243
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:46,976
stuff,

244
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:47,375
you know.

245
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:52,630
But actually if you read it, what Lufthansa did is they actually read a piece of,

246
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,530
they were like, oh, look at this piece of government regulation that says blah,

247
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:55,979
blah, blah.

248
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,859
And they were basically being weaselly

249
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,580
because

250
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,789
technically, yeah, it's a battery.

251
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:00,830
We,

252
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,669
we can't not have small batteries in luggage like

253
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,190
that just because everything electronic has a battery now.

254
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,669
And people travel with electronics.

255
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,070
-- I, I don't know if you've noticed, but that's the thing. Now in 2020 two
-- can you check.

256
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,159
No, I, when you have baggage you're not supposed to put lithium.

257
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:16,929
Well, they say lithium

258
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,539
ion, which Airtag do not have lithium

259
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:20,880
-- ion in them. They are the cr
-- 2032.

260
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:26,119
-- Yeah,
-- those, those, um, half cell batteries, they're, they're very safe and stable

261
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:31,429
and I, I've never heard of one even leaking. Much less catching on fire.

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah, exactly.

263
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:37,344
We should do an experiment. Can we make a nickel cell light on fire?

264
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:40,965
-- My guess is no, uh,
-- you can actually make them leak.

265
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,125
-- I accidentally put some in my charger.
-- That's a different problem.

266
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,724
That's not happening on an airplane.

267
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:46,284
-- But,
-- well,

268
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:49,724
but the thing is even then it just kind of leaked a bit but nothing happened.

269
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,244
So,

270
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:53,085
so I want to tie this back into security now because I think

271
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:56,734
this is an interesting parallel is how often in the world of security

272
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:57,924
do we see

273
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,890
someone say something like, oh,

274
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,520
that's not a vulnerability or we're not going to

275
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,789
-- fix this problem
-- or that's not allowed because.

276
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,820
-- Right.
-- Exactly. And then

277
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,530
they

278
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,940
go to the court of public opinion.

279
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,489
They are shamed immensely.

280
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:13,590
And then they're like,

281
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,549
oh, we were just kidding, we're going to fix that after all. And I feel like

282
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,669
this is so totally that story

283
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,270
that is literally how,

284
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,080
like

285
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,380
large companies like Google doing dumb things and

286
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,909
then getting called out on hacker news works.

287
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:32,419
And I love that when people point out that this is not a sustainable way,

288
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,979
you know, for example,

289
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,770
Google just turns off your developer account because some

290
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,229
reason that they won't tell you and they're like,

291
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,090
we can't tell you because then the spammers will know how to avoid the spam.

292
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah, I kind of get that but at the same time, like,

293
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:45,909
you know,

294
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,219
yeah, I

295
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,260
the,

296
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,289
it's,

297
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:55,289
there's this huge power imbalance between like Google and me

298
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,330
and yeah, if I can get maybe enough traction on hacker news or Twitter,

299
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,590
I can kind of get it fixed.

300
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,650
But that is not a sustainable way to do things and it's not,

301
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,130
it's not really fair. I feel.

302
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:06,369
Well, no, it's not.

303
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,409
And it's never been, I mean,

304
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,969
there's historically always been a massive power balance between,

305
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,729
we'll say large corporations and people

306
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:14,609
because,

307
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,309
yeah,

308
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,590
I mean, you look at nearly all regulation that exists from auto safety, food safety,

309
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,690
you know, any of that stuff,

310
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,250
these large corporations were taking advantage of people and often lying

311
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,530
and then eventually

312
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,619
the government had to step in and do something about it.

313
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,020
And in the case of tech and things like, you know, Google,

314
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,260
canceling developer accounts or putting air tags in your luggage.

315
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,599
It's gonna be really hard to get the government to care because generally speaking,

316
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,820
the government only cares when a lot of people get killed.

317
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,070
Well, and a great example of this is, for example,

318
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,739
like all those Uber and Waymo driver cars like messing up traffic in San Francisco.

319
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,729
Yeah.

320
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,969
You know, or that food delivery robot driving through a crime scene.

321
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,799
Right. Right.

322
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,460
And the cops are just like, what, like, and, and I was thinking, I'm like,

323
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,229
what do you do?

324
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:06,500
Like, do you stand in front of it to make it stop and then tip it over? Like, can you,

325
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,099
can you be like, halt robot? Like, let me talk to your human supervisor?

326
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,330
No, like, seriously, what do you do?

327
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,140
What's gonna happen is nothing

328
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,539
because the human response to

329
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,239
unknown situations

330
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,659
is we do nothing. We basically freeze in panic mode,

331
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,140
observe and report,

332
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,659
we observe for a while and by the time anyone understood what was happening,

333
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,255
the robot had probably exited the crime scene, right?

334
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:31,554
Is my suspicion on how that

335
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:32,755
that's basically what happened.

336
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:34,794
It's human nature.

337
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:38,434
When something ridiculous happens, we often just stop and stare, you know,

338
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,434
often with our mouth hanging open

339
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:42,315
and then it's like what now?

340
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:42,625
And I mean,

341
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,664
this is part of what makes like the security universe

342
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:48,395
so humorous is because like in an event starts happening

343
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,325
and then we're often just like

344
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:52,994
in shock and panic for some period of time

345
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:57,315
and then hopefully sanity takes over eventually, but sometimes it doesn't.

346
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,169
And I mean, that's where that's why having things like playbooks, for example,

347
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,359
where you like literally write down what to do is helpful because now

348
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,710
instead of staring and starting to do dumb things that don't make sense.

349
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,539
I can say, oh, I'm going to open a playbook

350
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,789
and I'm like, step one, don't panic. And then we go from

351
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,169
-- there.
-- Well, but, and the thing is I've been thinking is

352
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,270
there's going to be some fundamental changes in the next few years.

353
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,190
Companies don't react quickly to this stuff.

354
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,299
-- And so it catches them by surprise and scares them.
-- Ok, that's the key,

355
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,150
that's the key to this discussion I think is talking about

356
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,450
the reaction of companies

357
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,469
because

358
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,250
I think fundamentally

359
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,989
if we look at how most people react to new things, it's,

360
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:40,909
there's the Douglas Adams quote about what things that existed before

361
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,280
you were born are normal things that are invented before you're

362
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:47,239
like 30 you can make AAA career out of and then

363
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,260
everything after you're like 30 or 40 is an abomination.

364
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,450
And I think the thing to understand is a lot

365
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,309
of these companies have existed for a very long time.

366
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,520
And so if we look at it in that lens,

367
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,440
they're often seeing some of this change in progress as an abomination

368
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,169
because now they have existing process,

369
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:08,270
they have things that are working and you introduce change, change is hard

370
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,750
and some of them will accept it. Many won't and they'll fight against it.

371
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,059
And I think this is true of dealing with security vulnerability reports.

372
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,599
This is true of dealing with

373
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,359
-- air tags in your luggage. I mean, well,
-- what about putting air tags in your packages.

374
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm, I'm kind of thinking about this now because, like, I know people that,

375
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,729
for example, you can buy a Mercedes car, like,

376
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:30,369
from Germany drive it on the test track and then they ship it over here

377
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:30,989
and,

378
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:34,640
like, I, I know cases where essentially the car has been lost, like,

379
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,070
not lost forever, but just

380
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,000
again, the classic, like, it's not lost.

381
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,450
We just don't know where it is and it's a

382
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,799
freaking car in a shipping container and it's like,

383
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,260
can't you put like a

384
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,059
couple $100 gps tracker on it

385
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,210
because I mean,

386
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,320
right, like to manage customer expectation and give them that little PAC man.

387
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,900
I, I guess ironically as part of that too is historically, there was no tracking.

388
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,679
So you just wouldn't know where anything is no matter what

389
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,419
because you gave the car to the shipping

390
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,280
company and then the shipping company gives you the

391
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,494
card back later in another place and you have

392
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,184
no idea what happened from there to there.

393
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,945
And we, we've become a bit spoiled in that regard.

394
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,784
And so for example, there's, there's like the, the,

395
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,794
the artificial avocado and artificial fruits

396
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,705
that they used to put through industrial

397
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:21,065
systems to see like where's the avocado getting bumped or smashed or banged

398
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,700
so that we can improve our process to like not smash up the avocados

399
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,210
or same thing for packages, right? Like how long have we had those G

400
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,849
shock stickers for packages that are sensitive or the tilt stickers, you know,

401
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,869
with the little beads in them that if the package tilts the

402
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,049
beads fall into a little chamber and can't come back out.

403
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,770
So, you know, if the package got tilted or not.

404
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
And so a great

405
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,760
this is like what happens

406
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,599
when we start putting like something that is a combination

407
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,539
of an airtag with a G shock with a,

408
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:47,159
you know, all the sensors, temperature,

409
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,169
whatever and start calling out shipping companies on their BS.

410
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,250
This brings us back to the

411
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,729
organizations dealing with change. I think if you have a package

412
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,150
and you put one of the tilt sensors on because

413
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,330
let's say it's some scientific equipment that can't be tipped.

414
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,760
And I get that because that exists.

415
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,339
Obviously, when you go to the shipping company,

416
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,760
the expectation is you're going to explain the situation to them and they're going

417
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,459
to charge you extra accordingly because now

418
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:14,180
they have to treat your package differently,

419
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,579
right?

420
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,060
And I think in the case of someone like Lufthansa,

421
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,848
the expectations of the customer have changed,

422
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,130
but the agreement between the customer and them kind of hasn't.

423
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,300
But at the same time, it's a very shaky agreement

424
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:26,338
because

425
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:29,328
the understanding is basically I buy a plane ticket,

426
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:33,659
I give you my bag when I get to where I'm going, you give me my bag back, right?

427
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,489
And that doesn't always happen. And then people get angry.

428
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:40,058
There's, well, there's no room for negotiation and there's no, uh, like,

429
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,958
I've actually had this happen where I've flown to Germany

430
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,249
and I get out and I wait

431
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,928
and my bag doesn't show up for like, two hours

432
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,530
and then it finally shows up and they're like, they give me some BS excuse.

433
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,959
And I'm like, did you guys put it in like the wrong cart or something? He's like, well,

434
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,709
yes, that's actually what happened, right?

435
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,099
Some, some baggage handler, like misread the tag, threw it in the wrong cart.

436
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:01,810
So it went to some other luggage hall,

437
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,729
went around the, you know, went for a ride on the conveyor belt got bored.

438
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,829
You're lucky it didn't go on in the wrong airplane, man.

439
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,869
I know right.

440
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,250
When it works, it works. But when it doesn't work,

441
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,989
there's this massive, well, what can I do? Nothing?

442
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,469
Actually,

443
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,969
you just reminded me of something and I want to bring this back to

444
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,260
Microsoft in the early two thousands when

445
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,829
they would deal with vulnerability reports.

446
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,910
Because any security researcher in the early two thousands know

447
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,530
that if you brought a vulnerability report to Microsoft,

448
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:31,150
they were basically going to do everything they could to discredit you because

449
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,670
you were the enemy and vulnerabilities

450
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,140
were a marketing problem from their perspective

451
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,209
and they would send lawyers and all sorts of stuff after you.

452
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,790
And I think that's an example of

453
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,910
if you think about the power imbalance Microsoft literally

454
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,660
had all the power in the early two thousands,

455
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,670
they were in charge of literally everything.

456
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,260
And if you didn't like it ha ha, too bad, there's nothing you can do.

457
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,699
But now you have these security researchers show up and this is I, I,

458
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:58,400
I'll put a link to Isaac Joseph Men, I think, wrote the cult of the Dead Cow book.

459
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,140
And he talked about a lot of this where

460
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,520
you have these groups of these like renegade hackers basically

461
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:04,410
that

462
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,010
they went out of their way to embarrass Microsoft.

463
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,160
It,

464
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,160
it turned into the power dynamic who flipped

465
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,010
around where all of a sudden you had these

466
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,780
random hackers

467
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:16,640
with all the power and Microsoft had none of the power

468
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,829
and that's not a situation they can be in.

469
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,880
So when you put someone like Mike, you know, old Microsoft in that situation,

470
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,619
they don't, you know, stop and reflect on what's going on around them. Oh goodness.

471
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,099
No,

472
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:30,380
they become a caged animal and they were lashing out

473
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,180
and they were acting completely just ridiculous in many instances.

474
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:35,689
And eventually

475
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:41,000
I think after the court of public opinion, plus just probably some amount of self

476
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:41,979
introspection,

477
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,680
they finally were like, ok, we need to change the way we're doing this,

478
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:47,510
but it took years, right?

479
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,630
This wasn't like, oh yeah, I guess you guys are right.

480
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,280
No,

481
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,339
the other problem is you can't treat Microsoft as

482
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,660
like some cohesive entity that has a belief system.

483
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,439
It's a pile of people who are competing

484
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,979
and jockeying for power and have conflicting visions of

485
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,910
what they want Microsoft to be and to do,

486
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,790
I mean, I think we can all agree that like Bill Gates,

487
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,189
Steve Ballmer and Satya Nadella very different.

488
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:09,729
CEO S

489
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,569
two of them did a pretty good job and one of them didn't,

490
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,349
one of them threw chairs,

491
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,959
the Lufthansa.

492
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:18,130
I,

493
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,359
I'm pretty sure the person running their Twitter account

494
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,880
doesn't have like a real strong opinion on this,

495
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:27,089
-- but they're being told what to say by somebody who,
-- of course they are, look,

496
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,829
I'm not going to give them a pass because they're a collection of people.

497
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,760
Well, what I'm saying is, it's like, it's not like people,

498
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,780
I think often view companies like the borg as

499
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,910
-- a, as a cohesive collective
-- and

500
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,469
-- I'm comfortable doing that. They're
-- not though, like, remember that time,

501
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:44,306
Sony Suit itself, that's their problem.

502
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:48,715
But what I'm trying to say is part of the, one of the problems here is that companies,

503
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,095
you know, you might have a new way of viewing the world,

504
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:53,395
but unless somebody really champions it, it's not going to happen,

505
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,755
-- but
-- that's normal, right?

506
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:55,526
Because

507
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,036
the world changes,

508
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:01,995
-- many companies don't and they stop being companies like
-- that's ok.

509
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:03,495
Oh, and somebody actually, sorry,

510
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:07,602
somebody pointed out on the Twitter thread that like, if you put like an, I watch

511
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,871
like an apple watch in your luggage,

512
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:14,062
-- that's a tracking device.
-- Is that, is that legal? Have they banned that I mean,

513
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,332
you know what that feels like?

514
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,281
That feels like the, did you ever read the,

515
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,891
the television typewriter story from the old, um, hacker folklore?

516
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:27,921
So, it was, I, I, I'll dig this up but there was, uh, according to legend, there was,

517
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:31,112
this was mit early days, like, you know, sixties,

518
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,560
there was, uh, one of the hackers was in the hospital

519
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,609
and his friends wanted to bring him a computer

520
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:41,099
and so they show up and the guards, like, what is that? They said it's a computer.

521
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:44,109
He's like, it's not on my list of approved devices. You can't bring it in.

522
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,430
And they were like, what he's like, here's my list

523
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,819
and they look at the list, it says television and typewriter.

524
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:51,510
They're like, oh, sorry, we meant it's a television typewriter.

525
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,890
He's like, oh, that's on the list. You can bring it in

526
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,500
and it's like,

527
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,920
I

528
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,959
guess,

529
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,800
and, and that's what that feels like where,

530
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,319
where the airline might say no air tags and you're like, oh,

531
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,400
but this is an Apple watch totally different

532
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,949
but whatever, whatever it is, what it is.

533
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:09,430
But anyway, anyway, I want,

534
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,920
I want to tie this all up before we run ourselves out of time.

535
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,729
I feel like the parallel I keep thinking of in this regard,

536
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,939
especially around security is that

537
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,390
there's all this change, especially,

538
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,439
it feels like there's more change than ever.

539
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,719
And I don't know if that's just because I'm getting old or

540
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,050
it's true.

541
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:29,810
Well, I think part of it is a combination of small batteries that work really well.

542
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,050
Access to the internet. Right.

543
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,599
All this stuff now has Bluetooth and Wi Fi built in because

544
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,810
it's like a five cent chip and you can have an operating,

545
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:41,339
like you can make an intelligent IOT device from scratch by yourself.

546
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,569
Like I have friends that have done this with uh what is it, those

547
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:44,689
eos 32 chips

548
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,410
like to make CO2 monitors and stuff for like,

549
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:50,869
like the whole thing with a 3d printed case, like 50 bucks out of pocket.

550
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,770
And obviously at scale it's going to be a lot cheaper.

551
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:56,170
But I think that's the secret is all of a sudden we've got batteries,

552
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,989
we've got internet access and we've got compute

553
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,560
and we've got software and software development kits

554
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,319
and you can build intelligent devices that can talk

555
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,750
to the internet and have all sorts of cool sensors

556
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,859
and you can build them like one off for less than 100 bucks and let alone at scale.

557
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,060
This changes the world.

558
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,109
It's like when cars went from being horrific death traps to like, yeah,

559
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,119
they just work,

560
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,099
just buy one.

561
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,069
Yeah. Right. Right. Right. So, so anyway, kind of trying to tie this all together.

562
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,810
Right. There's all this change. It's always interesting to me watching

563
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,170
how the change is embraced and how it's not embraced.

564
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,250
And I think especially in the world of security, I see this a lot where there's,

565
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:34,785
there's all these new ideas around the security universe, right?

566
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,954
Like some of the, the n

567
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:40,444
standards even, I'm shocked by how cutting edge they can be.

568
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,925
Like the, the, my, my favorite whipping boy right now is the SSDF,

569
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,925
the secure software development framework from this.

570
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:46,255
Like,

571
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:48,084
it's pretty good. It's not that bad.

572
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,199
And then you look at some of the other new things

573
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,380
you've got like salsa, you've got sig store, there's just,

574
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,790
there's so much happening

575
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,219
and some of it will work. Some of it won't like, we don't know which it is.

576
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,910
But fundamentally as, as security practitioners,

577
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,099
we have to understand what this is because if we try to

578
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,680
hold on to the way we did security even a year ago

579
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:09,560
that's ineffective and we're functionally

580
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,319
going to just, I, I guess

581
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,760
old person ourselves out of a job, you know.

582
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,400
Well, like the world changes.

583
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,680
So, you know, a good example of these,

584
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,369
these regulations talking about baggage tracking tags.

585
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,599
Well, when they were written,

586
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:24,640
baggage tracking tags had huge batteries and powerful radios and now

587
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,750
Bluetooth, low emission and like a tiny little cr 2032 battery.

588
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,319
Like it doesn't it, you know,

589
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:30,839
it's

590
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:35,109
what was envisioned as a problem no longer is,

591
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,949
well, but this is very common as well. I think

592
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,010
you see, like, like let's face it,

593
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,939
what Lufthansa did had nothing to do with regulation.

594
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,469
They just,

595
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,219
they didn't want to be embarrassed and they were trying

596
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:48,750
to use regulation for their advantage and we see that

597
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:49,589
in

598
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,619
all regulation where someone might not want change

599
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:55,660
and they will try to use regulation to hamper change.

600
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,630
And it, it literally never works right,

601
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,550
because eventually someone finds a way around it or the regulation gets

602
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,479
or whatever.

603
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:06,020
So I think trying to hamper positive change is always just,

604
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,089
it's a losing battle in almost every instance.

605
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:08,420
I mean,

606
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,020
I can't think of a single instance where

607
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,109
someone tried,

608
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,939
you know, enforcing change

609
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,849
-- and it failed because it's just, it's almost always
-- better.

610
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:20,239
That change is coming for a reason.

611
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,109
Usually because it's better, it's more efficient. It's more effective like

612
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,619
the horseless carriage

613
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,569
turns out,

614
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,489
you know, because here's the thing, if you park a car for a week

615
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,760
in a box,

616
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,569
it'll start in a week. If you put a horse in a box for a week and don't feed it.

617
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,729
You're probably going to jail now.

618
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:39,819
Maybe not nowadays.

619
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:40,199
Yeah.

620
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,609
No, I, right. But at the same time

621
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,959
you had no purpose to park your horse for a week because

622
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,310
I mean, when I park my car for a week,

623
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:53,199
I own horses, they go lame all the time and spend a week in the box just not moving,

624
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:57,369
standing there looking stupid because they, like they stepped funny on the ground.

625
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,199
-- I
-- mean, that could be, that's what I feel like.

626
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,150
No, like horses go lame, especially at competition. Like

627
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,089
I, like,

628
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,400
I've walked into a barn and seen a horse covered in acupuncture needles, like,

629
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,760
because it was getting therapy, like

630
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,489
horses go

631
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,890
-- all the time. That's not how
-- horses worked when they were tools. Like

632
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,020
you didn't, you didn't fix the horse, you sent the horse off to the glue factory.

633
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,890
If you had another horse you could just use instead.

634
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,959
But that's the thing, right.

635
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:26,849
So this change is obviously coming for a reason and yeah,

636
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,199
trying to push it back or trying to hold it back.

637
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,469
Well, if it's, if it's change, that is like, and again,

638
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:34,430
this is a perfect example of survivor bias, right?

639
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,439
Because we're talking about change that like happens.

640
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,660
There's a lot of change that happened and fizzled out

641
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:39,849
like

642
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,040
a great example like voice

643
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,425
condition back in the late nineties, early two thousands.

644
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:49,094
-- I bought a copy of Drake and dictate.
-- I remember that thing. Then it was

645
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:49,665
terrible.

646
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:50,694
It was garbage.

647
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:51,665
And now,

648
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:56,114
you know, I can say, hey, Siri, buy me a pony on Amazon

649
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,064
and like half of our subscribers are going to yell at us.

650
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:01,364
Let's hope, let's hope that's not a thing.

651
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:02,084
But

652
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,520
anyway,

653
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,469
and, and I mean, so my favorite example I'll use, I'm gonna,

654
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm gonna pick on NFTS what?

655
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,680
Six months ago, NFTS were like the super hot thing and now everyone's like, whoa,

656
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,050
that didn't work out real good.

657
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:17,859
Yeah, it turns out that all these Ponzi schemes were Ponzi schemes.

658
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:18,810
We

659
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,109
knew

660
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:20,430
lots of people

661
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:21,459
that

662
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,290
don't buy them.

663
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,719
What's funny though is it didn't work? But the,

664
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,819
it would not shock me if in a couple of years we see a,

665
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:33,500
a practical use for the technology behind NFTS used in a reasonable way.

666
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,150
-- Oh,
-- we

667
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,560
absolutely will. With, with respect to, like, inventory tracking and stuff.

668
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:39,800
But it'll be boring corporate stuff like.

669
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,040
Right. Exactly.

670
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,920
Right. No one's gonna care, like tracking legs. Who cares?

671
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,040
I don't, I don't want to know that.

672
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,469
But anyway, anyway,

673
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,280
it's

674
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,239
luggage as NFTS and you pay and you own the luggage and

675
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:54,599
gives it

676
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:55,599
up.

677
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:56,989
Don't give them any ideas.

678
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:59,260
Seriously. Seriously. Don't,

679
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,040
it's, uh, whatever, whatever

680
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,219
flying already sucks. Actually, I just, I just went on a trip,

681
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,780
what, last week it was last week from the time we're recording. This is it,

682
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,589
I think it was

683
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,780
no kinds of a time anymore. But it was flying.

684
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,270
I mean, flying always sucked and it's just so much worse now.

685
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,380
I feel like, because all the, all the flights are super crowded.

686
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,530
People are grumpier than normal. I feel like, and it's just like, oh, man,

687
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,859
I have a friend who's flying to Vancouver and back and

688
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,910
first of all, they canceled both her flights, then they,

689
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:30,140
for a new flight

690
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:31,699
and then she's like,

691
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,489
but no return flight shows up on this thing.

692
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,739
I'm like, you probably need to call them because

693
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,239
in the past I would have just assumed like you paid

694
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,660
like

695
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,640
this person paid for a return ticket to Vancouver

696
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:43,579
and

697
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,430
like there's not been a refund. So like in Pao,

698
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,359
we've been like, yeah, for sure the airline will take care of you nowadays. I'm like,

699
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,979
I might wanna

700
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,420
really double check that

701
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:53,140
man.

702
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:53,709
Make

703
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,530
-- sure you're not on standby.
-- So, although one funny thing I've, I've, I've learned

704
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,180
so this is, it vaguely ties into this and then we'll, we'll end it.

705
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,400
I flew American Airlines, which I normally don't fly.

706
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:06,949
But they,

707
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:11,079
they were going to where I needed to go for the best times and the cheapest price,

708
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:11,609
I'm like, whatever.

709
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,420
I have no status left anywhere anyway. So, what do I care

710
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,380
at this point?

711
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,199
So,

712
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,750
Americans planes are pretty new now and back when I started flying a lot,

713
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,000
like 10 years ago, their planes were like the worst.

714
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,939
They were really old and they were, I didn't like them.

715
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:28,250
So that's why I didn't fly American ever.

716
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,099
And they're fairly new. And now

717
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:34,689
I, I was flying a lot of Delta and Delta has like the screens on all the seats,

718
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,719
right where you got like your little entertainment, whatever.

719
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:40,119
-- None of the new American flights
-- have that. Everybody brought their own screen.

720
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,869
That's right. That's right. And I'm like, wow, this is wild progress, right.

721
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,599
But at the same time,

722
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:48,599
how many millions of dollars did that probably save in the cost of that plane?

723
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:49,819
Because dude, the weight

724
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,989
that too, I suppose. Yeah, that's a good point.

725
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,625
People from, yeah, like, I don't like the, the,

726
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:57,385
the cost of the screen is mostly a one time upfront

727
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,665
charge because they're pretty reliable and don't need a lot of,

728
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,344
you know, ongoing maintenance and administration.

729
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:02,305
But the weight,

730
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:07,305
like, you add 100 pounds to a plane over the life of that plane. That's a lot of money.

731
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:10,665
-- More than
-- 100 pounds. I bet. I bet it's hundreds of pounds. At least

732
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,925
they each way. Yeah, a couple 100 seat.

733
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:15,064
Half a pound. Yeah. Anyways, the point is,

734
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,630
yeah, just, and the simplification you can make the seats thinner,

735
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,709
maybe cram in one more row of seats you can get no seriously,

736
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,630
like plane seats have gotten thinner and, you know,

737
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,750
if you can fit one or two more rows of people and that's one or 2% more profit.

738
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,349
This is why I'm glad I'm not like a giant person like you. I fit

739
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,339
when I get on my

740
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:35,750
-- plane,
-- we'll have to put that picture of Andre the giant in a plane.

741
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,270
-- Oh, yeah.
-- Yeah. You know where he's in, like first class taking up two seats. Right.

742
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,770
Right.

743
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,060
You know,

744
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:42,869
but

745
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,040
I think it's going to be interesting because as people

746
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,140
gain this, you know, ecosystem of tracking and sensing and

747
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,439
kind of telling the truth,

748
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:54,930
like what happens when my baggage has a little camera in it

749
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:57,459
to see if it's being abused or not like a drop sensor,

750
00:30:57,469 --> 00:31:00,339
you know, like things like, like that guy that had to write that, you know, song,

751
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,359
like, uh I think it was American Airlines or Delta.

752
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,869
Why did you smash my guitar?

753
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,199
Like, he's, he's like sitting in the plane watching and he's filming the guy, like,

754
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:10,140
just smashing the bejesus out of his poor guitar.

755
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:11,020
You know,

756
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:11,672
he wrote a song.

757
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:13,583
It, it went viral on Twitter and, you know,

758
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:15,113
they finally got him a new guitar or whatever.

759
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:19,233
But again, that's not a sustainable model for, you know, the rest of us.

760
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,703
It's always been the model though.

761
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,703
Kurt, like the, the concept of making things go viral.

762
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:27,432
I mean, think about what is it, uh uh what was it? The book Unsafe at any speed

763
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:30,062
was, is credited with a lot of auto safety.

764
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:33,792
You had the, the, the guy who created the poison squad where they were,

765
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:35,902
he had these people like eating food.

766
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:37,113
Oh, this was, this is a US thing.

767
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:38,985
Kurt's looking at me funny like, I don't know what you're talking about.

768
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:40,776
I'll, I'll find, I'll dig it up and look.

769
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,066
But in the US, obviously,

770
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:45,475
our food safety was terrible at the turn of the century in the early 19 hundreds.

771
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,735
I can't say turn of the century because that was only 20 years ago.

772
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,546
Um in the early 19 hundreds.

773
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:51,345
And this guy created a group,

774
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:54,985
he called the Poison Squad where he was feeding them preservatives

775
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:58,375
and documenting how sick they were getting from this stuff.

776
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:02,845
And then his research led to a lot of the food regulations around, you know,

777
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:04,345
what's safe and what's not safe.

778
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:04,946
And,

779
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,380
and I think spectacle has been the only way that true change has been driven, like in,

780
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,500
in human history.

781
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:15,020
And I'd like to say it'll change, but I don't think it will. I think

782
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,670
like spectacle is what, how we're going to have to do a lot of the things we do.

783
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,680
And then eventually, if you get attention,

784
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,699
maybe someone who has the ability to actually create

785
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,290
-- the change will create the change so
-- well,

786
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,979
the reality is life has so many threats and problems

787
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:30,650
and

788
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,739
just things that don't work, right?

789
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,290
We kind of have to pick and choose which do we fix because there is,

790
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,739
that's true. There's an infinite number of problems.

791
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,800
They're not going away. All right, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.
