Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 184 with myself,

1
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:12,609
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,970
So, what's new man?

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,260
I actually phoned in a complaint to the city and they agreed that it was

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,420
a correct complaint and that they would check into it in a few days.

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,409
I was actually kind of shocked

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,569
-- that it was that it
-- doesn't mean anything

7
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,399
just because they agree with you doesn't mean they're

8
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,590
actually going to do anything about your complaint.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,169
True, true. But in this case, so they bladed all the roads yesterday and

10
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:33,650
that,

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,720
which is nice because the roads were a bit flatter now and then they had like a little,

12
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:37,560
a guy in a gator.

13
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:40,889
So it's like a little four by four kind of golf cart on steroid thing, you know,

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,979
with the little snowplow on the front

15
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,009
to, to clean off in front of the driveways and stuff because, you know,

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,110
otherwise you get like that 2 ft pile of rock hard ice

17
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,310
uh, in front of your driveway.

18
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:55,130
And, um, so he cleared out my driveway, but he made a 4 ft pile of like,

19
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,869
ice rubble on top of

20
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,069
-- the drain for the street.
-- What could possibly go wrong.

21
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,419
Yeah, exactly.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,099
And the thing is last year they spent like,

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,389
two days fixing potholes on the street because of that quo, of drainage issues.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,699
So, obviously,

25
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:13,150
ok, so I need to, I don't, I don't understand what this means.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,739
You said they bladed the road.

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,790
So when they plow your roads, they don't plow down to the concrete.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,870
-- No,
-- they plow down to within four inches.

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,339
It's, it's more a matter of just making it flat because like the road out here

30
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:26,394
not so bad, the ruts are maybe 23 inches deep.

31
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:30,285
But for example, I've been in back alleys a couple of which were, the ruts are so deep.

32
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:31,294
My car bottoms out,

33
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:32,245
right.

34
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:37,614
So you get a 89 inch difference and we're not talking like, oh, fluffy snow, ha ha, ha.

35
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:38,964
We're talking, you know,

36
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:39,684
ice.

37
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,559
And when you bought them out on ice, your car makes a bad noise.

38
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:43,809
It just reminds me of like,

39
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,870
this kind of doing maintenance is really

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,389
important and doing maintenance correctly is really important

41
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,809
because it's great that they bladed the road because the idea is like,

42
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,199
there's less wear and tear on our cars and when the stuff melts it'll melt better,

43
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,639
you know, because it won't be all like, it'll be flatter so it'll run off,

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,660
but they blocked the place where it needs to run off to.

45
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,410
But it's easy to say this and everyone always says

46
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:08,119
this about how you need to do the maintenance,

47
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,479
you need to do all this work

48
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,529
and

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,509
almost nobody ever does it.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,320
And this is true of government and it's true of private industry.

51
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,470
It is true of our personal lives.

52
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,809
I would generally agree. But I mean, at least it's getting easier.

53
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,850
For example, you can do GPS maps of where all the drains are and just, you know,

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,850
have a tablet and the guy can be like, oh, don't pile the snow here.

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,330
You know,

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,410
like the farmers with their spraying of crops more intelligently based on,

57
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,914
you know, GIS state and, you know,

58
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,324
ah,

59
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:34,794
but now farmers have

60
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,764
a desire to do that. Right? Because they will make more money.

61
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,285
The word you're looking for is incentive.

62
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,294
-- Right?
-- There's, there's a reason whereas

63
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,554
paying the man driving the plow to not pile

64
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:49,125
something up in a spot on a tablet. What is his incentive to not do that?

65
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,054
Literally nothing?

66
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,205
Well, somebody phones in a complaint and he gets dinged with a fine, maybe

67
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,470
for doing it wrong.

68
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,789
I mean, there's this great guy, this guy had, uh, I forget what brand of camera but

69
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,940
his poor neighbor comes to him and he's like,

70
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,210
do you know what happened to my car last night?

71
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,639
And his car is just like the back end of it is just

72
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:07,529
destroyed and it's pushed into a car in front and the guy's like,

73
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,539
yeah, I'll check my camera

74
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,949
and he does and it's a grater, like a big grater and you know how they have, like,

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,949
the two big front wheels just ran into a parked car and pushed it into the car in front,

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,270
backed up and, like, kept going, which I get, but he didn't like phone it in or,

77
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,990
you know, like, tell a supervisor later on in the shift, like, oh, bye.

78
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,289
The way I clobbered this poor car over here.

79
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,570
The guy just destroyed this car and just drove off and, you know,

80
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,130
without that video footage proving that the greater did,

81
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,490
it would have been basically impossible.

82
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,830
Right.

83
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:33,479
It's

84
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,389
interesting to me that, to see the, you know,

85
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,960
there is the potential for these technologies used correctly to,

86
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,570
to help us with maintenance, you know,

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,839
augmented reality, you know, don't, don't connect that pipe to that output.

88
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,529
That's wrong.

89
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:44,809
You know,

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,369
don't connect that black wire to that white terminal

91
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,039
-- connected to the black one
-- and in some cases,

92
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,649
I think that will work, but

93
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,130
it's,

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,229
it just depends on what the incentive structure is

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,910
in all of this. And

96
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,919
I have a strong suspicion for the guy driving the plow.

97
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,720
It's going to be hard to have an incentive because let's face it.

98
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,050
His actual job is getting the snow off the road,

99
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,990
right. That's all anyone cares about.

100
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,229
-- Yeah, but
-- like the guy in the gator, for example,

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,970
his incentive should be not just to clear the

102
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,630
driveways but to make sure also that the,

103
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,350
-- the drains are not blocked up
-- except you're probably the

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,390
only freaking town who's calling and complaining about blocked drains.

105
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,230
-- So,
-- probably,

106
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,869
yeah.

107
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,880
Although she, it didn't sound like this was her first complaint.

108
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:28,260
No, I'm amazed that that is true.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,549
Now, were the other complaints you calling earlier?

110
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,750
Anyway, let's talk about something even worse than snow.

111
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:38,549
Yeah. So,

112
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:39,380
ok.

113
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,470
Are we going to even mention the whole.org dot com price grab, you know,

114
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,790
financial shenanigans, conflict of interest,

115
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,149
possibly illegal stuff going on or are we just gonna leave it at that?

116
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,089
Let's, let's ignore that. That's,

117
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,209
there's other places people can go if you, if you aren't aware.org

118
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:54,470
org

119
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,380
is sort of maybe up for sale and there's some

120
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,829
-- bizarre political shenanigans going on. Go educate yourself. No,
-- not bizarre.

121
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,250
There's just straight up old tiny, like I

122
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,140
control.org, I'm on the icann Board, for.org and we're selling it to a company that,

123
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:08,470
huh?

124
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,359
Weird. I also sit on that board.

125
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,179
Right.

126
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,899
Ok. Anyway, we're not getting into it.

127
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,760
And same thing for.com, they just approved a 70 what was it?

128
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:20,049
A 72% or they want to approve like a 72% price increase

129
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,510
over a period of a couple of years for the registry.

130
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,140
And it's kind of like,

131
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,970
that's a lot more than inflation.

132
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,049
-- I'm
-- not getting into it. Go find someone smarter than, than us

133
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,290
that's talking about it and you might learn.

134
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,239
Let's just talk about the other DNS tire fire,

135
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,029
internal domains.

136
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,640
I God bless internal domains.

137
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,809
Do. I'll let you explain it. It's a Krebs story. It's good.

138
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,130
We'll put a link in the show notes.

139
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:51,200
So the way computers do a DNS look up is not what you'd expect.

140
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,029
Basically, the long and the short of it is, is you can have like a local search domain,

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,790
like say

142
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:55,890
creed.org.

143
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,390
So that when you look for printer,

144
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,890
you don't look for just printer, you look for printer.creed.org.

145
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,149
And

146
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,040
assuming you have that set up, you find your printer, talk to it. Life goes on.

147
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:09,970
The problem then becomes also is it, it gets way more complicated than that,

148
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,619
especially with,

149
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,970
say a technology like active directory for Microsoft where you have a

150
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,709
combination of a directory for users and computers and services and systems

151
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,279
that also ties into DNS sort of but not really like,

152
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,399
it ties into DNS in the sense of it does DNS and it provides DNS,

153
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,019
but typically people don't actually tie it into a true DNS name. They

154
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,059
Microsoft literally says set up your Corp name as Corp.

155
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,070
And so then it basically thinks it's corp.com.

156
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,850
Well, no, I think I from my understanding is Microsoft meant to say

157
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,649
set up

158
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,089
corp.cried.org, not corp.com, but I'll let you guess which one everyone did. No.

159
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,269
Microsoft said just set up Corp but they didn't again. Yeah, go deep enough.

160
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,500
I know a bit about ad

161
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,649
stuff. I don't want to know. It's

162
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,730
ad is horrendously complicated and amazing.

163
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:01,920
Right. Like it's LDA

164
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,170
combined with

165
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,290
a bunch of other stuff on steroids. You know, it makes uh novel night.

166
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,170
We back in the day look simple. So it's actually not as simple as that.

167
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,399
Even if you set up Corp, say.company.com,

168
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,329
you still have problems.

169
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,290
There's a whole pile of corporate networks out

170
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,570
there with internal networks that think they're Corp.

171
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:22,109
And so when they start looking for stuff, they think they're corp.com and, well,

172
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,130
it turns out that's actually a valid domain name.

173
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,779
And the guy that owns it,

174
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,470
this is my favorite part of the article.

175
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,309
They're like, we basically decided to do a test where we'd actually like

176
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,869
stand up corp.com.

177
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,500
Like it's, it's a domain, it's registered domain, but it's not active.

178
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,640
So we'd actually make it active and we'd, we'd, um,

179
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,390
collect all the traffic sent to it.

180
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,279
Right. Well, ok, before we, before we start on this point, we should clarify.

181
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,049
Corp.com is owned by a person

182
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,410
and they want to sell it now because they don't

183
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,510
want their Children to take on this toxic sludge heap

184
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,489
when they eventually pass on.

185
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,609
And

186
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:58,269
they've not been using it as like, goodwill to humanity up to this point.

187
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,989
Well, in fairness, they've done sort of the least terrible thing with, with it,

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,489
which is to keep it inactive.

189
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,570
Right. Right.

190
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:06,359
And so now you're saying that basically in this creb story,

191
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:07,929
people did tests where they turn it on

192
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,700
and holy crap,

193
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,799
-- they
-- turned it on and they had to turn it off after 15 minutes

194
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:16,559
because it was so horrifying how much traffic was being sent to it.

195
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,920
And we're not talking like, oh,

196
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,410
you know, I want to talk to the printer. We're talking like,

197
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,600
hey, I need to authenticate.

198
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:25,980
Here's my credentials from like thousands and tens of thousands of systems.

199
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,399
And they ended up like taking a brief glance at the data

200
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,515
and going nope and just deleting all of it because I,

201
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,785
I did something similar back in the day with my ISP.

202
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,296
My ISP back when it was Videotron.

203
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,755
They let you, they had high speed cable internet, 10 megabit uh down one megabit up,

204
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,166
you know, this is like 20 years ago.

205
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,195
So it was pretty fantastic.

206
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:44,155
And they let you pick a host name, right?

207
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,926
So that's pretty like they gave you a static IP and let you pick a host name.

208
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,005
Oh, I remember this thing. You picked what logo

209
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:49,856
host was it?

210
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,271
I picked local host.

211
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,062
Yeah.

212
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:55,072
So again, when, when a computer looks up local host,

213
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:58,331
it looks up local host dot Whatever its default search domain is and

214
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:01,322
then that fails and then it looks up just local host and goes.

215
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:04,031
Oh yeah, that's me. Yeah. So the default search domain.

216
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:06,072
So local host dot Default search domain,

217
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:10,781
I had to disable that pretty quick because my, my, my link got flooded.

218
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,070
Um And then I had to go tell Kevin and I'm like, yeah,

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,030
I remember that because I was trying all these different domains.

220
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,320
Like I tried www which didn't let me grab. Good.

221
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,890
It, I tried to grab admin which didn't let me grab and

222
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,849
mail, which didn't let me grab and a bunch of others. And I'm like, OK, good.

223
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,090
And then I'm like local host and it's like,

224
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,280
oh,

225
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,849
so, yeah, they, they're like, yeah, we're gonna update the, uh, the,

226
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,369
the blacklist there.

227
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,070
Well done.

228
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,179
But yeah, similar thing.

229
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,429
I mean,

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,109
it's just the reality is computer networks by and large

231
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,890
have the potential to leak a lot of data.

232
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,469
They just typically don't because the DNS end point they want,

233
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,789
they want to leak to doesn't actually exist.

234
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,859
But if it ever starts to,

235
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:44,614
you're kind of up the creek

236
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,405
like there's dot Internal. Right. So many people use dot Internal as a domain name.

237
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:51,494
And 20 years ago I would have been ok with this, you know, where they say,

238
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,744
like dot Internal will never be a real domain name.

239
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:55,005
And I would have gone. Yeah, you're probably right.

240
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,955
Except now we have over 1200 top level domains and

241
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,224
there was talk at one point of actually making dot Internal

242
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,294
like a valid top

243
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:01,994
level domain.

244
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,520
Yeah. Right.

245
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,880
Uh huh. So, yeah, probably not the best idea.

246
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,299
I, I just, I don't know what to say or do here because you know,

247
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,599
this is like a systemic problem with how people

248
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,719
set up their DNS and set up their networks.

249
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,989
I I have an answer but I will, I will start this by saying so my home network,

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,969
I used to use uh breast dot home as my home network and then dot Home became a TLD.

251
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,359
I'm like, well time to fix this.

252
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:28,809
But

253
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,320
so yeah. Yeah. Now I just pretend I'm part of breast.net,

254
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,500
which is my, my my domain. I own. This sounds terrible.

255
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,200
And I will explain myself a bit, but honestly,

256
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,729
I think corp.com should be sold and I think the

257
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,809
more evil the person who buys it the better.

258
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:47,770
That sounds terrible. I'm sure.

259
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,570
But here's kind of,

260
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,929
here's my reasoning on this is so the owner wants Microsoft to buy it for like 1.7

261
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,760
-- million I think is the asking price I
-- saw

262
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,650
he didn't specifically want Microsoft to buy it.

263
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,409
He's selling it for 1.7 million and he'd offered it to Microsoft and past,

264
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,390
but they'd only offered like 20

265
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,049
and he's like, well, no, because

266
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,820
-- you guys made this mess and it's a bigger mess than 20 grand
-- and that's probably fair.

267
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,169
But my take on this is so if Microsoft wants to pay a reasonable price for it,

268
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,419
I think that's fair and there's nothing wrong with that.

269
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,190
However, if somebody evil buys it, now,

270
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,659
we're back to our discussion about incentives,

271
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,880
people have an incentive to fix this.

272
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,500
Whereas if Microsoft buys it, there's no incentive.

273
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:30,219
-- They won't. They, some people won't. A lot will.
-- I would argue that

274
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,409
it,

275
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,530
we would, we would generally all be better off economically speaking,

276
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,780
if Microsoft just bought it and deep fixed it because it's going to cost,

277
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:39,760
I think you will agree a lot more than $1.7 million

278
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,289
to fix all those networks.

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,429
-- It will not cost Microsoft $1.7 million to fix all those networks.
-- True.

280
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,950
But I'm thinking, you know, this is, this sounds a lot to me like broken window files.

281
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,340
It's like, oh,

282
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:53,710
we can make a whole bunch of economic activity by throwing bricks through windows,

283
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:56,330
you know, by having somebody do something evil with corp.com,

284
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,090
we can generate a whole bunch of activity and people have to secure their networks.

285
00:11:59,099 --> 00:11:59,450
Well,

286
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,239
they're not going to be securing their networks.

287
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,200
They're gonna be scrambling to like, rename them, which, oh man,

288
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,609
technically speaking, renaming your active directory is possible,

289
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,489
but

290
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,330
I

291
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,289
bet it's terrible.

292
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,989
I mean,

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,530
it's technically also possible to like change out your cylinder heads

294
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,650
while you're driving down the highway at 100 miles an hour.

295
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,640
-- I don't know if that's possible. I feel like it's not.
-- Yeah.

296
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:23,869
Well,

297
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,840
and that's kind of my point with these large corporate

298
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:28,650
global spanning networks with hundreds of thousands of hosts.

299
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,169
-- And
-- look, man, if you are a legitimate organization,

300
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,190
like if you're large and you have resolver trying to hit corp.com.

301
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,130
Holy crap. What is wrong with your security team

302
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,002
in your network team?

303
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,392
Because you should have someone competent enough to figure this out.

304
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,791
The security team probably had no say in this

305
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,492
because this was the best practice from Microsoft

306
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,531
man. I feel like no, that's

307
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:55,372
-- no, just, no.
-- Well, and it's one of those things like a lot of security flaws.

308
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,541
It doesn't become a security flaw until somebody evil

309
00:12:57,552 --> 00:12:59,611
owns corp.com and starts doing something with it.

310
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:02,651
Until then it's like a buffer overflow that just sits there lurking

311
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,351
man.

312
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:07,651
If you are a security team and you've got Resolver trying to hit corp.com,

313
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,012
there's no excuse for that.

314
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:11,903
There just is none even saying it doesn't go anywhere.

315
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:12,114
See,

316
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,174
I would argue this is Microsoft's fault because

317
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,614
-- guess when this domain was registered a
-- long,

318
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:18,643
-- long, long, long time ago,
-- 1990

319
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:19,114
four.

320
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:19,374
Right.

321
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,494
It was part of this guy,

322
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:22,874
whoever owns it brought up a whole bunch of really

323
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,193
juicy domains and sold them off which I mean,

324
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:25,814
good for him.

325
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:29,314
That's, I remember back in the day it was, it was hard to buy domains.

326
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:32,874
-- Oh, poker.com got sold and that that person retired.
-- Right. Right.

327
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,033
I don't know because I would say the

328
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:37,893
blame here generally lies squarely on Microsoft for

329
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:42,856
creating this dangerous behavior and kind of recommending people do it.

330
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:46,736
I'm not sure how much I would blame people if they're following Microsoft guidance,

331
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:49,666
fully understanding a technological decision,

332
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,255
especially when it's something that interacts with DNS in a weird way.

333
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,695
There's not a lot of people that actually understand this.

334
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,046
-- So
-- you just made me think of something else that's really

335
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:03,505
important is in the vast majority of compromises of an organization.

336
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,835
Active directory is basically the target because

337
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:10,239
the odds of it being configured correctly are essentially 0%.

338
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,299
I'm not sure there is a correct configuration.

339
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,479
There probably isn't.

340
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,409
But like this is,

341
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,309
this just feels like another one of those examples where active directory is

342
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,659
-- unnecessarily complex.
-- No, I would disagree.

343
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:27,070
It is necessarily complex when you look at what it does and what it enables.

344
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
I don't think you can say that.

345
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,349
I think if you make a tool that literally can't be configured correctly,

346
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,919
you've created a tool that's unnecessarily complex.

347
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:34,700
So E Linux,

348
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,719
I would agree.

349
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:39,659
E Linux is unnecessarily complex and that's why everyone turns it off. I mean,

350
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,049
look, I would be the first person to admit that I'll turn Se Linux off the second.

351
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,969
It gets in my way and I'm a security guy and I know how to fix it,

352
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,489
but I can't be bothered to do it,

353
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,729
expecting normal people to keep that on is ridiculous.

354
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,830
And the fact that basically the Se Linux

355
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,109
developers mitigating strategy for all these years has been yelling at people.

356
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,630
I mean, how did that work out guys?

357
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,919
Like, no, I think se Linux is a perfect poster child for like

358
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:06,085
this is a fundamentally flawed technology that needs to be fixed.

359
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:10,846
I wouldn't say it's fundamentally flawed. It's fundamentally difficult to use and

360
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,885
there's just been no impetus to, to simplify it and make it work better.

361
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:19,205
Well, no, but like for example, cars early on when you were crank starting them,

362
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:19,736
they could

363
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,346
start up and like break your arm

364
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,406
and well, then we got starter motors,

365
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,106
right.

366
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,125
We made it better.

367
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:26,622
Yeah.

368
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,132
And I mean, that's what I'm saying. Se Linux,

369
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:35,221
I remember Se Linux actually had a graphical tool to look at logs and to build policy.

370
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:38,041
Well, and so this graphical interface was actually pretty decent,

371
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,921
but it sort of just died.

372
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,502
-- I don't
-- remember that and it wouldn't shock me

373
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,081
because there was probably no demand for it because, you know,

374
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,262
it's easier than fixing.

375
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,622
Se Linux is turning it off

376
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,059
-- and this is similar to active
-- directory. Well, you can't turn active directory off.

377
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,929
Well,

378
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:55,500
no,

379
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,119
not exactly.

380
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,190
But the point is, well,

381
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,580
you kind of can now because I think there's alternative tools that are acceptable.

382
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,229
We'll say

383
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,909
-- it wouldn't be trivial to migrate.
-- No.

384
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,890
Like if you're running a large Microsoft network, you use active directory first.

385
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:12,989
-- All
-- right.

386
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,390
Well, and that's fair.

387
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,719
If you, if you're big enough, you're not going to migrate to anything else.

388
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:17,830
But regardless,

389
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,150
I will blame Microsoft for building a terrible tool more than I will blame.

390
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,969
I'm not so sure. It's a terrible tool as it lacks additional tooling

391
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,859
because fundamentally what it does it needs to do.

392
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:30,349
And I still think

393
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,190
that

394
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:35,799
claiming it's unfixed bad and corp.com has to go

395
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,580
to Microsoft because there's no other way around.

396
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,989
This

397
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,190
-- is an absurdity.
-- Well, I'm not saying it's unfixable bad.

398
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm saying just buying corp.com and deep fixing it is a far cheaper option.

399
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,760
Well, it's not cheaper for them. I mean, don't get me wrong.

400
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,880
They have the cash to do it.

401
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,429
-- So I don't know why they wouldn't necessarily, I
-- mean,

402
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,859
it's cheaper for even a large company to just buy

403
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,849
it and deep fix it rather than fix their network.

404
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,289
That would be hilarious

405
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:01,159
and ignoring active directory because I'm sick

406
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,849
of talking about that because whatever,

407
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,848
if you read this article,

408
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,660
there was also a lot of email and other crazy things that came into corp.com

409
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,030
and I have a suspicion. There's, there's kind of two sides to this.

410
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,939
There's a Microsoft side of,

411
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,449
they gave bad advice

412
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,209
and then there's the other side of,

413
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:20,420
I bet a lot of people didn't realize corp.com was a real domain.

414
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,670
They assumed it was similar to example.com

415
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,660
and they were using it as like part of testing and kind of product defaults.

416
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,939
And so now it's a mess.

417
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,569
The thing is there's also people that chose other domains that are active.

418
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:35,060
Oh. Right. Right. No, it happens all the time. I will still never forget me.

419
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,119
And like my,

420
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:41,760
I complain about this. I, I haven't complained in a while but when I go to my gym,

421
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,119
the 172.16 network, except they have the route wrong.

422
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:53,400
So I can't get to anything in the 172 dot X network, right?

423
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,300
The, the slash or is that a slash eight?

424
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,760
And so obviously it's meant to be 172.16 through 0.32

425
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,910
which is what a sla it's a slash I,

426
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,099
I forget what it even is.

427
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:07,589
It doesn't matter. Like this is my favorite example because I'm actually, I've seen

428
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,280
more than one place now.

429
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,650
This is about the third or fourth,

430
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,339
but people screw this up because people don't understand how

431
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:15,520
networking works and they get the IP addresses wrong.

432
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,239
Right. It's like this is why I like the 10 dot X

433
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,290
private IP space and the 192.168 private IP space because like,

434
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,900
it's pretty hard to screw those up.

435
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,939
Whereas the 172.16

436
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,780
is really easy to screw up. It's the same thing with these domains. Right?

437
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,780
It's worse. The 172.16 is a slash 12

438
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,140
slash 12. That's it. Ok. Right. Right.

439
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,849
Yeah.

440
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,510
And so that's a weird number that most people

441
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,270
look at and probably think is wrong or something.

442
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,770
Right?

443
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,969
Because people don't know they,

444
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:43,300
it's almost everyone is used to dealing with

445
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,040
like slash eight slash 16 slash 20 fours.

446
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,140
-- Right.
-- Well, basically 10 dot Star or wanted to do 168 dot Star.

447
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,949
Right. Right.

448
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,890
Exactly.

449
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,800
Like I literally remember finding out about 1 72.16. I'm like, what?

450
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,189
Like I was so confused for a while. Right.

451
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:02,209
In fact, I'll never forget when this was my first job out of college. It was a,

452
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,969
they, they were a window shop

453
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:04,890
and

454
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,189
-- the windows admin
-- like windows,

455
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,910
the operating system or windows like making actual physical windows

456
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,530
-- like
-- no, no, like the operating system, they had windows everywhere.

457
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:13,869
And of course,

458
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,290
they hired me as a UNIX admin and I was like the super

459
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,089
crazy black sheep and I was annoying to be just as I am

460
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,540
and I'll never forget like he had 172 dot

461
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,449
You know, X as a slash eight for the corporate network.

462
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,469
I'm like, that's public IP space. He's like, no, it's not. I said, yeah, it is.

463
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,510
And like he started arguing with me like, all right, fine.

464
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,239
I got the RFC out and I showed it to him.

465
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,430
He was like, 00, well, it probably doesn't matter anyway.

466
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,939
I'm like, oh my goodness, this is ridiculous.

467
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,410
And yeah, like it,

468
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,500
we couldn't get to anything in the 172 dot

469
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,579
X space because it was our private corporate network.

470
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:53,329
-- It's like just use 1010 is easy. You literally can't
-- screw it up.

471
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:57,020
Problem becomes when you need to peer or VPN with somebody else using 10.

472
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,400
And then it just all goes to,

473
00:19:58,699 --> 00:19:59,699
-- and
-- I've, I've had that

474
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:03,854
actually because I had, uh, what was it? I was, oh, my in-laws

475
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:08,005
were set up to use 10 dot X. And when I would VPN in

476
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:09,405
two, I think it was at redhead.

477
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:12,285
Actually, they, they were, they were using the exact same subnets.

478
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,275
I remember having to re

479
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,555
my network when I started.

480
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,484
And so I just, I gave up and I'm like, I'm gonna rub your network and they were like,

481
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:19,805
what I said, great.

482
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:20,724
Like,

483
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:23,155
they don't even know anything changed. Right. But yeah,

484
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:24,369
it was,

485
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,260
it was painful and, but whatever,

486
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,790
it doesn't matter when you're a corporate network,

487
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,079
you're rarely VPN into someone else's network, right?

488
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:33,400
-- It's fine. Everything's fine.
-- Uh Not anymore.

489
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,780
This is kind of the whole premise of like cloud gateway and stuff at Amazon.

490
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,520
-- Like, yeah, whatever,
-- who cares?

491
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,819
Like, even Amazon now has split horizon,

492
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,959
like internal and external DNS for your cloud stuff.

493
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:45,439
Yep. Yep, they do. It's pretty cool.

494
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,010
So, so anyway, anyway,

495
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,530
I guess my point being

496
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,880
and this is something I've been thinking about kind

497
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,290
of all week since I read this story.

498
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,969
And when you said we should talk about this is just the fact that

499
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:56,300
it is

500
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:01,349
incredibly difficult for people to not screw this stuff up. And I don't think

501
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,380
I, I feel like holding their hand too much isn't necessarily the right option.

502
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,209
We're like,

503
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:11,140
and I'm, I'm gonna come back to, if corp.com is bought by an evildoer,

504
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,109
I think that's gonna fix people quick and I know you disagree with me.

505
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,520
Well, it's not that I disagree with you.

506
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,280
It's just the reality is they're not going to fix their network.

507
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,510
They're gonna, like, filter out going DNS traffic to corp.com maybe.

508
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,390
But that, that's something

509
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,520
I,

510
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,670
I don't know.

511
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,699
I,

512
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,969
I keep going back and forth on this one in my head and

513
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:30,199
I can see instances where people always are going to make silly mistakes,

514
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:34,680
but I don't think that is acceptable either because I think it's a combination of

515
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,329
if your tools let you, for example, use a, a public subnet in

516
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,119
your private network

517
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,189
that is partially the tool's fault and partially the person's fault.

518
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,180
How's the tool supposed to know if you're actually wanting

519
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:48,849
to number with 10 dot star or 11 dot star

520
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,520
when you

521
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,250
setting it up in a Windows, internal network,

522
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,469
that's clearly meant to be a private IP space.

523
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,420
-- Come on, the tool should
-- know, I mean,

524
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,989
I would say the tool should probably be aware of

525
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,489
the RFC 1918 or whatever it is space and,

526
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,930
and say like give you a warning if you

527
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:04,310
are or are not doing that.

528
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,550
But it's called like for example,

529
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,890
my home network here by default is internal 1 92.168 dot whatever space

530
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,770
plus valid, I PV six because my ISP hands me a valid slash.

531
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,689
Was it like a 32 or a 54 or something?

532
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:19,069
I PV six is different and that doesn't count.

533
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,709
I would argue that most people have about as much expertise

534
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,689
with I PV four as they do with I PV six,

535
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:24,949
which is to say none.

536
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,709
Yeah, to a degree.

537
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,829
I mean, this is, I think partially where I PV six gets some things, right?

538
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,630
Because they, you have real ips.

539
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,469
You don't have Nat. Nat is

540
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:34,869
nat is a headache.

541
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:35,989
Yeah, you have,

542
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,400
-- well,
-- it exists. Please don't use it.

543
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,930
You don't need it. Nat is there because of the whiny complainers from I

544
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,390
PV for

545
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,910
-- land.
-- I personally like

546
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,650
Nat because I have a lot of devices. I don't want to accept incoming connections.

547
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,560
Like I just want them to be dumb clients ideally

548
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:54,869
like my TV.

549
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,750
So you run Net on your internal I PV six network.

550
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,270
-- Uh
-- No, because it's uh it's complicated but basically I don't,

551
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:02,709
no,

552
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,930
you don't get to tell me you prefer nat now.

553
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:08,920
-- Uh
-- Well, I prefer net basically if something is dumb enough not to talk I PV six,

554
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,989
I don't want it on the internet

555
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,050
because by definition, it's not getting any real good security updates,

556
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,109
but at the same time,

557
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:19,670
like it is up to your, your router not to allow I PV six traffic in, right?

558
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,640
Like

559
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,270
you need tools to do the right thing. Here

560
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,709
anyway,

561
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,619
-- I guess
-- what it boils down to DNS is

562
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,140
still complicated and people are still messing it up.

563
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,310
No, DNS isn't complicated. Active directory sucks. That's the lesson here. Like

564
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,310
the tooling needs to be fixed

565
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,160
like full stop. That's the correct solution.

566
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,609
Microsoft should not spend $1.7 million to buy corp.com

567
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:48,380
and they should spend $1.7 million to look for people trying to

568
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,920
connect to corp.com and active directory and throw up a warning.

569
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,214
That's like, hey, I see your G

570
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:52,645
connector,

571
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:53,614
corp.com.

572
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:55,775
You know, you can have like clipping, tell you for example,

573
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:58,064
and he could guide you through fixing your active directory.

574
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:00,255
That would be a better spend

575
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:01,354
on that

576
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,954
-- than buying a domain just to deep fix it.
-- I disagree.

577
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:07,454
Buying it and deep fixing it makes the problem go away for now.

578
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:10,060
And granted it doesn't make the problem go away for all the

579
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,760
other domains people accidentally chose like say company.com is a real thing.

580
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,760
-- I think
-- probably everything.com is a real thing

581
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,229
now

582
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,030
pretty much.

583
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,469
And actually in all seriousness,

584
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:24,670
if you've made it through the bizarre ranting of curt and I to this point,

585
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,390
there is a domain called example.com that is

586
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,750
literally created for all this sort of stuff.

587
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,359
-- Well,
-- an example.org and

588
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:31,979
-- well, they
-- have,

589
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:32,260
yeah,

590
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,099
like use example.com if you ever do any

591
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,599
sort of development or testing or document writing,

592
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:41,609
except remember that one time

593
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,010
they actually started accepting email for example.com, that was a mistake.

594
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,420
And also if you go to example.com in your browser, it

595
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,530
you get a web page.

596
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,819
-- Yeah,
-- it goes somewhere but it is literally created for this purpose, right?

597
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,569
But it used to not resolve it used to be safe like

598
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,060
it's still safe. Sort of.

599
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:00,550
Yeah,

600
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,420
example.org and example.com both serve a valid web

601
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,319
page now which they definitely didn't used to.

602
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,390
I'm OK with him serving it because I think it is, it

603
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,449
is an example of something real happening is probably

604
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,699
going to be easier to detect than an error.

605
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:15,449
Uh

606
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:18,849
Well, DNS timeouts, yeah, typically aren't

607
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,010
-- all very,
-- no, they, they take a long time and people often give up.

608
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,390
Well,

609
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,719
often I've discovered a lot of networking equipment doesn't really throw an air.

610
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:28,569
-- It just sort of times out and kind of looks at you stupidly
-- and,

611
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:28,739
yeah.

612
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:29,400
Right.

613
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,810
It's always infuriating to me that, like,

614
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:35,410
I'll go to a website in my browser and it's thinking that and after like 10 seconds,

615
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,410
I just click the URL and hit, enter.

616
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,390
So it tries again and then it pops up immediately and it's like, it's,

617
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,890
it's after five seconds guys, it is clear the TCP connection has timed out

618
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:46,255
something happened.

619
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,416
Try again.

620
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,095
It's never coming back.

621
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,666
But anyway, networks are hard.

622
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:52,735
They work better than they used to though.

623
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:53,735
Uh

624
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,375
Yeah. Anyone who talks about the good old days with any of this stuff is

625
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:02,536
they have brain damage and it was so bad. It was so bad.

626
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:06,125
I actually remember trying to set up multicast at one point.

627
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:07,615
-- I don't want to talk about it.
-- II,

628
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,855
I read about it because I thought, oh, this sounds neat.

629
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:14,156
And I was like, nope, I'm not doing this. This is ridiculous. And it was, it was

630
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,332
that insane and yeah, I mean, whatever, whatever.

631
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,741
Well, so why don't we talk about something happy and simple?

632
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:20,302
So,

633
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,472
crypto A G is this company that was

634
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:26,182
started in 1952 to provide commercial cryptography,

635
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,011
you know, for companies that wanted to communicate over the globe without,

636
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,112
you know, the competitors reading their messages

637
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,761
and without the, you know,

638
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:37,661
using one time pads or craziness like code books and all that, which,

639
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,182
-- yeah,
-- this is, this is like the red phone, right?

640
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:40,692
Well,

641
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:41,741
sort of, yeah,

642
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:43,102
anyways. Um

643
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,550
uh so,

644
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,130
and there were rumors for a long time that they were like back doored because I mean,

645
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,170
literally the NSA and C I A's job. Now it turns out the CIA owned the company.

646
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,969
Well, that is technically a lot easier

647
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,609
than back door in the company.

648
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:00,489
Yeah.

649
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,949
No, it was, uh it was owned by the CIA and the BND, which is the German version of the,

650
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,689
uh their Federal Intelligence service.

651
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,609
That's something

652
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,209
I guess. I mean,

653
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:14,119
honestly, this doesn't shock me in any way.

654
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,430
It is

655
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:18,319
anytime you deal with encryption,

656
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:22,390
I think it is a dicey proposition. To begin with.

657
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,209
Well, especially closed source and commercial crypto.

658
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,030
Right. Right. Exactly. Because who knows what's going on there. Like,

659
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,910
like the enigma machine in World War Two had a very subtle flaw

660
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,280
that allowed the allies to core

661
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:34,869
it

662
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,949
-- and,
-- and there's,

663
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,900
there's tons of books written on this and

664
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,270
I would highly recommend reading any of them

665
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,729
because I've read a couple and they're all fascinating and I never get sick of it.

666
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,270
-- Yeah.
-- Also they had a lot of operational security flaws

667
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,469
which didn't help.

668
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,819
Right. Right. Read the books and they'll tell

669
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,599
about things like the, the weather station in Africa they never attacked.

670
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,709
-- No,
-- it was in the, it was in the Polish, uh

671
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
Polar Circle.

672
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,680
Ok. Ok.

673
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:00,119
It was a, it was a boat.

674
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:01,520
Yeah. Right. Like

675
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,719
it reported the same thing every day. So they knew exactly what it was hilarious.

676
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:08,000
-- Well,
-- he started all his messages the same way.

677
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,680
Right. Right. Anyway, anyway,

678
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,479
so,

679
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,410
uh, I

680
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,510
guess my take on this is number one,

681
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,160
no one should be surprised.

682
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,290
And number two

683
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,369
is this is why all crypto needs to be in the open

684
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,569
and vetted by the public because as soon as you start talking about having, you know,

685
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,569
secret encryption algorithms and you have systems that were built in the dark

686
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:38,170
and you have like secret backdoors is that only one organization can access? Like

687
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,300
that's all super dicey.

688
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,489
What's fascinating to me though is these devices are electro

689
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,709
mechanical in nature.

690
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,989
So it's not like, I mean,

691
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,670
they didn't have microchips with secure enclaves that you couldn't read.

692
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:54,310
These were all physically big enough devices that you like. You and me

693
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:57,609
in our garage could take these things apart and build

694
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,890
a schematic of what it's doing and how it works.

695
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,099
-- Yeah. But good encryption. You can know the algorithm.
-- Oh, yeah.

696
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:08,619
-- But the key is what matters, right.
-- Essentially the algorithm was spiked a bit.

697
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,930
Part of the challenge too with encryption is having

698
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,810
somebody with the actual expertise to audit it properly.

699
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,849
And there aren't a lot of people who can do that

700
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,810
and a lot of them work for the NSA weirdly.

701
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,109
-- Uh Yes,
-- I, I believe they are still the world's largest employer of mathematicians.

702
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,349
I would be shocked if they're not.

703
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,709
It's, it's one of those things that like

704
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,670
I'm

705
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,829
glad they exist and I'm glad they do the work they do.

706
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,069
But I also don't think we should ever hand them the keys for free

707
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,979
and say, take it out for a spin, you know, lock up when you get home because

708
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:45,474
it is one of those situations that's very cat and mouse.

709
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,395
And this is true of any organization in any sort of

710
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:51,545
power structure is if you hand too much power to anyone,

711
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:54,515
-- they just make a mess of things. Well,
-- there's the temptation to use

712
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:54,675
it

713
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:58,405
and they do eventually they do. You see this time and time again.

714
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:01,155
And you know what I always compare this to is like, when

715
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,380
I started playing Minecraft a long time ago

716
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,859
and I thought, oh, look at all this, like, there's crafting and there's,

717
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:10,729
you can enchant things and there's all this crazy stuff.

718
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:12,170
I'm like, I'm never going to do any of that.

719
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,079
I just want to, like, build a house with my kids.

720
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,979
And then you made that automatic chicken maker thing.

721
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:16,750
Exactly.

722
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:16,780
I,

723
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,339
I created a thing that automatically cooks chickens

724
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,930
to give me food by the end because

725
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,069
it's, it's like being a drug addict where it's like just one more,

726
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,359
one more I can do this.

727
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,420
And that's totally what it's like when you give an organization power, it's like,

728
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,300
oh, just this one time, just this one time

729
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,689
and it, it's always one more time and one more time. And so

730
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:36,530
like, is it ok? They did this?

731
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:39,680
-- No. Well,
-- it normalizes the behavior. Right.

732
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:40,400
Exactly.

733
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,699
Exactly. So, I mean, it might kind of, the way I would sum it up. Is, is it ok?

734
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:44,479
They did this?

735
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,079
Not really? Were they caught? Yeah.

736
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:51,239
Sort of, is anything bad going to happen because of it? I mean, probably not,

737
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,920
but at the end of the day I think we are a better society

738
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:59,729
when we have secure encryption versus when there is a known flaw

739
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,290
that even if only one organization can use it.

740
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,930
I think it's highly dubious that only one organization has access to it.

741
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:09,010
-- That's not how flaws work.
-- Right. Exactly.

742
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,045
If, if one person finds something, it's highly likely another,

743
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:16,285
either did or just by the nature of counterintelligence

744
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,204
that the, uh,

745
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:21,564
the bad guys were basically someone in a briefcase handed it to him eventually.

746
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:21,844
Right.

747
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,645
And, I mean, at the same time, like, we won't get into it today.

748
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:27,555
But, like, this is the whole reason why, when you hear people say, oh,

749
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,760
you need to be able to break into every iphone on the planet.

750
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,390
It's like, well, no, you don't because if we give the NSA the power to do that,

751
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,550
then the UK is going to show up and the Russians are going to

752
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,890
steal whatever we gave the UK and then Australia is going to show up.

753
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,589
Well, and that's already happened with what is it Russia wants

754
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,089
or wants Apple to pre install government software on all the iphones.

755
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,000
-- Yeah. Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

756
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,030
And if Apple does anything other than give them the middle finger,

757
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,560
I will lose what little respect I have left for them.

758
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,119
So,

759
00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:01,280
and I, I, I'm confident they will. The Russian market isn't that big. But

760
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,219
anyway, anyway. All right, man, I feel like any, any last thoughts on this one.

761
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:08,119
I think it is an interesting

762
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,770
thing, but I don't think there's any kind of dramatic lessons or, or takeaways here.

763
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,920
-- Either
-- I would say basically back to, you know, good DNS security practices,

764
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,000
make sure you can actually see what's going out and log it, you know.

765
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,109
Uh, because honestly, even just malware is making random DNS calls.

766
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,619
-- It's one of the best ways to catch it. Uh, right.
-- Everything uses DNS.

767
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,119
So, having, you know, decent DNS security is

768
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,260
-- not a bad thing.
-- No, I agree. I agree completely.

769
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,250
And exactly, if you see, if you see corp.com in your DNS logs,

770
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:42,439
go fix that. I like it. All right, sweet. So, thank you, Kurt.
