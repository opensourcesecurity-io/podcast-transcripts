Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,000
Kurt Siefried and my partner in arguing Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,890
We do argue a lot. Most people don't have a view behind the curtain.

3
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,950
But Kurt and I argue about literally everything

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,819
and we really mean to each other sometimes.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,930
But in the classic sense,

6
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,610
I guess from the, we'll say the learned man sense, I'd call it where.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,090
Well, it's respectful. We do. We're friends at the end of the day.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,489
We never end our arguments with like I hate you,

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,489
which is good

10
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:33,905
even though I make fun of you sometimes for being an A I fan boy.

11
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:34,875
Yeah, I am.

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,785
But I think part of it too is even when we disagree,

13
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:41,305
I still in the back of the mind have the and it's not even that you might be right.

14
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,375
It's also that I might be wrong. And those are two

15
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:44,166
things

16
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:47,076
-- because quite often we're both wrong.
-- Oh, absolutely.

17
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,326
And I,

18
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:50,425
I'm also happy to change my mind

19
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:52,666
when you provide me with compelling evidence.

20
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,445
I am happy to change my position and I've done that

21
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,625
many times

22
00:00:56,742 --> 00:01:00,832
anyways. So what does mail channels allowing spoofing of email domains by default.

23
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,582
Uh Google marking, a web page is serving malware

24
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:04,171
and has

25
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:04,331
a

26
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,662
corps license change. All have in common. I mean,

27
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:09,561
but you said you, you wrote it down and I've already forgotten it.

28
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,402
-- Um
-- I told

29
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:11,351
-- you
-- what the answer was it,

30
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,601
is it responsibility? Was it? Yeah.

31
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:16,611
Some version of responsibility or accountability. OK.

32
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,762
I want to set some context before we keep going.

33
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:22,442
So it's Sunday at approximately 1 p.m. For me,

34
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:24,482
I woke up like two hours ago

35
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:30,220
and it was the, the Sunday after a B sides and, and black hat and Defcon.

36
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,750
I flew home on Friday night.

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,739
And so I basically had Saturday to rest,

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,919
but I'm still like insanely tired and I slept for like 12 hours last night.

39
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm totally old. I'm not even gonna pretend that's not the case,

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,339
but I do want, I do want to call out Bides because this year, all I did was B sides.

41
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,589
I didn't go to black hat. I didn't go to Defcon. I decided they're too busy

42
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,930
and it was super chill. Besides, besides Las Vegas is very chill.

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,690
I really like the hotel they do it at and I

44
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,110
stuck around on Thursday to just hang out and go,

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,440
you know, have lunch and drinks with friends and stuff and it was marvelous, but

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,569
I need to call up B sides for their

47
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,290
amazing attention to detail.

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,309
So I gave a talk this year called next generation Enterprise Security.

49
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,690
And it's where I watched All Star Trek

50
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,714
next generation and talk about their terrible security.

51
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,615
Now, I've done this before and I know we've talked about it,

52
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,054
but B sides has a box when you submit a talk that says,

53
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:17,615
please submit your most ridiculous speaker request you can think of.

54
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:22,375
And I asked for a person dressed in a Starfleet uniform in the front row to heckle me. I

55
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:24,395
think it's amazing.

56
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,904
And I walk into the talk and there's no one

57
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,014
in the front row dressed in a Starfleet uniform.

58
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,854
And I'm like, oh man, they didn't do it.

59
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,360
So I start talking

60
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,729
and like maybe three or four minutes into the talk.

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,380
A dude barges through the door with a Star fet uniform on, carrying a trombone.

62
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,320
And I was like, this is gonna be so good and it was, it's,

63
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,559
I'll put a link in the show notes.

64
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,789
It's, it's, it's on youtube, but it's like the, the guy was amazing.

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,919
-- It was so much fun.
-- Did, did

66
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,050
-- he ever
-- do the Picard Tuck while he was in there?

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,339
-- No, no,
-- they

68
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:52,729
pull

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,720
-- out the uniform because they kept writing up,
-- right? He did not do that.

70
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:58,399
I don't, he sat in a chair much of the time in the front

71
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,330
and heckled, but he was very good.

72
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,009
-- It was good. Heckling
-- is hard.

73
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,179
Like,

74
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,279
that's my favorite thing about a stand up comedian is when

75
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,800
a stand up comedian gets heckled and heckling is bad.

76
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:08,479
Like, my favorite one,

77
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,990
there was just a recent one where somebody said you're not funny.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,169
And the stand up comedians, like, oh, what now? Like, ok, let's, let's go with that.

79
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:17,009
Like, ok, you're German, you're not funny.

80
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,809
You made fun of the German person, blah, blah, blah.

81
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,050
And he's like, ok, let's try again. Like, something, tell me what's wrong.

82
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,770
And the German guy went, you're not funny. And the Canadian comedians, like,

83
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,449
like, you're not even trying. Yeah. Right.

84
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,529
So, but, but then you see good heckling and it's like,

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,320
-- that's funny. It is.
-- It is. And

86
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,059
generally speaking don't heckle comedians because they're like professional

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,179
-- things on the spot and you're not,
-- and they're sober and you're probably not

88
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,410
sober.

89
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,169
That is a good point actually. Yes, that's,

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,399
I remember I was at a comedy club once and some

91
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,690
drunk guys from Red Deer started heckling the comedian and he,

92
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:49,729
uh,

93
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:53,682
-- yeah, he was not nice.
-- They, they take, they take you down. It's amazing. I know.

94
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:56,533
-- But they were so drunk, they didn't even realize.
-- Well, that could be too.

95
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,492
And that's sad. But anyway. Ok. Ok.

96
00:03:58,652 --> 00:03:59,513
So, uh, Bide.

97
00:03:59,792 --> 00:03:59,873
So

98
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:00,973
super fun. Well done

99
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:03,792
Bides. It's, it's an amazing show. All right, back to your topic.

100
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:06,162
Sorry, I had to interrupt that way when people understand why I'm not.

101
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:07,723
-- Well, ok, so
-- basically

102
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,623
mail channels is a mail delivery provider. You

103
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,223
have a web api

104
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,675
api, you give it some data and

105
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:20,735
an email goes out, it's free. Mostly. Um there's also you can buy services.

106
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,496
And so by default,

107
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,846
most people that want to send mail just want to send

108
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,316
mail and they don't want to do so like hyper securely.

109
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:30,985
And it's funny because I actually mail channels did a thing with cloud flare

110
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,906
and where you can use them very easily from your cloud flare workers.

111
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,355
And I had a cloud flare worker for the web finger dot io thing where I should

112
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,196
send email.

113
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,679
And honestly I tried uh mail gun and Sendgrid which we

114
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,329
have accounts with and pay for

115
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,130
and like, oh man, there are web API S and stuff for a bit.

116
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:45,779
Anyway, the

117
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,670
point is it did not work well from cloud Flair's worker.

118
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,140
I tried mail channel the demo example

119
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,260
and it just worked immediately and I'm like, oh, ok.

120
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,220
And then I immediately had the thought of wait a minute.

121
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,279
There's no authentication. There's just like I'm sending email as

122
00:04:59,839 --> 00:04:59,940
clouds

123
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,140
carolines.org. Oh, I can't have them.

124
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,299
I like I can't add them to our SPF record center protective framework

125
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:10,044
because then anybody can use male channels to spoof a cloud crew line.

126
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:15,373
And then I checked, oh, they support DKIM uh domain. He's identified male. I know

127
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:15,864
it

128
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,123
-- before
-- encrypted mail

129
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,104
signed email, not encrypted mail. Sorry.

130
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:21,864
And so I'm like, ok, cool.

131
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:25,074
I look at their tutorial. It's terrible. It's disjointed. So

132
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:28,973
I set it up. I document it because I'm gonna have to rotate my de

133
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:30,743
keys or set it up again in the future.

134
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,903
And I actually emailed the mail channels people and

135
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,294
they actually replied and actually added it to their official

136
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:37,988
augmentation and put a link to ours saying thank you for this

137
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:38,708
because,

138
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:39,588
well, yeah, I mean,

139
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,627
I had it like from literally just cut and paste.

140
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:46,018
Here's the open SSL commands, here's the, this the, this the, this done

141
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:49,497
because future me is gonna have to fix this and it's gonna be tired and just

142
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:50,608
have to figure it out.

143
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:51,988
And so

144
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:53,808
now somebody figured out, wait a minute,

145
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,687
mail channels has become quite successful and

146
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:57,868
there's like 2 million domains using it,

147
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,268
then they can all be spoofed because none of them bothered setting up DC.

148
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:01,227
Yeah.

149
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:02,778
The second one is that

150
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,227
somebody complained on hack

151
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,032
news that Google marked their website as hosting

152
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,272
malware and it turns out they actually had

153
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:09,402
a

154
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:12,372
zip file on it that contained malware that

155
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,832
they were intentionally distributing for like testing or whatever

156
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,462
and like, yeah, and hacker news is kind of like, yeah.

157
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,002
So you're saying you distributed malware and Google discovered it and I mean,

158
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,092
your site is malware and now there's not a real good process to get rid of that because

159
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,492
weirdly people who actually are malicious

160
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,272
and distribute malware often claim like,

161
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:30,731
oops,

162
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:31,932
yeah. Should you please

163
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,201
unlist us? Like we're,

164
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,675
-- we're good now
-- we promise we won't do it again

165
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:36,925
-- and
-- then again,

166
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,635
so Hashy Corp just came up with a license change for, um, uh, what was it called? The

167
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:42,376
Hashy

168
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,246
Corp Business License.

169
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:47,276
And I think it's like all their stuff basically is it?

170
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,226
I haven't looked at exactly what it is,

171
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:52,115
but Vault and Terraform are the two big ones that they

172
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,355
-- have.
-- That's all their stuff. Like

173
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,835
that's fair. I know they have other things but

174
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:59,075
-- that's basically all their stuff.
-- Those two things are what matters

175
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,395
for sure. For sure.

176
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:01,156
Yeah.

177
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:02,135
And so

178
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm looking at this and it's all sort of this,

179
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,089
people seem to have this expectation of

180
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,519
responsibility or quasi

181
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,269
ethical or moral behavior, but

182
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,089
like the world has changed. So a perfect example is email, email used to like

183
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,649
you and I were running email servers before SPF even existed.

184
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,790
There was like no security on anything

185
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,019
-- you
-- would get Joe jobbed. Somebody would spoof your address in

186
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,619
-- return for spam and you'd get like hammered,
-- you could tell that

187
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,730
-- to almost any email server and just send like crap email. I am
-- Bob.

188
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:34,553
I

189
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,513
don't remember how to do it, but I, I remember doing that a lot.

190
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:41,233
It's ok. You tell it blah, blah port 25

191
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:43,053
and then you hello or you?

192
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:44,513
That's

193
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,592
-- right.
-- And then it's, it's mail from

194
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,192
and receipt two, right?

195
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:48,972
-- Receipt
-- two

196
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,122
and then,

197
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,463
and then enter your data including subject focal

198
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:53,643
and blah, blah, blah and then hit

199
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,363
twice blank line or no sorry dot Enter

200
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,013
to. Um,

201
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,983
and then, like, accept it for delivery or not, then you're done.

202
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:02,352
I mean,

203
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:02,622
the,

204
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:07,216
the reality is a company like mail channels or any mail delivery company forcing,

205
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,415
I'm doing a thing with my hands here that Josh can see

206
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:15,175
the scales forcing people to set it up securely or getting a lot of customers.

207
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:20,325
I mean, look, that is the perpetual argument in the business world.

208
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:24,955
There are times where security goes against the features

209
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,716
-- that business
-- needs ease of use and set up.

210
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:31,135
Sure. And, and security always loses because the reality is

211
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,599
if you don't have customers, you don't have a business.

212
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,659
So security is irrelevant in that context.

213
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,890
Yeah, I mean, we're at a point now where I've,

214
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,799
I've interacted with companies that don't even validate my email address

215
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,210
and I actually logged into an old Aws test account and

216
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,119
it's like you haven't validated your email and I'm like,

217
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,419
how did this account even get set up?

218
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,340
And like

219
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,059
it's been billed and like it's paid for stuff and like we used it for testing.

220
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,679
-- How did that even happen?
-- So this reminds me of a conversation I actually had

221
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,789
while in Las Vegas. I don't remember with who.

222
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,400
So I apologize if, if whoever I, I talked about this with is listening, like,

223
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,349
-- let me know and I'll give you
-- a shut up, just claim we're being GDPR compliant.

224
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,880
Right. Right. There you go. That's Right.

225
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,450
They, they made a comment like something has to change.

226
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,960
And I said, I don't know if it does because this is the security, the market demands,

227
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,390
right? If you look at the world, the world functions

228
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,119
yet we as security people are talking about how everything's on fire and terror.

229
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,679
Right? Like

230
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,179
-- is it,
-- it's coming, I mean,

231
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:34,030
-- it just, it'll probably just after the Linux desktop. Right.
-- Yes, that's fair.

232
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,630
That's fair. But it's at the same time, like society functions.

233
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,109
This is the amount of security, the market demands

234
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,150
and like,

235
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,549
I wish it was better but

236
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,020
-- it obviously isn't that bad.
-- Yeah. Like, and I think part of it is

237
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,909
there's not just sort of what is responsible

238
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,299
but what is sort of necessary and needed.

239
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:55,750
Like

240
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,859
the reality is we've had email spoofing since email began.

241
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,219
That's it. That's, that's, that's the extent of my argument.

242
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:05,780
Like I would say it was mostly harmless jokes in the past where, like,

243
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,739
you send your friends an email from God or something.

244
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,130
Well,

245
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,570
and then it's started to kind of escalate

246
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,440
because especially for spam delivery or fishing,

247
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,460
like, obviously for fishing, if I can spoof you know,

248
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:17,299
your CEO S name at your company.com,

249
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,859
that's going to look a lot more believable than like

250
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:23,719
we get stuff from like, blah, blah. Oh, what was the last one we got was um,

251
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,159
some vet clinic or something got popped and so was

252
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,719
sending out email pretending to be Zendesk or something or

253
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,830
uh

254
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,599
oh

255
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,250
Sendgrid. So we are getting,

256
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,799
somebody is going through all the DNS records on

257
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,210
the planet looking for SPF records for Sendgrid,

258
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:36,700
I think

259
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,479
and sending fake like your Sendgrid account has been suspended.

260
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:41,799
Click here, blah, blah.

261
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,679
And of course you click there and it's like some totally nasty fishing site, but

262
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,919
I only get them for sen

263
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,869
grid, not for male gun or the other ones because it's kind of weird.

264
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,169
And so I'm kind of wondering if maybe the average SD

265
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,679
user is not as savvy

266
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,559
that could be because

267
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,460
it's really easy to tell

268
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,880
who uses what email systems because YSPF records

269
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,299
like

270
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,380
otherwise your email doesn't get through or

271
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,729
in the case of Google it gets through,

272
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:09,359
but it gets that horrific nasty yellow warning banner saying this might not be blah,

273
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:09,559
blah,

274
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:09,710
blah.

275
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,539
So anyways like, yeah, I mean,

276
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,679
I wish mail channels require dkim set up for every customer.

277
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,059
Then there would be like way less spoofing, but

278
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,400
obviously

279
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,070
the people using it are not being affected enough

280
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:28,130
to go set up deacon because well, they're, they're not going and setting up Dean,

281
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,809
like, like you said, the market is spoken

282
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,609
and

283
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,840
I,

284
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,500
I wish people wouldn't smoke cigarettes. But that's the thing.

285
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,619
I mean, the market speaks on many things. That's,

286
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,059
and that's the challenge too is it becomes a boil of the ocean problem.

287
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,590
Like I pointed out like there's a guide on how to click, click, click, do this thing.

288
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,280
And you know, somebody pointed out that that's not easy

289
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,119
because it's a scale issue of like 2 million domains have to do this.

290
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,559
And that's the second part I wanted to think about here is

291
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,440
like,

292
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,419
oh perfect example.

293
00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:01,090
All everybody's losing their minds because all the A I bots are scraping the web to,

294
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,929
we scrape the web and have training data

295
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,580
and they're all like, oh, but we, you know, we support robots dot TX.

296
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,710
And if you put in like, don't crawl, blah, blah, blah, we'll respect that.

297
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,250
But it's like

298
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,570
asking everybody to opt in to secure their data.

299
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,450
They're not like half the people don't even know it exists.

300
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,890
So that's funny you say this because I got in,

301
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,890
I was in a discussion

302
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,979
at one point where there is a, a lawyer doing privacy leg

303
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,020
like legislation fundamentally and some other people and these people are talking

304
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,150
about all of the interesting technologies you can secure your data with.

305
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,400
And finally, I just said, I'm like, look, I looked at the lawyer, I said,

306
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,760
tell me if you think I'm wrong,

307
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,479
technology doesn't matter. We have to solve this through legislation.

308
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,500
And he was like, you are absolutely correct

309
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,820
because the problem is even with technology,

310
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,969
anytime there's a problem and the data leaks out

311
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,789
like the horses left the barn is over.

312
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,630
Versus if you have legislation that protects your data.

313
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,200
Cambridge

314
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:52,885
analytics,

315
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,265
people will try to do bad things with it.

316
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,184
But at least there's legal ramifications then.

317
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:01,445
Whereas today there's nothing, once your data is out, it's out and that's the end

318
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:03,875
or you get that like, $2 settlement with, uh,

319
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:05,275
or

320
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:05,914
whatever.

321
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,125
Yes.

322
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:11,679
You know what my favorite was, was there was some point,

323
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,070
like in the nineties or early two thousands where there

324
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,539
was like a settlement with one of the music companies

325
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,030
and I got like, I think a 70 cent

326
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,729
credit to buy

327
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,320
-- music.
-- That's my

328
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,299
favorite thing. It's like you get 70 cents off your next purchase. It's like

329
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,070
this is ridiculous.

330
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,030
Like why even send this to me? This was the postage was half of the cost of this.

331
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:33,520
Did. Well,

332
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,059
oh, here we go.

333
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,789
If you are a class member, the deadline to file initial claims,

334
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,510
perry claims for free or free for free credit monitoring or up to 100

335
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,840
and $25 cash payment and other cash reimbursement passed on January 22nd 2020.

336
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:46,130
So

337
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,739
Equifax data breach is long done. I

338
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:48,960
don't

339
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:49,270
sign

340
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,219
up

341
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,580
for that. I feel like I don't think I did

342
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,070
to get

343
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,520
making people sign up to get it. Like at most a few percent will, like

344
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,215
in North America, we can't even get half of people to vote in a federal election

345
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:02,414
for sure.

346
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:02,645
For

347
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,965
sure. Is the heck not going to get them to set up deacon records on their email?

348
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:06,304
Do

349
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:07,775
exactly.

350
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:08,255
And,

351
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,775
and on the flip side, somebody was pointing out that this,

352
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,094
they said emails becoming the walled garden. And

353
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:16,565
I sort of agree and disagree in that in that some of the, well,

354
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,705
Twitter only Google and Microsoft outlook are

355
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,405
Google gmail is 30% or something.

356
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:24,174
And I don't know what outlook is, but on the corporate side, it's massive.

357
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,799
And for example, if Google says, like do SPF or we don't,

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,210
we don't accept your email, then

359
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,869
people would deploy SPF D

360
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,020
D.

361
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,849
But there's an incentive at that point,

362
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:37,200
it's like when they switched over to the HTTP S or else

363
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,500
for web searches, it,

364
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,179
it

365
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:43,369
improves your search engine rankings and everybody's like I would like to.

366
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,650
-- But
-- again, that's, that's a market incentive that's effective versus art today,

367
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,289
-- we have no market incentives.
-- Well, but what's interesting though,

368
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:52,030
we go from a boiling the ocean and trying to

369
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,950
get 2 million people to agree to one company being

370
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,989
potentially able to make a decision. But

371
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,409
I mean,

372
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,130
it incentivizes those 2 million people sufficiently to actually go do something.

373
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,599
-- Now,
-- at the same time,

374
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,289
I think you could create an antitrust argument about the power.

375
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:09,210
This company has to do such things because I mean,

376
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,679
Google could also say if you don't put a uh

377
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,070
like a dancing bear at the top of your website,

378
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,169
we won't index it.

379
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,510
Everyone would have a, I think they're at the top of their website and

380
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,349
that's kind of scary, you know.

381
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,469
Well, I mean, like,

382
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,530
people forget this is kind of how barcodes happened

383
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,700
is Walmart and the Department of Defense said like,

384
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,940
no barcode, no buy.

385
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:28,250
And everybody's like, ok, barcodes are awesome.

386
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,250
And so I like,

387
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,450
I guess what I'm saying is,

388
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,950
I don't think the answer to this sort of market

389
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,090
speaks thing is to have a company like Google,

390
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:40,130
hopefully do the right thing and ask for more security.

391
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,690
I think

392
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,169
as much as I

393
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,650
am nervous by

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
specific technical legislation,

395
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,729
I think that

396
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,450
maybe is the better way to go,

397
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:50,080
but

398
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,450
-- it's so far behind that. Does it even matter?
-- Well, and that's one of the questions.

399
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,979
I mean

400
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,210
that this, but this,

401
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,469
I don't want to get into that today. I want you to tell me how has

402
00:15:59,609 --> 00:15:59,619
a

403
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:03,260
Corp fits into this still which we haven't gotten to yet has

404
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:03,710
Corp is

405
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,825
just the latest example. But a lot of other companies have done this where

406
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,534
well, like Facebook with their Lama open source license, that

407
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:11,474
is open source

408
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,614
unless you have more than 700 million users,

409
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,655
which would be a problem I would like to have.

410
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:21,515
But so is there these companies want to make money because

411
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,354
that's kind of the whole point of companies in general

412
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,335
and

413
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,179
they have a thing. That was true. I let's go with true O SI,

414
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,619
what was the phrase O SI approved open

415
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,419
source? That's right.

416
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,929
An O SI approved license is what we currently think

417
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,450
-- of as open source
-- and they go to something that is

418
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:39,609
not just

419
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,469
like a minor tweak or change, but is it goes against the spirit,

420
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:48,679
many would say of what open source is meant to be on the flip side though, like

421
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:49,270
Hashi

422
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,299
Corp is getting essentially

423
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,280
clear cut by people using their stuff and not contributing back even a bug report.

424
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,780
Right? And we've seen this happen with a lot of products like

425
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,179
-- Nessus, you know, like, I
-- mean, that's open source. That's how it works.

426
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,079
So I can't help but wonder is like,

427
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,180
should there be an expectation if you're a company doing open

428
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,618
source that somebody can come in and eat your lunch and?

429
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,949
-- Well, there's no recourse.
-- Yes, that, that's absolutely an expectation.

430
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:18,579
And what I was going to say, argument wise is whether or not you like it,

431
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,858
that's the reality.

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,219
It's like, should I look both ways when I cross the street?

433
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,739
Well, I have the right of way as a pedestrian in a marked crosswalk,

434
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,339
but I'm still going to look both ways

435
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:29,800
-- because the world we live in, I might get run over.
-- Right. Right. Ok.

436
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,119
I want,

437
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,459
I want to start at the beginning and this is related to that

438
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,910
email we got that I said I didn't read but I did skim

439
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,739
and I, and I like an episode or two ago,

440
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,839
I made a comment like if it's not on the O SI S list.

441
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:43,209
It's not open source and it turns out it's technically

442
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,800
open source approved is what the O SI calls it.

443
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:49,000
-- It's, it's kind of complicated.
-- They, there's trademarks and stuff going on.

444
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,560
They

445
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,189
fundamentally the definition of open source is squishy.

446
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:57,199
But so far the O SI has managed to, I think, hold the line

447
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,439
on we own like we control this term. Go away.

448
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:02,464
-- Everyone else I would
-- say more convincingly.

449
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,285
their list is in the spirit of open source

450
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:05,214
and that they accept.

451
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:07,925
So here's the thing

452
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,665
I would start with Red Hat

453
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,064
like Red hat,

454
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,665
Red hat Enterprise Linux

455
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:14,165
is technically

456
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,015
covered by open source licenses,

457
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,104
but it is definitely not within the spirit of open

458
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,464
source because if you distribute the source RP MS,

459
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:20,854
they,

460
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:25,415
they remove your license to access Red hit Enterprise Linux.

461
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,750
So you could definitely say like that is open source but not in the spirit.

462
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,050
And then you look at things like Mango or elastic or Hashy Corp or whatever

463
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,579
where they basically

464
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:40,770
-- they like to claim open source. But it is not technically in the open
-- source

465
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,260
or the open core. This part's open

466
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,609
source,

467
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,829
-- but like,
-- well, open core is different.

468
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,349
Open core is open source because you have actual open source components,

469
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,310
-- but
-- it's useless with all, all the other stuff.

470
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,739
-- Uh
-- Some of it is and that's a different problem. Yes.

471
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,079
But then what I think these like Hashy

472
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,189
Corp is doing uh I best heard it described as business source

473
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,619
where it's basically, if you're a person, you can use this.

474
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,530
But if you're a company and you're creating a competing product,

475
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,079
-- you can't. Well, that's
-- the llama thing. 700 million.

476
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,979
I'm assuming that's the number for like 10 cent Baidu, Google

477
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,060
-- Microsoft,
-- probably. Right.

478
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:17,900
And that's almost certainly their target for that particular,

479
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:21,719
the number of companies with more than 700 million users is I'm hoping last thing

480
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,099
I want to

481
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,010
pick this up where you made a comment about, you know, companies make money.

482
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,849
And is it ok if someone takes their open

483
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,219
source and like eats their lunch with it basically.

484
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,380
And

485
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,739
I think the danger we see happening here is the,

486
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,579
if you look at almost every start up on the planet today,

487
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,339
they brag about having open source because open source is a good marketing tool.

488
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,540
Like I'll give you an example

489
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,359
if I work for Anor

490
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,859
Anchor has two tools called sift and gripe that get used a lot.

491
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:53,280
We don't have AC L A contributor license agreement.

492
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,489
I'll explain what that means in a little bit.

493
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,479
I would not have gone to Anchor if they did because

494
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,800
I just come off the heels of elastic pulling the shenanigans.

495
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,439
But anyway,

496
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,579
they had right, they had one too.

497
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:02,459
But anyway,

498
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,500
so like

499
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,560
we have these tools that are open source and they're open projects,

500
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,339
we accept lots of patches from people.

501
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,030
And if now, if I go to a conference and I say I wanna talk about Anchor Enterprise,

502
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,260
the product my company creates, that's close source.

503
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:16,839
Like

504
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,369
no,

505
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,540
that's not getting in under any circuit. We don't do vendor pitches. Yeah, exactly.

506
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:23,270
But I can show up and say, oh, hey,

507
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,189
I'm gonna talk about gripe this open source tool that does vulnerability scans

508
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,810
and that gets accepted a lot, right? Because it's an open source tool and it's cool.

509
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,349
And so most start ups treat open source

510
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,010
as their marketing department because you can say

511
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:40,076
I have this thing that's open source. Let me come talk about

512
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:45,796
-- it at whatever venue you have
-- even more simply, it allows me to get a taste test and go,

513
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,875
oh, this actually does kind of do what I want

514
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:48,956
and to a degree

515
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:53,946
and more importantly, 99 times out of 100 as a company or a corporation or a,

516
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:57,666
if I'm using this for work stuff, my response is, oh, and you'll like,

517
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:01,566
sell it to me with all this other stuff that makes it really easy to use.

518
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,286
And I

519
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:02,761
like,

520
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:06,312
like I have a vendor right now where I'm paying 99 we upgraded from

521
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:09,832
$49 a month to $99 a month for something I could totally build.

522
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,161
But it would take me like 100 hours to build and run

523
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:14,641
-- and then
-- you have to run it and running things is expensive

524
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,411
and, and or we can pay 12 hun

525
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,021
like 1200 bucks a year.

526
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:19,031
It's no

527
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:19,781
brainer.

528
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,482
But now here's what happens, right?

529
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:22,241
So like

530
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,391
in the context of

531
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:28,121
Acor, we have sift and Gripe and they are like the foundation of our enterprise tool.

532
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:28,602
OK.

533
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,157
So anyone could take sift and gripe and build a tool on top.

534
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:35,078
In fact, there are many companies have, we know of many comp competitors to

535
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:37,417
Acor that have literally taken sift and gripe

536
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:39,218
and built competing products on top of it.

537
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:42,708
And that's how open source works like those are, that's the deal.

538
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,708
That's it. We deal with it too bad.

539
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,578
Like we hope what they contribute back,

540
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,267
-- but they don't have to. Well, and
-- I think the big thing is though,

541
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:52,677
ideas are easy, execution is hard

542
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:55,634
and sustained execution of like an open source

543
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:56,504
project.

544
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,894
-- It's tough for sure.
-- Absolutely.

545
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,073
-- That's super
-- hard

546
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,234
for sure, for sure.

547
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:03,494
And if a company can do that and actually keep

548
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:05,953
that piece of open source alive and going well.

549
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:09,754
Yeah, then like, I'll look at the vendors and a lot or the,

550
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,183
the sort of the secondary market,

551
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:12,884
let's call it where they kind of take the open

552
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:15,494
source from the original company and repackage or rebrand it.

553
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:18,713
-- And in my experience, most of them don't do a great job.
-- No, of course.

554
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:21,963
And that, that's my excuse. Always, as I tell people, look, if, if a competitive,

555
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,979
taking one of our things and they're doing a better job than us. We suck. Like that's,

556
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,280
that's how, that's like my other argument is sometimes people would be like, oh,

557
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,229
but if this feature goes into open source

558
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,949
and then people won't pay us for enterprise,

559
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,359
I'm like, look, if, if an open

560
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,280
source project can damage your enterprise product, like you suck.

561
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:38,579
That's the lesson here

562
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:41,260
keeps moving forward.

563
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:45,780
Exactly. Well, they all do anyway. Ok. Ok. So here's the important part of this.

564
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,229
I think

565
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,790
so. Hashy

566
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:48,270
Corp,

567
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:52,770
they had this open source and I think we can easily agree. This is true of Mango DB.

568
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,040
This is true of elastic search

569
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,280
without an open source product.

570
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:00,479
These things would not have gained the popularity. They had,

571
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,180
-- they would have never launched for sure. They'd have like six users.
-- Absolutely.

572
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,560
So the open source was very much

573
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,130
a, an important component of their success.

574
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,640
And now what they had is they had something called a contributor license agreement.

575
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,319
What happens when you have AC L A

576
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,849
is you are signing over your copyright rights

577
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,150
to the company or organization because like

578
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,109
the free software foundation has clas also.

579
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,060
But their, their purpose isn't to relic

580
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,119
it as a business someday. Well, yet.

581
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:29,930
But they could though,

582
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,380
that's the

583
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,079
thing we never know.

584
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:34,589
This is what I love is, people are like, oh, but they would never do that.

585
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm like, cool, put that in writing in the contract and they're like, oh, but,

586
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,589
-- yeah.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

587
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,069
And and they claim it so they can switch to other licenses and whatever,

588
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,849
like a proprietary business

589
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:45,935
just saying.

590
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:47,364
-- Right.
-- Well, and so that's the thing.

591
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,964
See, that's what gets me is, for example, do they ever say,

592
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:51,194
do they ever put in that thing?

593
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,834
I guess you could put this in ac a, uh, contributor license agreement where

594
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:56,625
we will only go for example,

595
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:01,594
-- to O SI approved licenses and then you'd also have to subvert the O SI
-- I believe the um

596
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,050
I, I think Liber Office has such a clause,

597
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,410
I think don't quote me on that, but II,

598
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,300
I know they exist and I think Liber Office has one.

599
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,979
But anyway,

600
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:12,380
so you got the CL A right?

601
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,099
If you want to contribute source code to a project like

602
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:18,569
Hashy Corp in the past or Elastic Search or Mango DB,

603
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,660
you had to sign a contributor license agreement

604
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,939
that said I'm giving you all my rights

605
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,209
and a lot of people did it.

606
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,449
And most of these companies said, oh,

607
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:29,689
we will never change our license under any circumstances, you know,

608
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,810
super double cross pinky swear. And then eventually

609
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:34,650
they did.

610
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:37,030
And because of that cl a,

611
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,969
there's nothing anyone could do about it

612
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,550
because what happens if well, they can fork it,

613
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,630
well, you can fork it and that will happen.

614
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,290
And that happened with elastic search because like uh open search was forked off.

615
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,150
Elastic search.

616
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,859
Nessus was forked. I'm, I'm, I know hashy corp will be forked.

617
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,010
I don't know if the fork will live.

618
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,890
Well, of course, well, anyone can fork it, but I don't,

619
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,270
is it going to survive as a question?

620
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,790
Like, talk to me in a year?

621
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,349
Yeah.

622
00:24:59,449 --> 00:24:59,790
Yeah.

623
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:00,680
More than

624
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,469
commits.

625
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,229
Right. Exactly. And that's, that's always the thing.

626
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,819
People are always like, oh, we'll just fork it.

627
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,589
It's like forking things is really hard.

628
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:07,949
Yeah.

629
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,420
Like when that whole rel thing came out and people were like, oh, we'll just like,

630
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,310
do it ourselves.

631
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,140
And it's like, oh

632
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,390
right.

633
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,829
That's like saying, oh, just walk the Cascadia trail with a 400 pound backpack.

634
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,630
It's fine. It's very easy. Everyone.

635
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,209
Yeah, I know. I know.

636
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,560
So anyway, now here's where, here's where not having AC L A is important, right?

637
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,430
So today there is a, a blog post by uh Pamela Chaste

638
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,199
I will try to find and

639
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,040
it basically talks about how we don't actually know

640
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,329
who owns open source license code if there's multiple contributors

641
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,420
because the way traditional copyright law works, like, for example,

642
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,959
let's say you draw a picture of a cat

643
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,260
and then you give me the picture of the cat and say, Josh,

644
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,160
you have my permission to change my picture of a cat

645
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,810
and then I draw a tree in the background

646
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,650
who owns the copyright to that picture.

647
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,170
Uh If memory serves, if you do enough transformative work to the thing,

648
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,319
then you own that copy.

649
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:00,369
It doesn't even have to be transformative if you give me permission and I do it.

650
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,030
Yeah, I forgot the permission thing.

651
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,150
Well, yeah, obviously I can license you the copyright. Yeah.

652
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,709
-- And then you have, yeah,
-- the last person to touch it has copyright over that work then

653
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,680
and open source is different though because you have multiple contributors.

654
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,859
So if I contribute a one line patch,

655
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,439
do I now does the last person have the copyright over the code?

656
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,390
And no one's ever answered this legally?

657
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:24,540
So, but the intention is with, if you don't have a contributor license agreement,

658
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,420
everyone involved in the project would have to agree to change their license.

659
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,069
And obviously, if you're trying to go from Apache two to business source,

660
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,229
that is not going to happen, right?

661
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:38,020
-- 100%.
-- I mean, in theory, you

662
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:38,625
could,

663
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:42,165
but you'd have to also probably gut a whole bunch of code for people that don't.

664
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,074
But even that's not obvious, like

665
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,094
because

666
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:48,104
we don't know the copyright ownership is just,

667
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:50,324
is going back in time and removing some code.

668
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:54,064
But, but what, well, I should say is removing code in the current iteration

669
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:57,885
that was added in the past. Does that count as removing their contribution?

670
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,344
Like it doesn't, this is not obvious at all. This is very murky

671
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,530
and traditionally in the open source world, we've ignored it because we could

672
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,920
because no one's ever said like, oh, hey,

673
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,300
I'm the last contributor to this project and I own it now.

674
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:14,660
And if someone did it would be a heck of a court case to say the least.

675
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,719
Well, it sort of has happened but it's never been.

676
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:19,930
Most of these people don't have the money to properly fund

677
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,989
a court fight for it or it just doesn't really matter.

678
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,040
Like somebody claims ownership of something. It's kind of like, ok,

679
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,479
cool. Who cares? Like life goes on

680
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,469
because,

681
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:31,189
and this is something that's been coming up a lot

682
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,050
because obviously I'm doing a lot of stuff with a IA

683
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,599
I generated content cannot hold a copyright unless the

684
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:38,189
human does a whole bunch of transformation to it.

685
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:42,040
We have no idea what level that is. 1% 10% 99%. Who knows? Right.

686
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:44,589
But one thing I've been coming across is

687
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,760
why do I care about copyright?

688
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,660
And the best answer I have is I care about

689
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,599
copyright because traditionally we use copyright to control the thing,

690
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,979
especially if somebody

691
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,380
abuses the thing.

692
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,859
Like if they post it to their website,

693
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:01,219
I can use copyright to issue ad MC a takedown notice for example.

694
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:02,430
But,

695
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:03,969
but, but

696
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,959
there are cases where I don't care that much like

697
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,790
well to put it simply the the Cloud Security Alliance,

698
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,739
we we want you to read our papers.

699
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,619
So like if you want to take our papers and distribute them,

700
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,079
we're not super happy about that.

701
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,339
But at the same time, like we're kind of giving them away for free to begin with.

702
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,229
So it's not that big a deal like we're not charging, you know, 50 bucks.

703
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:25,609
It's not like an iso standard where they watermark each one with

704
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,420
your email address because they cost some godly amount of money,

705
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,300
you know,

706
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,349
uh we're, you know, we're just handing these things out.

707
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:34,729
And so I was thinking about this and I was kind

708
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:36,839
of asking people this kind of awkward question of like,

709
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,199
well, why do we care about copyright?

710
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:43,280
Assuming it's not like a music CD where we're trying to sell the darn thing, you know,

711
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,280
and prevent piracy.

712
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,500
I mean, fundamentally, if you don't care about piracy, why would you really,

713
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,420
that's the open source way, right?

714
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,650
Is generally speaking as long, like,

715
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,520
so GP L is a little different because GP L you have to,

716
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,319
you have to release the source code, but with like Apache two,

717
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:02,540
-- no one really cares what happens.
-- And, and so that's the flip side of it is

718
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,119
again, they're sort of using copyright to enforce something they want.

719
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,000
And in this case, it's sort of the,

720
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,329
I don't want to say it's the opposite of control because it is still controlled,

721
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,800
but it's controlled to contribute

722
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,040
and gain access to those contributions

723
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,719
as opposed to locking it up.

724
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:18,119
But again,

725
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:20,454
well, for example, all the service companies just

726
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:23,925
ingest open source and like, maybe never give anything back

727
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:27,574
to the point where companies change their licenses. So that they can't do that,

728
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:28,074
right.

729
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,675
But fundamentally, I've been thinking about this, like,

730
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,944
do I really care all that much about copyright?

731
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:33,505
Like if we have an A I uh

732
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:34,785
support bot

733
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:38,204
generate a answer to how do I reset my password ticket?

734
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:40,935
-- Yeah, we don't care about the copyright on that answer.
-- Ok.

735
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:43,525
Look, there's two sides to this argument. OK.

736
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:45,925
There's the data going in

737
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,989
and today there are multiple court cases where you have creators

738
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:55,260
who are upset that their content was used without permission in an A I system.

739
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,670
And I totally relate to this.

740
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:57,550
I don't,

741
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,040
I go back and forth whether it should or shouldn't be legal, but it's not up to me.

742
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,819
-- So it doesn't matter.
-- It's also kind of, it's a done deal.

743
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,079
-- No,
-- it's, it's not, it's not at all. Don't talk like that.

744
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:12,060
The reality is until this goes through the courts. It's not a done deal.

745
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:15,880
Court and law is the functioning foundation of society.

746
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:19,583
You can't say it's a done deal. It's a, it looks like it's a done deal.

747
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:21,473
But if the courts tell an A I company,

748
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:25,703
you have to remove all of the art from this particular artist from your model,

749
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,303
they're completely screwed

750
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,784
and that's, they know it.

751
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,394
-- We
-- thought GDPR might make a difference,

752
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,553
but a lot of these tech companies engineered around it.

753
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:35,764
-- GDPR
-- has made a difference. Kurt GDPR has made a huge difference.

754
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,323
I'm pretty sure Facebook still has all our data and is selling it.

755
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,854
-- Facebook has
-- our data but there's definitely more

756
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:44,413
power you can exert over not Facebook.

757
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:48,998
We'll say Facebook is special because they're extra sleazy and extra huge.

758
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:52,387
But the challenges some of these large A I companies are

759
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:56,017
-- well like Google saying basically extra
-- sleazy and extra huge.

760
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:58,307
Google is like, you know, if it's on the public web,

761
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,017
-- we're feeding it into an A I
-- because today they can,

762
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,137
but if copyright says you can't do that,

763
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,078
they will change because they have to because

764
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,078
they're going to get sued by literally everyone.

765
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:08,907
It's not a done deal, but now

766
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:12,277
-- they're going to fight it to the death because they have to, I get
-- that

767
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,608
and they, and the thing to remember too is they don't have to win,

768
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:15,307
they just have to stop

769
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,411
and they will, they'll try.

770
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:22,141
But now on the other side as well, you have the issue of copyright on the output

771
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:23,852
of this stuff.

772
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:27,791
You and I don't care a lot about copyright because it doesn't pay our bills.

773
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,052
But if I was an author

774
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:35,761
and I was creating copyrighted works that I was then selling as my job.

775
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,112
You know how I was living,

776
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:38,712
I would care a lot.

777
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:41,891
The online romance book novel industry has already

778
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,052
been just stomped by A I generated stuff.

779
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:45,725
I

780
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:48,005
am not surprised at all.

781
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:48,885
I mean, I

782
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:49,176
-- think
-- that's

783
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:53,706
-- already formulaic,
-- right? I've heard a lot of the children's books are coming

784
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,186
under the same sort of attack with a lot of low quality,

785
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,395
like generating a board book with like

786
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:03,475
50 or 60 lines of text in total. And some images is

787
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,806
that's a really easy thing to set up and,

788
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:06,576
well, no,

789
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:07,796
no, no,

790
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,135
I, I think it's easy to turn out.

791
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:13,166
But I think making a good story because, like, when I was,

792
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:14,725
when I had young Children

793
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,900
there were a handful of books that were

794
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,180
clearly just heads and tails above the others.

795
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,750
Yeah. And those stories do very well.

796
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,839
The others my guess is they probably don't make any

797
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:26,260
money because you look at them and you're like,

798
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,030
this is obviously crap and maybe someone will buy it and give it to your kid

799
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,270
in a

800
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:34,660
-- present and then you throw it out.
-- Fun fact there was, um was it

801
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,349
who's the guy, uh is it Neil Gaiman? Who's the guy that wrote The Fool?

802
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,099
Uh Not The Fool series, the one

803
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,239
they're based in San Francisco kind of magical

804
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,650
devils and stuff. Anyways,

805
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:49,030
somebody set their name as the author's name

806
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,469
and released a new book with a similar title

807
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,739
by similar title.

808
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,270
I mean, I think it was the same title of an upcoming book of the author and I

809
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,560
was like, oh, it released finally. Hallelujah. And I bought it and this

810
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,339
thing comes to me in the mail that was like an on demand print.

811
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,349
And I'm like, no, and I did a return and filled out the form and

812
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,359
Amazon, you know, like, whatever, they don't care as long as you do, like,

813
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,420
less than 1% returns that are just like we don't care.

814
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,489
But it was pretty clearly this person had set up

815
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,449
a, they were trying to,

816
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,180
yeah,

817
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,250
that's horrible.

818
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,430
Yeah.

819
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,569
And I mean, we're going to see more of that because

820
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,199
yes,

821
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,650
it's easy. Ok.

822
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,410
But

823
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,530
I think

824
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,239
how does this tie into responsibility and hashy Corp,

825
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,780
I'm still not putting all these pieces in.

826
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,829
So, for example,

827
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:30,920
like

828
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:35,390
in the past companies behaved in ways that were

829
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,579
usually reasonably ok when it came to making money.

830
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,109
And what's interesting is they would sometimes do things that

831
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,400
we said that is not an acceptable way to,

832
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,150
to make money or to defend your moat,

833
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,520
you know, like suddenly

834
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,390
like suing competitors to drive them out of business, you know, like you,

835
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,339
and what's interesting now is it's becoming kind

836
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:57,790
of a trope where these companies become successful.

837
00:33:58,229 --> 00:33:58,810
And

838
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,699
in my experience it seems to be driven a lot by

839
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:04,489
service companies using their open source and offering a service now

840
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,850
and, and this is driving them to modify their open source licenses to this, you know,

841
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,389
hashy court business license or like the totally free but business friendly,

842
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,020
open source license or whatever.

843
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,409
Ok.

844
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,168
-- Well, is this good or bad? Is it
-- ok. It's bad.

845
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm gonna, I'm gonna unwind everything you just said. Ok, I wanna unwind all this.

846
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,879
So if you can't say companies like, somehow had this

847
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:31,668
moment of, of like Zen and realism where they were good and decent and they,

848
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:33,009
what happened was,

849
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:33,378
that was

850
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:33,638
-- not my
-- in.

851
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:35,589
-- Ok.
-- That's kind of what it sounded like.

852
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:35,958
Ok.

853
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:39,239
Well, no, I meant more that they didn't do reprehensible things

854
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:39,748
yet.

855
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:43,329
-- They, they wanted to but they couldn't or they didn't
-- feel it was necessary.

856
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,768
But no, no, they did. So this is where, ok.

857
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,279
So you did kind of say what I thought you said,

858
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,989
this is where if you look at

859
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,938
the way companies acted and they'll say in the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds,

860
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,360
like they were literally throwing human beings

861
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,379
into machines because it was cheaper than,

862
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,020
than building a railing.

863
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,840
And like you had these huge companies that were just

864
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,780
awful and they literally killed people and no one cared.

865
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,189
And then the government, it got,

866
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:10,149
well, I'm talking more

867
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,590
-- the last 2030 years of tech companies. I mean, and
-- that's just it, right?

868
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,260
So it got so bad. Governments had to step in and be like, hold on.

869
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,419
We have to fix some of this.

870
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,080
And now we're back there again where these companies,

871
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,699
like if a company could like remove all their hand rails at their, at their plant,

872
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:25,810
they would, right?

873
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,429
They would love to if it saved them five dollars,

874
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,370
there was that meatpacking thing where a 17 year

875
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,889
old lost his hand and the company was fined,

876
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:37,129
-- it was just over 1000 bucks,
-- which they don't care, they're going to keep doing it.

877
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:37,540
You know.

878
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,209
And that's why we had these, like,

879
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,679
we had labor unions and we had government regulation that was

880
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:45,439
basically telling the companies you can't throw people into machines.

881
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:46,770
It's not, it's not ok.

882
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,810
And we're back because a lot of these protections are gone and

883
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,479
in many ways the world has changed and it took it away.

884
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,860
Now on the topic of like,

885
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,620
like saying hashy Corp is,

886
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:58,540
is getting their lunch eaten by another company or whatever.

887
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,439
I think this is your classic commodity

888
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,360
problem where if I create a product and I can,

889
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,760
let's say patented and I get my 20 years of patent

890
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,919
and at the end, if I haven't done anything to really innovate,

891
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,949
people are gonna copy what I do

892
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,889
and they're gonna steal my stuff. And you could argue, well, that's not fair.

893
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:18,379
Hashi Corp did all this work and they built this thing and like you're not wrong,

894
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,379
they did a lot of work, they did a lot of good work.

895
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,840
But at the same time, I think you could argue that

896
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,550
the fundamental functionality of terraform and vault,

897
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,219
it's not going to change drastically because

898
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,840
it's basically a commodity function now like

899
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,290
it's expected and we need that functionality and it's not novel anymore.

900
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:37,770
So, and this, for example,

901
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,300
is a perfect example of where worldly mapping gets it right where

902
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,570
it talks about things go from Genesis to custom to products,

903
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,629
to utility

904
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:45,409
and

905
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,969
to put it bluntly

906
00:36:47,149 --> 00:36:50,580
-- in most of the utility space, your margins are 1 to 3%. Right.
-- Exactly.

907
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,689
And that's what's happening.

908
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,360
-- Like
-- grocery stores 3% margins to,

909
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,949
if you're lucky, it is horrifying to find out. You know, I

910
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,919
don't, when you like, I remember a chef at large did an episode with Earl's.

911
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,540
It's a chain of restaurants, Canada where they went over like,

912
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,770
here's this dish of food for like 28 bucks and like, ok, like,

913
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:09,100
you know, like, uh, about a third in food costs.

914
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,840
Here's the labor cost, here's the like,

915
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,639
cutlery or plates getting broken is like 10 cents and

916
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,169
like this and that and that and then it's like,

917
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,729
literally you're left with this handful.

918
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,459
This is like, this is so old. We still had pennies

919
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:20,149
and like,

920
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,080
it's literally a handful of like a couple of nickels and a couple of pennies.

921
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,750
And that's

922
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,350
amazing. It's absolutely amazing.

923
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,149
So anyway, I think that's the difference when we have this discussion.

924
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,379
It's easy to say, oh, big be Amazon.

925
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:34,969
Big mean Google are stealing from poor little hashy

926
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,310
carp

927
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,129
and it was the same with elastic where big mean Amazon was stealing from elastic.

928
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,199
But I think what you end up with is like, your product has become a commodity.

929
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,959
It's time to do something else.

930
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,899
-- This is not going to make a difference
-- and

931
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:50,159
the smart companies keep moving up the food chain.

932
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,510
So like Microsoft and Red Hat went from like we have an operating system

933
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:55,419
to

934
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,199
that. We have everything

935
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,300
had 100 and 20 products.

936
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:01,860
Like,

937
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:05,760
and, and I mean, so here's what's funny is so like elastic, did that change?

938
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:09,610
Elastic doesn't sell elastic search anymore.

939
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,100
They're selling solutions built on top of elastic search. So

940
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,100
elastic search

941
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,199
fundamentally,

942
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,260
fundamentally, I don't think they had to change their license.

943
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,709
I think they were just really mad at Amazon or something. But

944
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:20,169
like,

945
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:20,500
I

946
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:22,000
sometimes

947
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,510
wonder if it's one of those interim steps that a lot of these companies have to take

948
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,510
because to put it bluntly, if they could make the leap from software to services

949
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,340
they would have.

950
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,419
And maybe, and that's true, maybe, maybe that's what they needed to,

951
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:35,030
to change their internal mindset.

952
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,219
-- I don't know,
-- we talk about culture and that company's culture is software.

953
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:40,850
Like a great example of this is Microsoft's company culture

954
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,780
is not software, it's business solutions,

955
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:45,810
right? Everything they ship

956
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:47,340
is a business solution.

957
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,040
So like Windows 11 still has PR N and calm one and com

958
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,280
two as reserve device names because people are still using them for that.

959
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:55,620
Like

960
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,679
somebody discovered you can't make a Microsoft team's

961
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,429
name of like LPT or PR N because

962
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:06,215
that like then we have to make a directory call that and you can't do that on Windows.

963
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,784
So those are magic forbidden words.

964
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:11,135
And I was toying with the idea of like making

965
00:39:11,145 --> 00:39:13,455
a major open source project called LPT One or something.

966
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:14,504
That would be really funny,

967
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:16,294
-- you know,
-- walk out all the windows people.

968
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:17,334
But

969
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:18,324
like

970
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,800
talking about this corporate DNA, like,

971
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,780
that's the thing is if your culture and DNA is making software,

972
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,139
which a lot of these start ups,

973
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,260
they are technically

974
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,860
minded, founded entities.

975
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:34,300
And so they have that, like, we make software, not, we make a solution or we make,

976
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,449
you know, they don't have to step up until

977
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,850
they maybe let business people come in and redefine the company, which

978
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:42,560
that's, that's rare for it to work.

979
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,310
One of the few examples I can think of for success for that is Apple.

980
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,929
They were from a technical company to a lifestyle company

981
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,889
and that's what people don't get.

982
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:52,159
It drives me nuts when they're like, oh my God, that Mac is so overpriced.

983
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:53,260
I'm like, yeah, none of us care.

984
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:53,649
I,

985
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,020
I do, I hate my Mac. But anyway.

986
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,750
Right. But like, fundamentally my math watch with all my other stuff

987
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:00,570
don't care.

988
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:05,169
They fuel my lifestyle of hatred, Kurt, they fuel my lifestyle of hatred.

989
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,090
And I, I think that's the thing is what is this,

990
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,110
I guess

991
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,409
what is the new behaviors and the new things?

992
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,040
But we want from companies, but also

993
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,459
what is sustainable and what will actually work because

994
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,250
we can want company like greenwashing, right?

995
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,330
All these companies are like, oh, we're going to be socially environmentally,

996
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,080
blah, blah.

997
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:25,560
You know,

998
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,239
and then every time one of these companies is

999
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,090
investigated for what they're actually doing with the environment.

1000
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:30,750
It's like,

1001
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,479
oh, yeah, we took all the plastic and burned it.

1002
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:34,399
Right. Like

1003
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:35,580
we dump

1004
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:35,870
it in the

1005
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,030
o,

1006
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,699
-- we
-- planted
-- a pine tree. It's ok.

1007
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:38,780
Right.

1008
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,919
Look, I, I think here's how I'm gonna end this one.

1009
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,419
I don't think open source is gonna stop being a

1010
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:48,209
feature used by small companies to get attention because it works

1011
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,820
right until it stops.

1012
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,899
I think what we're going to see

1013
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,070
is

1014
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:56,389
the community is becoming wise to what's going on.

1015
00:40:56,399 --> 00:41:02,110
And like, for example, if I saw AC L A on a project, there's absolutely no way

1016
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,399
I'm going to participate in that community because I know how that story ends.

1017
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,909
And so I, I'm hopeful that the,

1018
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:12,360
the what's going to come of this is start ups will keep using open source,

1019
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,389
but they're gonna have to stop using CLAS.

1020
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,250
That's my hope because I think no cl A

1021
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,939
I won't say it solves the problem, but I think it makes it better.

1022
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,189
That's a thought for like maybe for the um what is it? The open

1023
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,050
OS sf what does that mean? Again? Open source, open

1024
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:27,620
-- source
-- security foundation.

1025
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,889
Yeah, like maybe

1026
00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:30,780
do they have a badge around cl A

1027
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,120
not having AC L A?

1028
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,939
I don't know if their members would be appreciative of that

1029
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,590
and then we're back to incentives and doing things that the people

1030
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,760
don't like.

1031
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,199
This is why we don't have sponsors.

1032
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,709
All right, I'm going to call this one. Thank you, Kurt.
