Hello and welcome to episode 109 of the Open source Security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,640
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:12,409
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,800
What's new man?

4
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,100
-- Not
-- a whole lot?

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:18,229
There really isn't. I mean, I mean, there isn't at all.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,379
I, I'm quite pleased by the relative lack of horrible

7
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:22,959
news,

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:23,600
which is

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,950
at least insecurity

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,709
maybe because everything else is on fire.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,629
But in, in, in fact, now I will say

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,790
one of the disadvantages to a slow news week is when you have a podcast.

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,709
It's like, what do we talk about now?

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,349
And luckily for us, we will never run out of topics.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,900
And, and so anyway,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,529
so for, for you listener,

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,939
Kurt and I were going to discuss. So we still will. But I, uh I recently spoke at

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,680
OCON the open o'reilly, Open Source Security or Open source convention.

19
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:55,099
I put security in all the time to everything.

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,389
Anyway, it's a nonsecurity convention and it was really cool to go and speak

21
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,349
as a security person because I generally only go to security events.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,550
But, but anyway, anyway,

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,870
so I was walking my dog this morning thinking

24
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,830
about what kind of things we should talk about

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,699
and something occurred to me while I was also kind of thinking

26
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,269
about and also listening to some security podcast before I walk the dog

27
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:20,760
about fishing.

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,620
And the reason fishing is in the last episode,

29
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:27,069
we talk about Google claims none of their employees have been fished for a year

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,389
and we kind of talk about that. But then something occurred to me

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,279
with, with what Google got to say, Google said none of their employees got fished.

32
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,389
Now,

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,980
we love talking about things like, oh,

34
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,510
let's do fishing training and we'll reduce the number

35
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,669
of fishes that are successful from 30% to 20%.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,120
And here's the thing that I kept thinking about is if 20% of your users can be fished,

37
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,959
that's still 100% success rate.

38
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,120
That's, that's terrible. Right? A success rate of 100% is unacceptable.

39
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:56,069
Well, what I love about all this, what,

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,680
what people seem to always forget about all these online attacks is

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,559
I can execute like 10 million online attacks and nothing bad happens to me.

42
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,540
Whereas for example, if I,

43
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,038
if I walk around the city trying every single doorknob to see if it's locked or not,

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,050
eventually, hopefully somebody will call the cops and be like,

45
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,500
this guy is like walking down the street, trying every single doorknob

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,630
and the cops will at least like come up to me and ask me, what the heck are you doing?

47
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,669
You know, can you please knock that off otherwise we're going to arrest you for,

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,309
uh, whatever attempt to break and enter or something.

49
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:23,889
But,

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,929
I don't know,

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,350
well, attempt to break and enter. Right. Like,

52
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,570
um, or, you know, they just talk to the person,

53
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,630
put the scare in them or get them to move on or whatever,

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,320
but fundamentally right. There's no consequence.

55
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,139
See, that's the thing, there's no

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,570
downside for a failed attack

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,869
in most cases.

58
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,419
Right.

59
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,199
And I don't mean even that, that like, there's a chance to go to jail, I mean,

60
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,979
like the attacks are so cheap to execute.

61
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,529
It's like

62
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,539
how much does it cost to send out

63
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,059
one email to every single person of the company?

64
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,639
Like a dollar

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,380
mostly in your time in writing the template?

66
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,850
Right? Like that's, you know what I mean?

67
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:01,860
And if you're doing this at scale, like the incremental cost is basically zero.

68
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:02,839
And so, yeah, I mean,

69
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,279
if there's no real cost to attacking a whole pile of people and there's almost,

70
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,649
if any downside to doing it

71
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,020
go nuts and keep trying, you know?

72
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,059
Right. Right.

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,119
-- No, I agree completely. And so are they
-- gonna block every email domain? No.

74
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,369
Right. Exactly. Exactly. And so I guess

75
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:28,619
this is where, what Google is doing is so powerful is it, it's not about

76
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,990
fishing training and reducing your net,

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,039
-- like 0% is the goal
-- we can't get people

78
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,660
to parallel park properly or stop at stop signs,

79
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:38,199
I can't

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,220
parallel. Right. So

81
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,940
I look at like driver training and we talk about, like, people talk about drivers and

82
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,380
it's weird to me that

83
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,449
we have this like

84
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,970
several 1000 people a year or thousands actually,

85
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,949
of people a year dying in car accidents

86
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:54,110
and you never hear people going. Oh, well, we just need better driver training.

87
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,520
No.

88
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,179
Like we need people to actually stop and stop

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,250
signs and if driver training hasn't accomplished that today,

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,580
-- it, it never will.
-- You have to pass the driving test to get your license.

91
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:08,529
Imagine the train wreck, the roads would be if you didn't need that.

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,770
Yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,369
So, no, I, I, you know, yeah, these systems where it's just like, ok, look,

94
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,059
humans suck at this. We can sort of train them to be a little bit less sucky.

95
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,459
Ok. That's one way to do it.

96
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,540
Or you can, like,

97
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,519
fix the problem some other way technologically or just

98
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,559
take the problem away even in some cases.

99
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,769
-- Right.
-- I, exactly. And I think

100
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,619
it's kind of like, let's say we start training people to stop at stop signs

101
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,570
and let's say 10% of people still don't.

102
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,179
That's still a huge number.

103
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,260
Well, we have red light cameras in the city that send out a lot of tickets.

104
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,500
Those things are money trees.

105
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,679
Yeah. And they should be like you, it's real simple.

106
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,459
If you don't want a red light ticket, don't run a red light.

107
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,769
Oh, man. So I, I have an awesome related story to that is

108
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,190
so where I live

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,109
you're supposed to yield to pedestrians crossing the street in a crosswalk.

110
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,510
-- That's pretty much all of the western world.
-- Ok.

111
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,380
Nobody does

112
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,950
wait on a, on a

113
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,989
crosswalk.

114
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,589
-- Mark crosswalk. No light. Then
-- they have the right of way. End of story.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,079
-- That's how traffic rules work.
-- Well, that, right.

116
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,579
Anyway, but you've clearly never crossed the street in America.

117
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,809
Pedestrians always have the right of way, especially in a crosswalk.

118
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,570
Oh, no, no, no, you'll get run over here too.

119
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:22,829
Right? Ok.

120
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,579
Ok. Good. I'm glad we're on the same page.

121
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,200
Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:26,339
No,

123
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,260
the drivers here don't know what to do with pedestrians other

124
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,750
than to try and run them over and see if they're

125
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:34,940
-- right.
-- Right. Um, anyway, so the police are doing this test where they have a guy

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,660
in a bright green vest,

127
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,179
right, just crossing the street and as people don't stop,

128
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,369
there's a police officer pulling him over and they were

129
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,410
basically pulling over people as fast as they could.

130
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
And I'm, I'm sitting there watching this and laughing hysterically

131
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,450
because I'm, that's one thing I do.

132
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,630
I try really hard to always stop because I walk a lot. So it's a big deal to me.

133
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,720
But anyway, anyway,

134
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:55,899
and, and

135
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,720
I just kept thinking

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,829
nobody is going to change their behavior because of this.

137
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,799
I wish I could say this is going to fix the problem.

138
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:06,279
But all it really does is probably makes a crap load of money for the city.

139
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,320
-- I mean,
-- really?

140
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,410
Well, so there was an even better one,

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,790
in L A where they had the cop dressed up as an orange traffic cone.

142
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,489
Right. And I, I've put a link in the show notes,

143
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,980
but straight up, they had this guy wearing an orange traffic cone costume,

144
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,000
like bright orange.

145
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,679
So this guy's about 6 ft tall. So we're talking like a 4 ft traffic cone walking across

146
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,399
and like drivers are literally like, I do not see the because what happens,

147
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,529
right is that these cops pull these people around, like, did you see the p

148
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,649
they're like, oh no, I never know this pedestrian. They're like, well, too bad.

149
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,309
-- Here's your ticket,
-- right?

150
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,559
-- And then
-- they

151
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:35,730
go to

152
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,579
-- you and
-- says that it's like, do you know how fast you were going?

153
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,179
Well, here it's like

154
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,000
you didn't see the pedestrian. No, he look over there.

155
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,100
He's in this bright orange traffic cone costume and they're like, oh, yeah.

156
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,579
No, I didn't see him and it's like, well,

157
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,630
you should have,

158
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,160
-- I was checking my text messages.
-- Yeah.

159
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah, exactly.

160
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:57,720
I fe I, yeah, so no, they've done all sorts of things like this and yeah, um

161
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,279
I was on uh we have a street car locally that goes from White Avenue just

162
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,769
south of the river across the river on the old high uh high level bridge.

163
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,160
It's a former rail bridge.

164
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,410
It goes a little bit downtown. A few blocks, stops, turns around, comes back, right.

165
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:14,739
And it has to cross a pretty busy street at 1.100 and ninth street.

166
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,429
And it's not

167
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:17,869
because the street car only runs like,

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,309
once every 40 minutes for like a few months of summer.

169
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,459
They don't have like crossing barriers and lights and stuff.

170
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,980
They just have like a sign saying, you know, railroad crossing

171
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,950
and you're expected as a car to, like,

172
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,350
when you're driving towards the thing to look for,

173
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,980
you know, the 3040 ton street car and if it's there maybe stop,

174
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,059
right? Because it's, if you hit the street car, you're gonna smash

175
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:39,269
your car up and the street car will get a little bit damaged, but not much

176
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,489
because it's like a train car. Yeah. You know, and it's anyways

177
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,109
and, you know, so we're sitting at the front, me and my kids and like,

178
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,619
we're coming up on the thing and the guy slows way down

179
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,339
and like, yeah, these cars just keep coming through

180
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,579
and we're like, you know, 10 ft away from the road

181
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:57,359
and then finally somebody stops and somebody else stops and it's, I'm like,

182
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,029
I'm like, wow, they, because he's also dinging, like,

183
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,390
they have this really loud bell and horn on the thing, right?

184
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,980
And he's making noise and

185
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,790
I'm like, wow, they really don't see you do. They, and he's like, nope.

186
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,850
And it's even worse with ambulances and cops.

187
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,950
Right. Because they get that tunnel vision when they're, you know,

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,279
because it's just such an oddity. Right. Having an uncontrolled inter

189
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,690
rail crossing in the city.

190
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:21,440
Right. That's rarely used. So people just don't know how to react to it. Right.

191
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,540
But,

192
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,399
yeah, it was just, it was wild to see, like,

193
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,540
because II I suspected one or two people wouldn't see it.

194
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,459
No. Like

195
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,390
finally somebody kind of noticed this like large green street

196
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,070
car making noise trying to cross the road and stopped.

197
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,099
That's crazy man.

198
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,380
You got to just pull like a Boston move and slowly inch your way out until you,

199
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,979
you're blocking all the traffic.

200
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,049
-- It was
-- basically

201
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,179
what he did. That's what he did, right?

202
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,099
And being a train, they can get away with that,

203
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,059
right?

204
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,929
Oh my goodness. It's

205
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,619
again, again,

206
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,679
we think we can train people

207
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,510
even better. We'll train developers to secure code,

208
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:03,059
you can train a few developers to secure code

209
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,489
and hopefully they write the framework everybody else uses.

210
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,450
That's the solution you

211
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:10,580
-- can,
-- I'm gonna say you can't and I'm, I'm I do this in. Every talk

212
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:15,789
on this topic is I'm going to point at the open SSH developers. They are literally

213
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,599
the brightest security developers on the planet and they still make mistakes,

214
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,760
-- end of story,
-- but

215
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,200
-- they make fewer mistakes than the average.
-- And that's true. I will agree with that.

216
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,869
Like the Linux kernel is a great example of, you know, where Linus Torvalds is like,

217
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,460
yeah, don't break Userland because if you break user land,

218
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:32,770
you break everything on the planet.

219
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,789
And yeah, I can kind of get behind that,

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,500
you know,

221
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,619
and he's also like, we can't like break systems, we can't do stuff that like,

222
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,950
you know, even if only 1/100 of 1/100 of a percent of people

223
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:46,724
install this reboot and it doesn't work. That's thousands. You know what I mean?

224
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,325
That's a lot of people inconvenience.

225
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:49,375
It's huge, man.

226
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,025
That's why I'm thinking with the IOT, right?

227
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:52,765
Even if your failure rate is one in a million.

228
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:56,255
Well, like when you're talking about light bulbs, that's a lot of people in the dark

229
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:00,325
and that's why just doing nothing is cheaper than doing anything else.

230
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,034
Yeah.

231
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,284
And safer.

232
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:04,164
Seriously, man.

233
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,159
And safer. I like it.

234
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,590
I like it.

235
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,510
-- Yeah,
-- whatever.

236
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:11,659
So what happened at Os

237
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,179
Con?

238
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,469
It was a fun show.

239
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:14,570
I,

240
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,270
I must say there's a certain amusement

241
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,070
I get from hanging out with nonsecurity people

242
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,570
because first of all, they expect me to be terrible to them,

243
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,090
which I'm, I'm not.

244
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,580
So,

245
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:32,049
I mean, I, I know I, I address this in my, in my talk and I,

246
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,969
I started out with, uh my name is Josh,

247
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,239
I'm a recovering security person and it's been

248
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,330
two years since I yelled at a developer

249
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,849
and I don't, I don't think it's really been two years, probably less. But it's funny.

250
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:44,859
So, a

251
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,960
couple of hours.

252
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:52,869
But anyway, anyway, no, it's, it's good and the craziest thing.

253
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,599
So, for anyone who doesn't know, because I know

254
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,960
Ocon is,

255
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,729
if you're not in the open source world, you might not know about it.

256
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,320
So o'reilly are the book people that make the books

257
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,109
with like the weird kind of pencil drawing of animals,

258
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,109
wood block cuttings,

259
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,900
OK. Wood block cuttings, whatever those things.

260
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,330
And, and obviously, they're probably most famous for,

261
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,070
like back in the day they wrote the pearl book which had the camel on it, which is,

262
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,429
you know,

263
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,580
and which one's the bad book

264
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:21,280
mail?

265
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,489
It was the 850 page one that you could

266
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:23,760
someone

267
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:24,270
to

268
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,849
kill someone with that book. I remember that book. I remember using that.

269
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,809
I spent over $5000 on o'reilly books.

270
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:33,169
I used to.

271
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,450
Yeah, that's how I learned all my stuff.

272
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,770
I had, I had 1.5 bankers boxes full of these o'reilly books.

273
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,489
I read cover to cover and made notes in.

274
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
They were great books.

275
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,690
They,

276
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,640
they still publish good books.

277
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,090
It's just, I think

278
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,450
when I learn something new, I don't turn to a book like

279
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,335
a to, I just find that, you know, online tutorials. But, but anyway, so o'reilly,

280
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:56,864
they, they do something called

281
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,604
Ocon, which is an open source convention essentially.

282
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:03,044
And obviously it's the usual convention. You've got the Expo Hall.

283
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,784
You've got speakers, you've got, you know,

284
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:08,354
whatever the parties and the dinners and, and all that kind of stuff.

285
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:09,505
And

286
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:13,604
I've, I've been to a couple of these, my last one was actually five years ago

287
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,809
and

288
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,450
it,

289
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,409
it was remarkable how different it's become in the

290
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,690
last five years because last time I was there

291
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,929
it was, I don't remember, I gave a talk on some open source security thing.

292
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,799
I don't even remember what, but I remember going into the hall,

293
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,890
it was primarily

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,409
like, like your Red Hats and Debian and, you know, just open source kind of users

295
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:41,309
that were either kind of selling something or maybe just showing off.

296
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,419
And there were a handful of companies hiring, like an example is

297
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,599
I still have a Spotify t-shirt. I got from them and Spotify was trying to hire people.

298
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,979
I was like, well, I don't really want to work for you, but can I have a shirt

299
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,900
and they gave me

300
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,989
and I still wear it? It's still in really good shape. Actually,

301
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,809
this annoys me because my partner, she really gets annoyed and she's like,

302
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,320
do you only have computer shirts?

303
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm like, yes,

304
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,640
they're free. Where else do you like?

305
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,159
What, how do you, how do you get T shirts?

306
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,559
Not only that, I worked for Red Hat for 12 years

307
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,799
and I have

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,270
probably 100 Red hat t-shirts

309
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:14,960
I actually bought.

310
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:15,289
It's

311
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:15,969
great

312
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,309
because they were three bucks each in the fruit of the loom. They are

313
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:18,969
yous.

314
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,739
Yeah. From the cool stuff store.

315
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,440
Because I wanted, I wanted 20 identical shirts for going to the gym and stuff.

316
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,890
So that, and it's funny because I think all the people at the gym thought I was, like,

317
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,590
borderline homeless because I wore the same t-shirt every day for, like,

318
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,219
a year until I explained that I had 20 of these.

319
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,400
Yeah, that's great.

320
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,640
Now I'll give elastic a lot of credit here.

321
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,219
They're really good about giving me shirts and II I have more

322
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,179
elastic shirts than I can wear between laundry at this point.

323
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,630
So

324
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,580
it's quite nice.

325
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,640
Uh Anyway, anyway,

326
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,479
so,

327
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:49,489
and, and Oscar,

328
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,469
now you go in there

329
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,429
and

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,710
it was Red Hat was there, of course, as you can imagine.

331
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,559
And like Google was there, there was,

332
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,969
uh paypal was there talking about their framework.

333
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:04,460
The Home Depot was there, obviously talking about the open source. They do.

334
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,020
There was

335
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:09,159
uh someone from the NSA was there. I got a bunch of stickers from them.

336
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,130
That was really cool.

337
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:10,929
There was like,

338
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,080
Huawei was there showing off their hardware and open source project.

339
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,880
It was just like,

340
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,869
it's so different now because

341
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,809
everybody is using open source. Right.

342
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,309
-- It's, it's nothing like it used to be back in the day.
-- Well, you, you can't not

343
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,469
use it.

344
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,070
-- Right. Right.
-- Because

345
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,380
like,

346
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:33,340
I mean, literally the only way you could avoid open source is by being, well,

347
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,619
100% Microsoft, they're really the only

348
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,619
-- Microsoft is there.
-- Exactly.

349
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,830
Well, and I was gonna say, like, in theory you could be 100% close source by, like,

350
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,400
just sticking 100% of Microsoft.

351
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,450
But even Microsoft

352
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,229
is, yeah, I mean,

353
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,840
even they have fully embraced open

354
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,679
source, like,

355
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:53,539
hard.

356
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:56,690
Yeah. And they were not just that and, and

357
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:59,989
Ocon Microsoft is giving away arduinos.

358
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,650
I mean,

359
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,890
what, what has happened to the world? Like this is not the world I grew up in.

360
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,609
Well, Microsoft has their own Linux.

361
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:08,809
Do they

362
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,109
for IOT?

363
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:10,929
Oh,

364
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:11,969
well, that's cool.

365
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,349
Yeah, and it talks to the manager and it,

366
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,820
yeah, they have a, they have their, sorry when I say their own custom links.

367
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,030
I don't mean like some lame like, oh we built the distro on top of something.

368
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,150
No, no, no. They have their own custom Linux kernel

369
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,940
for their Linux IOT stuff. So it's like part of their SDP. It's like

370
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,219
here basically is a pile of software and documents and like

371
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:35,369
you want to build like an IOT device that does XY and Z cool.

372
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,580
Like you do a little bit of data processing locally

373
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,210
if you want and then you ship it off to Azure

374
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:44,090
and you get a nice web portal for the users and you know, back like basically it's,

375
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:44,440
it's

376
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:48,890
everything from A to Z just plug and play. Boom off. You go

377
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:49,599
oh

378
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,289
And it's an arm. Linux not like some easy Intel.

379
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,890
Linux, like it's, it's proper iot Linux on an arm.

380
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,299
So, no, like, yeah, Linux

381
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,820
or Microsoft has their own.

382
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:00,530
Linux

383
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,799
like kernels. Userland everything.

384
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,780
Yeah, it was uh what? Yeah, in April or earlier of this year.

385
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,260
Right. So, it's been around for only a few months but still. Yeah.

386
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,809
No, clearly Microsoft does open source,

387
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:14,669
open

388
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:17,789
source one. Right. I, I keep saying that but

389
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,570
I don't know, it amuses

390
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,039
me.

391
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:23,770
I think a lot of people don't think that yet because open source one everywhere,

392
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,000
but a lot of it is still like way on the back end or like deeply embedded or,

393
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,570
you know what I mean?

394
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,479
Like you don't see

395
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:32,200
like a great example is

396
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,450
uh, yeah, last night we went to the Italian Center.

397
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,969
It's an Italian store that sells Italian stuff, food.

398
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,919
Um,

399
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:42,729
and they have this like really good selection of cheese and meat, like,

400
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,309
like over like, I think it's about 100 kinds of cheese.

401
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,770
Like, it's pretty fantastic.

402
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,770
And so they have these giant display boards

403
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,250
showing all the cheeses the cost per kilogram

404
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,530
and like sort of, you know, if it's available or not. Right.

405
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,710
And um,

406
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,619
there was like an error on one of the boards. I took a picture of it

407
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,859
and I looked a little closer and I'm like, OK, this isn't a windows air,

408
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:03,919
this isn't a Mac Os.

409
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,540
It's, oh, it's Ubuntu Linux. OK.

410
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,500
So they have like an Ubuntu Linux machine.

411
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,858
Running these like six or seven giant, you know, TV,

412
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,660
s displaying their cheese prices.

413
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:13,660
Nice.

414
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:14,499
Right?

415
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:17,739
It's, and so yeah, I mean, because if you went to the store and asked like, hey,

416
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:18,769
are you guys Linux users?

417
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,138
They'd be like, what, what's Linux?

418
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:23,058
Right? Can you just buy your cheese and leave?

419
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,078
You know, you're making us nervous

420
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,298
and, and part of me was like, can you guys please just hit the ok on that air?

421
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,058
Like, because it wants to install some updates and just,

422
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:30,869
it's really annoying because

423
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,458
was covering a cheese I wanted to buy and I wanted to see how much it was.

424
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,060
But yeah, I mean, it's just funny.

425
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,060
Right, because it's like they're Linux users, like

426
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:38,930
-- they wouldn't
-- know that

427
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,219
and they don't even know it, it's, it's hilarious.

428
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,819
I,

429
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:43,229
yeah,

430
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,329
-- that's awesome, man.
-- That's how technology should be. It should just work.

431
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,800
-- No,
-- I agree completely.

432
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,569
And, and so anyway, it was, it was amusing to me seeing all this.

433
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,239
It was, you know what the craziest part was.

434
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,160
And this is something I didn't really, it didn't sink in

435
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,290
until my plane ride home is.

436
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,910
I, I go to a lot of security events

437
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,910
and I'm obviously representative

438
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,000
of elastic

439
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:08,780
and I get asked questions about logging in Sims constantly because basically in

440
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:09,060
the

441
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:09,589
security,

442
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,020
like, si em, security incident

443
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,989
and logs as well, which are related

444
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,750
and a lot of people use a lot

445
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,599
for this.

446
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,589
Right. Exactly.

447
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,390
Nobody asked me any of those questions at

448
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,400
Ocon. And it was, it was, it was so weird to me because that's all I usually talk about.

449
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,780
And this time I got to actually talk about other cool stuff and people would ask like,

450
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,520
programming questions and,

451
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,839
and we could talk about using Python and how

452
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,780
that works to solve your problems and stuff.

453
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,339
And it was,

454
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,160
it was very pleasant. I really did enjoy it. It was, it was good. And then

455
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:47,420
uh I gave a talk about what did I call it? Security as an MVP is the name of my talk.

456
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,750
It will eventually be published. I'll tweet it out when it is.

457
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:54,540
And I will say the thing that I found the most amazing

458
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,060
was I brought my chromebook I presented off of my chromebook

459
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:04,229
and when I showed up, they had one USB C cable on the table. I plugged it in

460
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,109
and everything just magically worked.

461
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,849
And I was, I was, I didn't even know

462
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:07,969
you

463
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,260
-- mean for the
-- display like the

464
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:09,520
USB,

465
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,069
the display, it was one USB C cable. I plugged it in

466
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:17,800
my chromebook appeared on the display and I presented it was crazy.

467
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:19,839
Yeah, seriously, man, I,

468
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:20,400
I

469
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:20,890
still,

470
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:21,790
we are in the future.

471
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,650
So you're saying just because I'm having a hard time

472
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,189
processing this and I just want to be clear,

473
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:31,510
you had effectively a laptop and you plugged one cable into it and it's worked

474
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,790
without like

475
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:38,199
working with display settings or changing the inputs or the aspect ratio,

476
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,469
it didn't catch fire,

477
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,369
it

478
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,609
just

479
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:40,969
worked

480
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,339
it in. I've literally never had that happen to me.

481
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,410
I know seriously, even with, with Windows or Mac or Linux, especially Linux

482
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,719
something

483
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,569
right.

484
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,150
In this one, I plugged it into the chromebook. It extended the screen.

485
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,540
I dragged my window over to the big screen.

486
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,959
I clicked the present button

487
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:57,640
and

488
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,719
that was all

489
00:19:59,089 --> 00:19:59,709
it was Mandi

490
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,170
man.

491
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,479
I'm not

492
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,319
sure I would know what to do in that situation.

493
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,680
I, I showed up like 10 minutes early.

494
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,699
-- Yeah, I know.
-- Right. I stood there staring at the poor A V guy.

495
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,199
-- I
-- travel with four display adapters.

496
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:16,319
-- I, I travel with four display adapters for my laptop.
-- Seriously, man.

497
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:17,640
Like it was, it was amazing.

498
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,780
It was so crazy and, and then of course, you know,

499
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,800
III I did the talk and make fun of security people a lot because it is easy to do

500
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,040
and,

501
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,430
and then there were a bunch of questions at the

502
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,489
end and it was really interesting actually listening to people because

503
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,089
the one thing that really came across and this is in

504
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,150
the Q and A as well as just people talking afterwards is

505
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:41,089
people just want, they want me to tell them what to do, right.

506
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,540
Someone will say like, tell me which password manager I should use.

507
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,130
And of course, I can't answer that because it's like, well,

508
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,280
they do all different things and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

509
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,229
I'm getting over that

510
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,400
where I'm just making a declarative because honestly,

511
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,910
even if you give them not a great answer,

512
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,810
an 80% answer is better than them being stuck in indecision

513
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,689
maybe.

514
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,780
And so the way I addressed that was I basically

515
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,229
said I use last pass for example and then I

516
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:05,439
explained why I use it because I have some very

517
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:08,150
specific reasons around the family plan and things like that.

518
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,489
And I don't know, I mean, I guess this is,

519
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,670
I need to think about this because you might

520
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,030
be right that just telling people what to do

521
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,030
and, and if it's 80% good enough that

522
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,630
I generally won't tell them what to do.

523
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,060
But like you,

524
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:23,469
I will coach it in terms of here's what I do or here's

525
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,609
what I would do or you know what I would recommend or,

526
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,469
you know, at least

527
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,430
because for example, I mean, part of the problem now is, is like

528
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,474
there are so many potential solutions, right? Which cloud providers

529
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:34,114
are?

530
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:34,954
I'll be blunt,

531
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,015
it's going to be Google Amazon or Microsoft unless

532
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,484
you have some really ridiculous crazy corner case need

533
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:42,954
for some local player or a vertical player

534
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:46,344
that does whatever it is you need to do. But fundamentally, you,

535
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,915
you pick one of those three players because

536
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:52,255
you know what, like life's too short to, you know,

537
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,655
I was talking with somebody and like, well, you know, didn't,

538
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,875
didn't you do all this research?

539
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,324
And I'm like, no, no, I absolutely didn't.

540
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:59,055
I picked Amazon because they were the biggest one.

541
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,199
They still are.

542
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:03,670
I'm pretty much locked into them at this point, but they keep lowering my bill.

543
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,410
So, like, I'm locked into a provider that keeps

544
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,660
me more services and a lower bill every month. So, like, yeah, cool. Whatever.

545
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,430
I don't care.

546
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,339
The cable company should take note of that.

547
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,380
No, I hear you, man.

548
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,489
I totally understand where you're coming from and, and so all right.

549
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,640
So let me ask you this then is one of the questions somebody asked me was

550
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,619
which like like software security scanner

551
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:29,579
would I recommend for, you know, doing like standard code analysis?

552
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,579
And my answer was there.

553
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:30,910
It

554
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,170
-- doesn't matter.
-- I would say

555
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:37,390
Coity because that seems to be the most popular one and more to the point they'll

556
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,810
-- be able to find people who know how to use it and what the results
-- mean.

557
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,089
That that might be fair. I don't, I don't know, does Coity

558
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,969
still back when I used it last? I think it only did C and C++.

559
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,630
I don't know if it does anything else. Oh,

560
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,410
it does a whole bunch of stuff now. But

561
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:50,339
more to the point.

562
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,250
Well, yeah, without even knowing what language they're using and stuff,

563
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,010
I'm just guessing.

564
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,770
But I would say Colver

565
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,930
because it's got a big company backing it

566
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,890
and

567
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:00,579
CAV

568
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,069
BC I think, and then C A but,

569
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,119
-- but yeah, so I think C
-- A owns them

570
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,829
part of it honestly, for most businesses is like,

571
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,810
businesses have a problem and you know what,

572
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:14,540
there is probably like a really good optimal solution that's only going to cost $7

573
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,089
or they can just, like,

574
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,239
pay this consultant to come in and fix it for 10 grand

575
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,010
and be done with it and not have to think about it.

576
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,790
Right. I, I agree with that.

577
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,270
Yeah.

578
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,270
You know, I, I had a small drip in my basement.

579
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:26,589
Yeah.

580
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,819
Paid the epoxy concrete guy, like 450 bucks problem solved because, like,

581
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,380
what do I know about fishing concrete?

582
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,829
And as it turns out there was a crack in there, right?

583
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,180
So he did the epoxy the injection and then he's like, oh, yeah,

584
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,569
I can see the stuff is coming out here.

585
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,020
That means you have a crack, I'm gonna have to charge you like a little bit more.

586
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,589
It's like 50 bucks more. And I'm like, yeah, I'm ok with that,

587
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,660
you know, and he's like, ok, we, you know, I'm pretty sure it's fixed.

588
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,459
Can you run the hose outside for, you know, like half an hour to soak it like, yeah,

589
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:52,369
no water came in. Ok, thank you.

590
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,020
Sweet. You know, he emailed me an invoice. I emailed him his money.

591
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:56,780
Thank you.

592
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,060
Right. I mean, and that's,

593
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,380
and, but see, here's the thing,

594
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,199
that's what normal people want with their security problem.

595
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,119
I called the guy. He came, he poked it, he fixed it,

596
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:09,839
he emailed me a bill

597
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:12,000
and like, it was done in two days.

598
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,579
It, it only took two days because he had to do, like, the epoxy,

599
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,030
let it dry overnight and then do the injection stuff.

600
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,839
Otherwise it would have been done in like, three hours.

601
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:22,064
-- This
-- is, this is an interesting analogy.

602
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,714
-- Right. That's what people want.
-- You. You're absolutely right.

603
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:27,415
It's what they want and it's exactly what we can't give them.

604
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,685
It's like changing my oil.

605
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:30,185
I could change my oil.

606
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:34,665
I could go buy all the stuff I need to change my oil or I can go literally two blocks away

607
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:38,185
and some guys will do it for 70 bucks and I get to sit in my car and not get dirty

608
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,425
and it takes like, 15 minutes

609
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,584
and, and it costs the same price.

610
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:43,165
You just

611
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:43,675
buy it

612
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:44,305
yourself.

613
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:44,635
Yeah.

614
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:45,255
Yeah,

615
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,300
I know.

616
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,780
I occasionally change my own oil in my,

617
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,260
my truck because I like to show the kids how to do it.

618
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:53,630
And, yeah,

619
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,310
I think it's actually more expensive for me to change that oil than it is for me

620
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:57,849
to bring it.

621
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,959
So, you know, that's what people want from a security point of view. Right.

622
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:01,660
Like, my mom

623
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,530
wanted a new lock for her, like,

624
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,630
a gym locker because we were at the store actually buying a little safer.

625
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:08,900
She's like, oh, I should also get a new lock, you know which one's secure.

626
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,569
And I'm like, I started laughing. Right.

627
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:13,270
-- And she's like,
-- there is an answer to this.

628
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,469
Well,

629
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,949
-- tell me what you told her and then I'll tell you the
-- right.

630
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,719
I started laughing and I basically said none of them are secure.

631
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,719
The only way to get a secure lock to spend at least

632
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,109
is to spend at least a couple 100 bucks and even those get picked easily.

633
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,979
And I showed her the lock

634
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,150
lawyer where he does

635
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,609
where the lockpicking lawyer did.

636
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,229
Uh, what was it, like, 15 master locks in two minutes or something?

637
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,619
And so I'm like, whatever, just pick this one. It's fine.

638
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,939
-- It's like six bucks and it'll keep normal people out of your locker
-- and,

639
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:41,910
and there's that, but did you, have you ever seen the, the master lock makes them,

640
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,339
they have like an up down left, right kind of thing on their face?

641
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,709
Yes, I've seen those

642
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:49,410
so of, of all the locks

643
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,699
that I've ever picked and done research on

644
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,709
that is the one that we still have not found a way.

645
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:58,420
Well, as of, as of this recording and the research I've done.

646
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,530
I, I will say that because I, I imagine

647
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm going to learn if that's not true,

648
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,699
but

649
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:06,170
that is the one lock you can't break into or

650
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,589
pick without drilling a hole in it to look inside.

651
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,209
Uh, there's a speed dial option.

652
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,569
-- What's a speed
-- dial option

653
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,089
where you can, like, try, well,

654
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,410
what you basically try all the combinations quickly

655
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:17,300
but it,

656
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,569
it holds like an insane number of combinations.

657
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:25,250
It's, I'm, I'm, I don't know, it is conceivable,

658
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,930
but this is all, this also comes back to your point.

659
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,050
-- It's like, that's just a brute force attack though. That's not picking it.
-- Right.

660
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,560
That's,

661
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,270
you know, and you can always brute force attack a combination

662
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,079
given enough time

663
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:37,589
and somebody who doesn't like

664
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,359
and, and my combination on my up, down left, right.

665
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,739
Deo is like,

666
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,689
it's fairly long anyone who is trying to pick it, it would take

667
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:47,859
the

668
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:48,930
code.

669
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,030
That would be glorious.

670
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,109
I didn't even think of that, but that would have been awesome.

671
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,640
All

672
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,069
-- that was like the 1234 that jumped into my mind for that.
-- I bet it is.

673
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,910
I bet that's the, I bet if you go to a gym with those, you could try the

674
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,849
Kami code and half of them are going to be the

675
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,189
Kami code.

676
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,719
You just need to glue a BN A button on the side and

677
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,239
good

678
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:10,380
to

679
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:10,569
go

680
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,310
anyway. Anyway.

681
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,099
All right. So we were talking about Os

682
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,670
Con

683
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:18,660
and,

684
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:22,920
and I mean, we're, we're kind of, we're running ourselves out of time here.

685
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:27,900
But I guess this is the thing I will say is I feel like people

686
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,569
normal developers

687
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,829
understand the importance of security

688
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,300
and I think they want to do the right thing and I think we're not telling them what it is

689
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,540
and that's basically what it comes down to.

690
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,760
-- No,
-- it's worse that we don't tell them, we tell them things.

691
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,160
Like, well, you should develop securely and not make bugs.

692
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,520
Oh. Right.

693
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:45,219
That's

694
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:50,050
exactly. Exactly. Well, it works. It's telling them something of

695
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,510
no value because it's so open ended. The only way

696
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,280
is failure. Right. Like,

697
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,520
you know, we're saying, like, so many security people, mostly in my experience,

698
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,709
I don't not,

699
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:03,619
oh, here's the, here's what you should be doing,

700
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,209
right?

701
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,140
Like uh the CS A developers came to me and they're like, we should be,

702
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,790
we want to start tracking CV numbers for all the

703
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,130
Ruby Gems and stuff we use and I'm like,

704
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,579
ok,

705
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,900
no, you really don't. And they're like, what?

706
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,439
Yeah, we, we, we, we care about security and I'm like, oh, yeah.

707
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:17,540
No, I know you care about security but I'm like, I'm like,

708
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,280
how often are you guys doing new builds

709
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,810
of the software and deploying it to production?

710
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:23,359
He's like, well, you know, like at least once a week, sometimes more.

711
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,270
If there's a really bad CV,

712
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,560
we'll hear about it in the news and you guys will push an update, right?

713
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,660
And he's like, well, yeah, obviously and I'm like, ok, cool, thanks. Right.

714
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,739
Everything else, I assume they just pick up

715
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,930
-- every time they do a build, right?
-- Yeah.

716
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:37,099
Yeah, they always just run whatever is the latest.

717
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:37,670
So I mean,

718
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,900
there is in theory the possibility of like a flaw being introduced in a newer jam

719
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,339
that is not fixed.

720
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,819
And so like if you know about it, you could roll back to an older version of the gem.

721
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,189
But the more common corner case is like, oh,

722
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,890
I found this flaw in the gem and we fixed it in the latest version.

723
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,449
That's like 99% of security flaws in my experience,

724
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:57,010
right? Somebody finds a flaw.

725
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,719
It was,

726
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,250
it was introduced at some point either at the very beginning or between now and then,

727
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,040
you know, when a new feature was introduced or

728
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,739
like the Linux kernel is great for this, right?

729
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,050
It's like, oh, we added this like uh SCTP protocol and

730
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,380
well, you know, there's a bunch of flaws in it.

731
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,760
And so as people extended the protocol and added more and more support for it,

732
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,430
you know, there's

733
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,099
this flaw was added a year ago, two years ago, whatever.

734
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,459
So essentially it's been there forever realistically, right?

735
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,060
And you know, we found it, we fixed it so the news version isn't flawed. Great. So,

736
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,660
yeah, like especially in the open source world, especially with this like,

737
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,849
you know, sort of ruby jams, you know, Pearl C Pan,

738
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,339
no Js type thing.

739
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,500
Yeah, if you're running the latest of everything,

740
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,819
basically, statistically, that's

741
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,459
how you are secure

742
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,520
as far as playing CD whacko.

743
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,189
Totally,

744
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:46,349
totally. And so I'm like, Yeah. You know,

745
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,819
if there's something really bad, I'll ask you to do an update.

746
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,000
But by and large you guys are doing these updates fast

747
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,859
enough that it's not really going to be a problem.

748
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:55,319
Plus we have a bunch of layers of other security like cloud flaring,

749
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,329
like other filtering and stuff to prevent, you know,

750
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,589
people from doing shenanigans to our web servers in the first place

751
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,140
regardless of what's running on it.

752
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,540
-- Yeah. No, I, I totally get it,
-- man.

753
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:04,910
You know,

754
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,900
and I get for like larger applications or stuff you're shipping to customers,

755
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,900
you probably want better, more official CV tracking, right?

756
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,660
Because you can't just be like whatever ship an update and you know,

757
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,060
enforce everybody to use it.

758
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,520
Right. That's the beauty of a service, right. With a service. Oh,

759
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:20,739
yeah, 100% of customers upgraded. Why? Because we did,

760
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,369
-- right.
-- It's that simple.

761
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,150
-- Right.
-- It's

762
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,130
-- true.
-- You know.

763
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,900
So, so anyway, anyway, kind of back to the topic is

764
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:34,020
people want actionable useful advice and we suck at that.

765
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,380
And so now this is something I'm starting to think about it,

766
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,099
but cost effective and realistic.

767
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,500
Yeah, that's true. True because I can give insane actionable advice.

768
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,060
But it needs to be practical. That that's a very good point actually. And I have to,

769
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:48,390
-- I have to consider that
-- in some meaningful way.

770
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,939
Right.

771
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,660
As we found out last episode that totally works.

772
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,020
So

773
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,339
it works all the time.

774
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,209
It's like fishing training anyway anyway. All right.

775
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,689
So, yeah, I guess in summary it's

776
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,479
open source one and people want to be secure but they don't know what to do and,

777
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:16,329
and quite frankly we don't know what to tell them.

778
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:16,869
So,

779
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,699
you know,

780
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,199
I guess, well, actually, so here's one of the other things.

781
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,920
So the talk I gave, I took the O

782
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:23,109
A

783
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:24,959
top 10 and I also showed the old O

784
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,810
A top 10 and the new one. And I'm like, this is what failure looks like essentially.

785
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:32,699
-- And I can't wait for the hate mail for saying that
-- it's, well, it's the same list,

786
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:32,910
right?

787
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,170
-- Every
-- year. It's almost exactly the same

788
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,260
and,

789
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,260
-- and I, I turned it into,
-- well, people keep making the same mistakes though.

790
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,459
So it's, it is the same list because, well, it's like driver training.

791
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,410
People still don't stop at red lights and they still can't parallel park.

792
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,630
-- Sure.
-- Like it just doesn't change.

793
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,290
Exactly. And so basically I said 10 is too many as it is.

794
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,650
And I told them like, here's three things you can do.

795
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,390
Number one was use and like a framework, right?

796
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,770
Don't, don't like, don't do your own html escaping, for example,

797
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,800
just find a framework and use it,

798
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,609
right?

799
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,930
That takes care of like four of the top 10. Basically,

800
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,400
the second one was like, don't do your own.

801
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:11,650
A

802
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,839
right? There's things like a

803
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,770
zero, there's like Google, there's Microsoft,

804
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,119
there's everyone has like their ability to

805
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,890
do authentication and they have libraries to

806
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,910
-- hook into
-- and more to the point most frameworks have that capability now,

807
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,900
weirdly, most web frameworks, you know, yeah,

808
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,359
they realize they need authentication.

809
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:29,910
Who knew? Right?

810
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:33,015
And then the last one was basically like, don't,

811
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:35,405
don't let humans do your infrastructure, right?

812
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:38,354
Use like tools and things like containers and answerable

813
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,974
scripts and whatever because obviously if humans touch it,

814
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:41,625
they screw it up.

815
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:45,175
But if you let a script do it, you're, it's going to be the same every time. And like,

816
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,375
and for real, like those three things, if everyone did those, you could,

817
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,844
you could almost get rid of the O

818
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:51,935
A top 10. But again, like

819
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:55,349
it, it's of course easy to say that it's hard to do,

820
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,010
but at least it's something people can think

821
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,310
about instead of saying here's 10 problems.

822
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,709
-- Good freaking luck.
-- Part of the challenge is, you know, people need

823
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,479
more good generic solutions, not some hyper specific.

824
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:09,489
Well, like, don't ever write this specific line of code ever again,

825
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:11,079
right?

826
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,199
Because I've seen that I've literally

827
00:33:13,209 --> 00:33:15,310
seen where people do developer security training

828
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,430
and they're like, don't ever do this, like, you know,

829
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:20,709
forget the html escape output to your web server.

830
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,030
Well, yeah, but no,

831
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,859
but kind of it doesn't work that way sometimes

832
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,829
because sometimes you actually have to send HTML out,

833
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,619
right?

834
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,219
And sometimes that's appropriate, you know, and so,

835
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:33,060
but if you have a framework, right? And the framework is smart.

836
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:35,199
It's like, well, that's user input. So I'm going to escape that.

837
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:38,380
Whereas this is something I generated, therefore it's OK.

838
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:41,599
-- You know.
-- Exactly. Exactly. All right, man,

839
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,300
I, I dig it. So,

840
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,400
yeah, I guess

841
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,380
acon was fun. I, I hope to go again soon

842
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,050
and

843
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:50,650
yeah, I guess

844
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,390
that that is all. So let's

845
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,410
