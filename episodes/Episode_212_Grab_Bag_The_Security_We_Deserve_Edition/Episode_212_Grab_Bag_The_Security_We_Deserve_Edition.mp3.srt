Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,810
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:11,649
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,059
I've got a new one for you. I smashed my thumb working in my,

4
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,620
ah, no, no, no, no. My story is much better than yours.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,159
I was working in my workshop

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,239
and

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,440
my wife wants like a blanket rack thing and I had some extra wood and I'm like,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,680
what's a blanket rack?

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,950
One of those things. It's,

10
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,599
I'll put a picture in the show notes. It's basically a thing.

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,169
You hang blankets on, right.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,009
And

13
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,220
you have a bunch of extra wood. She wants one and I'm thinking this is something to do.

14
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,959
I'm actually, I'm, I'm kind of between,

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,990
we'll say time wasting in the evenings right now because I

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,209
finished a bunch of video games and TV shows and like,

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,490
games done quick last week and that's done now.

18
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,270
So I'm like, I have nothing exciting to do. I'll go build this.

19
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:57,310
I'm, I'm tightening a clamp to hold some wood down to the workbench

20
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:01,770
and I, like, smash my thumb into something. I have no idea what I smashed it into it.

21
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:05,309
Like bled everywhere. I literally have no idea how I possibly did this.

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,860
There was blood all over the place. It's all bruised up now.

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,309
And I'm thinking this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in my life.

24
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,300
So, are you going to wear your work gloves from now on? No,

25
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:15,809
no, no.

26
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:16,779
Actually I don't,

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,620
I have never done like fine woodworking with work

28
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,440
gloves on and I don't think you could.

29
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,669
Well, fine woodworking is one thing, but I mean,

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,779
the other thing is I,

31
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:29,620
I was tightening a clamp. Like, what did I? There's nothing near my hand.

32
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:34,069
I don't, I literally, I have no idea what I even hit to do this.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,989
Here's the thing I've discovered about work gloves

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,370
is work gloves by and large are terrible.

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,690
What you want is like a specialty glove.

36
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,540
And I discovered airs soft gloves, very comfortable. They

37
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,184
typically a pad on the thumb and index finger

38
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,915
that will also like allow you to work your phone, which is nice, right?

39
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,114
Because that's the other problem is you put work

40
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,294
gloves on and you can't use your phone.

41
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,434
I don't use my phone in the workshop anyway.

42
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:58,675
But the point is there was nothing to hit my hand on and I did.

43
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:00,144
So it's kind of like in full

44
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,385
se like, why are we hitting ourselves in the face that

45
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,194
I maybe I have no idea.

46
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:05,305
I'm like, honestly,

47
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,835
it felt like someone smashed my thumb with a hammer I obviously hit it on something.

48
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:09,625
I don't know what

49
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,445
and it's just like, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,949
So anyway, but I have the bruise to show it, this is kind of like the chromium thing.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,440
So uh chromium sends out DNS probes

52
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:23,570
uh when you like fire it up.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,259
So

54
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,899
you, you know, kind of figure out like, am I on a captive network?

55
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,690
Like is there a captive portal is that,

56
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,250
you

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,380
know,

58
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,740
the problem is the way they do it is they generate a random like domain name,

59
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,580
which is just like a random string of text.

60
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:39,979
It's like 7 to 15 characters long or something.

61
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:40,789
So of course,

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,179
that ends up going all the way down to the TLD servers because they want to like it.

63
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,009
They just look for like http

64
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,432
slash slash 1237 QXB 947

65
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,162
right? No.com

66
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:51,731
dot org.

67
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:52,401
So of course,

68
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:55,421
all these queries go to the root level name servers and something

69
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:58,182
like 50% of the traffic now to the root level name servers.

70
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,481
Is this crap? Seriously, I didn't know they did this.

71
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:03,542
I mean I'm familiar with captive portal.

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,542
So we should probably also clarify the reason this happens is

73
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,682
so if I wrote a web browser on my computer,

74
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:12,962
the web browser will say OK, computer look for this DNS record,

75
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:18,164
right? And then my computer will ask whatever name server is configured.

76
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:19,634
Usually your home router.

77
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,143
Hey,

78
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:22,313
go find this DNS record and then your home router

79
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:24,794
is usually configured to talk to another DNS server.

80
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,503
Like in my case,

81
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:29,684
it's talking to the Cloud flare 1.1 0.1 0.1 it will then ask cloud flare, hey,

82
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,934
give me this DNS record.

83
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,143
And if cloud flare doesn't know, then it will say, hey, root name servers,

84
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:35,694
give me this DNS record.

85
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:40,145
And the thing too is like generally speaking, queries for like.com dot net.

86
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:41,046
You know, that stuff

87
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:45,276
you look that up and it gets cached. I was going to say there's not that many TL DS.

88
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:48,436
Well, there, there are like 2000 or something now, 1500 there's a

89
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,365
lot more to the point that stuff gets generally

90
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,766
cashed because even if you use 100 of them,

91
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,845
which I don't, well,

92
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:58,005
maybe somebody's browsing the web enough to see 100 different TL DS a day.

93
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:01,845
But the point is that stuff gets cashed for minutes or hours. So, you know,

94
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,619
there's not a lot of load on the,

95
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,160
on the root level name servers for actual legitimate traffic,

96
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,039
especially if you're using like 1.1 0.1 0.1

97
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,339
right? Because they'll do a query for like, where do I find.com?

98
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,740
And you know,

99
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:15,070
they hold that answer for a while.

100
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,798
But what's interesting is the chart has like

101
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,019
sort of chrome market share and you know,

102
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,858
this uh

103
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,019
this amount of traffic and of course, you know, it,

104
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,739
it basically as chrome usage goes up, this traffic goes up.

105
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,589
I mean, the good news is chrome market shares are like what,

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,730
60 something percent now.

107
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:29,059
So

108
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,890
I guess it can only get 50% worse. Why is that good news?

109
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:33,730
Well,

110
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,089
because basically it's not like chrome will

111
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,109
somehow keep linearly growing and you know,

112
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,079
this traffic will drive the top level name servers into the dirt.

113
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,730
Oh, you mean for this particular bug?

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,269
You just fix it in the next version,

115
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,709
you can't fix it,

116
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:49,880
right?

117
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,459
You have to use you, you can't, for example,

118
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,420
they could make a query for like random string.com

119
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,100
but that every once in a while that would actually

120
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,299
be legitimate and work or fail or nex don't,

121
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:00,540
you know,

122
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,480
something would go wrong and it would also be much

123
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:05,929
easier for Attackers to detect and do their shenanigans with,

124
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,019
right?

125
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,140
Because part of this probing

126
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,375
is to see if something is going wrong, right?

127
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:14,295
Because it's generating a DNS query that what's the longest TLD?

128
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:17,464
Basically, this will never accidentally hit a correct TLD.

129
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:20,625
Well, in theory and even then the TLD shouldn't be serving a record.

130
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:22,924
Like there should not be a record for.com like, oh yeah,

131
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,984
that's 1.2 0.3 0.4 go over there.

132
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:25,975
What's the point?

133
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,369
Well,

134
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,459
it's just remember back when those routers all

135
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,679
use some poor university NTP server and like,

136
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,820
hammered it into the ground.

137
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,299
That was neat. Well, it's, it's just, I'm kind of wondering like, at what point

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,859
does a company have, maybe

139
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,820
I don't want to say a duty but you

140
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,119
can't just like hammer away on public infrastructure.

141
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,049
Yeah, I agree with that. I think this feels like a silly thing

142
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,339
to be doing.

143
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,279
And there are probably

144
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,989
alternative methods.

145
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,720
II, I feel like Google could,

146
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,519
if they want this feature, they could support it themselves.

147
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:02,299
That would make sense to me. But that's just me.

148
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,869
Yeah, actually this just came up now that I think of it

149
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,089
yesterday. I think the

150
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,519
tu default ami

151
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,880
will the, the, the message of the day that Motd

152
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,850
curls to an

153
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,760
ubuntu

154
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,519
address.

155
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,339
So basically every time the system you log in

156
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,100
ubuntu gets

157
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,540
uh a website hit from you

158
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,609
and that the curl command

159
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,250
contains an enormous amount of information

160
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,619
in the user agent

161
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,019
that feels dirty.

162
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,880
And like

163
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,929
this is one of those situations of as soon as a company realizes what's happening,

164
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,250
you just, you know, it's easier than trying to fix all the AMI S

165
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,440
ban that freaking IP, you know what I mean?

166
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,609
And so my guess is Google by doing DNS nonsense, get skirts around the topic of oh,

167
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,119
we'll just be

168
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,600
and the stupid Google IP that everything's trying to hit.

169
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,839
Yeah, I don't know either way.

170
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,739
It's, it's because there's, there's a lot, there's increasingly more of this,

171
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:02,959
right?

172
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,679
Like all these essentially public good services

173
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,880
that are being like

174
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,230
to put it bluntly the TLD,

175
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:14,779
the purpose of the TLD servers is so that people can do DN SS lookups

176
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:16,000
and

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,170
sort of, I suspect the intent was

178
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:23,019
to do DNS lookups that are sort of correct or meaningful.

179
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,140
For example, I can't, can I just,

180
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:28,660
can I start using the root level servers as like a speed test?

181
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:32,450
Right? No, no. Like can I be like, hey, I wonder how many DN SS queries per second?

182
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,790
My system can handle and like start spamming.

183
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,325
Is that a reasonable use?

184
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:40,274
Well, not really, you know, but so where do you draw that line? I

185
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,084
do not know the answer to this. And

186
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,285
this is

187
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,255
always an interesting topic

188
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:52,475
because a great deal of internet infrastructure relies on nods and handshakes.

189
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,480
And this is another example of Google is potentially abusing

190
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,519
the not in handshake ecosystem that keeps everything running well,

191
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,170
more to the point.

192
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,640
This isn't something that you can actually block.

193
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,790
Like there's no way for the TLD to block that we know of.

194
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,649
Well, not, not reasonably,

195
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,869
you know, it just, yeah, I don't know. It, it kind of comes to me this whole

196
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,700
people used to, I don't want to say only do reasonable things,

197
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,760
but it was more that doing unreasonable things was that

198
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:23,587
difficult.

199
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:25,557
But when you have a web browser that's 60 some

200
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,527
percent of the market and you make a small change.

201
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:27,967
Well, that,

202
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:30,546
that has a very global effect. It does.

203
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:34,166
And you know what I would compare this to is we discussed B GP.

204
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,746
It feels like 100 years ago,

205
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:39,466
but it's a similar problem where when B GP was created for, you know,

206
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,506
internet routing,

207
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,317
it was, there were like six people that could use it so

208
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:43,775
great

209
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:44,456
each

210
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:44,666
other.

211
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,156
And right, exactly.

212
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,317
Like if something's wrong, just you pick up the phone and call Bob, you know,

213
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,456
two towns over and we'll sort this out

214
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,533
and now

215
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,713
everyone's using B JP and we're like, holy crap. This is ridiculous.

216
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:00,893
A great example of this is a most operating systems have

217
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,963
a host file because actually before we had DNS servers,

218
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,494
we actually had a host file.

219
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,783
So literally, like this is like an old timey phone book.

220
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,823
Like you literally had a printed phone book that

221
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,573
was inside your computer and the host file,

222
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,164
like people would publish host files for

223
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:17,963
their university or for their organization.

224
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:21,453
Well, yeah, but that's because there were like 10 IP addresses in use.

225
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:22,174
Yeah, exactly.

226
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:22,791
Yeah.

227
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,000
And so of course,

228
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,940
even though we have DNS and everything now,

229
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,041
we still have a host file and a host file can be really useful because if you want to,

230
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:30,531
for example,

231
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,700
do some development work locally on your laptop and maybe

232
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,111
like redirect something to a local port or whatever,

233
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,651
you can do that with a host file very easily.

234
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,541
Or, you know, if you want to have like sort of a site, local dns,

235
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,510
but not actually set up proper DNS.

236
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,760
You know,

237
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,070
it can be actually a lot easier to just edit a few

238
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,520
host files on a few servers and be done with it.

239
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:51,870
And so now Microsoft is now detecting host files that block the windows telemetry.

240
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:52,840
So

241
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,830
one way people try to turn off the windows telemetry is, I mean,

242
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,359
there's a bunch of magic registry editing keys that you can use,

243
00:09:58,369 --> 00:09:59,880
which quite honestly like

244
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,119
I hate going into the registry editor.

245
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,200
It scares me because, like, you, you make one wrong move and you,

246
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,260
it's not even that your system is dead. It's like your system

247
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,450
is an introverted brick.

248
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,520
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

249
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,690
That's right where there's some strange minor behavior

250
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,900
that pops up every three months and,

251
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,400
like, totally messes up your spreadsheet.

252
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:24,799
So, so what are they doing if I, if I zero out their telemetry servers, what happens?

253
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,520
Restores those files back to its default content?

254
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,770
Interesting. Yeah.

255
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,780
It basically they've decided that, like, for example,

256
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,719
if you want to put microsoft.com or, you know, stuff in there you're not allowed to

257
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:40,656
in, I have a lot of feelings about this. Well, my take on it, it's my computer. Don't.

258
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,056
I have some agency over this. It's totally not your computer.

259
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:47,395
It's, we are borrowing Windows from Microsoft.

260
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:50,765
So, at what point, how much of the configuration stack do they own?

261
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,796
And can they force upon me?

262
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:55,885
Can they force me to use their Ds server, they can probably, because I bet in that,

263
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,476
that phone book of the terms of

264
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:58,791
you didn't read,

265
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,142
I'm sure this is clearly laid out in there

266
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:05,911
in like section 307 subsection 400 paragraph eight.

267
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,231
Well, it really got me thinking like, I mean, because there's,

268
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,521
there's copyright protection so I can't really, you know,

269
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,611
there's certain ways I can and cannot modify the system,

270
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,911
but a configuration file is clearly meant to be

271
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,802
modified or else it wouldn't be a configuration file,

272
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,072
it would be a hard coded value.

273
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:19,831
It kind of is now

274
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,280
this is the future we deserve.

275
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,219
Yeah, I'm not going to disagree with you. That's what I feel like here.

276
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:31,950
I mean, we are, I think on a precipice in terms of things like privacy

277
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:33,719
and even

278
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:36,729
just, just consumer rights to a degree,

279
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,440
we've become lazy and complacent

280
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,359
and this is what happens.

281
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,479
I mean, this is,

282
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,330
this is one of the reasons the free software

283
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,000
movement in the nineties was picking it got so popular

284
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,460
because Microsoft was this wouldn't have even registered as

285
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,750
a blip on the things they used to do.

286
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:59,030
Well, I mean, I've had now had the experience of my one son had us on app.

287
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,099
He loved story bots.

288
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,419
Story bots took their apps offline and they only go through their website

289
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,940
now because I guess they don't want to give Apple their 30% cut.

290
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,919
But I'm kind of annoyed because I paid for the Story Bots app. Oh, so you paid for it?

291
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,869
And it disappeared.

292
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,260
Well, it didn't disappear if it's installed on your ipad,

293
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,010
you can keep it but it's out of the store.

294
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,390
So, like if you, if I buy him a new device, I can't install it on the new device.

295
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,469
Ah, interesting.

296
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,400
Or for example,

297
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,570
if I have to wipe his device or if we accidentally delete the app or something,

298
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,789
it's gone forever.

299
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,349
I paid for this thing. I paid for a license for this thing,

300
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,409
but

301
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,140
it's essentially effectively been taken away.

302
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,330
Well, it's not yours and it never was, I mean, this is

303
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,000
the whole Apple ecosystem.

304
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,640
Well, and so I was trying to explain to my other son that, you know, for example,

305
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,969
we don't buy software

306
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,229
and he said, oh, so we rent it and I'm like, well,

307
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,750
no, actually renters have more rights than us.

308
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,510
Like you can't just kick a renter out of

309
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,659
a house when they're paying their rent on time,

310
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:55,309
right?

311
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,270
Even if they don't pay their rent on time, you can't just kick them out.

312
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,150
But in this case, I paid for the app,

313
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,619
I didn't do a charge back or something like I paid for the

314
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,710
app in good faith and then it got yanked away from me.

315
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,229
This is the future we deserve.

316
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,650
I worry because, well, he's quite rightly,

317
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,979
he's quite upset about it because it was actually quite a good app.

318
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:16,369
And you know, you could personalize it with his picture and stuff like that and

319
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:17,330
now it's gone

320
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,349
and, and, I mean, gone forever unless I,

321
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,609
you know, the website experience is nowhere close.

322
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:27,440
And also I think a couple bucks a month that recurring revenue stream too. Right.

323
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,010
That's the other thing I'm noticing is a lot of children's apps are

324
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,309
getting pulled off the App store and being turned into recurring revenue websites.

325
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,130
This is very interesting.

326
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,210
I mean, you could tie this back to what, what Epic did with Fortnite

327
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:43,309
where they're, they're trying to stand up to Apple and, and you can argue this,

328
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm not going to take a position necessarily because I can see there's, I think both

329
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,453
sides are wrong in this one. I think they're all terrible.

330
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,893
I mean, I agree, I don't like any of them, but I mean,

331
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:56,492
you've got the angle of Apple is providing an ecosystem, but then they're also,

332
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,572
it feels kind of like shakedown money from Epics perspective.

333
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:00,013
Well,

334
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,713
and then clearly like Apple with that whole wordpress thing where they tried to

335
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,732
sort of shake down the wordpress app and the Wordpress app is like,

336
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:11,083
but we don't have in app purchases and they, they had to cave on that one.

337
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,403
But I think that was,

338
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:15,116
is a little too where the bad guys. Yeah.

339
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,205
Well, as somebody pointed out though, this is not like

340
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:20,786
relying on public outrage to sort of police companies

341
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:23,395
behaviors is not sustainable or what we want.

342
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:26,085
It definitely isn't, but it's all we have right now.

343
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:26,575
Yeah.

344
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:27,096
Well, class

345
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:30,835
action lawsuits which, you know, the lawyers make out like bandits and we get,

346
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,306
what is it, $7 off on our next computer purchase?

347
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:37,866
And it takes 17 years for the case to go through. I mean, so,

348
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:38,690
yeah,

349
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,570
this is,

350
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,940
I mean, the, the obvious answer is

351
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,169
the government needs to

352
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,489
clean up some of this mess. But I think

353
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:52,489
they've got, uh, we'll say, but I'm not hopeful.

354
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:52,929
Well,

355
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,809
and the problem too is that the government passes

356
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,369
regulations and then the companies just engineer around them.

357
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,070
Like, what is it?

358
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,830
Uber and Lyft in California now have changed the pricing structure and model

359
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:04,440
so that we're back to, oh, you know,

360
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,109
these people are your employees because you pay them a certain amount of time,

361
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,039
you require them work these hours, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

362
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,200
And they're like, ok, well, we changed the system how it works.

363
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,599
So it no longer falls under that definition and they're back to being contractors,

364
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,479
guess maybe California

365
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,114
decides to do this dance again.

366
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,075
And in 23 years, we have another set of regulations that they, you know,

367
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:26,344
because literally they were like, we're shutting down by 1159 on this day because,

368
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:29,145
you know, the law takes effect at like midnight and they're like,

369
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,385
we're shutting down for a few days.

370
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,984
Like I think it was Lyft and Uber both shut down in California and

371
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:35,544
they're reengineering their systems so that,

372
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,164
well, the law doesn't apply to us as our lawyers understand it.

373
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,265
Well, in California walk some of this back, I mean,

374
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,849
and, and this is so this is an example of,

375
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,669
and this is what we just kind of make a broader topic because

376
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:54,510
the world is fundamentally different now than it was even say five years ago

377
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:55,760
and

378
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,059
things like what is work

379
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,250
and how we do it. And especially during a pandemic,

380
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:05,559
there is no comparison to the way things used to be.

381
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,400
And now, I mean, this is one of the challenges when, for example,

382
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,906
in the United States, most of our leadership is essentially, you know,

383
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,546
white men who should have retired a long time ago

384
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:18,015
and they're insanely out of touch and they don't know what's going on.

385
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:20,906
I'm going to, I'm going to tie this now kind of back to security because this is,

386
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,856
I see this

387
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,265
again and again and again where

388
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,265
you have leadership in a position of not

389
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,536
understanding what's actually happening on the ground.

390
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:35,185
But from their vantage point, everything looks great.

391
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,046
For example, in computer security, I have some knowledge of what's going on.

392
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:39,065
But I'll be blunt, even I

393
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,521
there are massive sea changes happening

394
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,392
and things are just totally different, you know.

395
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,562
And part of me though, I mean, previously on the show,

396
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,812
when we had Katherine Waldron from the R street institute.

397
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:51,851
She said something that I really never fully thought through before,

398
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,622
which is regulation has to be good regulation.

399
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:55,721
Right.

400
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,521
Well, but no, no, no, no,

401
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,151
but I'd always kind of operated under the premise that obviously

402
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:01,601
people who are making regulation are trying to make it good.

403
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,302
Well,

404
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:05,040
I can try to make a good wedding cake that I'm

405
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:07,362
pretty sure it's not going to be a good wedding cake.

406
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,839
II,

407
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,290
I suspect that is true when the regulators

408
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,608
have a highly adversarial relationship with those,

409
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,380
with the entities being regulated.

410
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,810
And I would go even farther to say that the, the entity is being regulated,

411
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,660
essentially have a highly adversary relationship with, like,

412
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,229
even their contractors slash employees, their customers.

413
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,560
Like,

414
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,709
like, honestly, I feel

415
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,869
kind of, you know, when I use Lyft or Uber, I feel kind of, you know, like it's,

416
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,810
it's not like my,

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,310
I have a barber. I like my barber. He's a good guy. Cuts my hair. Really?

418
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,199
Well, I like him. You don't have any hair?

419
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,930
Yeah, I get my head shaved every couple of weeks

420
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:47,030
anyways. But when I get in like a lift or an Uber, I'm basically like, you know, how

421
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,229
badly am I going to get ripped off by this company?

422
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,469
Here's the thing. They're cheaper than taxis.

423
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,989
And from my perspective I'm getting a deal.

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,349
But the, I always feel like the person driving is kind of getting ripped off too.

425
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:57,489
Yeah,

426
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,670
they're getting shafted and So I make sure I give them a generous cash tip.

427
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,880
I was about to say, yeah, because if you're tipping them through the app,

428
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,510
they may not be seeing that.

429
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,310
Right. I don't, I don't tip them through the app. They get a generous

430
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,069
bit of cash for me

431
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:12,640
when I exit the vehicle.

432
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:13,270
Right?

433
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,630
Like the fact that you have to like,

434
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,790
subvert the system to like make sure the driver can eat dinner.

435
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:18,310
Yeah.

436
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:23,390
Right. Right. And, and this is, this is what the modern world feels like, man.

437
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,550
From looking at the way Apple treats us to Microsoft's telemetry to Google.

438
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,270
Abusing the root name servers is just, I don't know if,

439
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,699
if history has always been like this, I think to a degree it has, but

440
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,880
it's just sometimes it feels super out of control

441
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,709
and like especially in the security universe,

442
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,079
everything is on fire all the time. We live in just constant panic

443
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,020
and at almost every turn, I mean, every time

444
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,260
I see an email come in from somewhere talking about, oh, you know, we,

445
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,069
there's an alert on this service or whatever and it's like,

446
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:58,239
holy cow, I need to go clean my pants again.

447
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,530
And it's just, it's, it's a lot, man.

448
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,619
And, and then you add the pressures of society on top of that and like it's

449
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,709
what a time, you know.

450
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,459
Yeah.

451
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,979
Well, I looking at investors like this,

452
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,859
somebody was pointing out on hacker news that it

453
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,099
feels like there's a whole bunch of ipos coming.

454
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,339
Well, yeah, because if the economy doesn't improve, good luck doing an IP next year.

455
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,819
Yeah. Seriously.

456
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,390
You know, I get it. These IP OS.

457
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,920
They want to make their money and grow their businesses. But at the same time it,

458
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,479
some of them feel a bit scammy, like some of them feel like they're rushing it out.

459
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:27,310
I mean, look at, look at most of your

460
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,420
icos, your initial coin offerings. Yeah, but those were scams.

461
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,790
Those were straight up all like that 2017 time frame of

462
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,550
all those Bitcoins that was very clearly

463
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:40,285
the make money fast era of the, the Cryptocurrency market.

464
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,505
Well, and that was before the SEC was involved as well.

465
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:47,555
And the SEC now, I mean, they have involvement but which coin was it that,

466
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:51,545
that raised like 2 billion and got what, like a $20 million fine

467
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:52,834
for doing it wrong?

468
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,994
Well, I mean, even more recently, there's the Yan coin which came up,

469
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,025
raised a couple 100 million I want to say.

470
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,405
And then there was a bug in the smart contracts.

471
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,714
So the whole thing came crashing down.

472
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,209
Oh, that's right. I read about that from what I read.

473
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,619
The idea was you,

474
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:10,109
you'd have the ability for humans to raise a consensus to say like we want to do this.

475
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,180
We don't want to do this.

476
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:11,510
Yeah, it was,

477
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,969
it was basically organized as a dow a distributed autonomous organization.

478
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:17,500
Yeah. Right. Right. But, but there was a,

479
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:22,435
so it was impossible to gain a consensus because there were too many, like,

480
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:25,035
magic coins that didn't exist, which is

481
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:26,464
good.

482
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,515
And that's, you know, that, yeah, here we go.

483
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,875
Uh, blah, blah, blah,

484
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:32,064
doubled from 200 million to 400 million

485
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,015
since the protocol collapsed on August 13th.

486
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,390
Yeah. Like the whole thing from, like, start to finish was done in a couple of days.

487
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,229
Like it was just a, you know, giant mess.

488
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,709
And I, well, but

489
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,050
those, how do I put it nicely? The, the Cryptocurrency market

490
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,579
is still at that gold rush stage.

491
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:55,040
The.com boom and the stock, you remember the.com era with

492
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,089
what some of those tech stocks did

493
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,060
and what was promised? I'm

494
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,439
so actually fun.

495
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,920
I don't, I, I imagine I brought this up before,

496
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,390
but actually my first job out of college, all of the office and the furniture we had,

497
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,339
it was the pets.com

498
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:10,819
office and furniture

499
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:15,969
that my company like basically got for a song because one day pets.com, like

500
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,150
the landlords just locked the doors because they didn't pay the bills.

501
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,750
Yeah, there was a lot of that.

502
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,530
I worked for one of those where they had, you know,

503
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,829
obscenely well appointed offices and then

504
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,380
three months later, the whole thing basically ended in tears,

505
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,510
right.

506
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:34,189
Anyway, anyway, this feels like a super depressing episode.

507
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:39,180
Well, what's interesting though is as bad as this is like things keep working and

508
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,719
I don't want to say this sort of abuse becomes normalized,

509
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,459
but we find better ways to deal with it.

510
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,520
You know, like I remember when spam was getting out of control and honestly, now

511
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,839
I get very little spam in my inbox, right? You know,

512
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:55,060
and I feel like honestly for these root level name servers, like OK, well,

513
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:58,180
if Chrome were to get 100% of the market share, well,

514
00:21:58,189 --> 00:21:59,599
the problem would only be 50% worse.

515
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,800
So simple linear statement,

516
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,969
they would need 50% more hardware on the root level name servers.

517
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:05,920
Well, to be blunt,

518
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,280
just wait one year for an it refresh and Moore's law will take care of that.

519
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,260
Uh That, well, maybe, I mean, I don't, I don't know if that's true or not.

520
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,930
I don't have any data to back that up.

521
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,969
No, what I mean is like if you buy a bunch more servers in a year,

522
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,380
they're going to be at least 50% faster than the one

523
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,170
they will be.

524
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,645
But how many more Chrome running devices will be in the universe in a year?

525
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,444
I assume the number is increasing in

526
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:33,964
some manner, but it's kind of it's increasing,

527
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,055
not super fast because basically we've already got, what is it?

528
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:40,155
3 billion smartphones in the hands of people. Again, even if we get one

529
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:43,140
Chrome phone for everybody on the planet,

530
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,819
that would only be about two or three times as

531
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,119
many and that's not going to happen anytime soon.

532
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:48,650
And that's, that's probably fair.

533
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,949
And that's what I mean is like, we've, we've,

534
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,890
we're in the middle of that s curve where it's like, yeah,

535
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
we could definitely get more,

536
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,180
but we're off the exponential growth phase

537
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:57,140
of like getting smartphones into people's hands,

538
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,040
like half of everybody has them now.

539
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,900
I mean, yeah.

540
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,385
Yeah, I'll agree with that. That's ok. Ok. Like if IO

541
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:05,655
devices start doing this, yeah, we might be in a world of hurt.

542
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:07,805
Like, if every light bulb on the planet were to do this,

543
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,944
that would be bad. Yeah, that's probably a different problem though.

544
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:14,244
Let's hope it is. Yeah. Why is your light bulb running a web browser? Oh, Lord.

545
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:17,844
It's just a computer. Of course, it could run a web browser. I mean,

546
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:18,915
you have to think me,

547
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:19,854
most, most,

548
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:23,625
most light bulbs probably have more powerful

549
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,150
computers in them than our first computer were

550
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,489
20 years ago.

551
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,640
Absolutely. More than 20 years. The fact that it can talk TCP.

552
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,589
I, and it's not like a $200 add on piece of software from IBM for OS Two, which,

553
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,530
you know, I actually, I bought the TCP I pack for Os Two.

554
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,239
I know you tell us that a lot.

555
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,750
I was like, trying to explain to my kids what a phone book is.

556
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,030
Do I actually, you know,

557
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,064
now that you say that I have not received a phone book at my house in a, surprisingly,

558
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,035
it's been more than a year now, I think.

559
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:54,535
And I mean, in the past I, I'd get my phone book, you know,

560
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:59,555
thrown onto my porch by somebody and then I would pick it up and recycle it and that,

561
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,905
I don't remember the last time I did that, which is good for the environment.

562
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:03,295
I mean,

563
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:04,204
yeah,

564
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,125
fundamentally, the moral of the story is the more things change,

565
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,234
the more they stay the same.

566
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:08,614
But

567
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,515
I think part of it is the the

568
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:15,670
the pace of change and the rapidity of sort of, I hate to use the word innovation,

569
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,670
you know, especially when I applied to things like Lyft and Uber.

570
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,390
But the sort of the pace at which people try new business models

571
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,189
to kind of screw people out of their money is definitely speeding up.

572
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,439
It's the story of humanity.

573
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:30,510
I mean, if you look at and I need to finish this work, so I,

574
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,160
I talk about this all the time.

575
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:35,410
But if you look at say like worker safety at

576
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,500
the turn of the century,

577
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:42,566
I mean, it was basically you went to work, you worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

578
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:45,926
And if you got hurt, you were just basically fired and that was the end,

579
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:48,816
you probably were going to starve to death because there was no,

580
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:50,686
no anything or even worse,

581
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:53,605
read about what they did to Children in the form of chimney sweeps.

582
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:56,475
Yeah. Right. Exactly. That's, that's horrifying also.

583
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,245
But anyway,

584
00:24:57,255 --> 00:25:01,706
the point is what happens is there's horrifying conditions and the

585
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:05,062
only reason they changed is because people wanted them to change.

586
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,541
But at the same time

587
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:08,812
it was so horrifically bad

588
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,732
that it couldn't be ignored anymore.

589
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:13,771
And, I mean, that's one of the, this is the perpetual problem we have.

590
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,302
Especially insecurity

591
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:18,942
is until we start killing people by the millions with technology.

592
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,621
Is anyone really going to care?

593
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:24,862
And I mean, if you look at the history of humanity, the answer is no,

594
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:26,222
no one is going to care.

595
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,328
Well, the thing is we have enough other quote

596
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:32,777
unquote like we have existential real problems that we're busy ignoring.

597
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:36,878
Yeah. Right. I mean, climate change is one of the easiest to pick on, right?

598
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:37,878
Like climate change.

599
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:41,417
We, there's literally as we're recording this, there are two hurricanes

600
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:45,628
in the Gulf of Mexico. Has that ever happened before? No,

601
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:50,317
that's completely bananas and humanity is like, oh, whatever, it's probably fine.

602
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,093
Like it's not fine at, oh,

603
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:55,573
I just, I remember this summer we've had

604
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:59,173
multiple heat warning advisories and I'm like, I,

605
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,093
that is not a thing when I was a child and that's the thing, right?

606
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,413
Like the climate

607
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:09,884
is not in a happy place, but as humans, we're like, whatever, it's fine

608
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,484
and unfortunately

609
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:15,534
it is going to have to get even worse than it already is before we care.

610
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:17,634
I mean, like this is a story of humans.

611
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:18,333
And see that's,

612
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:19,839
I think it's part of the problem with some of these

613
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,670
technological things is like by the time we figure out,

614
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,219
hey, we should have a secure iot world and how that actually looks.

615
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,160
Well, I've already got, you know what,

616
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,170
I don't even actually know how many IOT devices I have in my

617
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,390
life anymore. Like I'd have to go count light bulbs and a bunch of other random stuff.

618
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,910
But now, now here's the flip side of that coin

619
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,369
and this is for all you market forces folks out there,

620
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,069
we literally have security,

621
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,579
the market demands.

622
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,329
And is it, here's,

623
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,390
here's a question and I'm not going to answer

624
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,270
this because this is kind of the topic for,

625
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,510
for everybody is, is the security we have today good enough.

626
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,010
And

627
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,839
I don't, I don't think we should even necessarily answer that. Like this is,

628
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,829
this is, this is the question

629
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,349
like, how many people have we killed because of the bad security?

630
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,150
It's, the number is pretty low for sure. I mean, I guarantee it's not zero.

631
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,589
Well, part of the challenge too is,

632
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,189
is information security is one of those classic things where it's not going to

633
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:15,420
quite often, it's not going to kill anybody out, right.

634
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,739
But it might add to stress levels or, you know,

635
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,699
do something that statistically shortens life a bit for a bunch of people.

636
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:23,599
So, you know, like, are we killing anybody directly. No.

637
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:27,050
But are we making everybody miserable? Yes. Even ignoring,

638
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,140
we make lots of people miserable. I mean,

639
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,979
anyone listening to this podcast.

640
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,939
Uh, but so, so, but like, here's the other side of it. Right.

641
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:36,380
So, ok, so my credit card gets stolen

642
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,619
and I have to deal with it,

643
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,900
which actually like that hasn't happened in a while for me either.

644
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,790
But like my credit card get stolen, I had to deal with the outcome of that.

645
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,390
And, but

646
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,189
on the, on the flip side,

647
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,030
my ability to easily use my credit card for all kinds of

648
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,699
things has probably given me a net positive in my life.

649
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:57,770
Ignoring the fact that I have to deal with some of the aftermath of it getting stolen.

650
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,109
So as much as we want to harp on security sometimes, maybe,

651
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,380
maybe we have the right amount.

652
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,670
I don't know. That's the question that we have the security, the market demands.

653
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,729
Well, I would say we have the security that we deserve at this point.

654
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:10,290
It

655
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,300
is the future we deserve. Kurt.

656
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:15,439
Uh All right, cool. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one.

657
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:21,719
I feel like I'm going to end it on one happy note before I do in Washington DC

658
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,359
in the United States.

659
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,479
There is a panda who gave birth to a baby panda

660
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,170
and there is nothing more fun in Boston to watch.

661
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:33,979
I don't know,

662
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,530
whatever, shut up

663
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,180
but

664
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,819
go, I will put a link in the show notes. Go look at the panda. They have a panda. Cam.

665
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,500
Pandas are awesome and you can't not love pandas. That is,

666
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,540
that is the happy note we will end on.

667
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,979
So I do enjoy a good zoo webcam like in pandas man, like pandas, pandas,

668
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:57,770
pandas are our hope for the future.

669
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,020
That's all I can say because like that is an animal,

670
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,619
by all accounts should not exist in nature

671
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,630
yet it somehow persevered and as humans helping

672
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,540
keep them alive because they're so cool.

673
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,359
So there we go. Pandas. Like when you get depressed, think of pandas.

674
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,250
Thank you, Kurt, that you all for listening. You can go to open
