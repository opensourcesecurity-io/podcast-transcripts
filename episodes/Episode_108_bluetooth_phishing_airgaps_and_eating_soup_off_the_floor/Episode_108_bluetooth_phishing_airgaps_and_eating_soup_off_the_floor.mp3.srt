Hello and welcome to episode 108 of open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,930
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,369
Well, we broke Bluetooth again.

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,840
Oh, yeah, like security. Not like it just stopped.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,559
Yeah, I have,

5
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,530
I've got so many Bluetooth devices that will

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,500
work with most of our phones or computers,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,280
but not like

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,549
all of them

9
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:28,750
like speakers that will pair with one phone but not the other phone,

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,489
things like that.

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,399
Yeah, I, I have similar problems.

12
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,159
Bluetooth is surprisingly flaky,

13
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:36,069
but we should probably explain this particular issue,

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:36,680
right?

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,240
Yeah. Well, so

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,619
it's not even worth explaining. I think basically elliptical curve,

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,000
elliptical curve cryptography is difficult

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,549
and if you don't do it right,

19
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:52,090
it doesn't work so good. And of course, what do software people do?

20
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,080
They don't do things, right?

21
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:53,819
That's the

22
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:58,259
nature of software's fault or is this hardware's fault? Is it both

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,930
anyway?

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,060
Well, ultimately, the hardware was designed by somebody who then, you know?

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,379
Ok. No, no, let's, it's a security podcast. We can't, we can't weasel our way.

26
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,019
All right. So ec DH

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,400
elliptical curve Diffie

28
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:13,870
Hellman

29
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,379
is what that is. And there's a

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,199
an algorithm, many of us may be familiar with called Diffie

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,300
Hellman, which is essentially a way

32
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,180
for you and I

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,290
to

34
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:25,860
share

35
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,019
like a public key each

36
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,279
and then use that to generate a private key.

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,709
Only the two of us know it's actually a very ingenious algorithm that

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,230
like without it, the much of the modern internet couldn't exist.

39
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:45,739
-- And
-- even more simply than that, it's a way for two parties to share a secret such that

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,050
a third party cannot see the secret

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,459
and both parties can be absolutely certain

42
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,309
that

43
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,580
they actually got the correct secret

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,410
from

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,309
sharing the correct secret.

46
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,040
There's a really cool video using paint.

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,449
I

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:00,639
see.

49
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,959
OK. I'll put it in the show notes, but it basically it gives a demo of

50
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,000
kind of how this works using paint, which is quite clever.

51
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:14,380
But anyway, anyway, so the issue being ec is just elliptical curve D

52
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:14,789
Hellman.

53
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,080
And basically there is an issue with the way the

54
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,309
algorithm works with certain Bluetooth devices it sounds like.

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,229
And essentially

56
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,880
the the device doesn't make sure that the divvy

57
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,160
Homan handshake happened correctly,

58
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:32,440
meaning the it sounds like an attacker and I won't lie.

59
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,470
I'm not an expert on this. I just read this today,

60
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,369
but it sounds like an attacker could essentially man in the middle,

61
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,869
certain Bluetooth handshakes

62
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:44,619
and render them such that the encryption key used is extremely weak

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,029
and then you could basically steal it and

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,970
and go from there, obviously decrypt all the Bluetooth communication. It

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,335
sounds more like a somewhat active man in the middle of his card. Quote.

66
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:55,975
From a certain note,

67
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,054
the device must also uh the devices rather must

68
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:02,384
also agree on the elliptical curve parameters being used,

69
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:02,634
right?

70
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:03,934
Obviously, you know, you,

71
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:08,535
you can't do VC DH D without agreeing on which curve frame you're gonna use.

72
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:09,794
And a bunch of them

73
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:10,554
didn't

74
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,684
like make sure that they were validating that they were using the same one.

75
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:15,964
Whoops,

76
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:18,044
you know, classic software. Whoopsy.

77
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,940
It happens.

78
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,429
It, I guess here's, here's what I keep thinking of though. Here is,

79
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:29,460
it sounds like some of the Bluetooth stacks on operating systems are at fault

80
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,210
and it also sounds like some of the devices,

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:32,740
all

82
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:32,990
of them,

83
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,990
it was Apple Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm,

84
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,580
Microsoft Android, Bluetooth sig.

85
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,729
So that's like the standards group that does that Google

86
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,960
and the Linux kernel were all affected or sorry.

87
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,929
No affected was Apple Broadcom Intel, Qualcomm,

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,860
Microsoft was not affected.

89
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,779
And then the rest, the last four I listed are unknown, but

90
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:55,080
like Apple Broadcom and Intel and Qualcomm are all affected. Then it's,

91
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,279
that's pretty widespread.

92
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,899
Well, here's, here's what I'm wondering is,

93
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:04,110
and, and this can be more of a hypothetical question than anything is

94
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,020
my assumption is you're going to have to update the clients and the servers

95
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:13,490
and obviously updating an operating system is something that can be done.

96
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,238
But updating a lot of these devices, like, I,

97
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
I have a Bluetooth headset that costs like $5.

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,298
Oh,

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,858
-- yeah, that'll never get an update. Right. That's
-- never getting an update.

100
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,299
But does that mean then that the, the client that the,

101
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,029
that the computers are going to have

102
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,269
to support the broken Bluetooth handshake forever?

103
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,820
Uh, sort of, I mean, the, the, the, the real potential there would be, for example,

104
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,109
you have like a Bluetooth keyboard

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,299
and maybe I can now, you know, more likely impersonate the keyboard.

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,010
Right?

107
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:41,700
Sure.

108
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,089
But the client in theory, if they fix,

109
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,019
if they fix one end of the Bluetooth, then that end should refuse

110
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,609
to talk to the other side.

111
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:53,739
And so if you're fixing all the computers and phones and tablets,

112
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,980
then you don't really care if somebody can attack your keyboard.

113
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,279
Uh Maybe, right?

114
00:04:59,399 --> 00:04:59,910
I don't know

115
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,329
in

116
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm

117
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,429
saying in general, right?

118
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,089
Like in general, the concern more is that you're attacking the computer, you know,

119
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,549
you're Impersonating a keyboard

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,989
and sending keystrokes to the tablet saying, you know, like delete everything or

121
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,179
go send the banking password to this Russian,

122
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,630
whatever,

123
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,269
the more dangerous part of a keyboard is being able to sniff it and get the password,

124
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,450
right? Because I type my passwords on my keyboard.

125
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,890
This is, this is a marvelous segue

126
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:29,820
into the article Krems just published saying that thanks to UTU two F and UBI

127
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,290
keys that Google hasn't been fished in the last year.

128
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,149
Yep, that's like,

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,829
it's awesome. Right.

130
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,329
The first thing I thought of was like,

131
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:46,600
this is proof that fishing training doesn't work but U two F keys do work. Right.

132
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:47,059
Well,

133
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,320
I'm honestly at the point now we're

134
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,239
trying to solve technical security problems with people

135
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,549
that doesn't work and it doesn't scale. Right. It's like the spam problem.

136
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah, you could have a human being review all your email and delete all the spam.

137
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,820
You need like 400 of them,

138
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,670
400. You need at least one person per employee who gets email.

139
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,929
-- Well, no,
-- I mean, no, no, no, I meant 400 people per person.

140
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,470
-- I see
-- with the amount of spam I get.

141
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,440
It's insane. Exactly. You know,

142
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,220
I should say that I have no idea how much spam I get anymore.

143
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,220
Well, exactly,

144
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,160
because the computer works.

145
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:23,799
Um, and the same thing with, like, the fishing stuff is like,

146
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,920
yeah, like the, the human will be hyper vigilant and always

147
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,359
do the correct thing and never make a mistake.

148
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,119
No, that's not, that's literally the opposite of how people work. Right.

149
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,559
That is correct.

150
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,000
And more to the point is that cost effective. I know UTF keys are 50 bucks done.

151
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,220
You replace them? I don't know every couple of years.

152
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,640
If somebody accidentally smashes it with a hammer,

153
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,339
they're not 50 bucks,

154
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,100
they're, they're like $20 or less.

155
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,660
Well, I'm talking about the nice fancy ones that also do NFC wireless and all that.

156
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,260
-- Other stuff which you want
-- because whatever, nobody needs all that.

157
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,769
Yeah, you do if you want it on your phone.

158
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,059
I want my UTF key to work on my phone.

159
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,869
I do all my stuff on my phone now.

160
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,700
-- I,
-- I do a lot on my phone but I'm, I'm thinking

161
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,940
most of the logins on my phone

162
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,230
are now the result of an action I took on my computer though.

163
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,769
So I, I won't disagree with you.

164
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,010
-- Somewhat.
-- True. Yeah. Well, regardless, 20 to 50 bucks,

165
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,679
50 bucks is still cheaper than no offense.

166
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,709
An hour of employee time taking fishing training,

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,260
that's 50 bucks of lost productivity.

168
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:26,429
Right.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,429
Wait, I bet you could buy them five

170
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,190
UB keys

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,470
because most of the fishing training is like a couple

172
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,190
hours, if not days.

173
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,709
Yeah, totally. And, and let's see, from, from what I've read

174
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,609
when you, before fishing training you'll probably have like,

175
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,190
30% of your employees clicking fishing links and after you'll have, like, 20%.

176
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,769
So,

177
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
it's not a good investment.

178
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,730
And not only that,

179
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:54,299
I bet you're paying more per employee than the cost of a UBK per employee.

180
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,660
Right.

181
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,540
Well, a lot of this stuff is like some BS online course. That's not very,

182
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,679
you know, I,

183
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,459
you click through it as fast as you can because you got work to do.

184
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:04,230
Really?

185
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,019
-- Wait.
-- I'm, I'm what? No, no, you're not supposed to do that.

186
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,269
You're supposed to go through the course and and pay

187
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,779
attention and then take the test at the end.

188
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:17,929
Yeah, I, I've, I personally

189
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,359
met people

190
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,380
through as fast as,

191
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,940
like, like you and me for

192
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,420
hands

193
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:23,890
up.

194
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,950
Oh, man. I, I remember at, at,

195
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,399
there was

196
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,559
an employer. I

197
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,690
know

198
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:30,040
exactly.

199
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,789
And we would have contests to see who

200
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,679
could complete the training the fastest every year.

201
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,469
I, I got it down because it was the same training with the same exam every year.

202
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,679
I got it down to about 1520 minutes and, and in fairness though,

203
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,669
I actually remember the answers because it was pretty clear that like

204
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,179
you shouldn't take bribes to build a bad orphanage that then burns down.

205
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,840
Like I generally would agree that that's a bad don't thing.

206
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,109
Well, you know,

207
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,650
it always amused me about some of those questions is

208
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:01,869
there were questions that are legally acceptable but morally wrong

209
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,909
and I'd always get this wrong.

210
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,750
No, I would not do that. Like, no, no, it's perfectly legal to do this.

211
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,510
And it's like, I don't care, I'm not doing it right.

212
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,299
So, anyway, anyway, no, that's,

213
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,510
I love,

214
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,150
I love my, you know,

215
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,349
it always makes me laugh is when you explain how to use a up key to somebody

216
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,900
because a lot of two factor authentication stuff is a right pain in the ass, right?

217
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,049
You have to either install an app on your phone and then you have to

218
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:28,039
like take screenshots of QR codes or you have to type in stuff or,

219
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,400
or you have to like badge your administrator to mail something

220
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,950
out and then you like have to sync the token or,

221
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,729
you know, blah, blah, blah, right. UB key. You like

222
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:37,719
literally

223
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,080
um it arrives in the mail and you uh stick it into,

224
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,159
like you go to a site that wants to set it up, like, say Google or github

225
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:44,840
or whatever.

226
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,479
So you plug this little USB thingy into the computer and

227
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,090
the little green light goes on and then you touch it

228
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,400
right?

229
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,039
And that's it.

230
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,109
There's, there's, that's it, that, that basically syncs it

231
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,169
to that

232
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,450
service, Google github,

233
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:57,210
whatever,

234
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,130
you know, because basically every UB key has like a built in like little

235
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,090
secret and a random number generator and all that good stuff.

236
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,239
And so

237
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:06,669
yeah, basically you have to,

238
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,659
you have to register the UB key with um sort of each site you're going to use it with.

239
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,169
But that registration basically consists of plugging it in and

240
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,890
touching the little copper pad that has a green light

241
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,179
in

242
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,640
the really important thing with U two

243
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,250
F. Is that

244
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:20,729
what's you?

245
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,799
It's,

246
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,210
I don't even know what it stands for. It's the

247
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,330
Fido alliance, it's universal

248
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,250
two factor, universal factor.

249
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,190
Thank you.

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,690
So U two

251
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,849
F, what it does though is

252
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,109
when I go to say google.com

253
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,140
and it wants me to put my U two F key in

254
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,809
the, the URL and this is why Google has

255
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:47,710
not the URL or right? The host name, I'm sorry, the host name, google.com

256
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,869
is packaged up with some other information and then basically sent to the U key,

257
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,510
right?

258
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,669
And it's, it's basically a hash goes to the UE key

259
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,080
and it's kind of like challenge response where there's

260
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,669
like a uh like think about public key encryption,

261
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:01,840
right?

262
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,940
Where there's kind of like a key on the on the U A key

263
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,700
encryption key.

264
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,000
And when I hit the button, it transforms the data,

265
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,340
the browser sent it and then sends back a response.

266
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,700
And so

267
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,900
the reason phishing doesn't work with this and you can still fish people

268
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,369
with like S MS or even the the number generator on their phones

269
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:28,400
is because the the domain I am visiting in my web browser is part of the challenge.

270
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:29,210
If I go to

271
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,460
google.com,

272
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,919
I will not get a proper response.

273
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:39,159
So the fishing side doesn't work. But the in theory man in the middle could work

274
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,859
but any well, no, no, let me finish please.

275
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:42,719
But

276
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,200
anybody doing this is gonna be using TLS correctly pretty much,

277
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:51,440
right? If it was over an unencrypted http channel,

278
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,630
in theory,

279
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,119
it could maybe be man in the middle

280
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,830
like essentially you could proxy the authentication request,

281
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,849
you could not.

282
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,510
Uh

283
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:00,260
No, no,

284
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,669
I mean once you get in like so you UTF uh authenticate to Google Google

285
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,549
hands you back a token over a clear text channel that's what I'm talking about.

286
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,559
It

287
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:08,820
does

288
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:09,000
not

289
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:09,409
work that

290
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,280
way. You can't act,

291
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,960
no, no.

292
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,369
What I'm saying is the actual UTF itself can't be man in the middle.

293
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,250
But then what the UTF sets up like where Google hands

294
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,570
-- you a token or a cookie
-- or you mean like whatever,

295
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,570
man, if you're doing that

296
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,140
and that's my point.

297
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,690
That's my point, right? Everybody now does TLS because, well, for one thing,

298
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,729
our, as of what is

299
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,409
as of today, our web browsers

300
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,690
because this isn't coming out for weeks

301
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,239
of

302
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:35,729
July

303
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:36,250
Day.

304
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:41,609
Yeah. As of July 2018, you know, Google Chrome now labels insecure websites

305
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:47,979
or rather labels http websites as insecure now rather than labeling htps as secure

306
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,400
that

307
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,419
-- which
-- is great

308
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:53,950
and it's totally the right way to do it, right. It's one of those things where

309
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:57,469
these small changes are going to have huge impacts.

310
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,380
Yeah.

311
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,179
Yeah.

312
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,539
Um but yeah, no UTF itself is pretty much

313
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,539
I'm not gonna say un hackable, but

314
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,580
as we understand cryptography,

315
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,280
yeah, it's, it's, yeah, you're, you're, you're ok.

316
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,510
And as long as you don't do something totally dumb,

317
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,570
like use UTF and then hand a token over http

318
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,210
-- Yeah. No, you're fine.
-- But that's not even U two F has nothing to do with that.

319
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:21,599
That's just,

320
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,109
that's what, but the thing is U two F only does the authentication. You still,

321
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,750
no, but the thing to remember, right is UTF doesn't exist in a vacuum,

322
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,530
you have to have other stuff wrapped around it.

323
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,809
Right. Like it's not like IUTF and then magically my email works.

324
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,900
The majority of this stuff is being used with a website. So, right.

325
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:39,330
So the website still has to do authentication properly. But

326
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,169
the good news is well as you pointed out and I think you did this presentation where,

327
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:45,780
you know, that's a framework problem. Go use a good framework.

328
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:51,039
That's it. That's just literally go pick one of these like frameworks

329
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,289
that is well known and reliable and they all do authentication

330
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:54,820
proper.

331
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:55,890
Exactly.

332
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,489
Exactly.

333
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:01,700
Well, it's even easier than that. Just don't do off anymore. Right.

334
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,130
Let people log in with Google.

335
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,049
That's,

336
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:05,669
please

337
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:09,390
don't ask for access to all my email and documents. When, when I do do that,

338
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,270
that's a secondary problem.

339
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,989
And, and I,

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,690
I still wish Google had the ability for me to like uncheck those boxes and say yes,

341
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,679
I want to log in,

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,049
but no, I don't want you.

343
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,510
Exactly.

344
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,510
And I love that you can like,

345
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,299
do that on Android now or you can just take away permissions to stuff

346
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,739
and I love it when I start something up.

347
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,070
But it's like, please, sir, can I have access to your location? Like? Nope,

348
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,030
sure can't.

349
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,020
Yeah.

350
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:37,669
Yeah, I mean, I, I get some apps legit needed location

351
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,460
data while I'm using it like

352
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,289
apple maps,

353
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,309
but not like all the time. Like when I'm ordering,

354
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,099
you know, it's a pizza app or whatever.

355
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,739
Yep. Yep. Exactly. Exactly. I love it when web browsers ask for my location.

356
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,710
Just, no, you can't have it. You know, I'm not going to let you

357
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,900
send alerts to my computer either. Right.

358
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,219
People didn't abuse it. It could in theory be really cool. Right.

359
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:03,460
Like, for new sites for, like, weather alerts and stuff.

360
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,979
But no, no, it's going to be used to spam

361
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:05,330
you

362
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,140
totally. And I love that. Like,

363
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,789
80% of the websites I go to ask if I want to enable alerts for this site. And it's like,

364
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,159
yeah.

365
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:13,604
No,

366
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:14,505
-- no,
-- I

367
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,015
100% of people accidentally click. Yes,

368
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,085
-- that's
-- all I can figure. Maybe 10

369
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:19,575
percent.

370
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:21,955
Well, or some bright spark thought it was a good idea.

371
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,005
Pushed it through a committee and then, you know, some poor

372
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,215
had to implement it even though it's like a terrible idea and everybody hates it,

373
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,684
-- like, from a user perspective.
-- Right. Maybe,

374
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:36,354
maybe anyway. Anyway. All right, man. So we, we, we also wanted to talk about air gaps

375
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,054
which are vaguely related to Bluetooth according to you, which I disagree with, but

376
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:42,030
we'll get there.

377
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,469
Well, no, I mean, just in the sense of,

378
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:47,630
I think a lot of people misunderstand what an air gap actually is.

379
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,309
Uh because I mean, you got to remember like air gapping computers.

380
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,429
Well, it used to be the default state. We did not have networks,

381
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:56,130
right? Like

382
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,729
prior to the internet.

383
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,570
Having a computer on a network was

384
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:01,770
pretty rare.

385
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,460
Yeah.

386
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:07,460
Well, I remember, like, all the computers I used as a kid at school, like,

387
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,520
there was no network.

388
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,090
Like what, you know, there was, they were like boss boxes with floppy drives that

389
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,469
they

390
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:12,840
were,

391
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,070
-- that was,
-- you know, we played a local

392
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,419
turtle.

393
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,020
Turtle was the best.

394
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,849
Yeah.

395
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,859
Yeah. But, uh, so, I mean,

396
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:28,000
and then I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about why you would want an air

397
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,900
gap network because I think people always focus

398
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,070
on the being attacked part of air gapping.

399
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,390
But forget about

400
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,909
for a lot of people that air gap, it's actually more about the the data exfiltration

401
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,270
piece than it is about stuff coming in.

402
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,479
Uh I can see it both ways.

403
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,200
I mean, you can argue what was,

404
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,869
what was the name of the virus that ruined the centrifuges?

405
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:50,630
That

406
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,080
was

407
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,020
that you're right.

408
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,270
I was thinking something else anyway, right?

409
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,150
Like that's an instance of going in was clearly more

410
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,659
dangerous than coming out.

411
00:16:59,299 --> 00:16:59,570
But

412
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,710
I feel like it goes both ways.

413
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,380
And

414
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,098
so, so anyway, let's

415
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,569
start at the beginning.

416
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,098
And what is an air gap? What is the intention of an air gap?

417
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,459
-- So
-- the idea behind an air gap network is,

418
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:14,739
is you have a computer or a computer network even

419
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:19,378
that is not attached to any external network,

420
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,368
-- which nowadays is a way to save
-- the internet.

421
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:25,338
Like there's maybe a gap of air between two different networks.

422
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,538
-- Yeah,
-- there's literally ideally no

423
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:33,359
physical link between this computer network and

424
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,640
the general internet or anything attached to the internet,

425
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,170
even if it's all firewalled and everything.

426
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:38,780
Right.

427
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,880
So the idea being that, you know,

428
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,800
some schmuck on the internet literally just cannot touch your network,

429
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,270
right? They would have to physically go to wherever it is

430
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,140
and try to hack it by getting

431
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,819
physical,

432
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:52,520
you know, I was talking to somebody. This is like 100 years ago.

433
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,199
And there are one way network devices

434
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,180
that can go from kind of like the the general internet to

435
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,260
an air gamp network, but they literally can only send data in one direction.

436
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,250
As you can imagine, the challenges here is

437
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,359
you need to build massive redundancy into your protocol because

438
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:12,209
you literally have no idea if a packet gets dropped.

439
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,739
-- And
-- so well, what I've seen actually, and this was like 1520 years ago,

440
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,109
was a device that

441
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,979
it was basically two physical computers sharing a memory,

442
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:22,619
like a physical memory device.

443
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,170
Uh And there was sort of an interlock,

444
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,329
so only one of the computers could read and write to the memory,

445
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,989
the physical memory device at a time.

446
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,140
And then there was a really well defined sort of,

447
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,420
it's just, it's like a file system, right? It's not like a network

448
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,979
thing, it's just like a file system.

449
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,050
And so essentially, you know, it's like,

450
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,189
it's, it's essentially you're sharing like a pad of paper, right?

451
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:47,069
So I hand the pad of paper to you, you, you read it,

452
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,180
you write on it,

453
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,969
you're done,

454
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:51,119
you hand it back to me and then I can read

455
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,150
whatever was previously written on it by myself or by you

456
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,619
and I can erase it and write new stuff.

457
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,209
And so the idea was that way you could transfer files

458
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,969
uh to and from an air gapped network in a very controlled way.

459
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:04,369
And the device also had things like

460
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,270
you could have um like filter, you know,

461
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,459
you had filtering expressions on both sides of what was allowed in and out, right?

462
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:15,000
So like, oh, you know, we're only going to allow like a CS V file with like,

463
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,140
like, you know, 20 characters for first name, 20 characters for last name,

464
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,869
the social insurance number and like what their balance is,

465
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,109
-- you know, things like that kind of, right? So
-- that's interesting.

466
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,930
The device I I learned of here was using fiber optics with the intent being

467
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,790
by using a piece of glass and literally having

468
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,890
the there was no hardware to transmit on the receiving end.

469
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,390
You didn't have to worry about it.

470
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,060
There was literally no way to make that send back across the line at all.

471
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:49,520
And that's where a lot of this comes in is that data exfiltration piece of, you know,

472
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,979
certain types of data

473
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:57,079
are incredibly valuable, not even to a targeted attacker, but just in general

474
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,069
you know,

475
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,900
um, or the,

476
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,849
the data being public could be horrendously embarrassing

477
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,449
to say a government or a company,

478
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,189
you know?

479
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,229
Ok. Well, so, so

480
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,900
the real reason this topic is being discussed is there's a story on

481
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,750
the register about Russia hacking us power plants over air gap networks.

482
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,800
And so this kind of comes back to the idea of

483
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,739
air gaps don't really exist,

484
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,390
right?

485
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,229
There's just

486
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,189
vast and slow networks,

487
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,920
right?

488
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,680
Air gaps are so incredibly painful because for example,

489
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,520
how do you get security updates to your computers?

490
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,560
Now, how do you get antivirus updates to your computer?

491
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:35,699
Now, how do you get any of the data you need to work with, to your computer? Now,

492
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,660
how do you get any of that data out into a reporting system?

493
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,000
So you can generate a nice spreadsheet for your boss every month, right? Like

494
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,239
the whole point.

495
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,930
Generally speaking of computers and data is

496
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,800
to share and mingle the data

497
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,000
to add value to it or to extract value from it.

498
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,469
Right. That's kind of the point. That's why the internet works so well.

499
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:55,060
Right.

500
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,489
And so there's very, very few use cases where you can like live without that,

501
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,109
you know, where you're like, yeah, whatever this thing exists, like you,

502
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,550
you can't have a bank that's offline because like, how,

503
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,469
how would I go get money from my account?

504
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,160
You know? Right. Like

505
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,449
-- it's all sorts of things,
-- you know. However, however,

506
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,579
apparently these power plants were air gapped and they were still hacked.

507
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:19,099
So, in theory and,

508
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,739
and the simple reason for this is because most

509
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,739
of these power plants have really old skater systems,

510
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,280
you know, supervisory control and data acquisition networks.

511
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,420
Most of these network protocols are sold.

512
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,859
They don't have any concept of authentication

513
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:32,400
or even remote security built into them.

514
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,099
Right. They're just

515
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,619
-- like open wide message buses,
-- which is probably why they were air gamp.

516
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:37,680
Yeah.

517
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:38,560
Well, uh no,

518
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,319
the reason they were air gapped originally is because they didn't talk TCP/IP.

519
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,250
Right.

520
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,750
They, again,

521
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,400
it was like the technology is sold and crafty or crafty rather that they

522
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,030
don't talk like what you and I think of as a network protocol,

523
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,849
like they have sort of network protocols, but they're like,

524
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:54,140
meant to be used like within a factory not

525
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:57,589
to have the factory talk to some other system. You know what I mean?

526
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:58,900
Um So no,

527
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,410
the reason they were air gapped originally is because

528
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,030
the technology was just old and crap and,

529
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,589
you know, you can't retrofit this stuff to talk to CP IP.

530
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,829
Well, you can now, but

531
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,089
you probably don't want to.

532
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,579
Well, except you do want to.

533
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:12,880
So you do and then you end up with a sort of, but not really air gap, you know, network

534
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,800
whatever.

535
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,839
Um But even the ones that are still physically air gapped, you know,

536
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:19,560
there's people swapping data around on USB keys

537
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:20,790
or

538
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,270
so you

539
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:21,520
know,

540
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:28,880
what happened is most of the time you've got some sort of technician with a laptop

541
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,810
and he literally unplugs his laptop from

542
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,250
the network over here and then goes and plugs it in to the

543
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,880
Skater system or in some cases they're still connected to the Wi Fi

544
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,420
and then they plug into the Skater system and it's like, you've just, like,

545
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,109
ruined everything, you know.

546
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,810
Well, the problem there is is that a laptop,

547
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:48,849
by definition is smart enough to run some code actively,

548
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:52,449
that the code can be smart enough to like go poke away the skater system and break in.

549
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,670
You know, like for example, if you, well, a better example, no,

550
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,530
that's a terrible example.

551
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,300
USB key I was going to say might be a better example,

552
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,069
but it's actually bad because USB keys again can

553
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,439
cause code execution on the remote system.

554
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,060
Um Same thing even with burned C DS, right?

555
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,900
A lot of air gap networks to transfer data back and forth, they will burn a CD.

556
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,040
Um

557
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,089
because then they feel like, you know, number one, it's easy to verify,

558
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:15,949
right?

559
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,500
Worst case example,

560
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,310
you can actually get a good optical microscope and like look at it.

561
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,390
Um you know, so you can't, well, no, the point is you can't really hide data, right?

562
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,069
It's, it's there or it's not

563
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,540
right. There's not like USB where you got this wonky

564
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,160
control chip that can

565
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,189
potentially be hacked to do things that are weird.

566
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,430
There's also the fact that when you,

567
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,349
when, when a CD is used to traverse a gap,

568
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,709
you're not supposed to ever put it in another computer,

569
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,229
you're supposed to destroy it after the data is copied just in case

570
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,290
somehow

571
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,959
something was copied back on the, the CD, which burnable C DS you can, I mean,

572
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,569
whatever, there's weird stuff you can do.

573
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,369
But, I mean, fundamentally,

574
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:54,869
right.

575
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:56,349
Yeah.

576
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,020
And,

577
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,130
but fundamentally this makes it so painful to use a computer

578
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,800
and the data and whatnot that like almost nobody does it

579
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,750
right? Because generally speaking sharing works,

580
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,790
lets us do things that are useful.

581
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,949
So, and then, then the problem of course is that even if you have,

582
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:15,439
let's assume for a moment you have a properly air gapped network, right?

583
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:17,050
Let, let's just say for the sake of argument,

584
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:19,589
you have a really old computer with no network card,

585
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,510
the serial ports are glued shut, you only have a PS OK.

586
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,780
For those of you that are younger, a PS two port,

587
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,750
it's like a round thing with pins that you plug your keyboard and mouse into.

588
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,469
Uh and let's say it is video out.

589
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,979
So it's like super, you know, old, even with physical access,

590
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:34,310
it would be a pain to get data off of it.

591
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:34,500
Well,

592
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,959
the thing is that computer still does things like probably as a built in speaker,

593
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,910
for example,

594
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,180
you can still make the computer generate like electromagnetic

595
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:45,880
energy and interference by monkeying with the CPU,

596
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,650
for example.

597
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,520
Right.

598
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,390
Uh There's all sorts of secondary channels that are not designed to carry data.

599
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,459
But, you know, for example, if you have a speaker on a computer,

600
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:55,569
you could make a play Morse code

601
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,910
and have another computer. Listen,

602
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,219
there's some group out of like Israel that does

603
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:04,849
all these wacky things with ex filtrating data off of

604
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,650
like,

605
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:05,989
does your

606
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:06,180
computer

607
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:07,180
have a blinking,

608
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,739
does your keyboard have a light on it that can be made to blink by the computer?

609
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:16,050
Like blinking lights and audio? And there's even one that they used like thermal

610
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,310
uh using, using the thermal signatures of the CPU to send

611
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:21,319
data.

612
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,280
It's completely

613
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,229
insane. But again, there's no such thing as an air gap. Like that's the lesson here.

614
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,199
-- Well,
-- that's the problem is to properly air gap, a computer,

615
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:34,729
you also then need to have it in like a tempest, shielded heat shield

616
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,900
-- shield room.
-- Humans are there like humans are the problem

617
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,760
unless you lock the door and don't let anybody in.

618
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,599
Now, your,

619
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:44,180
your

620
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,829
network is useless. But there's at least no people,

621
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,790
people are the problem like this goes back to the fishing problem. Right.

622
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,229
It's all people, people are the problem.

623
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,550
Yeah.

624
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,550
So fundamentally, I think like outside of like about three or four really rabid,

625
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,400
insanely corner corner cases.

626
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,290
Air gapping is,

627
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:02,439
yeah. No, it's,

628
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,560
it's something that will

629
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,859
not so much ultimately fail from a security point of view,

630
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,699
but we just ultimately fail from like trying to do anything useful.

631
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:14,520
Here's the other thing I think about a lot around things like air gaps is so now

632
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,260
if there,

633
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,290
if there's anyone like legitimately from the intelligence community listening,

634
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,020
uh

635
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,609
you're probably laughing at us

636
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,099
and that's fine. That's fine. Right.

637
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,219
But I'm thinking from the context of like a power plant,

638
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:29,520
if, if you, if you have an air gap system, you're going to be lazy

639
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,400
because you're gonna think, oh, nobody can attack this. So I don't care.

640
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,920
I don't have to install security updates.

641
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,689
I don't have to worry about login and passwords. Right.

642
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,069
I don't need any of this stuff.

643
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,560
And so this is a place where I have a suspicion

644
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,609
that having an air gap network is actually far more dangerous than if you just

645
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:46,530
plug the freaking thing into the internet because then at least you'd be like,

646
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,630
oh, crap, it's on the internet.

647
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,719
I need to protect this stuff.

648
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,750
Well, the other problem too is the discipline needed to maintain that air gap when,

649
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,439
you know, like, oh, man, I really want to get this data off this thing quickly.

650
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,310
Ok. You know what? Just plug the laptop into it,

651
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,885
you know, turn the Wi Fi on and just SCP the data out quickly.

652
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:01,875
Don't tell anybody you did.

653
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:02,474
I

654
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:03,895
just plug this

655
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,334
cable in for a few minutes. It'll be fine. Yeah,

656
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,114
exactly.

657
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:10,375
You know, we'll just stick it or we'll use it, you know, like the Stuxnet guys.

658
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:12,395
Oh, we'll just use a USB key. Those things are safe

659
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:13,094
in the

660
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:13,515
parking

661
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,045
lot, you know. It's ok.

662
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:15,564
Yeah.

663
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:17,180
Yeah.

664
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:20,969
Oh, I love that because, well, realistically if you find a random USB key, you,

665
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,810
you have two choices, you either throw in the garbage

666
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,109
-- or you plug it into something and see what's
-- on it.

667
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,949
Normal people plug it in,

668
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:27,180
I

669
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:27,949
guarantee it.

670
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,369
Yeah, because they're nice and normal.

671
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,160
Like, it's like when you find a wallet you open it up to see whose it is.

672
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,770
Not because you want to rob them. But like, oh, there's a driver's license here.

673
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,150
Great.

674
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,760
-- You know, or you give it to the cops or whatever.
-- Right.

675
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,229
Right. Right. You know,

676
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:42,689
I, I, um, sort of, I don't know

677
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:43,564
when I find

678
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:43,944
a

679
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:44,724
set of

680
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,135
keys,

681
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:50,545
I find a USB key on the ground and I, I feel like I've actually never found one on.

682
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,954
What is this? I want to know what's on it.

683
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:53,724
And of course,

684
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,385
unfortunately my better sense always tells me to throw it away and I always do

685
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,015
but like, there's a part of me that

686
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:01,314
it's, it's like the forbidden fruit.

687
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:04,854
-- Where are you
-- finding all these random USB keys, like, at conferences or something?

688
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:08,405
-- I don't find lots of them. Um, I find quite a few.
-- I never found

689
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:08,675
one.

690
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,810
Uh, lots of hotels. If you walk around hotels, you just for whatever reason.

691
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:17,430
Find a lot of USB keys, especially if you're near, if there's like public terminals,

692
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,239
there's

693
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,979
quite often they're already plugged in there

694
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,319
that where people, like, plug them in and leave

695
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:26,770
and, and again, it's like, they're like the forbidden

696
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,640
-- because
-- they went and got like, like a $2 USB key to get that one

697
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,239
file off their computer so they could print it or whatever.

698
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,430
And I've actually done that before too where I've,

699
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:38,250
I've gotten a USB key just for that reason where, like,

700
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,109
I copy a file onto it and then I bring it to the hotel

701
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,979
business computer and then I,

702
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,880
I print it and then I throw the USB key away because I'm like,

703
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,790
I'm never using this again.

704
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,369
Well, you know, the reality is like USB devices can trivially

705
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:52,859
be

706
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,969
any public computer. Who knows what that thing is? Right.

707
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,609
I, I know I, every time I see someone checking their email in a public computer,

708
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:03,160
I just want to, like,

709
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,630
grab them by the shoulders and shake them and scream what is wrong with you?

710
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,910
-- Like, every
-- time, you know, it's like licking soup off the floor,

711
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,479
it's worse than that.

712
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,839
It's, uh, oh, my goodness.

713
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,819
I, because like the thought of lifting soup off the floor while really gross,

714
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,849
-- appalls me less than using a public
-- computer soup

715
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:23,439
-- off the floor at an airport.
-- Uh, that, that would be pretty bad.

716
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:26,880
But I'm still, I'm thinking I would still, I would still do that before.

717
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,459
I would check my email on a public computer. I'm not going to lie to you.

718
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:33,130
Like I would do that first because at least looking soup off the floor,

719
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,949
I'm pretty comfortable understanding what's going to happen to me

720
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,900
using that public computer. I have no idea.

721
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,030
It's too many unknowns.

722
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,770
Oh,

723
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,579
man.

724
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,229
So,

725
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,069
I guess the moral of the story is it's ok that you

726
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,229
soup off the floor as long as you don't use public computers.

727
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,349
Anyway.

728
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:57,160
I, I probably set myself up for that.

729
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,140
So

730
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,050
