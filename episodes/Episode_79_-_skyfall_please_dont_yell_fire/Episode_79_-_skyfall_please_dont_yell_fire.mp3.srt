Hello and welcome to episode 79 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,300
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,189
I don't even know which thing to start with today. Kurt.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,800
It's

4
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:18,790
for the best part is the world's on fake fire. Now.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,639
It's,

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,360
yeah, that's,

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,704
you know, yeah, let, let's start there. Let's start with Skyfall.

8
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:26,305
So there was a,

9
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,944
well, there was something called meltdown, which happened,

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:33,544
which you may have heard of where, where something affected, like most of the,

11
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,505
the CP US on the planet,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,610
anything

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,419
less than 10 years old. Basically,

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,909
most of them

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,409
-- cost more than $10.
-- Right?

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,860
Turns out that was kind of bad.

17
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,069
And

18
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,490
what happened shortly afterwards is kind of

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,069
a website appeared called the Skyfall Attack.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,130
I mean, what is called Skyfall attack.com is where it ended up and it kind of said,

21
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,069
you know, stay tuned, watch this space.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,430
There's another attack coming and, and I remember

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,990
I talked to a handful of people about this and they were like,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,790
this has got to be fake and I said

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,540
it, it probably is, but it's still something we should pay attention to.

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,279
And I think also

27
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:13,959
there are going to be a whole bunch of attacks now on CPU timing

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,069
that

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,959
we need to be mindful. Now, this one did come out really fast.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,480
But anyway,

31
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:22,279
what it turns out it was basically a scam and some guy did it and he was like, oh ha ha,

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,300
look at me, everybody.

33
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:26,040
I I put together a fake page to trick you. Aren't I clever?

34
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,300
-- I
-- think
-- what he was trying to get it is he did like, what was it like two comments in the,

35
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:29,879
in the

36
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:31,800
comment section of the register and like one

37
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:33,470
or two tweets that were kind of anonymous.

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,690
And on the one hand, I mean, this is also happening in journalism now, right?

39
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,809
Where the problem is that first to publish thing and you know,

40
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,779
it used to be that you had a couple of hours to

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,610
research and write a story or even a couple of days,

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,430
but now it's like

43
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,709
you have to break the story inside of 15 minutes or somebody else will, you know.

44
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,379
And so especially in tech, right? Like especially in tech.

45
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,919
And so yeah, you don't have time to like verify this and validate this and,

46
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,379
and even if you try, you know, the guy is non responsive.

47
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,739
So what do you do? Right.

48
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:08,095
But here's the thing, man, this isn't, there's a website, right?

49
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,414
And all you have to say is I found this website, look what's on it.

50
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,595
It's not about validating or anything.

51
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:14,804
Even in additionally,

52
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,914
if you're a good security researcher and you have something private,

53
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,934
which mind you, you shouldn't make a website like this,

54
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:24,110
but you're not going to talk about what you've got, even if people catch wind of it.

55
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:24,539
Right?

56
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,380
And, and so like my first reaction when I found out this was a scam was like,

57
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,059
this is yelling fire in a theater is what this was like.

58
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,020
This is not OK in any universe because

59
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,270
the world was on edge because of me

60
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:43,235
and you, like you grabbed on to the fear and confusion

61
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:47,854
and you, you ran with it and like that's not, that's not a social experiment.

62
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:49,735
Like you're just a big jerk.

63
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:53,434
What the outcome of that experiment is is that some people will panic.

64
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:56,634
Some people dismiss it, some people will try and figure out more and waste time

65
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,720
and it's just kind of a dick move.

66
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:03,070
Um And see what really frustrates me is, is the reality is in security.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,520
There's typically like there are some big

68
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:08,619
well known entities like Google Project Zero, you know,

69
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,830
that come out with good stuff,

70
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,139
but there are occasionally completely random people who

71
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,720
come out with a really good flaw,

72
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,570
you know, like http Poxy is my favorite example.

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,619
It's a bunch of guys in New Zealand that, right? I think it was point of sale software,

74
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,529
right? They, they and they were like, what the heck?

75
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,570
Like what do we do with this, we need some help and you know, we helped them and it was,

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,449
it turned out, ok.

77
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,729
But

78
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,839
so there is

79
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,190
the case of just completely random people finding horrible things

80
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:35,339
that does happen. And that's,

81
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:38,800
you know, and if that didn't happen, then this would be really easy to dismiss,

82
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,000
right?

83
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,080
Because it would be like, oh, well, it's not from this list of trusted people. So

84
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,160
ignore it.

85
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,960
-- But hey,
-- man, you know what, you know what a better example is even is Dan Kaminsky.

86
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,220
I

87
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,149
mean, Dan was kind of known before he broke the internet with DNS,

88
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,940
but like after that, everybody knows Dan now

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,240
and, and that's a great example of, and, you know, granted Dan did everything right.

90
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,339
That could have been done, right?

91
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,259
I mean, it, it was, that was a tough one. But, yeah. No, no, I, I agree completely.

92
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,809
I think,

93
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,610
I think pretending lone wolf type researchers can't contribute

94
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:11,860
massive research would be a foolish attitude to have.

95
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,839
-- And so anyone who writes off something like
-- that for the

96
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:16,059
year.

97
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,940
Yeah. Absolutely.

98
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,029
Right. Right.

99
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:19,858
You know,

100
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,640
and um, and, and the reality is like,

101
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,429
we have a society that

102
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,679
largely runs on trust.

103
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,429
So like my favorite example is I go to the bank to say pay my credit card bill with

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,880
money because I have a credit card with a

105
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,589
bank that I can't do electronic transfers easily to.

106
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:41,109
So I have to be like some 19 nineties stone age person and actually bring them money

107
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:45,540
and I hand the teller. Yeah, cash. So I, I bring a pile of cash to the bank.

108
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:46,549
Hand it to the lady

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,540
and I get like a tiny little receipt

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,420
but

111
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,089
like, I don't know if she faked the entry and printed it off herself,

112
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,100
but it's never been a problem. Right.

113
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,720
Like when you go to the bank and you give them a pile of money,

114
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:02,190
it like always ends up in your account. It doesn't just go missing.

115
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:02,630
So

116
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,970
actually I, I have, I have a fun story about that too is I was uh,

117
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,480
I think we spoke some time ago where I,

118
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,940
I help out with the concession stand at my son's swim team

119
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,059
and we had a big meet this weekend

120
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,859
and

121
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:16,559
I,

122
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,720
at one point I brought uh $1000 in twenties in

123
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,019
to break into change because we were selling lots of stuff

124
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,140
and, you know, I go in and get my stuff and they, they brought out the,

125
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,100
the rolled up or the, the, what is it?

126
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:32,459
The banded, like stacks of bills where it's like $50 in one,

127
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,559
for example.

128
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,269
And I had,

129
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:34,630
you

130
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:34,859
don't have

131
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,260
coins for

132
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:35,679
once.

133
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,019
I

134
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,890
know we have those terrible bills. But anyway,

135
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:44,010
uh the lady gives them to me and says, do you want me to count them? And I'm like, no,

136
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:47,709
even if we're a couple dollars short, like it's totally not worth anyone's time,

137
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,890
but at the same time

138
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,920
I totally get a bank having that attitude of,

139
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,359
if you want to double check us and you don't trust us implicitly, it's ok.

140
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,760
Yeah.

141
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah. And that's, and that makes the world efficient.

142
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,859
It makes the world work, you know?

143
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,820
Yeah. Right.

144
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:04,839
Anything else?

145
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,070
I mean,

146
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,160
if you had to validate and verify every single

147
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,760
transaction you have in life with everybody and everything,

148
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,570
it would be so time consuming.

149
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,600
You know. Isn't that what the blockchains for?

150
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:16,149
Well,

151
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,720
yeah, but even then you still need people just not to rip you off.

152
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,119
Right.

153
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:23,484
No, I, I agree completely. You know, it's one of those things.

154
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,904
Well, my favorite is like when you return stuff to a store,

155
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:29,274
most stores you literally like Costco is my favorite example.

156
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,244
You bring something to Costco that they may or may not have sold in the

157
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:36,095
last 10 years and you don't have the receipt and they don't even have like,

158
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,885
because they'll have the electronic record of it, right.

159
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:38,964
Hooked up to your card.

160
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,035
But even if they can't find that nine times out of 10,

161
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,885
they'll return it and give you your cash,

162
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:49,470
right? Because they know that like 99% of people aren't there to rip them off

163
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,149
and there's always going to be that 1%. But I also have a suspicion that the 1%

164
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,790
of we'll say nefarious people

165
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:05,299
if, if you service the the 99% the benefits far outweigh the negatives of that 1%.

166
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,899
But actually

167
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,359
this is, this is a good lesson for security also is as humans,

168
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:13,079
we love to obsess over the very small group

169
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,630
and, and what they are or aren't doing and,

170
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,790
and we ignore the huge group to our detriment.

171
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,470
Right.

172
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,899
Yeah. No, it's, um, so, so fundamentally, I mean, we

173
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,799
to have an efficient society, you have to have as little friction as possible,

174
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:30,079
right?

175
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:30,839
As little,

176
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,769
you know,

177
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,000
extra work as possible. Right?

178
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,700
And so, you know, you look at what journalists do

179
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,970
and they, you know, they'll make their best effort.

180
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,730
Uh but the, the ever common quote of, you know, we reached out to so and so,

181
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,950
but they could not provide a comment by the time, you know,

182
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,279
the story went online or whatever, right?

183
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,380
Because, you know,

184
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,769
they can't sit on this thing for 12 hours or 24 hours

185
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,880
or a week waiting for some guy to get back to them.

186
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,899
Oh, yeah.

187
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,970
No, no, I know, I know, man, I've, in fact, I've,

188
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,730
I've been in that situation where the one where,

189
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,529
where a reporter will send an email and be like, I,

190
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,109
if you can get back to me in the next 30 minutes,

191
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,359
you know, I read the email two hours after they sent it,

192
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,040
sorry guys,

193
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:09,579
but I

194
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,470
get it and I suppose they, they blast out, you know, send 50 emails,

195
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,350
hopefully four people get it in time.

196
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:15,829
I

197
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,369
-- get it. I
-- mean, the reporters on a dead,

198
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,549
they don't have a week to wait or a day.

199
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,279
But, um, so anyways back to this guy crying fire, it's like the reality is, yeah,

200
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,779
that,

201
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,329
that will work

202
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,119
for at least some small group of people will get upset

203
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,059
about it and try and figure out what's going on.

204
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,840
Um, and so, yeah, we know the result of what that experiment.

205
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,359
Like, I've often thought of doing like an April fools joke with a CV assignment.

206
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,320
And then I'm like, you know what?

207
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,750
No, because I'm gonna literally waste thousands,

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,859
if not tens of thousands of hours of people's time

209
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,940
and that's a dick move.

210
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:46,510
Yeah,

211
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,419
I absolutely, man. I, in fact, I hate April fools in general for that reason

212
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,580
is you just end up creating a bunch of stupidity.

213
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,700
And I, I think it's a weekend this year. Thank goodness, I don't have to work.

214
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,229
But yeah,

215
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:03,539
like I hate April fools because there's just so much stupidity going on and I waste

216
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:06,940
half my day trying to figure out is this real or is this not real?

217
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,719
And, and let's face it. Most of this stuff isn't even funny.

218
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,130
And, and that's what I think of what this guy, like what was proven here.

219
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:13,950
There

220
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,299
was

221
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,080
for some reason, we picked an

222
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,489
un,

223
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,010
an un embargo date of April 1st was picked for some major issue and it was just like,

224
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,849
oh man,

225
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,369
in hindsight, that was a really bad idea.

226
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,789
Or didn't Gmail debut on April 1st?

227
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,369
Remember like back then most online email providers gave you like

228
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,080
10 megabytes of space and Gmail says here's a gigabyte.

229
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,570
We're like, what? No, that's not real.

230
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,190
-- So
-- yeah, no, I mean,

231
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:44,590
yeah, I mean, if you want to waste people's time, you, you can definitely do that.

232
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,869
There, there's so many ways to grief and waste people's time. You know, you could

233
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:52,380
spray paint, bus stops or throw rocks at cars or yell

234
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,320
bomb in a crowded environment or at the airport.

235
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,200
You know, and

236
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,549
if you do that in the airport, man, you're going,

237
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,739
you'll be eating through a straw for a long time, I think.

238
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,950
Well, and see, that's part of the thing too is typically people don't do this

239
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,820
stupidity because there are consequences,

240
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,429
you know.

241
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,640
Um,

242
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,619
and that's part of the challenge with this online

243
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,369
thing is there's really no consequences for this,

244
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,539
this guy who did this stupid thing other than, you know,

245
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,059
we all kind of grumble about him and,

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,840
um, I can't even be bothered to find his name, but,

247
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,440
you know, and I don't think public shaming is the way to go.

248
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,739
I'm all for public shaming actually.

249
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:30,729
Well, it's

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:30,849
a

251
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:31,090
slippery

252
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:31,979
-- slope
-- and

253
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,890
there's that really good ted talk, talking about the online shaming and how,

254
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,700
you know, first of all, did we get the right guy

255
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
uh in, in this particular instance, we, we know exactly who it was.

256
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,340
The person's commented in public

257
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,700
and I, I don't remember their name and the website's down actually now,

258
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,960
so I can't look it up.

259
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,349
But, but like this is one of those instances

260
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,140
I think,

261
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:58,219
and, and, and this came up in a side conversation I had the other day was

262
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,570
not using people's names when they behave poorly,

263
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,739
encourages poor behavior because they know they're going to have a

264
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,880
certain amount of anonymity and protection from making terrible decisions.

265
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,450
And like, this is an example of

266
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,770
a competent, reasonable human being made a terrible decision.

267
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,099
Even with that though there's some challenges because there's other people

268
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:20,150
with the same name who had nothing to do with this.

269
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,510
Right.

270
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,650
There was a Reddit thread about this kind of stuff a while ago where it was like,

271
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,890
you know, people have read it

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,130
who share a name with like, somebody who's done something terrible.

273
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,739
What's that like? And this guy is like,

274
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,619
you know, when you Google my name, the first result is this guy who has the same name,

275
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,669
he's in the same state.

276
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,809
He kind of looks like me

277
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,950
and it's like some terrible, like child molester, some, you know,

278
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,280
something that's just not at all socially acceptable.

279
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,549
And he's like, every time I apply for a job,

280
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,659
I have to go through this whole thing to like, prove that that's not me.

281
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,140
I do feel bad for people in that situation.

282
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,539
And I guess

283
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,179
that is one of those examples of

284
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,900
sometimes when you have a functional society that isn't

285
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,619
completely bonkers in terms of identification of people,

286
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,659
you're going to have this and granted it's easy for

287
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,859
me to say this is OK because it's not me.

288
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:17,000
But even if it was me, I feel like

289
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,450
this is an example of

290
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,479
AAA functional civilized society

291
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:27,039
is just going to have this problem and you sometimes have to deal with it.

292
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,469
Well, this is why I learned that, you know, the, the,

293
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,679
the internet trope of Florida man does Xy and Z

294
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,179
the reason for that is that Florida is one

295
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,750
of the states that has open reporting laws around,

296
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,419
you know, uh criminal reports, like a lot of states,

297
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,739
criminal reports and whatnot are private, they're not public.

298
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,820
And so the reality is, I think this is probably happening everywhere.

299
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,489
It's just Florida is one of the states where as a reporter,

300
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,909
you can go to like a website and like search for funny things.

301
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:53,510
And

302
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:54,010
not only

303
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:54,419
that,

304
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,609
I think part of it as well is Florida is a place that attracts a lot

305
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:04,719
of people because it has plenty of opportunity and it has a very unique economy.

306
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,690
And so I have a suspicion between the open records laws

307
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,010
and the fact that just lots of random, like nobody's from Florida, right?

308
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,960
Everyone moves there.

309
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:14,830
And so you just

310
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,210
crazy hodgepodge like who's legitimately born and lives in Florida.

311
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,169
He was

312
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:20,400
born,

313
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,309
he left,

314
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,109
-- he left.
-- But no, no, no, no, no, no. You, you have to stay there. Right.

315
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,630
Because everyone born there leaves.

316
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:27,799
Right.

317
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,270
That's my point. Right.

318
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,409
Nobody's from Florida who lives in Florida.

319
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:36,130
You either move in or you're born there and you get out like, it's hilarious.

320
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:37,820
Yeah. So, I, I don't know.

321
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,030
I mean, to me there's, there's, we know the result of this experiment.

322
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,210
It's not going to be very surprising. It's

323
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,059
the part of the question is like, how do we sort of defend against this?

324
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,969
And I mean, the good news is, is there's not,

325
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,349
I mean,

326
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:51,770
the downside to this is kind of like the spam problem in

327
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,530
that a lot of people's time gets a little bit wasted,

328
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:54,690
right?

329
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,789
Nobody actually dies from this or has, you know, like a truly epically bad day.

330
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,750
But, you know,

331
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,349
a bunch of people wasted thousands if not tens

332
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,869
of thousands of hours dealing with the skyfall attack,

333
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,590
talking to their manager about it, you know,

334
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,469
calming, ruffled feathers, blah, blah, blah. Right.

335
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,630
And just, you know,

336
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,909
that does add up. It's like the spam problem.

337
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,419
We get these every single day. It, it does become a real problem

338
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,440
actually. That's really interesting.

339
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:20,789
I bet

340
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:25,260
if you're a business and you spent time on skyfall,

341
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,440
you could probably make a legitimate case to sue this guy

342
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:33,719
because he deliberately wasted your time and caused you direct monetary damage.

343
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,559
I mean, let's face it. This was fraud essentially, right? Like

344
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:38,630
you, you are.

345
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:39,419
That's a I,

346
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,469
I, well, ok, so definitely on the one hand,

347
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,229
the men's rea like he admitted to it in public, right?

348
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:48,799
He admitted the intent of what he did in public, which

349
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,330
I mean,

350
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,179
I believe that's the third rule of felony.

351
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,059
So I've decided now there's three rules around felonies.

352
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,729
Rule number one around for committing a felony is don't film it

353
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,989
right? Apparently people do that. Not a good idea.

354
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:02,539
Number two, don't talk about the felony to strangers,

355
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,909
seriously, folks

356
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,239
or to anyone.

357
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,630
And number three

358
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,679
is like, don't admit,

359
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,280
I guess number two A or whatever it is don't admit to the felony in public

360
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,200
and with intent

361
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,390
because like, yeah,

362
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:20,299
this makes a court case relatively like here's a printout of his tweet,

363
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,669
uh his tweets, sir.

364
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,770
Oh, ok. Well, there we go. You know,

365
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,890
like,

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,010
uh

367
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:29,320
so and again, we're not trying to give tips and tricks to criminals,

368
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,419
but I just feel like some people are so fundamentally

369
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,659
like, oh, it just blows my, it's like the tide pod thing.

370
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,000
Seriously. What,

371
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,049
what

372
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,059
like as a parent with small Children,

373
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,059
-- they're not small.
-- You know what

374
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,989
I've been thinking about this a lot because you told

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,960
me the other day we should talk about tide pods.

376
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,580
And I thought, how can I do anything other than just say like these people are idiots,

377
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,580
but here's the thing. I got to thinking about this and

378
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,840
I don't think they're the smartest people in the

379
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,760
-- world who might be doing that
-- by definition.

380
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,770
If you eat laundry detergent, that's not a

381
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,109
smart

382
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,799
-- thing
-- to get to that. We'll get to that.

383
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:07,679
So if you're listening and you've done the Tide Pod Challenge, uh by all means,

384
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,030
send me your video, I'd love to

385
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,239
see it.

386
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,340
But

387
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,080
I, I'm encouraging you, please. If you please please, people don't, don't do this.

388
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,440
And so here's the thing, right? Is

389
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,239
this feels like it's probably not very risky because let's face it.

390
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,520
When you were a kid. Did you get your mouth washed out with soap by your parents?

391
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:24,760
I totally did

392
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,469
so

393
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:26,739
right.

394
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,520
You say a naughty word or something and all of a sudden you've got,

395
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,049
you get in your mouth washed out with soap to teach you a lesson

396
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:36,090
and like it's not pleasant but it's not the end of the world.

397
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:41,659
And so I remember like soap isn't very good, but like I didn't die. It wasn't that bad.

398
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,770
And I feel like people probably have a similar view where they're thinking, OK,

399
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,880
so this is just soap.

400
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,049
I can put it in my mouth and I can bite down on it and

401
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,400
like orange goo flows out of my mouth and we all get a laugh,

402
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,979
we film it and then I spit it out

403
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,909
except that's not what happens because apparently

404
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,010
the chemicals inside give you like terrible

405
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,539
burns in your mouth and you probably need medical attention after you do this.

406
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,598
Well, it reminds me of the ice bucket challenge, right?

407
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,719
If you do the ice bucket with actually just like a bucket of ice,

408
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,819
yeah, you're, it's uncomfortable but you're probably not going to die.

409
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,069
But then the problem is of course, like any online prank me stupidity type thing,

410
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,880
people escalate.

411
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,040
Right?

412
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,819
Because you got to do bigger, better to get the views, you know, than the last person.

413
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:25,118
And so that one guy did die from the ice bucket challenge because he used

414
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,250
like an excavator or something stupid to dump a huge load of water on him.

415
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,189
I did not hear about that, but I am not surprised even a little bit.

416
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,050
Yeah.

417
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:36,310
You know, well, the reality is people die in all sorts of ways.

418
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,069
Like, so like I, my favorite is that British phrase,

419
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,250
death due to misadventure as an actual legal cause of death.

420
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,170
Oh, yeah. I, I like to say, uh, poor decisions, make good stories

421
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:51,829
-- if you live to tell the tale that
-- that is true.

422
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,359
And luckily I've, I've made it through all of my poor decisions so far.

423
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,170
But, but so, so anyway, here's, here's my point about this, right is I think

424
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,930
when as a human,

425
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:04,530
we evaluate risk constantly throughout our day

426
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,329
and we make decisions all the time about

427
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,109
Cleveland Crossing, the street has a certain level of risk, right?

428
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,160
Eating at a restaurant carries a certain level of risk. And I think

429
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,689
biting down

430
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,449
on laundry detergent

431
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,849
feels like it's probably

432
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:18,199
a

433
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,979
little risky, but not too bad when the reality is,

434
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:24,869
it's significantly worse than we think it is because

435
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,229
we're not dealing with chemicals in that thing.

436
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,199
We're used to,

437
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,359
we're thinking hand soap or bar soap. Right.

438
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:31,819
Well,

439
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:32,640
we're used to.

440
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,150
So,

441
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,339
and I guess people think, hey, this stuff's fine on my skin. Ok.

442
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,449
How bad can it be in my mouth? And the answer is

443
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,780
quite bad.

444
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,459
Really?

445
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,900
It's not normal soap, right. This isn't normal soap.

446
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,530
And I, I have a feeling or even laundry detergent, man.

447
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,530
I mean, well, now that I think about it,

448
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,239
you're right because this soap is contained in a little pod that when you,

449
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,500
even if you do touch it,

450
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,949
you're not touching it.

451
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,380
Right. Right.

452
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,160
You know,

453
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:59,699
-- and,
-- and I, how, how often do you touch laundry detergent? I touch it all the time.

454
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:00,719
-- Like it's in
-- my,

455
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,160
yeah, I have a scoop and I, I get,

456
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,780
I get the powder on my hands every time I use a scoop and then you know what I do,

457
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,589
I just kind of brush it off and in the machine and I go wash my hands and no big deal.

458
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,500
Well, and I think that's part of the challenges is there's a lot of risks that

459
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,599
they evolve over time.

460
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:22,209
Like a great example being the risk of being online, it used to be,

461
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,680
you could plug a computer in online

462
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,319
and

463
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,030
nothing too terrible would happen. Or you could open up,

464
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,800
remember when you could open up email attachments

465
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,439
safely as long as it wasn't like a dot exe or a dot Bat.

466
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,140
And

467
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:35,819
it

468
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,410
was it, I love you.

469
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,000
That was the first virus that was like people would send an

470
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,589
email saying if you get an email with the subject of,

471
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,140
I love you.

472
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,550
Don't, don't open it.

473
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:48,119
And the virus was actually the warning email

474
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,839
because there was no, I love you virus.

475
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,520
But the problem is like,

476
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,760
if something evolves at 5% a year, that means it's completely different inside of,

477
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,130
uh, what's rule of 72 roughly 14 years

478
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,750
or less. Right. Exactly. You know,

479
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,020
um, or even within five or 10 years, it's evolved so much that we, you know,

480
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,270
like the flu every year a new strain comes out and

481
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,290
unfortunately you got to go get a new flu shot.

482
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,359
Well,

483
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,040
a

484
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,400
good example of that because this year, I guess the flu shot is highly ineffective.

485
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:17,709
The

486
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,770
-- wrong
-- strains.

487
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,510
-- Right. I got the stupid flu shot for nothing is what that means.
-- Exactly.

488
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,660
Um, but yeah, so going back to this, the problem is these like,

489
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,900
soap is a great example, right?

490
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,989
Soap used to be real simple. It's ash

491
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,709
and fat

492
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,599
and lie.

493
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,869
Right. That's, that's basically soap, you know, in a nutshell.

494
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:35,890
Right. Well,

495
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:40,699
-- well, funny. Enough. Lye is like, super dangerous too.
-- Well, no, sorry, I was wrong.

496
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,640
It's just ash

497
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,849
and fat

498
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:46,040
is the minimum. The bare minimum you need to make functional soap.

499
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,910
Right. It won't be good soap, but it will be soap.

500
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:49,640
Right.

501
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:50,400
And, you know,

502
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,280
so soap went from something that basically you could eat but it tastes bad to,

503
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,239
you know, now something that's, yeah, full of chemicals.

504
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,920
Highly

505
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,439
concentrated,

506
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,949
you know. And, um,

507
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,180
like, yeah, I mean, the amount of liquid detergent I put in, in a load of laundry.

508
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:07,680
Now, it's like a tiny, tiny amount. It's crazy,

509
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,079
you know. So I'm pretty sure I don't want to drink that blue stuff.

510
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,500
Um,

511
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:12,569
you know.

512
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,250
Oh, and here's the best thing I just noticed the other day,

513
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:21,400
uh, G two Gatorade. The blue flavor is the exact same shade of blue as Windex. I had

514
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:21,689
a,

515
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,939
I had the two bottles sitting on the kitchen counter and I was like, oh, they're,

516
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,819
they're the exact same color

517
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:30,650
or what is? There's, there's a, uh, a floor cleaner. Fabu

518
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:34,500
Loso, I think it's called that has like pictures of fruit on it and it's,

519
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,390
it's orange and red and in very fruity colors

520
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,520
and I guess they do have problems at poison control

521
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,180
where Children drink it all the time because it,

522
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:43,930
it looks like

523
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,369
fruit on it. It must be

524
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,660
one of my kids tried to grab a ch beer out of the downstairs fridge and I was like, no,

525
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,859
that's not cherry Cola

526
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:52,300
you can pick

527
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:53,160
up kid.

528
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,119
Yeah.

529
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,260
You know, but it was like it had,

530
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,790
-- it had pictures of cherries on it. The
-- soda's gone bad. Daddy.

531
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,869
Yeah.

532
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,410
But, uh, no, I mean, and that's the problem. Right?

533
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,109
Is this, you know, I remember as a kid, laundry detergent was pretty boring.

534
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,469
And, yeah,

535
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:09,949
it wasn't like you had to dump huge amounts of it in to get your clothes clean

536
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:14,209
and you know, now you, you put in a tiny amount and your clothes are super clean.

537
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,670
Um So yeah, I don't know, it's,

538
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:23,790
but so back to the, the the the fire yelling fire in a crowded theater analogy. Like

539
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,209
uh do we, how do we defend against this? And, and or even do we need to defend against?

540
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,390
I

541
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,750
kind of,

542
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,729
yeah, because I kind of think about the reality is this happens so rarely,

543
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,760
you know,

544
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,989
that do we actually really need to spend a whole bunch of time dealing with this?

545
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,479
Right? And I mean,

546
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,359
as much as I would love to say,

547
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,400
all of the bases need to be covered and we

548
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,219
need systems and technology to keep us perfectly secure.

549
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:49,449
And it's the only way like

550
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:55,099
a significant amount of society security relies upon humans being decent people.

551
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,680
And like this is one of them, it's the only real solution.

552
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,319
But again, this is where I think

553
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:03,189
things like shaming these people is important because it shows

554
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:06,050
there are negative consequences for doing things like this.

555
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,439
Right.

556
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,079
Yeah, like, locally, uh, two years ago, yeah, two years ago now

557
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,839
we had somebody who went around

558
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,079
and I guess they think they were using a slingshot or something

559
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,979
and they, like, were firing marbles or whatever at bus stops, you know, which have,

560
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:25,479
like, the glass panels and breaking them and they did this to, like, 80 bus stops.

561
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:26,869
Right. That's,

562
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,069
that's a pretty considerable cost,

563
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:30,969
you know?

564
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,500
And fundamentally, yeah, it's just, it's, it's

565
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,709
just,

566
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,130
yeah, why?

567
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,010
It's just stupid vandalism that has absolutely no upside, I guess,

568
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,810
unless you're the guy making those glass panels and selling them

569
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,439
to the city or to the transit corporation

570
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:46,000
who

571
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:46,959
owns those things.

572
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,530
There's some idiotic economic theory called the broken window

573
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,989
and the idea being someone breaks a window, you have to pay to fix the window,

574
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,739
which pays, you know, and there's all this

575
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:58,459
economic

576
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,349
activity

577
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,250
which actually I think, I think a real economist proved that was nonsense.

578
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:03,829
But

579
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,540
you,

580
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,939
you do create economic activity but it's wasted.

581
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,500
It's a net negative. Right.

582
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,170
Well, fundamentally, if we wanted to create economic activity,

583
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,699
we would ban bulldozers and make people do use shovels

584
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,479
that would literally solve unemployment overnight. Except

585
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,390
I literally wouldn't be able to afford to build anything anymore

586
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,250
minor details. Uh,

587
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,640
yeah. Well, well, funny enough. No, no, you could afford.

588
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,160
Well, it's complicated because

589
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:29,000
I,

590
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:30,030
there's

591
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:30,650
minimum

592
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,160
wage. Well, it has to be less than that.

593
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,380
So there's this historic house, uh, I went to,

594
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,119
you know, they decorated at Christmas and they've got, like,

595
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,449
their big thing is like Charles Dickens, a Christmas carol and they have people,

596
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:47,329
like, dressed up in, in character and, and it's fun.

597
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,520
Right. It's neat to go see and that kind of stuff. And I really like it because

598
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,069
it has like, an electricity museum, lab thing.

599
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,849
Hands on type stuff for the kids in the basement because it was

600
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,599
one of the first houses to have electricity back in the day.

601
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:02,780
Uh It was all DC. It's really fascinating talking to the people

602
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,099
because it was like the power plant was 50 ft away and it was DC driven by the river

603
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,790
and, and yeah, like they, they said that like

604
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,670
the only way they knew if the power was working is the

605
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,000
guy who ran the plant had a light bulb he would look at

606
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,829
and if the light bulb was too dim,

607
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,780
he knew to like turn the power up and if the light bulb was too bright,

608
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,170
you should turn the power down.

609
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,819
And then,

610
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,969
you know, in fairness,

611
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,489
it's not like our IOT monitoring for skater stuff has gotten that much better.

612
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,910
That's true. It's amazing.

613
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:35,319
Anyway. Anyway, so here's, here's my point though. Right? Is

614
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,709
they,

615
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,219
they were going on and on and talking about how the guy who did

616
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,954
the woodwork in the house and it took him to two years to do,

617
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:42,785
the woodwork was paid a dollar a day,

618
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:46,104
which was significantly above the going wage at the time.

619
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:48,464
And I, I, like, I did the math.

620
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:53,645
It was like it today, it's something like $15 a day. And I'm like,

621
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:59,954
-- what, who would work for a day for $15?
-- Well, and especially skilled work.

622
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:03,354
Like, I've, I've, I've tried doing, like, wood joining

623
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:04,305
and

624
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,665
the reality is I can't,

625
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,030
it's very hard to do. Well, yes.

626
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:08,349
Oh,

627
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,989
it's basically impossible because if you're out by even like 1/10 of a millimeter,

628
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,630
you either got a huge gap or the pieces are like sticking out.

629
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,739
Uh, no. What, what you actually do is

630
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:19,969
so I own an old

631
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,660
house. I do, I do a lot of woodwork. No. No, you don't use wood filler.

632
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,400
You purposely cut things a little large. Well, this is, this is on site.

633
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,719
If you're in the shop, it's easier to do proper measurements.

634
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:31,069
But like when you're on site you make sure you cut it too big

635
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,109
and you carry a hand planer in a file in your pocket

636
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:35,060
and then you

637
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,880
constantly adjust as you're fitting it together.

638
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,140
I've done that where I basically cut a piece,

639
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,640
take it back out to the garage and like to shave off half a blade's length.

640
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:49,890
Take it back in wiggle it. Not quite yet shave off another half blade,

641
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,589
you know, not, not just that I actually, some of the hand tools.

642
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,410
If you have decent hand tools, it's,

643
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:00,010
you can get away with some impressive quality

644
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,890
and,

645
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,810
and, like, shaving off a little bit

646
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:03,729
is easy.

647
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,839
I went to buy a shoulder plane because I have to, um,

648
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:09,880
my parents' cabin is settled a bit so the back door is, like, really sticky.

649
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,760
Uh, basically I got to take like two millimeters off the door at the one end.

650
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:16,910
Yeah, a proper plane at Lee Valley. It's our sort of local high

651
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,770
end woodwork store. Like, yeah. No, I, I'm not spending 300 bucks on this thing.

652
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,089
You know, you do go buy a belt sander, just buy a cheap belt.

653
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:25,040
That was Plan

654
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,260
B

655
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:26,609
Yeah,

656
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,530
I was just gonna,

657
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,680
yeah, because I own a belt

658
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,199
sander. So I was

659
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:29,359
like,

660
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,890
-- ok, it's gonna be messy but whatever, who
-- cares?

661
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,810
And it's uneven but it's the bottom of the door. So no one cares, like, yeah.

662
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:36,890
No, I know. I know. I know. But, yeah.

663
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,010
Yeah, that's the thing, these tools and you got to think too back in the day

664
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,680
you had to own these nice tools.

665
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,709
So, I, anyway, anyway, what were we talking about again

666
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,949
in computer security? I think it is

667
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:52,130
-- just
-- like joining and fixing and,

668
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:52,930
-- you
-- know,

669
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,880
anyway. No, no,

670
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,369
we, we were talking about the fact that how do we solve a problem like this?

671
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,770
And, and the reality is you can't because we have to exist in a society

672
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,660
with a certain amount of sanity just

673
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:05,540
period.

674
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,160
And, and this is true of,

675
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,020
of computer security to a degree is the vast majority of people are decent

676
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:12,979
and honest.

677
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,300
But I think computer security is tricky because you only need like one guy

678
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,060
in,

679
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,300
you know, middle of nowhere ST

680
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:23,819
or whatever and, and they can attack the whole world.

681
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,939
And in fact, so actually, actually, you know, what this leads into nicely is

682
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,260
there was,

683
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,949
there was some thread on reddit where someone said basically,

684
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:38,300
I want like a AAA command center view of all of the traffic hitting my router.

685
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,260
And of course, the responses were you have to pay a ton of money to get this and blah,

686
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,060
blah, blah, whatever.

687
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:43,660
And I thought,

688
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,140
well, no, no, I thought, I bet I could do this with elastic search actually.

689
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,359
And,

690
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,800
and II, I spun up a VM

691
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:55,630
and funny enough, uh I did in Digital Ocean and they must have been having problems.

692
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,900
It took like five minutes for the VM to get spun up.

693
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:58,849
So

694
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,989
it took me a total maybe 15 minutes, five of it waiting for the VM.

695
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:07,430
And basically the VM is only running SSH and I'm done.

696
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:09,510
Anytime anyone tries to connect to me,

697
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,069
I'm just logging it into elastic search and then I can pull up a map that

698
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,510
updates itself every I can update it every five seconds is the smallest amount of,

699
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,369
of visualization.

700
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,239
But anyway, the point being like

701
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:24,630
there's crap coming from everywhere which I guess is totally not surprising.

702
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,469
And, and the funny enough, the biggest port right now is the uh Bitcoin test network

703
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,930
because there's real money there.

704
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:36,560
No, no, just the test network, not, not the real Bitcoin network, the test network.

705
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:36,979
So I have

706
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,339
an assumption that the IP I have

707
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:42,140
must have been part of a test net at some point.

708
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:43,500
So

709
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,729
-- just
-- scanning the entire

710
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,719
because honestly,

711
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,839
you can scan the entire I PV four space for a

712
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:50,689
port in like 10 to 15 minutes now using something like

713
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:51,339
uh Z

714
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,040
map or um

715
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,260
what is it M scan?

716
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,619
Oh, I don't even know the name of the tools. I just, I

717
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:57,949
know

718
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,239
and am scan

719
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,599
and, and yeah, like from literally, well,

720
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,890
I could even do it from home now because I have 100 and 70 megabit up,

721
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,060
you know,

722
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,229
sweet.

723
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,420
It is, it is actually really sweet.

724
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:12,670
I'm

725
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:13,760
not a lot.

726
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,900
I don't mean to gloat with everybody else having not as great internet, but no,

727
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,160
really, you do want

728
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,310
it. You want the fastest internet you can afford.

729
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,300
I, yeah, I

730
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:25,560
have the fastest internet I can buy and it's not that fast.

731
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,040
Makes

732
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,859
-- me
-- sad. That's a very American thing to say.

733
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,729
It is a very American thing to say.

734
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,209
God bless America.

735
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,140
Uh Anyway, anyway,

736
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,900
it is, right.

737
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:37,859
So I guess thinking about this though is

738
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,040
on one side,

739
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,160
there's civilized society

740
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,420
and not publishing fake advisories

741
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:48,599
easily falls into that bucket. Right.

742
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,640
And on the other side,

743
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:51,699
don't be

744
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,439
-- the
-- classic. Don't go out of your way to be a jerk to people.

745
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,640
Yes. That's exactly right. That's exactly what this was.

746
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,920
And, and, but now at the same time,

747
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,560
there's the concept of people all over

748
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,280
the world attacking everything because they can,

749
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,520
and, and there's, you know, botnets and,

750
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,900
and who knows what and they're looking to steal resources and in your Bitcoins and,

751
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,839
and whatever,

752
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,010
and that's where

753
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,959
we need to put our focus on to technology because that

754
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,750
is the place you need technology to solve the problems.

755
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,290
We don't need technology to somehow verify

756
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,619
fake reports coming from random people on the internet.

757
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:33,579
-- That is a very human problem.
-- Well, I mean, the beauty of a lot of this

758
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,260
is there are really good, simple technical solutions. It's just

759
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:42,859
they're hard to deploy by default because for example, let's take ssh, for example,

760
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:45,560
when you spin up a system,

761
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,500
unless you have some sort of orchestration or provisioning thing behind it.

762
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, you need to be able to log into it, right?

763
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,119
And so typically sort of the lowest common denominator is of course the password.

764
00:31:56,949 --> 00:32:00,969
Um Now what's nice, for example, uh is for, well,

765
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,260
most cloud providers now when you spin up a system,

766
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,719
you don't set a password, you feed it an SSH key

767
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,520
and let's face it right? Like if your system is only allowing login via SSH keys then,

768
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,189
uh, unless you're, you know,

769
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,650
using one of those Debian generated SSH keys

770
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,750
from back in the day where there were only

771
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,109
64,000 possibilities to open SSL having a bug or not an open sl having a bug story.

772
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:29,550
But the Debian guys modifying something so that a, like, uh, warning was

773
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,670
stop warning them on something.

774
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,780
The reality is if you're using SSH key based authentication,

775
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,260
an attacker can't get in

776
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,810
unless they like compromise your workstation and steal your key.

777
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:42,739
Right. Right.

778
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,829
Like that's just it, like it's like two factor authentication with a UB key

779
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,540
unless you can like

780
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,180
somehow.

781
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:49,849
Well, first of all,

782
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,650
you'd have to trick me into authenticating and then sticking my key in and then,

783
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:53,979
oh yeah,

784
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:56,420
the guys that made U two F thought about that

785
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,180
because people like me and everybody make mistakes and we're idiots

786
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,130
that they put the host name in, you know, as part of the authentication thing.

787
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,089
So that even if some Russian dude tricks me,

788
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,489
it's not going to work

789
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:09,109
end of end of story, right?

790
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,670
You know, and so there, there are these wonderful, you know,

791
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,520
all these people complaining about their web servers being attacked.

792
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,050
Well, yeah,

793
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,520
I hate to say it but you go behind

794
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,500
something like cloud flare or some other protective service

795
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,510
and then you firewall access to your web servers as sort

796
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,060
of far out as you can and only talk to those services

797
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,989
and now the bad guys can't, you know,

798
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,810
talk to them directly,

799
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,089
right. Which solves a whole pile of problems.

800
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:34,739
It is.

801
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:35,959
It is.

802
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,680
Right. There's, there's really,

803
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,640
there's that, that's how you fix the problem,

804
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:41,900
you know.

805
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,540
Like, so, yeah, for the, the, for a lot of this technology stuff, we,

806
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,699
we have good solutions.

807
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,520
Um, I remember a friend of my mother,

808
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:51,089
uh, she bought a laptop

809
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,569
and she didn't have a router at home.

810
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:56,410
Like she literally just had a cable modem that plugs straight into the laptop,

811
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,699
right?

812
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,560
And she, and this is back like this is about 10 years ago,

813
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,550
she couldn't

814
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,020
essentially when she plugged the laptop in, like it was running Windows XP.

815
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,550
Of course, she couldn't get updates fast enough for it not to get hacked,

816
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,969
right? Because,

817
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,570
you know, back in the day, like, you know,

818
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,320
if you plugged the Windows XP machine and it would be on average,

819
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,850
attacked and compromised in like what five minutes or something,

820
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,158
you know, it is a really low number.

821
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:27,339
Yeah. And, and so the reality is the solution was, is like, tell her to go buy a $20 wi

822
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,388
fi router

823
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:29,809
and stick that in between

824
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:32,728
right there, there is no other solution

825
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,079
I know or take your laptop to a trusted network that won't attack you. But you know,

826
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:42,398
so let's reframe this discussion now because I feel like

827
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:45,728
this all makes sense and, and let's think about fishing,

828
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:50,739
we like to treat fishing as a human problem. And so let's imagine a scale on one side,

829
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,418
spam is a human problem

830
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,040
kind of maybe. And I, I think we get to that.

831
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,959
Uh but I feel like so skyfall is on the purely human problem on,

832
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:03,459
on the one side of the scale and on the other side of the scale,

833
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,540
you have purely technology problem. And I think SSH keys are a great example of that.

834
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,629
-- And fishing. I feel like, well,
-- it's, it's, it's more so that

835
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:15,719
you could solve it with humans, but it's basically impossible.

836
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:18,639
Like you could have everybody choose passwords that have

837
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,179
two K.

838
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:19,770
No,

839
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:20,810
no, you can't. That's

840
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:21,300
never

841
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:21,459
gonna

842
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:21,669
happen

843
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,199
like

844
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:23,100
the reality.

845
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,830
And I think, I think,

846
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,310
well,

847
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:27,610
no, no,

848
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,689
something important though is

849
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,340
we love to say

850
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,560
you could do this if,

851
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:39,100
and then if it's some impractical solution of every human picking a good password,

852
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,959
which let's face it

853
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,360
if, if you and I had to pick a password, it would be terrible.

854
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,120
That's why I let my password manager pick my passwords. Right.

855
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:48,560
So, anyway,

856
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,280
let's think about fishing. Now. Fishing is my favorite whipping boy. Here is

857
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:53,530
so many people.

858
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,030
I talk to talk about things like, oh,

859
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,239
we need fishing awareness and we need fishing training and let's stop.

860
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,070
And it's like

861
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,409
I have come to the conclusion, fishing is a 100% technical problem.

862
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:08,280
Yes. And no, there's honestly a lot of fishing can simply be solved with if

863
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,169
it sounds too good to be true. It is.

864
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,550
No, it can't.

865
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,540
What happens when you get a phishing email that looks

866
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,750
like an invoice from the company you just dealt with.

867
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,060
Like, that's not too good to be true. It's the invoice for the crap I just bought.

868
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,770
And sometimes,

869
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,629
in fact, I've even gotten phishing emails that were like,

870
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,250
it was basically the stuff I was looking at.

871
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,949
So these people somehow had insight into like some ad network or something

872
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,100
and they knew the products I was looking for and they sent me an

873
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,399
from a company

874
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,840
for one of the products that in fact I had even bought earlier in

875
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:45,570
simple example is, you know, we like there's a lot of, you know, uh fishing in uh

876
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:48,860
for invoices or bank payments and stuff and click like

877
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,389
I constantly about once a week on my phone,

878
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,870
I get a text message saying

879
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,560
your refund from your cell phone company, click this link and you know,

880
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,280
fill out your interact banking details to get the refund.

881
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,429
And that probably works quite a bit in

882
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,459
Canada because we have like six phone companies.

883
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,449
So, you know, if you pick one at random, you're probably gonna get

884
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:07,850
it,

885
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,739
the one that the person uses, right?

886
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,879
-- Like there's a pretty good chance
-- we have two phone companies. So

887
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:13,689
yeah,

888
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,350
and so, you know,

889
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,830
part of it is knowing that these guys that's not how they operate.

890
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,770
And part of it is, again, if it's, you know, my,

891
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,370
my phone companies are just not going to randomly give me money,

892
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,929
that's not how phone companies work,

893
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:29,330
you know?

894
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:31,520
Right. Like, I remember when I

895
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:37,669
did have to get my $20 back from them because I, I overpaid my final bill and, you know,

896
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,280
like when I canceled my account

897
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,590
and getting that 20 bucks out of them took three months.

898
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,060
And at that point, it just became a matter of principle.

899
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,919
You spent $200 worth of time

900
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,689
to get $20.

901
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:50,459
Yeah.

902
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:55,159
So II I agree on the one to me, fishing is,

903
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:58,540
I think part of the problem is people conflate fishing as being a separate,

904
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:01,199
completely unique problem. It's not, it's spam.

905
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,500
Look at spam.

906
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:06,290
Spam is trying to trick people into doing silly things. That's what fishing is,

907
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:06,600
is

908
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,070
way more sophisticated.

909
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:08,229
I

910
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:10,040
think there's

911
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,110
a range of attacks with even fishing though.

912
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,199
And even spam is if we can put them all in the same bucket is, is some of it is as simple as

913
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,000
I just want to trick you into looking at my product

914
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,199
and you have things that are like, I'm going to literally steal money from you and,

915
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,080
and like, let's face it.

916
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,600
That's,

917
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,790
that, that's basically unquestionably crime and fraud

918
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,770
and no problem there. But then you kind of, you can end up with things in the middle of,

919
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:38,439
I'm gonna trick you into giving me a password.

920
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:39,399
Right.

921
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,500
And like that kind of

922
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:41,270
in

923
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,899
to be the head of the CIA that 15 year old from Britain.

924
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,080
Yeah. Right.

925
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,620
Right. Right.

926
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,600
And, like, seriously he called up the

927
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,129
help desk apparently and pretended to be the director

928
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,239
of the CIA to get access to a system.

929
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,719
Like,

930
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,300
that's not a fishing problem. That's somebody at the help desk didn't.

931
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,639
I? Well, no, I can't say I'm hoping that they have some sort of strong

932
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,399
method internally for verifying identity before you're like, ok, Mr CIA director,

933
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,229
I'm going to give you remote access to your desktop.

934
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,479
They do now

935
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,860
well, or they enforce it, right?

936
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,129
But here's ok.

937
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:17,110
So this one I'm really sensitive to actually because I know

938
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,239
some pen testers and it's great because the stories they tell

939
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:23,719
is like anytime they attack a corporation,

940
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:27,469
they just call up a secretary and they're like, I'm the VP of blah, blah, blah.

941
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:30,540
I need you to give me this right now, you know, right now.

942
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,830
And they,

943
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,479
they keep getting more and more agitated

944
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:34,389
when the secretary isn't cooperating and like,

945
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,149
let's face it.

946
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,149
That's an attack on humans and you can't stop that.

947
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,919
Right. Well, not just that, like if you're worried, you're going to get fired.

948
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:45,639
If you don't help someone, you're gonna help them. I mean, it's, it

949
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:50,459
is part of the human condition and that we can't fix with technology necessarily,

950
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,979
right?

951
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,560
But

952
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:51,889
like,

953
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,860
maybe not so much technology but process. Like if

954
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,060
uh like this is a great example.

955
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,810
Uh in Edmonton University was defrauded of

956
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,520
$11.8 million after staff failed to call one

957
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,570
of its vendors to verify whether emails requesting

958
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,530
a change in banking information were legitimate.

959
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,810
So they had a process in place

960
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:10,729
saying like when a vendor emails you to change their

961
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,949
banking details to be like and it was stupid.

962
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:13,810
It was like a bank in

963
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,409
hung. It was, it was like, totally not at all what it used to be, right?

964
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:24,389
And you know, they, they sent $11.8 million to some random bank account.

965
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:27,810
I when you hear stories of that,

966
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,100
even where people send emails as the CEO to

967
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,250
finance saying I need you to pay this invoice.

968
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,399
Don't ask any questions.

969
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,280
-- You
-- know, I see that all the time with the cloud security alliance is like

970
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,310
uh because you know,

971
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,070
the name of the CEO of the cloud security alliance is

972
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,939
pretty obvious because it's like on one of the web pages,

973
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:43,330
you know,

974
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,550
the list of people who run this thing

975
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:50,060
and they'll be like so like some wonky at gmail.com address and it's kind of like,

976
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,489
yeah,

977
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:51,629
no,

978
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,610
right. Like,

979
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,260
you know,

980
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,060
and we will hit the report button or the spam button or whatever and but you know,

981
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,590
and there's, we're not going to track this down and like beat them with a stick.

982
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,659
-- It's just not worth it.
-- No, it's totally not.

983
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:08,820
And like, like that is a place process can fix things, right of,

984
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:14,100
of saying before you pay an invoice, like maybe double check with the CEO, right?

985
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:17,360
That's not hard to do. That's pretty easy. Call him on the phone.

986
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,129
Say, hey, did you send me this email?

987
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,919
And then I feel like there's the other side of things where let's say you

988
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:26,300
get a phishing email that's trying to get you to type your password in.

989
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,320
This is sort of things like two factor off

990
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,800
are huge because like two factor off and U

991
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,709
two F basically neuter these type of attacks.

992
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,770
They, they, I mean, yes, someone could get your password,

993
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:39,129
but without the other half of your password,

994
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,699
it really doesn't matter.

995
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:41,649
And

996
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:45,989
even if they manage to suck down your U two F, let's say, for example,

997
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,320
somebody actually manages to execute a man in the middle

998
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,919
attack against my Gmail account using U two F.

999
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,000
They now have access to that session.

1000
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:54,949
Uh They,

1001
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,110
they can't,

1002
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,060
-- but
-- hypothetically they now have access to that session.

1003
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,629
And Google just did a uh a slide deck where they talk about

1004
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,110
how they detect

1005
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:11,489
break ins of accounts because there's patterns of usage that are very abnormal,

1006
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:11,590
right?

1007
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,379
Like my pattern of usage of my Gmail account basically consists of log in

1008
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,419
read email, archive, email, reply to some email,

1009
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,879
log out,

1010
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:20,909
right?

1011
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:24,510
And maybe once in a while, change a setting or an out of office setting or whatever.

1012
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:29,290
But the attacker one apparently pretty much consists of log in,

1013
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,620
uh, reset, sort of the like phone number and, or backup email, you know,

1014
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:35,520
for warnings,

1015
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,469
uh, change the password, you know,

1016
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:42,199
rifle through all your stuff looking for like anything to do with Bitcoin or,

1017
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:42,389
you know,

1018
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:44,479
other sort of electronic shenanigans where you can

1019
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:46,790
actually extract money from the person quickly.

1020
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,159
Uh, and then either delete a big pile of stuff or,

1021
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:51,820
you know,

1022
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,860
email everybody in your contact book that you're stuck in

1023
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,659
Russia and need them to send you 50 bucks,

1024
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,719
right?

1025
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:00,139
And, and they can basically

1026
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:02,379
quite like, let's face it.

1027
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:05,659
What are the chances of a legitimate account owner doing that

1028
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,969
very low

1029
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,820
and more to the point if they do want to change their backup information,

1030
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,260
you just poke them again for,

1031
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,739
you know, the out of band authentication or the two fa or whatever.

1032
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,610
-- And, you
-- know, now that you say this, there have been times I've used

1033
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,280
in gmail comes to mind.

1034
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,419
I, I imagine, I, I need to start paying closer attention to this now, but

1035
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:27,310
I know I've been like on the road

1036
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,229
and

1037
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,030
I'll, I'll kind of log in from a weird place and, yeah, the Google says, you know,

1038
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:34,649
you know, you've got to log in again.

1039
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,409
I don't, I don't know who you are.

1040
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,409
Yeah,

1041
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:41,669
I get it, man. Well, not even just IP because I mean, I do a certain amount of travel but

1042
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:46,719
c if I'm doing certain travels and, and I do certain things, it, it,

1043
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,629
now that I'm thinking of it, it definitely makes a difference

1044
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,669
depending upon like what I'm searching for and the kind of email

1045
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,050
and that's a perfect example of kind of where,

1046
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,449
you know, I hate to say this, but part of the frustration is

1047
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:02,639
security solutions that depend on everybody doing the right thing

1048
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:05,219
will always fail straight up.

1049
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:09,070
So security solutions that are more centralized. I,

1050
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,899
I think in some ways stand a better chance, right? Like

1051
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,590
uh I mean, well, my,

1052
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,979
a great example is, you know, my most of my Linux systems,

1053
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,790
I get all my packages from the vendor.

1054
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,969
Like Red Hat is a great example.

1055
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:24,030
Pretty much everything living on my Red Hat systems all comes from Red Hat.

1056
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,469
I actually don't think I have anything weird on them anymore.

1057
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:28,989
And so I just run yum update or DNF update

1058
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:29,659
and that's it.

1059
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:33,709
I don't, you know, whereas I just, oh God, I just turned on the windows, 10 laptop.

1060
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,949
It hasn't been on for three months.

1061
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:35,379
Oh,

1062
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,189
sweet God.

1063
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:42,169
Uh Anyways, two days later, I had everything updated, including itunes Steam.

1064
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,449
Oh, no, I haven't updated Steam. I still have to do that.

1065
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,389
You have like a two gazillion bit link to the internet now.

1066
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,879
-- Yeah. But
-- more to the point I have to like

1067
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,760
the number of reboots to get windows updated.

1068
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,570
Right. Like it's at least it was two or three updates

1069
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,229
that required reboots because it installed a pile of updates and then it rebooted.

1070
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:02,649
And then,

1071
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,409
and I don't think it has the meltdown update. I don't know yet. I, I need to,

1072
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,290
I don't even care at this point.

1073
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,320
I hate that thing.

1074
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,679
Well, no, because,

1075
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,939
and then the best part is because I knew my partner

1076
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:14,870
was going to need to use this laptop this week.

1077
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,530
And if she turned it on and then, you know,

1078
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,360
couldn't use it for like three hours because

1079
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,770
it's trying to reboot and install updates.

1080
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,370
She's going to throw it out the window and I don't blame her,

1081
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,290
you know,

1082
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,830
so I, I proactively turn this thing on.

1083
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,979
I was trying to get it all updated, you know, in itunes and Windows defender,

1084
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:29,939
Windows updates.

1085
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,790
I still got update. Steam. I still got a

1086
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,330
VLC, you know, and, and so anyways,

1087
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,979
it's just basically impossible to keep that machine up to date because

1088
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,020
for sure there's something I installed on there that's not updated.

1089
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:41,689
Uh

1090
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,010
You know, there is

1091
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:44,139
totally man.

1092
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,149
Well, and something important too. Oh, and then I removed Java.

1093
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,689
I don't know why it had Java installed.

1094
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,090
Why not?

1095
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:51,699
Why

1096
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,699
not? Oh God. So

1097
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:53,080
everything

1098
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,139
needs Java

1099
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,830
because I don't want whatever their default search

1100
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,290
engine is to be my new search engine.

1101
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,879
When I do an update,

1102
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,469
I don't pay

1103
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,770
attention

1104
00:45:59,879 --> 00:45:59,899
to

1105
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,120
it.

1106
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,540
Funny. Enough. I think chrome kind of remove their ability to do that.

1107
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:06,290
So it's,

1108
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,820
it will, in fact, now, when I update Java,

1109
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,250
because actually elastic search is written in Java.

1110
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,959
So I use Java quite a lot now.

1111
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:13,979
But anyway,

1112
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:14,760
every time

1113
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:18,149
-- I'm
-- not
-- opposed to Java, I'm just opposed to Java being hooked up to my web

1114
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,870
-- browser.
-- I agree completely in effect.

1115
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:20,439
Now,

1116
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,320
it kind of politely asks you to enable Java in your web

1117
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,719
browser and when you're done upgrading it and then I'm like,

1118
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:26,439
nope,

1119
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:27,070
no

1120
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:27,639
way.

1121
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:29,560
Yeah. Well, it's like flash,

1122
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,679
I disable flash in my web browsers.

1123
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:34,560
Even though it's a chrome flash which is reasonably secure,

1124
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,250
you don't need it.

1125
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,659
I, I have flash set on, like, click to activate or whatever it's called

1126
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:41,600
and

1127
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,070
it is so rare.

1128
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,679
I even see that and, and 99% of the time if click to activate flash, it shows up.

1129
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:48,979
I just close the tab

1130
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:52,229
-- because
-- I don't know, I find it's just wonky new sites with video players.

1131
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's, it's dodgy sites at this point. I mean,

1132
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:57,510
that's all it

1133
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:57,800
is.

1134
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,439
There was somebody I was somewhere that I

1135
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,189
was actually surprised they hadn't fixed themselves yet

1136
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,389
that, that I felt like it was a legitimate site

1137
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,370
that should not have had flash,

1138
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,270
but I can't remember for the life of me what it was.

1139
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:12,550
Well, yeah, it's

1140
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:15,360
one day we'll get rid of flash. Maybe

1141
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,469
never.

1142
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:17,530
It'll never die

1143
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:22,419
-- anyway.
-- But going back to this, I mean, any security problem that generally, like,

1144
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,510
like crossing the street safely depends on all the drivers watching.

1145
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,290
And, I mean, there's,

1146
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,310
there's a couple of crosswalks here on the west end of Edmonton,

1147
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,590
like the one on stony plane over by 160 whatever.

1148
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,310
Uh, people blow through that all the time when there's, like,

1149
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,709
people crossing on the street

1150
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:43,070
because they're just not paying attention or whatever.

1151
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,500
I don't know what it is about that stretch of road. But, like,

1152
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,959
yeah, I've seen so many people blow through and almost hit pedestrians.

1153
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:51,360
I, I, well, I know what the solution to this is.

1154
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,070
It's, you know, self driving cars with computers that don't get bored,

1155
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,750
uh, and try and run over people, you know, unless a hacker makes them do it.

1156
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,520
Right. Right. And

1157
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,010
I feel like

1158
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,439
there are

1159
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:07,979
very few security problems that legitimately need humans to solve them

1160
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:11,949
because humans are unpredictable and terrible at solving problems like this.

1161
00:48:12,709 --> 00:48:16,080
Well, the other thing I always get is whenever somebody's like, oh, I want to have,

1162
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,250
like, this dashboard and monitor what's going on on my network.

1163
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm like, great. What are you actually going to do with that?

1164
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,449
And they're like, what do you mean?

1165
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:22,469
I'm like, so you're gonna see all these attacks coming in?

1166
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,620
What are you going to do about? It? Looks cool, man.

1167
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,139
Yeah. And more to the point.

1168
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:28,500
So who's going to monitor it when you go to sleep or the bathroom.

1169
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:31,620
It looks cool. I didn't do it because it was useful.

1170
00:48:31,629 --> 00:48:34,479
I just did it because it looks cool. Like I'm not even going to pretend

1171
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:36,020
like,

1172
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,000
unless there's something actionable you can do then, ok,

1173
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,459
logging it is kind of useful.

1174
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,270
And that maybe if there is an attack you can figure

1175
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,060
out how bad it was or how deep they got in.

1176
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,520
This doesn't really apply to home networks.

1177
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,620
And number two, because the answer is they, they did everything.

1178
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,300
And then number two is, you know,

1179
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,620
if you're actually going to be monitoring this and doing actionable stuff with it,

1180
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,780
if you don't automate it,

1181
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,840
that means you need at least four or five human

1182
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,260
beings because there's 100 and 68 hours in the week.

1183
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,580
And,

1184
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,070
you know, people working 40

1185
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:03,370
hours,

1186
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:05,129
four people, you can't,

1187
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:08,120
humans can't look at logs anymore.

1188
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:12,040
Like, even if you're not doing anything interesting,

1189
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:15,379
the volume of your logs will be so huge.

1190
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,159
A human cannot look at them

1191
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:17,709
and

1192
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:21,679
they can look at it with a system of tools to find, you know, like that.

1193
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:25,040
Did you see that cloud flare blog entry on looking at their core dumps?

1194
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,239
Yeah. And did you see how few they get?

1195
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,270
-- Well, exactly. Yeah. Well, after they fixed a bunch of stuff,
-- right.

1196
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:34,199
But, but I mean, that's a great example of

1197
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,439
if they were getting say

1198
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,760
300 core dumps a day,

1199
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,590
they wouldn't let humans look at them, they would build tooling to figure it out.

1200
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,879
But because it was like, less than 20 a week

1201
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:47,899
they could have and let's face it.

1202
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:51,110
My guess is there's a huge overlap in those core dumps.

1203
00:49:51,729 --> 00:49:54,739
And so my suspicion is it was a small enough number.

1204
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,020
They could justify just letting a person look at

1205
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:02,830
it. And that's kind of logging has reached the point where humans need not apply.

1206
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,590
Just

1207
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,629
you cannot deal with it.

1208
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,270
You have to have automation and,

1209
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,620
and I think more and more of our security problems are,

1210
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,090
are becoming this.

1211
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,989
But I also

1212
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:13,290
feel

1213
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,489
it's simply the law of larger like my SSH connections,

1214
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,600
the number of SSH connections I get on an IP address.

1215
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,520
I don't even know anymore. I'm guessing hundreds or thousands a

1216
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,840
day. I don't know. I don't care. I just have

1217
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,629
key based off. That's it.

1218
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,860
So I ignore the problem,

1219
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:30,100
you know, same thing with spam.

1220
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,199
I,

1221
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,239
I check my spam folder like maybe once every month or two

1222
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:35,850
on the

1223
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,060
off.

1224
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,050
-- So
-- I just, I just pulled it up. This is,

1225
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:41,050
this is one of the cool things I love like uh so my machine

1226
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:44,209
that literally like this is a VM that I started

1227
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:46,530
and I'm running something called uh packet beat on it,

1228
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,479
which is just looking at incoming traffic.

1229
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:49,350
I have never

1230
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,419
actually connected out to anywhere from this machine, right?

1231
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:56,080
It's just, it is a random IP, the only thing running on it is ssh.

1232
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,840
And in the last 24 hours, I've had 3000, 173 connection attempts.

1233
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,219
Obviously,

1234
00:51:01,229 --> 00:51:04,399
none of them are me because I'm not even logged into the machine right now.

1235
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,070
So like that, that gives you an idea of in, in effect I 20

1236
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:09,879
four seconds.

1237
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,689
That's one every 30 seconds, a

1238
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:13,679
-- significant
-- amount of it came.

1239
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:18,219
It looks like at 9 a.m. this morning for me where I have a huge spike.

1240
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,939
And so obviously someone was trying to hack my server with, with SSH attempts.

1241
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,149
Right? Like, that's what that is.

1242
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,169
Yeah,

1243
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:25,919
it

1244
00:51:26,129 --> 00:51:26,379
works.

1245
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:26,739
There's a

1246
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,129
lot of default

1247
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,060
-- passwords and stuff on things,
-- not on this machine.

1248
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,219
Well, that, that's a part of it too. Right. I'm like, I can't,

1249
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,520
and part of me wants to, like,

1250
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:37,020
I'm wondering if I turned off SSH

1251
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,370
O

1252
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,379
or, I mean, key off if,

1253
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,899
if the number of attempts I would see would go up dramatically because like,

1254
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:43,669
when someone connects,

1255
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:43,820
you

1256
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:44,459
know,

1257
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:48,560
well, well, they're shotgunning but if you connect, you know, I only allow keys.

1258
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,050
Right?

1259
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:50,540
You can figure that out.

1260
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,110
That's true.

1261
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:52,370
Yeah.

1262
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,610
But anyway, yeah, 3000 just on one port on a, like,

1263
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,129
completely insignificant machine.

1264
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,570
I'm, I'm confident that I could not parse

1265
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:08,989
those logs by myself and that's not even like a real company doing real things.

1266
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:09,689
Right?

1267
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:13,409
And, and I guess so you say what is the point of having the dashboard.

1268
00:52:13,419 --> 00:52:17,370
This is the point. So in the podcast, I can answer your question in 10 seconds,

1269
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:18,429
you know.

1270
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,010
So I did read back in the day

1271
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,899
one really good reason for having an intrusion detection system.

1272
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:28,639
Now note I'm not saying intrusion detection or intrusion prevention system,

1273
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:30,389
I'm talking strictly about an I DS that

1274
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:32,500
is effectively a dashboard for network attacks.

1275
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,810
And the guy pointed out that the, there's one valid reason to have it.

1276
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:38,870
And that is you put one in front of your network and you

1277
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:42,459
put one behind your firewall and all the other stuff protecting your network.

1278
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,919
And then you show executives the delta between the reports

1279
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,629
and you say this is why we're spending all this

1280
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:49,659
money on these fancy firewalls and all this other stuff.

1281
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,760
Definitely.

1282
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,620
And that, and I'm literally like, I'm like, literally,

1283
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:56,169
yes, that makes sense because otherwise, like

1284
00:52:56,879 --> 00:53:00,870
I get ID P like actively blocking and dealing with tax. That makes sense.

1285
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:03,979
But just like randomly showing you a dashboard of how bad it is.

1286
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:08,040
Yeah, literally unless it's for the executive so you can justify your budget.

1287
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:08,649
I don't see the

1288
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,100
point.

1289
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,020
No, I agree with you completely. But, but it does look cool and, and I mean,

1290
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:13,260
for

1291
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:13,649
real,

1292
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,030
and it's fun seeing real time.

1293
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,870
Although the one other thing that I think could be really interesting

1294
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:22,149
is if you have a real time dashboard,

1295
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,250
you will like,

1296
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,179
it'll light up if someone is starting a legitimate attack against you.

1297
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:27,639
But again,

1298
00:53:27,649 --> 00:53:30,189
like if you have automation it's going to see it

1299
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:32,949
probably more than 20 seconds faster than a human.

1300
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,149
Right. Which is

1301
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,459
so there's still no excuse to not have automation.

1302
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,100
Well, and more to the point you still have to react to it and do something.

1303
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:39,760
Yep. Yep.

1304
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:43,629
That's what always gets me is you have to actionable. Something has to happen

1305
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:48,110
-- otherwise it's, it's pointless. Yep.
-- Yep. No, I get it. Wow. I've got

1306
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:51,199
2000 hits on port 23.

1307
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,000
But this is, this is crazy and I don't know why this would be

1308
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,520
but port 21

1309
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:00,229
20 no, 23 is FTP, right? 23.

1310
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:06,419
-- 21 is FTP.
-- 2121 has 38 hits in the last 24 hours, which is

1311
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:07,120
OK.

1312
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,469
I remember when

1313
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,760
I remember literally the day of the month or whatever it was the point at which

1314
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,409
officially web traffic overtook FTP traffic on the

1315
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,189
internet and this was a long time ago.

1316
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:18,979
But I mean FTP used to be, well, if you wanted to move.

1317
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:20,153
Uh

1318
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:21,123
Actually

1319
00:54:21,482 --> 00:54:24,792
it's funny. I remember, do you remember Archie for searching FDP,

1320
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:25,393
man?

1321
00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:28,062
I remember searching for all kinds of stuff with Archie

1322
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:29,383
because like there was no other way to find.

1323
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,752
I only ever used Archie.

1324
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:35,913
I was, I don't know why I feel like Archie worked better for me. So I used Archie

1325
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:40,462
anyway, whatever. Like the young people. Like, what are these guys talking about?

1326
00:54:40,732 --> 00:54:41,052
What is

1327
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:41,532
it

1328
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:41,752
that

1329
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:42,613
annoying thing

1330
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,295
-- for mainframes? Right.
-- Look it up, look it up. You'll figure it out.

1331
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:47,436
Uh, anyway, anyway. All right, man.

1332
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:52,216
Uh, let's call it any, any closing thoughts on human security,

1333
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:55,236
I guess. Remember our threat model to, you know, quote Bruce

1334
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:55,456
Schneier,

1335
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:58,196
our threat model evolved in the African Savannah and

1336
00:54:58,206 --> 00:55:00,295
it doesn't deal so good with the modern world.

1337
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:00,875
Uh,

1338
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:03,416
that, that seems fair and, and my advice would be, uh,

1339
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,565
you're bad at security and you should feel bad.

1340
00:55:05,785 --> 00:55:06,575
So, there we go.

1341
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,300
You're right. Are you talking about me specifically or the world in general? I mean,

1342
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:10,669
both

1343
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,260
are true

1344
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:16,719
humans. You, you're in the Venn diagram of all humans. So yes, it applies to you.

1345
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,840
So I would agree with that.

1346
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:22,439
So, anyway. All right, man. Thank you. Thanks everybody for listening.
