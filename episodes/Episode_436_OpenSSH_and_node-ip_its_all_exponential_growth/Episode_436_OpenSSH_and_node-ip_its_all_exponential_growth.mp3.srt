Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:13,060
Kurt Siegfried and my partner explaining what openness H and node IP have in common.

2
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:15,739
-- Josh
-- Bresser. Did you say node IP?

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,739
What is node IP?

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:18,090
Uh

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,680
Node IP is a

6
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,420
node library for IP, address manipulation, not really manipulation.

7
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:27,049
Um

8
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:32,909
More like getting the subnet mask or the given this IP with this subnet.

9
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,369
What's the first, what's the last IP or given this like hexadecimal strength?

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,779
What is that? And like

11
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,540
the correct dot quad format?

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,840
Yeah, it just, it does IP address magic

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,580
well, did.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,310
It still does

15
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,509
and it will only ever do that and nothing else

16
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:50,529
I know

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,549
because it's now read only.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,459
And so yeah, what does that have to do with this open SSH remote code

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,090
-- exploit bug?
-- I cannot wait for you to tie them together for us. So

20
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:01,669
OK.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,860
So obviously the big news this week is open SSH

22
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,029
has a critical vulnerability in SSH D was present in.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,099
No, it was rated important. Kurt, it's fine.

24
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:14,089
I'm reading literally from open ssh.com here.

25
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:14,680
They

26
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:14,980
called it.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,059
-- I know it's critical
-- was present in portable open SSH versions. So and to be clear.

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,879
So there's two versions of Open SSH,

29
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,180
there is the Open BS D version which is open

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,239
SSH and there is the Open SSH portable version,

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,080
-- which is sort of there, the
-- one everyone uses,

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,360
the one that everyone on the planet not running open BS D uses. Yeah, exactly.

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,519
On Linux or whatever. And open SSH portable has

34
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:38,400
LAX.

35
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,330
Uh It doesn't really,

36
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,080
I don't want to say LAX capabilities but just

37
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,669
there's some integrations that open BS D and open sh

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,489
can do because obviously they're the same people and

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,199
they have like when they make a design decision,

40
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,360
they can just do it.

41
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,830
They don't have to convince 1000 Linux distro to.

42
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,400
Exactly.

43
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:55,970
So open SSH on open BS D does do some things

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,760
and have some protections that open SSH portable does not or

45
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,900
not widely available anyways.

46
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,690
So our critical vulnerability in opens in SSH D was present in

47
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:08,460
portable open SSH versions between 8.5 P one and 9.7 P one.

48
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,649
So basically every version on the planet

49
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,750
not on my de

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,250
in 11 system.

51
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,919
-- Really? Is it old enough that it's not affected?
-- It is old.

52
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,149
It just missed it by one version.

53
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:25,160
-- Well, ok, most things then
-- because it was funny I was actually riding my bike

54
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,520
on Monday morning. This came, this came up Monday morning.

55
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,460
I was, I took my morning bike ride,

56
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,279
I get back to my house and I like

57
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:37,179
happened to open Mastodon while I was like, cleaning up,

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,869
like putting the bike away and all that stuff.

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,839
And I saw that

60
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:40,679
and I was like, oh, crap.

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,380
But I literally like,

62
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:44,559
ran inside the house and sat out on my computer and disabled

63
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,770
at my open ssh instance that I had running in my network.

64
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,139
And then I read the advisory. I was like, oh, I don't need to turn that off.

65
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:51,770
Like I'm fine.

66
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,809
And so it

67
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,929
that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

68
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,000
And this is one of the things actually, this is a whole show for itself,

69
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:04,330
but it absolutely does allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

70
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:05,690
However,

71
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,520
the chances of you successfully exploiting this on an

72
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,830
X 64 system with stuff like address stack lay

73
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,800
randomization are very close to zero, not 00,

74
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,559
but very close to zero. It's small.

75
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

76
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,449
Well, it's in the sense of like from a mathematical physics perspective, not zero.

77
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,360
-- From an insurance perspective. I'm not worried
-- here's the way I would address this.

78
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:27,919
And this is what I told the people I work

79
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:32,399
with about this particular vulnerability affecting certain things we are running

80
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:33,399
is that

81
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:36,070
I'm not concerned right now

82
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,070
about this particular issue like that.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,589
I'm not saying we shouldn't fix and patch and block and

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,350
do things like that and add add mitigations because we should

85
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,809
because right now with what we know it is mathematically

86
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,789
infeasible to exploit this on a 64 bit system,

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,190
I would say unlikely.

88
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,449
I'm saying mathematically infeasible because I think

89
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,929
winning the lottery is mathematically infeasible.

90
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,029
Someone wins it,

91
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,830
not me.

92
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,580
OK. Then you're using the word

93
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,089
-- in a way. I didn't expect
-- that's fine. Now,

94
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,610
even though this is true today, it

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,339
is,

96
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,139
I think very likely that an version of this

97
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:15,020
exploit will exist at some point in the future.

98
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,140
That will not be mathematically infeasible.

99
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,140
Well, this is kind of the holy grail of exploits.

100
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,559
Exactly. Like every bug hunter, every exploit developer,

101
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,179
the eye of Saron has turned upon this one

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,019
and here's the thing,

103
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:34,559
it's easy to say, oh, whatever. Like it's never going to be exploited. Oh, whatever.

104
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,880
It's not a big deal. There are. What, what did they say?

105
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,899
Like 21 million open SSH versions on the internet exploitable to this.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,230
So on. Show Dan, it shows 23,728,100

107
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,989
-- public facing open.
-- That's all versions, right.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,589
They are old versions, new versions, something of it. It's probably a bell curve.

109
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,570
If I had to guess I'd say this, this feels like a 50 to 80% are affected.

110
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,279
-- Kind of versions,
-- right. It's, it's tens of millions for sure.

111
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,450
Which Kurt thinks is too low, but we'll talk about that too.

112
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh, no, no, I don't think it's too low.

113
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,649
I think it's just absurdly small considering the size of the internet.

114
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,390
They're all in cloud services. Now behind gateways.

115
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,260
-- But
-- anyway, virtual private cloud,

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,890
there is enough meat here

117
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,829
and it's good

118
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,390
be there for a long time that I think

119
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:23,540
the potential to have like a weaponized exploit here is gonna be,

120
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,619
it's going to be valuable and people are going to figure out a way.

121
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,649
-- I think
-- the other problem is open a switch runs on a lot of devices that are not,

122
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,350
shall we say prone to

123
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,619
updates? I'm not even gonna say quick updates.

124
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,140
Well, and they're not 64 bits either. Right. So if you read the Q

125
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,109
this advisory on a 32 bit system,

126
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,779
they, it was what, 10,001,

127
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,660
but basically one in 10,000 attempts because it's a race condition.

128
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:53,100
And if you do one in 10,000 serially against a host,

129
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,820
you're talking about weeks of effort for that or

130
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,720
I could just do 10,000 attempts at the same time across the internet

131
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,600
and pop a shell somewhere.

132
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,630
Well, but the other thing to remember too is like, it's, it's the classic thing of,

133
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
you know, your 99 point, how many zeros is that?

134
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,079
99.999?

135
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,859
Yeah, that'd be the correct number of nines,

136
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:17,519
but 99 or 0.9999% to the power of 100 like 100 attempts.

137
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,670
It goes from almost zero to not like far away from zero pretty quickly.

138
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,149
And that's the thing of like

139
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,738
if it's a targeted attack Yeah,

140
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:27,358
they'd have to keep hammering away on this one portal IP address.

141
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,618
But most attacks are not

142
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:32,578
targeted, you know, they're not the NSA or whatever.

143
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,197
It's, I just want to grab a bunch of boxes.

144
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:35,947
Right.

145
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:39,958
What's really interesting to me is

146
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:40,858
like I said,

147
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:44,967
23 million out of four, well, not 4 billion, about 3.2

148
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,967
billion IP S that are valid. Like once you get rid of multi hat

149
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,477
and like 127 and 10 and all that, that seems like I just,

150
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:55,835
I just assumed there would have been a lot more public facing SSH instances.

151
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:58,096
-- I
-- don't know. I feel like 23 million is a lot.

152
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,635
Here's, here's kind of the way I look at it. I think,

153
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,585
I think in the internet of 20 years ago,

154
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:08,105
I would expect more things to be running. SSH.

155
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:11,506
But like we've reached a point where you don't SSH into stuff anymore.

156
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,635
You're, you're using

157
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:17,235
various orchestration tools and kubernetes and cloud services and,

158
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,415
you know, they don't, they don't use SSH.

159
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,436
Well, no, but many do like Puppet and Anz

160
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:23,894
for sure, for sure.

161
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,373
But, but even if you're using those things, Kurt and you're in like in Aws cloud,

162
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:32,514
you're not gonna open up SSH to the world, you're gonna

163
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,694
-- have cloud front in front of whatever it is you're hosting
-- because, well, no,

164
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,243
you'd have a virtual private cloud in the virtual

165
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,973
-- virtual network, connect and all that stuff.
-- Yeah.

166
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:42,553
And you're,

167
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:46,144
you're probably only serving an HTTP session in and

168
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:49,044
out of your environment because everything is freaking http.

169
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:49,514
Now,

170
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,691
honestly, in my mind, like if I'll be I

171
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,941
have web servers on the internet and their firewall to

172
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,582
talk to cloud flare and like my IP for SSH

173
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,231
because why else would I do it?

174
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,772
And that raises a good comment. You so this is a classic walk.

175
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,372
Don't run bug, like you don't have to run to fix it,

176
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:07,111
but you should walk maybe quickly to fix it and make sure.

177
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:09,451
Yeah, yeah, I agreed.

178
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,092
You mentioned mitigations.

179
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,182
And here's my always my thought on mitigations,

180
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,221
which is if there's something that mitigates

181
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,002
this attack and potentially other attacks,

182
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:20,502
shouldn't that just be sort of part of the baseline default convey?

183
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,790
No, not on this one. So this one's interesting actually.

184
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,570
So the way you,

185
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,929
the way this attack works and we haven't talked about any of the technical details.

186
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,349
-- But so
-- there's multiple mitigations to be clear here like firewall, like in my mind,

187
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,308
if you haven't already firewalled

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,469
your SSH,

189
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,419
there's one mitigation

190
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,609
that people are actually suggesting to change you can.

191
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,250
So the way this attack works is you connect to

192
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,590
an SSH server and then you send a bunch of

193
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,789
data and you basically wait on the last packet of data

194
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,780
to complete

195
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:51,630
the authentication, handshake.

196
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,028
You wait on the last packet and you want to

197
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:57,947
send that last packet as the SSH server is running

198
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,867
the time out handler and the time out is 100 and 20 seconds on new versions of open SSH.

199
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,627
And I think 600 seconds or 300 seconds on old versions. I can't remember the numbers.

200
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,987
-- I wrote it down. Let me
-- 10 minutes or something.

201
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:14,007
I, I wrote down 100 and 20 by default. Now, 600 on old versions.

202
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,547
This is why you should write things down kids.

203
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:19,987
But anyway, so you wait for this grace log in time out to land

204
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,908
and then you send that packet. OK?

205
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,530
So the mitigation being kicked around is to just turn off that timer.

206
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,489
So now though, the problem is

207
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:31,030
if I connect to your server

208
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,929
and I never complete that, that authentication handshake

209
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,890
-- the that TCP connection stays open forever.
-- Yeah. So basically the attacker can

210
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:43,270
hold open a lot of connections that essentially

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,349
wouldn't time out and they could trickle packets in like slow LS on a patch. Did

212
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,109
they don't need to trickle packets in?

213
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,869
-- No, but
-- wouldn't the TCP time out happen at some point if you don't send a packet.

214
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,590
Probably,

215
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,169
right.

216
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,590
So that's, but, but I mean, from an attacker's point of view, that's ideal,

217
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:56,940
like I said,

218
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:01,109
unpack it every 10 or 50 or 100 seconds and like hold open a million connections

219
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,200
-- and yeah, you can't log into your router anymore
-- and then you're stuck.

220
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,909
But, but again, the, the denial of service problem is magnitudes less bad

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,780
than

222
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,799
a root shell.

223
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,890
Well, it's uh you say that,

224
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,750
but remember in pastors in these open ssh issues where then

225
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,270
remember where

226
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,140
oftentimes people have devices running open

227
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,409
SSH and they don't have physical access

228
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:28,179
to them very easily and they don't have like we're talking of routers,

229
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,260
points of presence.

230
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:33,869
-- No, I get that. I get that.
-- And so this is definitely a thing where

231
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,440
hypothetical example, you know,

232
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,780
an attacker could prevent you from logging into

233
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,510
the device to update it and hold those,

234
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,599
you know, use that do not like if you implement this work,

235
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,969
quote unquote workaround or I don't want to call it a mitigation.

236
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,950
It's a workaround

237
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:51,460
because it actually works around the bug but also has harmful effects. Right?

238
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:54,580
To me, a mitigation is more of a like, oh, you know, there's a ditch here.

239
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,190
So we put up a sign saying ditch and that didn't work. So we put up a fence

240
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,640
but I'm not gonna argue

241
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,450
semantics.

242
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,549
Um But back to this. Yeah, I would say the log and grace time thing is, is,

243
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,059
yeah, be aware that somebody could denial of,

244
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,859
well,

245
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:11,349
they could prevent you from ever logging into that device again,

246
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,750
remotely basically,

247
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,419
right?

248
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,460
-- And depending on your threat profile that may or may not be an issue. Uh
-- Sure, sure.

249
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,669
But I, I don't know.

250
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,289
I mean, I guess here is the,

251
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,929
the things that the big ideas I have in my mind as I think about this one.

252
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,190
First of all, I feel like there hasn't been like a good

253
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,385
promote code execution bug in a long time.

254
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,484
And part of me wonders is that because we

255
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,125
are getting better at not making these mistakes in

256
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:41,625
things like open ssh or is it because people

257
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,315
who discover bugs like this are selling them to governments

258
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,474
not

259
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,294
releasing advisories to them? Like Wallace did,

260
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,770
I

261
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,609
suspect it's a bit of number two.

262
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,460
However, those attacks do then get discovered because people are like,

263
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:00,489
why did all my machines get popped or, you know, we traced an attack, right?

264
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,700
And that, that has happened.

265
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,210
But I think there's another factor that you're forgetting, which is

266
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,820
4 billion IP addresses of which about, you know,

267
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,880
3.2 are usable and only 23 million publicly exposed open SSH host.

268
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,340
I think the reality is there's less and less stuff exposed to the internet

269
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:17,836
publicly than they probably

270
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:19,286
past.

271
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:22,606
And what is exposed is port 443, that's

272
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:23,526
-- 80.
-- That's

273
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,637
and actually, so this also lends itself to.

274
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,336
So there's a podcast I was listening to the other day. It's called, um,

275
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,507
security cryptography, whatever.

276
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:36,026
Like actually security cryptography, whatever or you just forgot the third word.

277
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,796
-- Yeah,
-- that's the name of the podcast. I'll put, I'll put a link in the show.

278
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:40,856
It's actually really good show.

279
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:42,956
They have marked out on the top,

280
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:44,833
talk about zero day markets, right?

281
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:46,604
Like selling experts and things like that and,

282
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,443
and marks a security researcher from, like, way back in the day,

283
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,924
like us Geezers, we know the name.

284
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:55,114
And it was fascinating to me because, like,

285
00:12:55,184 --> 00:13:00,223
the conversation was almost exclusively geared towards, like, phones.

286
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:03,963
But if you think about it, like, that's the marketplace today, right?

287
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,583
Where is all your pi I

288
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:06,193
-- the
-- phone?

289
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:09,244
Yeah, the phone is where it's at. For sure. Exactly.

290
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,181
The fascinating thing related to that is uh the market for KVM exploits.

291
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,500
Now, Google is paying $250,000 for KVM exploits.

292
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,731
-- What
-- is KVM for us nubs

293
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,091
kernel virtual machine?

294
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,260
So that's the Linux virtualization layer that essentially

295
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,741
-- all of the cloud runs on top of
-- and

296
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,330
everything, even,

297
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,741
even when you're running like container stuff now, like everything is,

298
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,051
-- is KVM magic
-- underneath.

299
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,260
And I, I was actually kind of surprised because if I had a KVM like exploit

300
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,469
escape, whatever

301
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,830
a quarter million dollars is actually not a lot of money for what that's worth.

302
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,830
I, I don't think that is unreasonable. So here's the deal.

303
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,630
If you are going to sell something like this,

304
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:53,630
you generally aren't selling an A bug,

305
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,070
you're selling

306
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,460
a kill chain

307
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,159
where you need to get from.

308
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,260
OK. Let's, let's assume you can log in, I'm going to get you from login to host.

309
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,619
Yeah. Right. And that's very different.

310
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,299
And you know, we've talked about that and passed on the mobile, you know,

311
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,590
with Pegasus and, uh, I forget the name of the evil company and everything.

312
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,950
I'm totally spacing out, what was the name of that evil company we talked about,

313
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,409
-- I, they talked about it a ton in that podcast.
-- Even the NSO

314
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:20,690
N

315
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:21,500
A group. Yes.

316
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,510
Yeah. Sorry.

317
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:26,030
And, and so what does this all have in common with? Node IP.

318
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,609
Well, node IP had somebody report a

319
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,770
air quotes security flaw

320
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,200
where it doesn't handle certain things correctly.

321
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,109
And the maintainer basically said, look in the context of node IP,

322
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,270
it's not a vulnerability

323
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,640
and he got fed up. But everybody else kind of pointed out.

324
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:44,760
Well, sort of technically true. But node IP doesn't

325
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:48,289
live on an island by itself. It's usually part of something else.

326
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,250
And in that context, it is absolutely vulnerable

327
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,090
and they basically,

328
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:56,349
some people argued with him and the end result was he marked the github

329
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,429
repo archives read only and has kind of

330
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,630
taken his ball and gone away.

331
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,250
Yes.

332
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,270
And, and that's similar to open SSH portable because the reality is at

333
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,260
least the open BS D developers,

334
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,390
they, you know, they're humans, they have flaws.

335
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,619
But one of the things they do actually practically get

336
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,479
is that open SSH on non open BS D systems

337
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,380
has problems that like pure open SSH does not because of like for example,

338
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,919
that integration with system D

339
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:27,224
or uh you know D bus and all that stuff

340
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,724
that came around last time.

341
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:29,455
And this, you know,

342
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,905
the login handling with this grace failure stuff doesn't happen on open

343
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:34,424
uh open BS D

344
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,034
but does happen everywhere else.

345
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:39,395
But they at least have the good sense to understand that. And then to, you know,

346
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,085
behave somewhat maturely and fix it properly

347
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,375
and not like, argue, it's not a bug because like in,

348
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:49,715
they could say, look, it's not a bug on open BS D like too bad,

349
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,494
right? We're not going to fix it.

350
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,169
That's not how open SSH portable has ever worked though.

351
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,349
No. And I'm saying that's a good thing, right?

352
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,539
Whereas there's other projects like this note IP

353
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,489
that went the opposite way of saying like,

354
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,690
yeah, no,

355
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,489
we're not going to fix it and we're gonna actually

356
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,909
like have a tantrum and take away our ball,

357
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,630
you know, Mark, mark the uh repos archived.

358
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,010
-- I don't
-- feel like calling it a tantrum is appropriate.

359
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,090
What is the upside of

360
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:19,534
-- marking it archived and not handing it off or not?
-- How do you hand this stuff off even?

361
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:23,135
I mean, is maybe JIA Tan is looking for a new project to work on?

362
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:24,775
Well, for example,

363
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,424
I'm pretty sure if he went to maybe either put a notice

364
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,864
on the front saying I want somebody to take over this and you'll

365
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,304
have to prove to me that you're valid by being a part of

366
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:36,215
the community or getting people in the community to vouch for you.

367
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,414
But there's ways to do this.

368
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:39,375
But

369
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:41,695
they're marking it. Here's the thing,

370
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,650
the node IP package gets 17.5 million downloads a week.

371
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:50,429
Yes. Actually, is this not archived anymore?

372
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,450
I think the github

373
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,450
repo is un archive now.

374
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,169
Uh It is, you are correct. Did somebody else who's the owner of it?

375
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,840
-- I don't
-- know if the owner changed or what's happened. But here's the thing,

376
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:05,150
if you own an open source project and you want to archive the repo because you're mad,

377
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,680
you get to do that.

378
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:08,800
But you have the

379
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,160
well,

380
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,329
but this is a classic case of just because you have the

381
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,310
right to do something doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

382
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,239
I I'm not saying it was the right thing to do,

383
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:22,819
but I also don't think it

384
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,880
is acceptable to pile on blame on the developer.

385
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,439
These developers are under immense pressure

386
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,439
and when you are tired and angry and

387
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,390
overworked and burnt out,

388
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,719
you don't always make good choices.

389
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,420
One comment I would also have and I think people forget this a lot.

390
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,050
So on Matron,

391
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:43,339
perfect example,

392
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:44,050
I

393
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,209
will block anybody that is rude to me, which is fine.

394
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:50,290
I also realized I will block anybody that is not interesting.

395
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,540
Like if they kind of keep tooting at me

396
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,770
and they're not saying very interesting things.

397
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,479
I'm I'm also fine with that because you get those like link farmers who

398
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,829
just at a bunch of people hoping. So

399
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:05,130
this is a person who's like trying to be argumentative and clever,

400
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,670
but they're not actually that clever, they

401
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,729
kind of wrong.

402
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,150
And I realized like,

403
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,329
if you and I were having a conversation in public and somebody came up to us and said,

404
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,829
you know, I really like the old says podcast.

405
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,619
We'd be like, cool, thank you. Like, awesome.

406
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:22,890
And then if they kind of kept trying to talk about feral weasels, we'd be like, ok,

407
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,349
that's cool.

408
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,650
But like me and Josh were trying to have a conversation here,

409
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,489
-- you know, are
-- there un

410
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,300
-- feral weasels?
-- Probably.

411
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,939
But the point is like at some point socially,

412
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,530
like it's ok for us to turn their power back on them

413
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,089
and like have our conversation without them being a part of that.

414
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,479
And I realize

415
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,839
like that and that's, and I think that's part of it is there are

416
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,500
people go from like,

417
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,300
I think people need to start using these old timey social signals of like,

418
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,810
I'm just going to mute you or block you

419
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,290
instead of like

420
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,770
arguing with you and then marking my repos,

421
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,319
archived and running and just getting fed up.

422
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,069
I mean, maybe, but I don't think this is a reasonable comparison.

423
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,709
Kurt, I think you have to look at the issue though.

424
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:07,969
-- The issue is full of people saying please fix this.
-- But here's the thing.

425
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,910
If 1000 people are asking him to fix it, maybe

426
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,569
that's the

427
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,300
thing to do

428
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,739
and not doing it is, you know, I,

429
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,579
it's tough.

430
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,770
Like I look at open source and I say yes, the people doing open source, you know,

431
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
they wrote it, they gave it away.

432
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:24,339
They, they really shouldn't have things piled on them that they have to do.

433
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,229
But at the same time to, to go to a bad analogy in Holland in the olden days,

434
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,939
you know, if you lived next to the sea, you were responsible for a piece of dyke.

435
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,729
And the thing is if

436
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,530
100 people are responsible for 100 pieces of dyke

437
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,060
and one of them doesn't do their job,

438
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,020
all 100 people suffer,

439
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:43,329
right? Not just

440
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,310
the one with the bad dyke, but everybody gets flooded.

441
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,469
And so there was this expectation that if you

442
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,609
couldn't take care of that piece of dyke,

443
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,410
then,

444
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:51,979
well,

445
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,489
it's time for you to give up your farm because you're putting everybody else at risk.

446
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,050
And I think

447
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:58,550
the reality of the world is, is a bad open source package puts a,

448
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,500
a lot of people at risk.

449
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,849
But

450
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,459
I, I also had a heart. I have a hard time

451
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,719
reconciling that with.

452
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:06,540
So now this person who did all this free work and gave it away for free,

453
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,939
we're gonna make him do more work.

454
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:10,369
Like I, I don't think that's the solution,

455
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,050
but we still have this huge pile of risk and problem.

456
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:17,979
I have no idea what you're even talking about at this point.

457
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,130
I, I don't think you can clarify at this point.

458
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,140
What I'm saying is basically we

459
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,790
can't

460
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:27,630
realistically expect open source developers to always do the right thing.

461
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,989
-- That's not fair and it's not feasible.
-- No, we definitely can't.

462
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:31,439
I agree.

463
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,609
But at the same time then what do we do with this pile

464
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,589
of risk where they have a security flaw that they're refusing to fix?

465
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:38,150
Is it a security flaw?

466
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,750
Yeah,

467
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,589
when it's integrated with other software in dangerous ways

468
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,030
and there's been a ton of those where,

469
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,219
you know, CV E intersection flaws even more.

470
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,790
So where you have two pieces of soft, we're both doing the correct

471
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,369
thing in their own world. But when they talk together

472
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,339
-- they, something goes a bit sideways and it becomes a security flaw.
-- Ok.

473
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,560
I mean,

474
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:57,969
I don't think we can talk through this and I

475
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,420
think you're becoming dangerously close to sounding like a fool.

476
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,640
-- This is a hard problem.
-- No. What I'm saying is, it is a hard problem and I, I,

477
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:09,520
but we can't keep ignoring this risk and saying like, ok, you know,

478
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,670
he says it's not a flaw.

479
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,439
-- Ok.
-- This is

480
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,760
been a common

481
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:19,229
occurrence in software where a vendor says we don't think this is a bug.

482
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,130
We don't think this is a security issue.

483
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,290
I mean, there's the, the age old joke of it's not a bug, it's a feature, right?

484
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,770
It is easy for us to disagree with vendors.

485
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,109
It is easy for us to disagree with open source projects.

486
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,560
Well, I think part of it is by the nature of open source,

487
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,050
these disagreements happen in public and they're actually known.

488
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,729
Whereas for all we know there's a

489
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:41,369
million people emailing Microsoft every day asking them

490
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,170
to fix a security flaw and Microsoft's ignoring it and we would never know.

491
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,319
-- I'm
-- sure they get tens of thousands of emails like that a day is my suspicion.

492
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,589
And, and the other thing too is just to also load this.

493
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,219
There is the argument that says, look, if you're using a,

494
00:21:56,229 --> 00:22:00,119
a library like node IP and it's insecure and you don't like that, it's insecure.

495
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,290
Go write your own use something different, like go deal with it.

496
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,329
But again,

497
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:08,140
that ignores the problem of the sort of the economic cost of fixing it

498
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,910
quickly in one place versus forcing a million people to do something different,

499
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,199
right?

500
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:15,420
11 of these is a more efficient solution, which is why open source one,

501
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,359
right, open source is by its nature, very efficient.

502
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,160
You know, Solaris used to make their own kernel in OS

503
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,510
and Linux murdered them on the efficiency of development cost scale.

504
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,949
Well, it also is because the Solaris computer cost $100,000 and a Linux

505
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,329
-- machine ran
-- on again, eco economics of scale.

506
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:33,719
I mean, look,

507
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:33,839
I

508
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:38,510
don't want to keep beating this dead horse because there, there isn't a good answer.

509
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:38,729
The,

510
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:41,290
the the reality is there isn't an answer and this is

511
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,750
related to something I've been thinking about a lot lately,

512
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,880
but it is also a topic very hard to get anyone to actually care

513
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,839
about is if you look at basically

514
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,010
any graph around vulnerabilities or software today,

515
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,989
it is all exponential growth.

516
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,560
Any way you look at it, you got exponential growth.

517
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,369
The Linux kernel is like, oh,

518
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,589
we're going to label

519
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,619
everything

520
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,979
that looks and smells like a security flaw

521
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,030
and that's 2000 so far this year with being on track for like 5000

522
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,270
-- and people are freaking out and like, but
-- the point is like they're,

523
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,270
they're noticing that, but it's everywhere you look, it's exponential growth.

524
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,670
And I think that exponential growth is finally catching up to us as an industry.

525
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,359
And there's a lot of people ignoring it though. Like

526
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,910
I have been trying to submit

527
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,219
this talk to a lot of conferences to be like, look,

528
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:32,099
this is a real problem and we need people to start understanding this.

529
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,589
It has been rejected literally everywhere.

530
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,010
And I've submitted this to places where the people should know

531
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,640
better and they should even understand this and they don't.

532
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,280
-- And
-- I think a quick summary of this is

533
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,603
all of Linux source code unpacked used to fit

534
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,243
on a like 100 megabyte hard drive.

535
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:51,633
And now when you com the compiled Linux kernel wouldn't even fit on that hard drive.

536
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:55,343
And I'd actually, I kind of wonder now how many lines of code

537
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:58,083
is an average web application

538
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,483
ultimately comprised of. And I'm gonna assume it's in the millions.

539
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:02,593
Probably it's

540
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:05,225
-- gigantic because of all the no J
-- S.

541
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:08,066
It's not even so much exponential growth of vulnerabilities.

542
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:10,806
It's that we had exponential growth of software

543
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,615
of everything. Yes. No, it's not just vulnerabilities.

544
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,706
It's of literally the world, right?

545
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:19,576
Everything you look at in technology, the number of devices that exist,

546
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:21,365
the number of things running the number of

547
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,485
apps, everything

548
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:24,086
take any data point

549
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,115
and it's exponential growth.

550
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,105
And I think the problem with exponential growth

551
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:30,125
is when you realize it's exponential growth,

552
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,836
it's too late.

553
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:31,630
You're

554
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,800
gonna double in a couple of months. So it, it hardly matters.

555
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,160
And I think this is all related to that.

556
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,310
I think

557
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,619
we don't know what to do with any of this because it's growing too fast.

558
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,459
Like my other favorite is when you have people

559
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:48,770
with N you know NVD collapsed and they're like,

560
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:48,880
oh,

561
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,660
it needs to go back to normal and it's like it

562
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,640
can't go back to normal because normal is a decade ago.

563
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,329
What you think normal is, has been gone for so long. It's not even funny.

564
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,599
It was funny to me when I, when I mentioned, you know,

565
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:03,099
I worked at Red Hat and I assigned six or 8000 CV S, you know,

566
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:07,463
Red Hat Hat was handling back when we left like 3000 CV S a year,

567
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,652
basically about 10 a day.

568
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:11,572
And it's funny when people talk about, oh,

569
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:13,062
I have to handle so many security vulnerability.

570
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:16,042
I'm like, yeah, Red Hat. We handled like, 3000 a year and they're like, what?

571
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,152
And I'm like, yeah,

572
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:18,873
across 100 products, like,

573
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,902
or sorry, 100 and 12 products when I was there.

574
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,392
And a lot of people,

575
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,203
when they start to learn about what, like making cookies. Oh, my God.

576
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,656
Every time, see, like a house it's made Cookie Factory. It's like

577
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:35,345
I can't, can does humanity need that many cookies? Apparently. Yes,

578
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,546
you can never have too many cookies.

579
00:25:37,556 --> 00:25:39,056
-- And
-- that's the thing with software is now,

580
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,786
is people forget that we have how many

581
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:44,186
millions of people literally churning out code,

582
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,505
integrating code, deploying code. It's ridiculous.

583
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,995
It's like the road system when you start to think about

584
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:52,865
how much Edmonton spent on its road system over the years.

585
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,420
And you know, we've got

586
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:58,510
all we need to tie this all back up because we had open ssh,

587
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,859
we have node IP.

588
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,219
And yes, I think the scale is part of it.

589
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,859
-- I think that's a good explanation
-- and we live inside of it so

590
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,564
much so that we don't notice it until next people are going like,

591
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,765
yeah, I don't want to fix that. Go away.

592
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,055
But, but you,

593
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:15,885
you have to, what do we do? No, you can't, you can't not do that.

594
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:17,744
Well, yeah, that person absolutely can

595
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,864
-- just not do that.
-- Maybe,

596
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:23,084
I guess here's here's how I want to end it and here's a question.

597
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,954
So, what, what do, what do we do? I'm a person.

598
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,515
What do I do

599
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:29,435
the open ssh problem?

600
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:30,555
Ironically,

601
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:34,175
I would say update your package except Red Hat still hasn't released an update.

602
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,180
Yeah.

603
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,849
And they called it important.

604
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:41,849
-- So
-- there two things that you can do that are somewhat useful,

605
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:47,209
which is one except reality for what it is and stop trying to

606
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,130
argue that it's not real or it's not a problem

607
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,339
because I see a lot of that and number two

608
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,199
is,

609
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,699
is in general

610
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,670
having more mature and efficient processes.

611
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,109
Now, I didn't say anything about security.

612
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,949
I just said processes, be it, security business, whatever,

613
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:05,010
writing

614
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,170
code tests having. So for example, like once here's the thing I love is, you know,

615
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,770
does anybody actually

616
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,660
test software updates before they deploy them?

617
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,640
Why do you, I mean, actually really test them?

618
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,180
And the answer is like, not really

619
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,109
like we just all sort of assume when you type,

620
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,089
you know, whatever hyphen you open ssh

621
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:26,010
it'll update and just magically work because well, it does

622
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,750
in

623
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,410
most of the time. Well, it's different. Look, I think

624
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,515
there's also a different way to look at the problem because you back in the day.

625
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:39,345
Yeah, you had to test updates because you had a computer running software

626
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,095
and you'd install an update on that computer and there

627
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:44,755
was no really good way to roll that back.

628
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:47,556
But if you have a proper

629
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:49,235
system today,

630
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:52,135
you've got things like containers and virtual machines and

631
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:55,261
you can take snapshots and you can deploy an update

632
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:56,781
and then check if it worked.

633
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:59,381
And if it didn't work, you just roll back to the one that did work.

634
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,261
And so it's kind of a different world in that regard

635
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,302
and that perfectly speaks to that efficiency argument of use these tools,

636
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,552
use the power tools, use them efficiently.

637
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,391
And yeah, and then you can just deploy updates willy nilly.

638
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:13,241
And if they break, roll them back,

639
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:14,781
I mean, it's just,

640
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,579
I think this is the world we live in now.

641
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,459
Everything is wild.

642
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:25,560
You're gonna have critical vulnerabilities in applications and you're gonna

643
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:28,849
have people arguing about how exploitable it is or isn't

644
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,380
-- and
-- or just simply not tripping an update in a timely manner,

645
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:33,339
which is

646
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,040
weird.

647
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:35,619
But

648
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,540
whatever I guess

649
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,520
-- like does Red Hat even support 32 bits
-- still.

650
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,010
I hope not.

651
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,780
They might, there might be some architecture but,

652
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,859
but regardless the optics of the issue, right?

653
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:48,459
I think

654
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,219
the reality is you're fine, but the optics tell me

655
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,869
why have you released an update for this?

656
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,109
And, and I think open source is similar,

657
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,400
there's like optics versus reality and the optics of,

658
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,920
you know, rage quitting your project

659
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,680
sends a certain signal

660
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:11,219
and the optics of like using open source and demanding fixes from

661
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:15,829
people that you have no relationship with sends a certain signal,

662
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:19,630
I mean, and, and I, I think it all comes back to like,

663
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,199
this is exponential growth. This is the world we're in now.

664
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,459
And the reality is we have no idea what to do

665
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,099
in all of the various serious people.

666
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:34,739
They don't even understand the problem, which I think makes it even worse.

667
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,829
And I, I, something you just said, took the thought,

668
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,569
-- it's not just exponential growth, it's exponential
-- use, it's exponential,

669
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,739
everything

670
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,847
like everything.

671
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,197
Well, no, but when, when you say exponential growth,

672
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,666
I think a lot of people think of it from the supply side

673
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:52,136
and not the demand use side,

674
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:52,766
right?

675
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:55,987
-- I I view them as similar
-- and that's a big thing where a lot of people

676
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:59,156
get it wrong because like this node IP thing is a great example of like,

677
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,796
well, it's, it's just a stupid little library.

678
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:05,526
-- How much could it matter? Well, 17.5 million times a week
-- and it's also an N PM.

679
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:08,327
So everyone running node,

680
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,266
it, it, it's a mess.

681
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:13,813
I mean, even if half of those polls are like automated systems,

682
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:16,354
-- I
-- bet 90% are automated systems.

683
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:21,154
But even if it's a 90% like it's still 1.7 million a week,

684
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,264
that's a lot of potentially affected apps.

685
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:24,553
So like

686
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,663
in summary, I don't know,

687
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:30,874
like I said, accept reality and you know, try to be efficient,

688
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,913
which ironically is also part of what landed us here is by being efficient.

689
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:38,604
-- That is una actionable advice. Kurt
-- accepting reality is absolutely

690
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
-- stop arguing with reality. In
-- fact, I'm

691
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,061
arguing with you right now.

692
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,461
I mean, I, I get it, we couldn't,

693
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,380
we couldn't even get people to wash their hands like that email

694
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,610
we got that I posted on mast on where somebody's like,

695
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm not going to say what he said. Exactly, because it's so gross.

696
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,260
But, you know,

697
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,691
the person basically was arguing against washing

698
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,620
their hands after using the washroom.

699
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,500
I

700
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:01,571
don't

701
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,740
-- remember this, but it's a
-- few days ago. Anyways,

702
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,020
I part of this.

703
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,810
Yeah, I think anyways, this person said, you know, I like the O SI podcast.

704
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:13,520
But regarding hand washing, I don't wash my hands because my dad taught me to,

705
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,260
you know, basically not wash my hands after using the bathroom.

706
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,319
I do not have any recollect. I don't think I've seen this.

707
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:20,380
-- I wonder if it went to my spam. It
-- might

708
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,479
-- have gotten blocked because of certain keywords.
-- Holy cow.

709
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,680
-- Anyway,
-- they

710
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,079
put it on Mastodon and it's like this is why I don't shake hands and

711
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,280
generally look at your master.

712
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,160
Although I don't look at social media very much like it's nothing like it used to be

713
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:34,594
on social media.

714
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:35,915
I don't know. Anyway.

715
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:40,094
All right, I'm going to call this one, I guess in summary, go update your SSH servers.

716
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:41,395
Everyone

717
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:42,714
wants to give you a package.

718
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:46,354
Hopefully, hopefully all the updates will be released by the time this show is out.

719
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,555
So,

720
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:50,474
whatever, you gotta love it, man. All right. Thank you, Kurt.

721
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:51,505
