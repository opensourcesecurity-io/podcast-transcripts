Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,149
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Sidewalk Crime.

2
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:12,819
Josh Pressers Sidewalk.

3
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:17,229
This was a marvelous opportunity to make a joke

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,190
about Mr rogers' neighborhood and you blew it.

5
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:23,180
-- I don't
-- want to drag Mr Rogers into this. He's, he's better than us.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,790
-- That's
-- true.

7
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,319
-- He's a lovely person.
-- I was going to say he's better than this, but he's better than us

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,709
actually. So I have a little side tangent story. I'll tell it is

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,959
there was, I,

10
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,029
I don't know if there was some anniversary or

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,270
birthday or something that happened with Mr Rogers,

12
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,189
but there was

13
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:41,479
a number of specials on my local public television station about Mr Rogers.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,020
And of course,

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,020
during these, they're doing their usual pledge drive. Like please give us money and

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,759
as someone who they call them sustaining members

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,319
where I just give them a monthly amount

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,229
annoy me to no end because I'm like, I'm already giving you money.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,299
-- Like give me a secret channel or something.
-- Skip a skip a

20
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:57,950
seriously.

21
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:59,040
-- Both
-- of my

22
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,869
Children, they're doing this little, you know,

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,029
send us money and they have a Mr Rogers tote bag you can get.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Which of course, if you ever watch any public television,

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,870
like a tote bag is like the default gift for donating.

26
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:11,949
And

27
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,940
my kids thought I was nuts because I literally, like, went and got my computer

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,150
and gave them more money just to get this tote

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,949
bag because I really liked it and I wanted it.

30
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,879
-- So I paid an enormous amount of money for a tote
-- bag.

31
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:28,150
I paid 100 bucks for a coffee cup for the, uh, for the reading Rainbow Kickstarter.

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,489
Why not? Right. I did not do that. Which makes me sad. But in

33
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,349
fairness they raised

34
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,879
was it $6 million in a week?

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,699
-- And they wanted a million. So
-- everybody loves reading

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:38,900
Rainbow

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,699
Levar.

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,690
Burton is almost as cool as Mr Rogers.

39
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,930
All right. All right. Anyway,

40
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:50,040
today we're going to talk about Amazon Sidewalk, which is, we'll say the opposite

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,010
of the neighborhood of make believe in every possible way.

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,349
And what's interesting is

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,930
I think it's only available in America because I cannot find it

44
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:01,430
on my account to disable. I don't think they're doing it

45
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,430
outside of America right now.

46
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,379
We should explain what this is before we start bashing it.

47
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,020
Ok.

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,580
So long story short, Apple, very cleverly realized

49
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,250
we have the world's largest distributed network

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,259
iphones

51
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,940
and so they can do things like find my iphone

52
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,979
and originally find my iphone, you know,

53
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,330
worked over Wi Fi and the internet and stuff.

54
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:26,070
So I can see, you know, I can see, oh, like I left my ipad.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,410
Oh, funny story once I visited my sister and we accidentally swapped ipads.

56
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,610
So I guess the moral of the story is if you

57
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,759
have the exact same case on your ipad as someone else,

58
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,660
maybe make sure it's actually your ipad before you pack it in your bag.

59
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,050
-- Whatever, that's easier said than done. Nobody checks that
-- anyways.

60
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,759
But then Apple realized, you know, with, through some cryptographic pokey,

61
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,949
jiggery and magic,

62
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,339
we could have all these Bluetooth devices that we've deployed A K A iphones,

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,029
uh essentially report their Bluetooth ID securely and thus

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,610
vastly improve the effectiveness and the coverage of like

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,350
find my iphone. Well, also find my ipad, find my computer, whatever.

66
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,089
And they've even extended that now to those Apple

67
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,929
tags. I forget what they're called air

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,570
tags, air

69
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,839
-- tags. Thank you. Right. Because like I have tile tags.
-- Amazon owns tile now. Right.

70
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:14,690
Well, exactly.

71
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,690
And so, you know, Amazon is jealous of Apple

72
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:18,740
and they're,

73
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,520
well, Apple has

74
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,179
again,

75
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,699
like the world's largest network for coverage of

76
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,699
looking for Bluetooth items that have been lost.

77
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,710
And so Amazon wanted to do this and of course,

78
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:32,139
what's interesting to me is nobody seemed to really mind Apple doing this,

79
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,830
but I think Apple did it in a way that was,

80
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,770
you know, much lower bandwidth and much less intrusive.

81
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:38,350
Amazon, of course, did not do that.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,860
Amazon is like, oh, it'll only use up to 500 megabytes per month of your data

83
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,470
on your internet. Which,

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,380
well, ok. Hang on. We,

85
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,139
I think we're missing an important piece of this is you, you dove into Apple.

86
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,610
But fundamentally what Amazon is doing is

87
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:56,270
they've created this program called Amazon Sidewalk,

88
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,389
which basically is going to turn

89
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,979
a bunch of Amazon devices like your echoes and your rings

90
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,285
and that's sort of thing

91
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:11,455
into a large mesh network. The intent of this I don't think is totally clear.

92
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:15,725
It's to support their iot devices and to support their lost stuff.

93
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,494
And, but the problem is,

94
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:21,803
and historically, Amazon has a lot of my purchasing data

95
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,174
and while they don't really share it externally,

96
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,165
they do use it to harass me to buy stuff.

97
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,410
I, I think there's some other pieces to this though.

98
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:37,410
Amazon is basically, people have these devices, they're opting you into this.

99
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,290
You have to opt out. There's no like, sort of opt in

100
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:41,940
because

101
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,010
it's like we've discovered with organ donors and blood donors that, you know,

102
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:49,730
you got to make people opt out otherwise only 3% will opt in.

103
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,010
Right. Well, and, and I love how

104
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,570
in the Apple Universe

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,250
they're basically blocking a bunch of information

106
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,779
to advertisers unless, unless you opt in and Facebook is having a conniption.

107
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,019
-- Yes,
-- it is the end of the western world as we know

108
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,859
it. It's absolutely hilarious.

109
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,320
I love it. It's so good.

110
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,970
But so anyway, anyway,

111
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,140
so Amazon has sidewalk and a bunch of people are kind of making a big deal about it.

112
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:20,179
I think your parallels drawn with Apple are very interesting and fair

113
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,279
because you're right,

114
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,559
Apple's doing very similar things and no one seems to care but Amazon

115
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,820
-- does it and everyone starts losing their mind
-- and Amazon has stated that,

116
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,070
you know, the data will only go to their Amazon services.

117
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,119
-- It's not like they're providing general internet access to these devices,
-- right?

118
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,230
And so my favorite part is if you look on the Amazon sidewalk,

119
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,109
they talk about how secure it is because it's encrypted.

120
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,429
And it's like the thing I keep thinking of is

121
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,940
I'm not worried about hackers stealing this in transit.

122
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm worried about you having it

123
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,890
when it gets there.

124
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,529
And there was that tweet about that guy who, you know,

125
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,910
visited his mother and now he's getting ads for his mother's toothpaste brand.

126
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,730
And some people on hacker news pointed out, look, I mean,

127
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,709
if you think you have privacy, no, you know, geolocation of your phone,

128
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,959
it's tied to your credit card, it's tied to your accounts.

129
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,980
I mean,

130
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:13,420
I I remember the kind of data that choice point had on me 1015 years ago

131
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,730
and that's only vastly improved, right?

132
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:19,160
Data storage is effectively free at scale now like

133
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,619
to store a makeup by on every American

134
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,239
you can buy a single compute device for under $10,000 that will do that.

135
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,299
Right.

136
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,579
You know, we talked about this in the magic of Santa Claus or the,

137
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,299
the crime of Santa Claus or whatever that

138
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,000
the point is like

139
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,160
the amount of data and data correlation going on is amazing.

140
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,019
And I fully trust and expect Amazon

141
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,980
to try to use it to jam more ads and more junk down my throat.

142
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,239
I mean, there's recently the, the Amazon Prime controversy where

143
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,040
they're apparently inflating prices on prime

144
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,989
items because I'll probably buy it because, hey, prime shipping,

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,260
it will just arrive here quickly because

146
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:00,369
I needed a new copy of, uh, The Hungry Caterpillar. And

147
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,359
the one on Prime is like $10 more than the one on, you know, the, the chapters.

148
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,649
It's like our big Canadian white bookseller.

149
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,869
Yeah. But, and I, I was kind of looking at it and I'm like, 35 bucks. Seems

150
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,019
like a lot like, I don't remember this book costing more than about 20 bucks.

151
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:18,279
So I look at chapters and it's like, no, it's like 2025 bucks.

152
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,480
Free shipping.

153
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,329
Not as fast as prime, but

154
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,679
am I gonna pay $10 extra for prime shipping, basically?

155
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, no, I'm, you know,

156
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,959
and so I, I fully anticipate like I like you.

157
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,839
I actually broke down and bought two apple TV. S to get rid of my fires sticks because

158
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,679
I am tired of the host style user experience in the firestick.

159
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:38,339
Yeah.

160
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,239
Did you get the, the new one with the nice remote.

161
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,119
I got the four K with the, I, I just went for the,

162
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,670
the one that was most expensive was like,

163
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,649
30 bucks more than the slightly cheaper one.

164
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,299
So, I was like,

165
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,559
whatever. Just buy the, the biggest one

166
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,850
-- times two
-- is your remote. Aluminum or black.

167
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:54,769
-- It's aluminum.
-- That's

168
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,559
-- the
-- good remote.

169
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,790
Yeah, it's,

170
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,500
it's quite nice. But again, you know, it's,

171
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,760
I'm ok with buying stuff. I do need to buy stuff. I'm a North American.

172
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:03,660
That's how we function.

173
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,549
But

174
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,010
at the same time I'm sort of getting tired of Amazon trying to

175
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,029
constantly just shove stuff down my throat and tricking me like that,

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,600
that prime, like the hungry Caterpillar does not cost 35 bucks.

177
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,230
-- It
-- does now.

178
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,209
I mean,

179
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,630
you know,

180
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,859
I, I didn't know that. That's interesting because I won't lie is I rarely

181
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:30,059
look past Amazon if I need something quick where it's just like I load up Amazon.

182
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,340
I buy what I need and whatever. I don't think twice about it.

183
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,260
But I'm going to maybe pay attention to some of this now because that's interesting.

184
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,299
And the thing is, again, yeah, I tend to,

185
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,960
when I'm shopping I tend to click that prime button because I don't want to

186
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,739
because, you know, again, the scam aspect of you order something and it's,

187
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,679
it ships in 6 to 8 months

188
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,320
like you with your laptop.

189
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:55,580
It's down to August 31st as the date now

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,140
that it's supposed to ship.

191
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,210
So we'll see it, it, every, every couple of weeks they decrease it a little bit.

192
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,140
So, anyway, anyway, we're talking about sidewalk here. So

193
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,559
I guess here is

194
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,719
the question I have in my brain that I don't have an

195
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:13,119
answer to because I don't know how I feel about this is

196
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,640
Google has created a massive surveillance network with devices.

197
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,130
Apple has created a massive surveillance network with devices. Amazon wants one

198
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,869
and now we're losing our minds. Why do we care?

199
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,239
Amazon is doing this when countless other companies have already done it,

200
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,159
-- I
-- think because historically Apple has not grossly abused

201
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,969
their position of trust and knowledge over consumers,

202
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,729
but Google has Google has, but,

203
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,150
ah,

204
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,710
-- people have given up, I think with Google
-- maybe.

205
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,010
Well, what's the alternative use?

206
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,650
-- Bing? So
-- actually I have been using duck duck go for

207
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,760
probably three or four months exclusively now for my searching.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,419
And I will say that when I started using,

209
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,000
I would try it every now and then about maybe one or two years ago.

210
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,169
I, I would, every now and then I'd give it a go and be like, all right, it's, it's ok.

211
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:05,700
It's ok.

212
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,219
But now like, it's pretty good.

213
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:13,299
I would highly recommend duck duck go as a, as an acceptable replacement.

214
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,409
I do think Google is slightly better in certain instances,

215
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,099
but generally speaking for my usual searches, I am having

216
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,369
-- complete success with duck. Duck go
-- so

217
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,650
stupid question. But looking at this, how does duck duck go make money?

218
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,440
And it's advertising and affiliate marketing?

219
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,799
They do have some ads but they're, they claim a bunch of privacy.

220
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,849
Are they clearly marked? Unlike, say Google? Where?

221
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,059
-- Yes,
-- the duck duck go ads have a very nice little ad

222
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,789
in the corner. It

223
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:45,500
is, it is, it is where Google used to be and I have no doubt

224
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,890
they will travel the same road

225
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,479
but for the moment

226
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,000
I find them to be an acceptable alternative.

227
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,380
Oh, their ad button is just the same as Google.

228
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,969
It's not super, it's just a little tiny thing at the corner.

229
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:02,039
-- It's,
-- yeah, it's not like blaring the obvious but whatever. It's, it's good enough.

230
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:03,609
I can easily tell the difference.

231
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,369
Yeah, because like I'm at the point where like

232
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:08,445
usually the first page of Google results for

233
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,526
just skip. That stuff

234
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:10,216
is just.

235
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,125
But anyway, anyway.

236
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,835
Ok, so back to my question, why do we care that Amazon is doing this?

237
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,695
-- But we don't care that Apple and
-- Google,

238
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:21,216
I suspect part of it is because people actually own Amazon devices,

239
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,176
people own Google devices.

240
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,986
I mean, every freaking Google phone is just like, like it's a,

241
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:29,565
it's a fire hose of data straight to

242
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,895
Google about everything you've done in your life.

243
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,781
I don't know. It's a good question. Maybe because people here's the thing.

244
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,421
I have a direct relationship with Amazon in a way that I

245
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:42,512
do not with Google and I am actually a paying Google customer.

246
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,952
The majority of people do not have

247
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:49,231
a customer relationship with Google. They don't pay Google for services,

248
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:49,562
right.

249
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,781
They don't buy Google works suite or whatever the

250
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,831
-- hell it's called this
-- week to a degree.

251
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:58,221
And, and that's sort of a fair argument is I did pay Amazon

252
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,192
for

253
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:03,940
my fire TV. S and my echo dots and all of those things.

254
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,200
And now suddenly they're abusing that device.

255
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,619
-- Do
-- I truly own this device? If they can

256
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,659
quickly opt me into,

257
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,359
you know, it's one thing to,

258
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,700
to get automated software updates, but to get opted into a, you know,

259
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,460
this global surveillance network and it literally is,

260
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:22,669
it's meant to be a surveillance network to like find lost Bluetooth devices,

261
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,849
right. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic and crazy and paranoid, but

262
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,260
this is literally what this thing is supposed to be doing.

263
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,260
Right. Right.

264
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,309
Also, historically, Amazon's and Google, well,

265
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:37,419
Amazon's behavior historically has been incredibly abusive of their workers.

266
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:41,309
Well, not just that, look at how they are partnering with law enforcement,

267
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:46,155
with Ring and there, there, it's super sketchy what's going on there. I mean,

268
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:49,005
I feel like Google is stupid,

269
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:54,034
evil and Amazon is true evil in many of these discussions, you know what I mean?

270
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:54,585
Well,

271
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:56,075
I feel like Google still has a lot of

272
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:59,385
influence by engineers who will please don't be evil,

273
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,630
sort of try and do the right thing. But

274
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,590
let's be clear, Amazon is Amazon is Jeff Bezos.

275
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,859
That's it. Like, don't pretend otherwise.

276
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,989
No, I, I, that's true. And he's a ruthless gentleman, for sure.

277
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:16,109
He makes bond villains look grossly incompetent.

278
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:18,869
-- He's
-- got the look like Goldfinger

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,349
was, you know, ridiculous compared to him.

280
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,359
I mean, I don't know. I really wonder about this.

281
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:28,049
I do know I've made a decision now that I'm not going to be buying more Google products

282
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,260
and, and it's not because of the privacy issue even.

283
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,190
It's because none of them work with my Google account.

284
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,460
And people are like, what, what do you mean? They don't work with your Google app?

285
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,890
Well, I have a Google works Suite account.

286
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,890
So my nest stuff,

287
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,609
I can't do two of a with it because it's not supported with a paid Google account.

288
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,909
I pay for youtube premium because I bought

289
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,250
youtube premium hoping to get the family plan.

290
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,570
-- You can't do that with a paid Google account.
-- I know that's so ridiculous.

291
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,289
Same thing with my Google Home Wi Fi.

292
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,830
I have to use the Google home app now which lacks functionality,

293
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,859
including some big stuff. Like what is the speed to my devices?

294
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:04,190
Well, in the old app, it would test it and say like 27 megabits up,

295
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,210
three megabits down whatever, right?

296
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:10,030
In the new one, it says good, sometimes excellent.

297
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,969
And I'm like, what is that?

298
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:14,789
So,

299
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,479
so actually

300
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,239
I have a for, for anyone listening.

301
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,130
I also have some Google devices and I would very much like to get rid of them and I

302
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,039
was going to go ubiquity at one point and I feel like they're maybe kind of on the air.

303
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:30,369
I'm not so sure about this. And so

304
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,849
I don't know what to get if someone has suggestions,

305
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:36,830
like tweet them at me please or send me an email because I would absolutely

306
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:44,474
love to get some suggestions on like good solid home wi fi slash networking,

307
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:49,775
but also not like a fire hose of stealing my data to some terrible company.

308
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,914
-- Well,
-- or a fire hose of, oh, you know,

309
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,094
we added advertising to the interface and also we

310
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,924
took away these features and now they're paid and,

311
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:57,304
you know, it's

312
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:58,905
anyway.

313
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,140
Yeah,

314
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,859
I don't know because I do like the aspect

315
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,580
like the Google wifi does do some things well,

316
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,909
-- in that it ros packets and it just works, it
-- does just work, which is convenient.

317
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,250
And when I got mine just work was

318
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,169
-- we'll say a difficult proposition at the time, especially
-- with mesh networking.

319
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,659
Right. Right. So, ok.

320
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:17,869
So anyway, anyway,

321
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,309
here is where I'm going to interject a great deal of opinion into this conversation.

322
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,150
Here is my thought on this whole Amazon debacle

323
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,380
and everyone has their own pet opinions and things like that.

324
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,909
And I think what has happened is the world is starting

325
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,719
to, we'll say pay attention to privacy like it has never done before.

326
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,969
I think this is where Apple found itself in a convenient position and

327
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,409
it always amuses me that Apple appears to be this privacy champion.

328
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,010
And I think

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,159
my, the reality is Apple probably doesn't give two craps about privacy.

330
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,299
They just happen to find themselves in the right

331
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,799
place at the right time and they're like,

332
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,000
well, you know, hell yeah, like sign me up for this.

333
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,039
But the thing is, I think people are paying attention to this and I think

334
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,020
we,

335
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,530
to a certain degree, subconsciously recognize that

336
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:11,380
Facebook and Google are lost causes. They've gone too far.

337
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,909
-- There's nothing we can do. There's no turning back. I think
-- it's worse than that.

338
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,700
It's the bait and switch aspect of

339
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:17,140
apple doesn't

340
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,580
do a lot of bait and switch. But Google and Amazon

341
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,419
constantly do bait and switch well.

342
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,809
-- But,
-- but Google has bait and switched us to death.

343
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,809
I mean, that's all like my favorite is my kids.

344
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,500
Anytime Google releases a product they joke about when Google is going to kill it.

345
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,340
I think

346
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,659
we've reached this point where people are fed up

347
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,500
and we can now complain about something.

348
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,419
Now, not everyone will because I'm sure like there's,

349
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:46,664
my parents will never hear of what Amazon is doing with their echo dots.

350
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,385
You know, it's just that sort of thing.

351
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:53,544
But I think people are truly starting to pay attention and that, that gives me hope.

352
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:55,275
I think we have a long way to go.

353
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:56,465
But I think

354
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,114
this is less about Amazon and more about just I'm

355
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:03,184
effing tired of all of this. Please stop.

356
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:04,854
And I think that's a big part of it is

357
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:07,305
this bait and switch aspect from Google and Amazon.

358
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,130
And

359
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,709
it's now an understandable privacy problem of, oh, wait,

360
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:16,140
you're just gonna randomly opt me into my network to be part of your

361
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,459
-- global mothership surveillance thing of a jigger.
-- One positive aspect of this I saw

362
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,368
is for example, let's say you have internet in your house

363
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,339
and you have a camera on your garage, but your garage camera can't see

364
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:35,150
your house internet, but it can see the echo.in your kitchen or whatever.

365
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,760
You know what I mean?

366
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:39,680
-- So like there can be value in this mesh network.
-- Absolutely.

367
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:43,040
Like I had um originally with my previous wireless network,

368
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,300
my ring doorbell on the front door is sitting on a big chunk of metal channel,

369
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,640
which is very good at blocking Wi Fi from inside the house.

370
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,213
And so I actually had to put it a Wi Fi extender

371
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:57,072
in the garage like 10 ft away from the doorbell because just

372
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,753
otherwise it was just getting like one or two megabits per second.

373
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:02,373
And then I deployed Google mesh Wi Fi

374
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:07,383
and it's actually connected to the Wi Fi unit up on the upstairs bedroom,

375
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:10,993
which is kind of at a nice anyways, the angles work out basically, right

376
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:11,843
and the problem

377
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:12,426
though

378
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:14,495
it's on a chunk, like most

379
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,105
door frames have

380
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,666
like metal on the outside, you know, flashing or siding or whatever.

381
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:23,765
Because, well, yeah, that's what you do so that it doesn't rot and, oh, yeah.

382
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,145
No, it's, it's stuff like this.

383
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:29,306
I, it would be nice to, you know, if every echo in my house did proper mesh Wi Fi,

384
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,546
I could throw my Google stuff out basically.

385
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:31,985
Right.

386
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,465
Yeah. No, if Amazon's gonna opt me into, to being

387
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,660
part of, maybe it's because there's this clear benefit to them.

388
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,209
There's like a clear line of Amazon doesn't want to pay to deploy this.

389
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:45,270
So they're just opting me in. Maybe that's why people are so upset.

390
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,150
That could certainly be, I don't know. It's, it's interesting.

391
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,290
This is, I think one of those just aspects of human behavior that,

392
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,770
that no one will ever understand that we get upset about one thing and not another.

393
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,569
-- It's,
-- and it's just, it's not just one aspect of this, right?

394
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,180
For many people, like I know for myself,

395
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,930
there's sort of three or four things I'm annoyed about with respect to this

396
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,770
and I suspect there's probably a constellation of

397
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,369
20 or 30 reasons in total if you interviewed

398
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,569
1000 people.

399
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,569
But yeah, no, that's a good point why,

400
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,969
because Apple has opted us into a whole bunch of

401
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,530
this tracking stuff with not a lot of consent.

402
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,520
So, I mean, in all serious, this air tags.

403
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,290
That's how air tags literally work.

404
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,869
They, so one thing that's really interesting is there's,

405
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,530
I think it might have been the eff published a story about air tags where basically

406
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,609
the reporter, someone put an airtag and someone,

407
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,099
-- it was using it as a stalking tracker thing.
-- Right. Right. Right. Right.

408
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,479
And there's so what's wild is

409
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:41,790
like if I put an air tag in your bag, I can obviously track it.

410
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,079
Now if you have an Apple device,

411
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,829
your Apple device because this happens because my wife has an Airtag,

412
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,449
my phone will be like, hey,

413
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,349
there's an Airtag following you around

414
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,050
and I'm like, yes, it's fine.

415
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:54,930
Right? And I can't be like, yes, it's fine. Never like never show up again.

416
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:59,130
It says don't show up for a while and then like a week or two later.

417
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,290
-- And,
-- and that's one thing Apple got right on those things is they,

418
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,130
their engineers are trying to do the right thing because for example,

419
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,810
I own some tile devices and they, they do nothing like that.

420
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,729
Right. Right. And so, I mean, I totally get the whole stalker aspect of this because

421
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:16,729
like historically, a lot of these devices were

422
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,829
push the button, make a beep.

423
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,930
And if it's not near you,

424
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,699
you're sol there's value in having the ability to track things for long distances.

425
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,469
But obviously the whole like just

426
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,170
-- tracking and spying angle is disturbing.
-- I'm divorced.

427
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,209
My kids live in two households there was a case where my son lost,

428
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:38,140
he put his phone in a basket of his mother's house and it was quote unquote,

429
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:39,410
lost.

430
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,420
And I'm like, well, I know it's at your house,

431
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,459
like, I'm not trying to be difficult but it's at your house, like,

432
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,020
and, but the battery just died. So I can't make it ping otherwise I would make it ping

433
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,000
and they eventually found it under a, you know, a thing of wool, like it had

434
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,099
kind of slipped under something

435
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:57,380
ball of yarn or whatever,

436
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:01,619
you know. And so, but so there's, there is a lot of,

437
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,380
there are a lot of common use cases where people,

438
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,280
Children live in multiple households.

439
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:10,140
Uh, you know, I remember in the before time there was a lot of people who went to,

440
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,479
I forget how to pronounce it.

441
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:11,699
W

442
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,939
it was like these big buildings that, where people would congregate and,

443
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,689
and, and do stuff together

444
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:19,619
to get paid

445
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,939
and, you know, sometimes they forget their stuff there.

446
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,520
I think there's huge value in this.

447
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,250
But yeah, it's, it's, are we making it hard for stalkers to abuse?

448
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,199
Are we making it privacy friendly? And

449
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:32,180
in Apple's case, they seem to be trying. And in Amazon's case,

450
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:33,400
I don't trust them.

451
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,020
-- I mean,
-- I, I agree. I, I feel like

452
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,564
trust Apple slightly more. I mean, for now don't get me wrong.

453
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:41,665
It would not shock me if at some point

454
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,305
in the near future, Apple does a total 180

455
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:45,665
goes full Google.

456
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:49,964
But so far, Apple has gradually ratcheted up and improved privacy.

457
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:52,305
And Amazon and Google have sort of done the opposite, at

458
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:53,805
least perceptually.

459
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:54,305
Yeah.

460
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:57,665
But again, I think we kind of come back to the situation of

461
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:02,305
Apple sells me devices which I gladly keep purchasing

462
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:06,540
and Google and, and I think Amazon may be slightly less,

463
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,780
but I feel like they're heading in the

464
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,339
wrong direction of like you are Google's product,

465
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:10,569
right?

466
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,560
We are their cattle

467
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,420
and I think Amazon is starting to treat us in a similar way.

468
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,560
I went to buy some AAA batteries because I finally ran out of the AAA batteries.

469
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:20,819
I bought three years ago

470
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:26,359
and by default, Amazon had it set as a subscription, not a one time purchase.

471
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:27,790
Yeah, but

472
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:29,430
like once every three years,

473
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,540
are they going to send you a case of batteries every month?

474
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:34,829
Go to Amazon type in AAA batteries. Choose the Amazon brand.

475
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,040
-- If you need a battery subscription, you're doing something wrong.
-- And by default,

476
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,560
there's a gray box at the top that says one time purchase

477
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,540
and below it

478
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,890
selected by default is subscribe and say 5%

479
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,939
say 5% now and up to 15% on repeat deliveries cancel at any time.

480
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,079
So it's,

481
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:56,319
you know, it's and it's delivery every six months, which is perfect because I'll,

482
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:59,069
I'll absolutely forget about this in six months and then get

483
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,040
another package of batteries in the mail that I don't need.

484
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,540
So now when I shop at Amazon,

485
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,140
I have to be super careful to make sure I'm

486
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,170
only buying one of them and not a subscription.

487
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:08,079
Uh,

488
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,229
I don't, I don't need to worry about this crap.

489
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,069
I don't,

490
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,949
and that's why I'm just like, oh man, Amazon. Not cool, man.

491
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,310
I need to find somewhere to order things on the internet easily.

492
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,500
I tried. There's, there's Amazon, that's it.

493
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,270
But Costco will only, you know,

494
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,339
sell me certain things in historically large amounts.

495
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,270
I love it, which is good though,

496
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:32,589
you know, for certain things. But yeah,

497
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,760
I, so and this is a perfect example, right?

498
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,680
This, this kind of constant bait and switch and trying to trick,

499
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:40,140
I feel like Amazon and Google are trying to constantly trick

500
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,359
me into clicking an ad or buying something I don't need.

501
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah, I'll agree anyway. It's frustrating.

502
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,689
Here's my ending thought on this and this is

503
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:50,979
something I've been thinking about a generous amount lately.

504
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:51,420
So

505
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:54,239
there when, when you and I were Children,

506
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:56,359
do you remember all the reduced reuse,

507
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,660
recycle messaging that we had like just shoveled into our brains where it was like,

508
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,479
oh everyone needs to do their part.

509
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,859
And then we've recently discovered that something like 80% of

510
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,170
pollution is coming from like 15 companies on the planet.

511
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:13,599
-- And it's like, wait a minute what
-- I have a problem with that because like it's,

512
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,530
I need to buy a lot of that stuff that they make.

513
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,170
-- Well. Well,
-- but here's the point. Right. Ok.

514
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,839
Here's the point is there's been this historic trend

515
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:21,800
of

516
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,650
kind of almost victim blaming for

517
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:24,859
a

518
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,560
large number of the world's problems and I think even things like privacy

519
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,989
were part of that

520
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:35,719
where it was. Oh, don't click links. Don't do this on the internet. Don't type.

521
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:38,310
And it's like you just, it doesn't work that way. Like you can't,

522
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:41,319
you can't defend yourself against these adversaries.

523
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,670
They're too big and they're too powerful. And I think,

524
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,989
I mean, to a degree, this is what we're kind of seeing with Amazon is, yeah,

525
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,189
you can opt out a sidewalk but most people won't and

526
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:57,189
they're clearly taking an adversarial stamps from the perspective of the users.

527
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:02,880
And so I think in the context of privacy on the internet and just in general, right?

528
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,560
Not even with Amazon or without or whatever is the only

529
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,569
way we're going to solve a lot of these problems is when

530
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:14,839
the governments of the world start to care about these problems because as a human,

531
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,189
there's just nothing you can do. There's no way to stop Google from spying on you.

532
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,030
There just isn't, even if you don't use the internet,

533
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,969
they're spying on you. Right. There's like there is no way,

534
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:30,540
let's say about 10% of people who are Google and Amazon users to stop,

535
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,890
which would be a massive ridiculous amount of success. Right.

536
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,989
It's just not possible. It, it, I

537
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,969
guess it would show up on their end of year spreadsheets, but that's about

538
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,780
-- it.
-- They siphon this data from everything.

539
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,000
I mean, it, it's coming from purchases you make in meet space,

540
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,839
it's coming from purchases you make online, it's coming from websites you visit.

541
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:50,420
It's just

542
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,300
we exist in this massive surveillance universe.

543
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,890
And so I'm hopeful that more and more people pay

544
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,920
attention and we see a push in the right direction because

545
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,280
I think

546
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,040
for a long time

547
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,810
there was, I don't know if I'd even say it was apathy.

548
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:07,239
It's just,

549
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,119
I don't think people understood and I think we're starting to figure it out.

550
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,359
It reminds me of like the Edward Snowden revelations where everybody's like, oh,

551
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:18,540
he's paranoid crackpot and now here we are 5, 10 years later and we're like, oh,

552
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,329
oh my goodness,

553
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,545
never forget that.

554
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:23,204
Where for a long time, all the security people were like, yeah,

555
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,564
the NSA is totally doing this and like, oh, you're all just paranoid nuts.

556
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:31,084
I worked for a company full of ex-military people and I, you know, was just talking,

557
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:32,084
I'm like, oh, yeah, it's too bad.

558
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,885
We can't do something like echelon and just monitor

559
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:34,964
all the RC networks and the guy's like,

560
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,165
you can't say that on the phone.

561
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:38,035
I'm like, say what on the phone? Like,

562
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,760
he's like, you can't say that word and I'm like, which word Irc like, no, like, come

563
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,380
on, he's like, yeah, don't say that on the phone. I'm like, God, I mean,

564
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:45,979
yeah.

565
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:48,859
And, but I remember telling people about stuff like echelon, they're like,

566
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,040
you're just a nut then.

567
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,599
I'm like, oh, ha ha, not a nut. And they're like, shut up nerd. We still don't care.

568
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:58,739
Well, the NSA using Danish telecoms to spy on the German Chancellor and

569
00:26:58,915 --> 00:26:59,584
Merkel, like,

570
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,005
yeah, that,

571
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,925
I mean, and that's, this is just new stuff in the last week.

572
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:06,265
I, I know, I know it's,

573
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:07,885
I guess the thing

574
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:12,324
I will hopefully fill us all with some hope is that

575
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:15,125
I think a lot of this went unchecked for a long time

576
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,974
and I think we have a very long way to go.

577
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,074
I think this is the beginning of the beginning,

578
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,005
you know, to steal the Churchill quote.

579
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:22,435
But I think

580
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:25,084
I feel it feels like

581
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,479
we're starting to at least look in the right direction

582
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:31,310
here versus before where I feel like no one knew

583
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,189
-- like
-- awareness is step one because

584
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:34,969
for the longest time, you know,

585
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:37,060
the NSA and all this warrantless surveillance and

586
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,569
FISA courts and everything was going on just

587
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,349
behind closed doors literally.

588
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:45,150
And same thing with these companies like Choicepoint and Experian and

589
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,150
Transunion and all these places that have massive amounts of data on

590
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:53,170
everyone. Like not most of us, literally, everyone

591
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,020
and we were blissfully unaware and well, now we're aware.

592
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,500
So that's step you know, it's to quote, uh, what is it, Dan Aykroyd, you know, you,

593
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,349
now you've discovered the source of the smell.

594
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,319
What are you gonna do about it?

595
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,619
You know, from?

596
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,260
Well, I don't know the answer to that yet, but we'll see.

597
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,170
All right, I'm going to end it.

598
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:19,979
I guess if anyone has suggestions or insights or any details that could be useful,

599
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,000

600
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:23,180
