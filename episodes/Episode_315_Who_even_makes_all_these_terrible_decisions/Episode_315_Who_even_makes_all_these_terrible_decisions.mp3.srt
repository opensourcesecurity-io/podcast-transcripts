Hello and welcome to the open

1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,590
source security podcast with myself, Kurt

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,119
Seri and my partner are not making

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,909
exceedingly poor logistical supply chain decisions.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,840
Josh Bresser.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,579
-- I
-- mean,

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,590
I don't think I can back that up.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,319
Well, so this, this morning,

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,190
I was actually looking at stuff in my bathroom because I was curious like,

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,799
where does all this stuff come from?

10
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,420
And

11
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,950
almost everything in my bathroom doesn't say where it's from,

12
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,299
but it does say imported by and then a large US firm, right?

13
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:34,764
And so for example, if we have sanctions, I'm not going to be able to wash myself.

14
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:35,365
I mean,

15
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,694
it's possible, I don't know,

16
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,805
I don't know where a lot of that stuff comes from.

17
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,775
Like even my hand lotion says made with Canadian oats but imported by, you know,

18
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:46,205
Johnson and Johnson us.

19
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,529
It would not shock me if Canadian oats are sent to the United States

20
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,970
and then sent back to Canada.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,810
Yeah, it's,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,319
I mean, look,

23
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:01,610
we live in a very global economy now where I

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,449
think cutting anything off from anywhere just causes utter chaos.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,129
Yeah, pretty much. But also what gets me is sometimes decisions are made

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,000
that trickle out and it's like, how, how did that decision ever possibly get made?

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,239
So my, my current favorite massive fail is Microsoft straight up,

28
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,690
experimented with putting ads

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,370
in the file browser.

30
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:29,480
Yeah, that's great. Like I can't even fathom.

31
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,790
Like if you literally gave me a choice between,

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,779
we're going to put this puppy in a tree chipper

33
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:36,650
and we're gonna put ads in the browser or in the file explorer.

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,699
I'd be like, can we do the puppy? I think people will hate that less.

35
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,360
I mean,

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,489
-- like straight
-- up,

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,720
-- right.
-- So I, I uh let's give some context here.

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,430
I, I read this story and

39
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,199
apparently what's happening

40
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,239
is

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:49,910
a

42
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,860
in a preview build of Windows.

43
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,760
A we'll call it feature. I'm using air quotes here.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,160
A feature accidentally leaked out to the public where there was an

45
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,510
ad in the file explorer and someone put it on Twitter.

46
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,919
And Microsoft is saying, oh, this was a mistake.

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,288
We didn't mean to do this where this is just an internal test.

48
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,020
They built the software that does it

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,449
and they

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,440
did,

51
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,449
but they didn't mean for us to find out about it.

52
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,770
Oh, wow. Oh, well, that makes it OK then.

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,710
Right?

54
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:22,649
And

55
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,770
I read this story and I'm like, I just stopped hating you. Microsoft like come on,

56
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:29,449
I,

57
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,250
-- I don't even know what to say.
-- See that's the thing, right? Microsoft didn't deny it.

58
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,889
They didn't say this is a shaft image.

59
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,369
They were like, no, that, that wasn't supposed to get made public. Right.

60
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,970
Right. You know, that's, that's literally what every

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,970
murderer and fraud person and, you know, criminal ever says.

62
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,500
It's like, oh, I didn't mean for you to find out

63
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:48,005
that,

64
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,485
like you caught me.

65
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:50,285
I mean,

66
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:54,434
especially in light of all that QR code, don't click. QR codes.

67
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:55,345
They're dangerous somehow.

68
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:56,285
It's like, ok,

69
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,475
so we've all established that drive by ads and ads are one

70
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,404
of the most dangerous things for web browsers on the internet.

71
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,095
Like that's how you do mass attacks.

72
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:06,645
And now we're going to put ads in a highly trusted user interface.

73
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,794
And when I say highly trusted user interface, I mean, as a user,

74
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,854
when I am looking at my file explorer

75
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,464
that is like

76
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,970
I, I trusted implicitly because it's my,

77
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,929
it's my file explorer for like since I've been using the computer,

78
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,550
it's basically been like what's on my desk?

79
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,089
Oh, that's what's on my desk. Cool.

80
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,990
Or on the network file share.

81
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:28,339
And it doesn't screw with me and make, it doesn't try and deceive me. And now it does

82
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,089
-- a
-- file explorer is one of those

83
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,059
just low levels of functionality

84
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,259
that you don't think about because it comes with the operating system.

85
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,979
You know what I mean?

86
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not like when I run a game or something else I downloaded where I'm like,

87
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:42,990
I don't know about this.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,210
I'm gonna check it out a little bit, but like

89
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,509
if it's packaged with Windows, I feel like I should be able to completely trust it.

90
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:54,779
Yeah, I do remember in fact having to install like MC or, you know,

91
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,259
command line file managers to be a little bit more friendly

92
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:03,160
-- than just a command line with, you know, CD and L si
-- mean, that was M sds, man.

93
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,279
Like

94
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:07,970
those were different days. There was no internet back then.

95
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,820
So I,

96
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,110
I just don't even know what to say to this one.

97
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,649
I feel like as a security person,

98
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,399
this is obviously ridiculous from the perspective of

99
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,988
you don't want something like your file manager loading

100
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,390
arbitrary resources from

101
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,079
some remote location

102
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,369
as a human.

103
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,809
I am appalled just because I am sick of

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,089
the ad fueled dystopian nightmare we all live in now

105
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:39,130
and the thing that irks me the absolute most is if you look at all of the ad economies,

106
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,095
you look at youtube is my favorite example.

107
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,195
You remember when youtube would show like one ad

108
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,954
youtube shows an obscene number of ads right now

109
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,415
and the revenue isn't going up to the moon.

110
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:52,195
-- So that tells you the value of ads is decreasing,
-- but that's always the case, right?

111
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:56,075
Same thing with cable TV. Oh, well, you'll pay for cable TV and it'll be ad free.

112
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,225
-- No, that that's actually what we were promised like 40 years ago.
-- Was it?

113
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:01,345
I don't even remember.

114
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,709
Yeah, literally the whole point was you pay for this TV. So there's no ads.

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,910
I like what Germany does. Germany has ads on TV.

116
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,010
But they're at the, there, there's like a block of them at the end of the show.

117
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,350
So you have time to go to the bathroom and get a coffee and stuff.

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,869
-- I
-- mean, that's kind of how, like public television and the BBC work.

119
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,179
I don't know what the CBC.

120
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,355
No, it's ads all the time. Just like America

121
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:21,445
and there's no limits on them now.

122
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:22,545
We changed that

123
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,625
-- good.
-- Good. That's,

124
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:25,325
yeah. So,

125
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,394
yeah, I just, uh,

126
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:26,845
I,

127
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:29,325
the fact that this got through committee and it got

128
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:32,304
implemented like this isn't some hypothetical like mock up.

129
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:32,855
This is

130
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,885
like, literally code that shipped.

131
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,769
I was supposed to only ship internally. Whoops.

132
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:38,929
So I just,

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,869
I uh like the number of attacks I can think of like where you put something in there

134
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,170
that the user is going to click because they think it's part of the U I because like,

135
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,880
well, it's not, you know, I, I can't even begin.

136
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,989
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Anyway, I, I think this story tells itself

137
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,299
and I imagine corporate people are going to love this even more than home users.

138
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,670
-- Oh,
-- I'm

139
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:00,200
sure you can opt out of this if you're one of their enterprise customers.

140
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,100
I mean, I, I think if you look at the world of windows, the whole version of windows,

141
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,709
it's very much marching.

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,980
I think in the direction of kind of,

143
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,739
I would say a chrome like experience where I

144
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,070
think Microsoft wants that control and they can like,

145
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,940
they get to decide what you look at and they get to decide what you do and

146
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,820
I hate that.

147
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,459
Well, I've already noticed that like with the family,

148
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,329
so I have the family sort of sharing or whatever stuff set up.

149
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,100
So I can limit, you know, my kids access to video games a bit by time

150
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,420
And it really, really wants me to enable location services

151
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:32,950
and

152
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,589
windows.

153
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,059
So, you know,

154
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,059
I can see where my kids are on their phones and stuff like

155
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,630
physically track them like the uh the iphone find my phone feature stuff.

156
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,049
But

157
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,739
yeah, no, it's very,

158
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,929
it's really clear that the mobile experience with the 30%

159
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,549
haircut for all transactions is what Apple and Microsoft want.

160
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,750
-- I don't blame them. 30% is a lot of money.
-- It is a lot of money they're doing all right.

161
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,269
Anyway, I hate ads. I'm sick of ads.

162
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,160
The only thing I hate more than ads is changing my clock,

163
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,480
which we had to do this week and I detest it and I'm tired and grumpy.

164
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:05,040
So

165
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,679
this is just like this is gas on the fire.

166
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,799
I'm just, I'm wound up as it is and now it's like dang it Microsoft

167
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,559
anyway.

168
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,200
-- Well,
-- and so in, in,

169
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,760
in news of like literally shooting yourself in the foot as much as you can.

170
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:18,119
So

171
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,410
as we all know, Russia invaded the Ukraine and we're now on to week, uh, almost four,

172
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,959
by the time this podcast comes out another week will have gone by

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,829
and of course, there's sanctions

174
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,809
and

175
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,890
I fully anticipated economic sanctions would hurt Russia because

176
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,029
that's the whole point of them.

177
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,850
But

178
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,089
for whatever reason,

179
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,799
myself and most people had never really

180
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,320
thought through the whole impact of sanctions.

181
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,429
So, a perfect example is apparently Russia is running out of storage.

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,690
They've got about two months left.

183
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:48,320
-- You mean, like computer storage, right?
-- Yeah. Like hard drive storage,

184
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:50,660
right? I mean, that's wild to think about.

185
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,670
Well, and, uh especially because we're,

186
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,649
we're getting into some very data driven

187
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,910
applications when you start talking about fascist

188
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,369
and authoritarian machines,

189
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,269
like things like facial recognition and surveillance,

190
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,899
like

191
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,769
that eats up a huge amount of storage

192
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,450
and you never delete anything, obviously.

193
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,459
Yeah. Well, you can't because you're afraid of everything and everybody.

194
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,959
And so,

195
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,119
uh, yeah,

196
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,119
I mean,

197
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,799
uh are, are we gonna have like national hard drive drives where you, like,

198
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,470
turn in your hard drives or?

199
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,119
Well, we won't. No, like, seriously. Right. What do you do? Because it's like,

200
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,029
that's, the thing is like building a hard drive. Now, how long would it take for, uh,

201
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,039
even

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
a, let's say, even a modern country like Canada

203
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,250
to actually build and start shipping a hard drives from

204
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,299
a hard drive factory with all Canadian stuff basically.

205
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,559
And I'm assuming it would be about one or two decades.

206
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:47,119
I bet you could do it in 10 years or less.

207
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,599
Assuming you just stole the IP from someone else.

208
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,440
I mean, how to do this is well understood.

209
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,080
-- Well, the problem
-- is, for example, where do we get the chips for the controllers?

210
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,150
Well, do we go steal a SM OS?

211
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,440
Ah, that's true.

212
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,700
Yeah, you can just, just start piracy, go take over some container ships and, and

213
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,210
claim them as your own. It's fine.

214
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,099
-- It's international waters. I'm sure that's
-- legal. And that's the thing. It's,

215
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,919
it's everything on the planet now has, for example, at a minimum,

216
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,400
has microchips built into it,

217
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,450
some pretty sophisticated stuff. Usually

218
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:16,520
we saw

219
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,544
with the,

220
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,934
the, the automobiles during the pandemic where

221
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:24,465
there was a, a, like a perfect storm of events that

222
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:28,025
hampered the chip factories and, like, you can't buy a car now.

223
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,065
It's like, wait, what a car?

224
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:34,625
Well, what happened is the automakers forecast lower demand.

225
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,354
So they basically canceled all their chip orders.

226
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,625
And of course COVID as a forcing function was like,

227
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:42,135
I don't want to get on a bus with other people if I can afford a car.

228
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,349
And so, like,

229
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:47,960
literally my used car is worth more now than when I bought it two years ago.

230
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:50,679
-- Yeah.
-- Except you can't buy another one.

231
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:55,789
Well, yeah, exactly. And so Ford, for example, their initial plan was to

232
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,570
build the cars,

233
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,140
shipped them in an undrivable state to dealers and then

234
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,140
I'm not sure what part two of the plan was.

235
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,119
They backed off that and now they're shipping Ford Explorers with no uh

236
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,580
rear. What is it?

237
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,419
The heating and air conditioning controls are, are disabled because there's,

238
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:11,760
well, there's no chips in them

239
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,820
and they'll be a little bit cheaper.

240
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,320
You can buy it and they sort of are promising within a year to fix it. Double promise.

241
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:18,909
Pinky squares.

242
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:22,299
Like I'm just looking at this. And so then the second problem becomes

243
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,210
ok. So supply chains are disrupted. That's bad.

244
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:28,840
But then Russia is now nationalizing stuff or talking about nationalizing stuff.

245
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,010
And

246
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,609
yeah, I, I'm not going to put assets in Russia

247
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,890
if they start taking them.

248
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:35,580
Like,

249
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:39,659
and somebody pointed out that Amazon Google all the big, you know, Microsoft,

250
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:42,250
all those big places, they don't have data centers in Russia.

251
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,289
They, they sort of weirdly foresaw this.

252
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,070
I mean, it, it doesn't totally surprise me.

253
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:51,330
I feel like when I look at a lot of the events happening around,

254
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,659
kind of just Russia in their behavior

255
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,520
is

256
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,190
when and this is very true of security. I re

257
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:00,739
I remember dealing with this many, many times is when you're

258
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:01,679
panicked

259
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,299
and you're under like obscene amounts of stress because

260
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,989
there's some sort of emergency happening around you,

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,150
whether it's your own creation or not.

262
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,960
Like, for example, if you get hacked, it's really hard to make good choices.

263
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:17,299
I mean, it's really hard like it's easy to say, oh, if I get hacked,

264
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,679
I'll do this and this and this, but it is nothing like that.

265
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,210
When you have an event, you have people breathing down your neck,

266
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,414
you have everything exploding, everyone's freaking out.

267
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,705
You don't know what to do.

268
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:30,304
And so you just start making dumb choices and,

269
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,544
and I have a suspicion that's part of this is like they're

270
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:33,794
panicked and they're freaking out and

271
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:36,424
they're making completely ridiculous choices.

272
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,465
Well, the other problem is you say they, but in this case, Russia is not a they,

273
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:40,554
it's Russia is Putin.

274
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,304
That's true.

275
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,125
And I think that's part of the other problem is that

276
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:47,294
traditionally you have sort of group decision making where ideally,

277
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,645
at least some of the more stupid stuff gets vetoed.

278
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:49,929
Uh

279
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,549
Although again,

280
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,039
that can go horribly wrong as we've seen

281
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,419
with Microsoft sticking ads in the file browser,

282
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,469
right?

283
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,890
But right, I mean, it,

284
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,150
it traditionally one of the reasons we use groups to

285
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,169
make decisions is so that Bob speaks up and says,

286
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,030
hey, guys,

287
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,849
did you know if we do that that it'll like

288
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,570
have this really bad consequence that we don't want.

289
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,460
I mean,

290
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,940
that's always easy to say in hindsight and I

291
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,619
think the conversation I want to bring this to is

292
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,729
so there's like all these supply chain things,

293
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,140
there's all this stuff happening in Russia.

294
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,229
Russia's making all these terrible decisions.

295
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,650
And I think sometimes if you think about kind of the greater security universe.

296
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,099
A lot of the supplies where they, like, we have a software supply chain

297
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,140
and there's an enormous number of interconnected

298
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,539
parts in ways we often don't understand.

299
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,619
And one of my favorite examples is when

300
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,539
you'll tell a software developer,

301
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:43,090
you have to upgrade this dependency and it's 36 layers deep

302
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,539
and they're like, I can't and you say you have to do it right now,

303
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:50,000
no questions asked and they do it and everything else explodes

304
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,000
somewhere else in the application that seems to be unrelated.

305
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,299
But you know, that's just kind of how supply chains work.

306
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,780
And we're seeing this literally in action

307
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,380
with real

308
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,719
the supply chain.

309
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:05,099
You know, I don't, I don't know what we call like the, the, the, the real stuff,

310
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,859
the global supply chain.

311
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:07,539
There you go.

312
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,590
Like it's just, it's like I'm at a point where do I just start hoarding soap

313
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,229
-- and toilet paper and literally everything just
-- hard lye and then you can make soap,

314
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:18,849
it's fine.

315
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:19,320
Well,

316
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,950
so that's what Toyota does as part of their

317
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,090
business continuity plan they now require or not.

318
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,909
Now they have for some time required

319
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,619
a their suppliers to maintain a 2 to 6 month stock level of whatever part it is,

320
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,510
they sell Toyota depending on how hard it is to kind of get a hold of.

321
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,830
Right.

322
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,669
So they essentially externalize the carry cost of

323
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,070
having all those backup bits and pieces,

324
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,539
right?

325
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,950
Right. And that's a really important part too.

326
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,775
So Toyota is famous for creating the just in time supply chain concept,

327
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,534
except most people here just in time supply chain.

328
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:54,544
And they interpret that as I will order what I need when I need it and it will be magic

329
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:58,325
and that works when the supply chain is firing in all cylinders.

330
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,094
What Toyota really does

331
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:04,565
is they have an enormous amount of insight into their supply chain

332
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:08,125
and they know that there are things they can get somewhere else if

333
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:11,414
they need to and there's things they can't and the things they can't,

334
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,684
they make sure they have some backup of

335
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:16,250
versus the things they know they can acquire elsewhere.

336
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,650
And like an easy example is microchips, right.

337
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,729
There's basically one place to get those.

338
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,330
But let's say, like you need a plastic knob,

339
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:27,760
you can probably get a plastic knob almost anywhere in a very short lead time.

340
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,969
So you don't need

341
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,229
-- six months of plastic knobs in a warehouse.
-- Yeah.

342
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,119
No, it's, and we discovered that, you know,

343
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,010
with the stupid truck protests here in Canada where, you know, they,

344
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,809
they basically shut down the auto industry.

345
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,409
Yeah. Yeah. Blocking that bridge

346
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:44,953
because the auto industry literally depends on a company in Canada making parts,

347
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,083
putting them in a truck,

348
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:49,812
getting them over the border in 3 to 4 hours and showing up at the factory,

349
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,672
you know, by 5 p.m. or whatever for the next trip.

350
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:56,213
And that's kind of why Shenzhen in places in China like that work so well.

351
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,672
Is they literally

352
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:00,523
I need, you know, this weirdly specific screw. Yeah, there's

353
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,692
the company that does, that is down the street,

354
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:07,492
you know, they have that critical mass of just everything is within a 23 hour drive.

355
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,205
But you need to understand that.

356
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,216
And I think again, if we want to talk about security which, and,

357
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:15,096
and I'd love to tie everything back to security whenever I can.

358
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,056
When you're talking about software and security.

359
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:18,716
Like

360
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,726
a lot of us fly blind where we don't know what's in our stuff.

361
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:23,846
We don't know where it's coming from.

362
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,245
We don't know how to get something new or different if we need it.

363
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,656
-- Well,
-- and that's one thing we don't have replacements.

364
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,416
Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:34,296
For example, back in the olden days I could very easily swap Apache for engine X

366
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,330
very easily. Right. I'm serving static content. I can swap them.

367
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,989
But nowadays with a fully integrated container web app,

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,599
the thought of swatching one web server for another is just a big, no,

369
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,630
that's a heavy lift

370
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:48,989
or like, I mean, switching cloud providers, right?

371
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,979
You don't just be like, oh,

372
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:54,150
I don't want to use AWS anymore, push a button and now we're using

373
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,760
no, like it doesn't work like that.

374
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,969
I mean, the whole, the theory of Kubernetes and multi cloud,

375
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,260
it's like I keep seeing it and I keep seeing people try and,

376
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:01,979
and,

377
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:04,080
and that's the reason a lot of companies use that is they

378
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,640
intentionally use that so they don't get locked into a provider.

379
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,989
Like,

380
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't know its name, names Oracle. Right.

381
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,739
We can all agree if you get locked into Oracle, that's not a good,

382
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,059
you're not going to have a good time.

383
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:13,580
Right.

384
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,539
Well, back to that,

385
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,460
that security thing is what is the criticality of this piece of software?

386
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:18,559
Like how important is it?

387
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,299
You know, a great example being the, well remember, there's

388
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,549
the time zone guy who does the time zone file, but the whole world relies upon,

389
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:27,729
I

390
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,429
know,

391
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,460
you know, and one time he got sick and another time he got sued

392
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,650
and it's like

393
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,559
maybe,

394
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,159
maybe we should have a second person just to sub in for him in case he gets hit by a bus.

395
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,239
-- I
-- mean, this is kind of the story of log for Jay, right,

396
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,159
where you had this incredibly critical package

397
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,520
that was maintained by volunteers and everyone lost their mind.

398
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,640
-- So
-- one fascinating thing is, and I, I

399
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,280
sent this to you last night, but

400
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,390
I noticed on the most recent open SSL advisory,

401
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,890
they have premium support now with extended LTs support for software.

402
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,679
-- I'm pretty sure they've had that for a while.
-- Has that? Has it been for a while? Ok.

403
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,410
Because I literally just noticed it.

404
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:05,949
Yeah,

405
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,469
I remember the other thing they did too is they had like you

406
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,880
could pay them for uh a Phis version as well where I mean,

407
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,848
in a while,

408
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:17,503
like not like 20 years or anything like that.

409
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:21,093
But it's been, I think around five give or take that I,

410
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,593
that II I may be remembering something incorrectly.

411
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,013
So

412
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,173
like by all means, verify this,

413
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:29,254
I do remember open sl had a Phipps version that was not free,

414
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,734
like it was certified and it was tested and blah, blah, blah.

415
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:35,154
And that was for anybody that's ever done anything to do with government paperwork.

416
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:36,254
Just Phipps is worse.

417
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,589
It's better than common criteria.

418
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,869
But that's another story.

419
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,410
-- Anyway,
-- if you think a sock two audit is a pain in your butt, just wait till you try

420
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:47,750
fs

421
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,050
-- oh
-- man, getting those certifications and it takes years.

422
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,829
I mean, it was, it was always funny because

423
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,560
when you have in a modern, like DEV

424
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:56,579
ops style

425
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,500
universe, you could be releasing every couple of weeks

426
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,199
and getting some of these certifications is completely untenable

427
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,030
because you can't, like,

428
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:09,280
you'd have to do a release and then basically support it for

429
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,050
years while you're waiting for it to go through the machine.

430
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,119
And then by the time it comes out, you,

431
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,469
the two products you have the old and the new would look nothing alike.

432
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,180
-- It's, it's a hard problem. I mean, it totally is.
-- Well, that's the thing.

433
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,209
How do you certify something when that something is constantly changing?

434
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,869
Right. Right. You don't

435
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,959
in in possibly significant ways.

436
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:27,079
Like,

437
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,939
it's one thing to certify a car for safety and then add a

438
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:33,380
new radio to it that probably doesn't impact the safety all that much.

439
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,189
But as we've discovered with software

440
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,069
it's, you know, I'm making the hand wavy.

441
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,270
It's an ecosystem like in the it crowd, you know, you, you change one thing and boom,

442
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,310
the rain forest dies.

443
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:45,699
Right. Well, I mean, again, this, this harkens back to the supply chain. Topic of

444
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,609
everything is so interconnected that it's really hard

445
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,780
to untangle and it's really hard to understand.

446
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,199
And I mean, I think this is where some of the newer techno, I mean,

447
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:56,410
some of the topics we're talking about like we just talked about as

448
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:56,630
a

449
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,859
couple episodes ago, like

450
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:58,525
Essbaum

451
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:01,964
is a great example of I'm not saying it's a silver bullet by any means,

452
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:08,395
but it is a way you can gain insight into what you have, which is like step one, right?

453
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:13,464
-- There's like 300 more steps after that, but that is step one. Well, I
-- mean, to me SB

454
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,185
is what, what's the alternative?

455
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:17,385
Like we, we have to start doing stuff like that.

456
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:20,265
We have to start understanding what we're shipping and what we depend on

457
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,260
the alternative is doing nothing, which is basically what we've been doing.

458
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,000
How's that working out?

459
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,300
Yeah, I hope those soap companies keep shipping soap to Canada so I can be clean.

460
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,390
No, I literally, I'm like,

461
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,150
where does all my soap come from.

462
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,589
I was looking at like every single product I looked at doesn't say where it's made,

463
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,099
you know, it just says imported by,

464
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,630
-- there's
-- some old timey recipe you can probably find on the

465
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,020
internet to make soap from dead animals and ash or something.

466
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,589
I don't know.

467
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,750
Well, fun fact I learned that's why bleach makes your hands feel slippery.

468
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,750
Yep. Yep. I read that and read it also

469
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,439
because bleach combines with the oil to make soap on your finger.

470
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,050
I just learned this uh yesterday.

471
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,550
So I'm very proud of that fact because I always was wondering like,

472
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,420
is bleach slipper like what's the deal here?

473
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,339
But no, it makes soap on your hands. So I guess

474
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,819
uh but I'm not saying you should wash yourself down with bleach.

475
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,699
That is probably a bad idea.

476
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,189
I, I actually got some lye in my hands one time and I,

477
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,349
I experienced a similar thing and I was like, wow, lye is slippery.

478
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:14,630
No,

479
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,060
no, I just made soap

480
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:17,520
anyway.

481
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,130
Anyway.

482
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:19,920
So,

483
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,819
yeah, I, because that's like I'm looking at this and it's,

484
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,160
there's certain countries where it's clearly

485
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:27,979
dangerous to operate or there's certain,

486
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,839
you know, there's a lot of constraints like, say North Korea, Russia, you know,

487
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:36,560
Iraq where you're not just going to like, build a factory and be happy, you know,

488
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,310
like you would say, compared to

489
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:42,079
Canada or Germany or France or the US, right?

490
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,020
But

491
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,640
I guess part of my, what I'm looking at this now is like,

492
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,709
what about all these sort of in the

493
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,260
middle countries like that are having trouble but not

494
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,959
off the crazy and, like, say Brazil Argentina, you know. Right.

495
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:54,670
Like, I just,

496
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,349
I imagine right now for companies doing risk assessments of

497
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,459
where do they operate and put plants is complicated.

498
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,750
I don't think it's worse than it's ever been.

499
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,280
I mean, I think this is just part of doing business, especially in a global space.

500
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,760
I think historically,

501
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,790
we've gotten to ignore a lot of this, not because

502
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
it didn't exist,

503
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,849
but rather just we were living this kind

504
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,229
of carefree lifestyle because things just showed up.

505
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,839
And now we have, you know, we had the pandemic which had its own supply chain issues.

506
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:23,729
We have a global war going on essentially now

507
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,630
and that's creating its own set of issues.

508
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,810
There's just all this angst happening and I, I think

509
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:32,170
it is obvious to everyone now how just truly interconnected.

510
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,530
Absolutely everything is.

511
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,119
And, and I even,

512
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,569
I even see this in software where there's just more

513
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:39,359
and more talk of all the supply chain issues of how

514
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,329
everything is interconnected about where you're getting your software from

515
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,369
and starting to try to build some trust around that.

516
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,589
And I think it, it's all connected.

517
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,729
Everything we're seeing is all connected in every possible way. And it's,

518
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,900
I mean, what's the old curse? May you live in?

519
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,979
Interesting times like, holy crap, it couldn't be more interesting than this.

520
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,060
Well, like you said, I mean,

521
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:03,079
I think for now until now it just largely worked well enough that we ignored it

522
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,260
with the occasional, you know, ridiculous

523
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,229
developer tantrum where they, you know,

524
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:10,780
destroy their software and it breaks a whole bunch of an ecosystem or whatever,

525
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,810
you know. But by and large, yeah, things just sort of worked.

526
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,689
People behaved reasonably and now

527
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,599
people are behaving less reasonably and more to

528
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,010
the point systems are behaving less reasonably,

529
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,130
you know, because of like second order effects, you know, for want of a nail,

530
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,680
the horse is not working

531
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:26,969
and

532
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,729
yeah, it's, it's, well, it's like the classic,

533
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,430
like I'm always reminded of uh Fukushima, which was,

534
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,420
there was a nuclear power plant. The name is G

535
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,969
that was closer to the epicenter and actually got a bigger wave.

536
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,170
But the plant manager there basically said, I don't trust managers,

537
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,310
managers aligning weasels, we're building a 10 m sea wall

538
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,040
and he got so much flak for it.

539
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,540
And everybody was like, oh, you're wasting money, blah, blah, blah.

540
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,780
-- And of course, well that nuclear plant didn't have any problems,
-- right?

541
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,089
I didn't know that. I haven't heard this before.

542
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,170
It's,

543
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:59,020
we'll put it in the show notes. But yeah, like straight up, you know, the,

544
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,260
it was like Seaward's Folly, just Google Seward's Folly, right?

545
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,959
The Britain's first kind of major atomic power plant was literally

546
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,939
um

547
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,750
these little metal canisters with a giant chimney behind them.

548
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,099
And Seaward was like, we should probably put a filter on top of that.

549
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,180
And they're like, nah, this thing won't catch fire.

550
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:17,739
And he's like, no,

551
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,319
we should really probably put a filter on top of that

552
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,260
because if it does catch fire it's going to Irradiate,

553
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,000
like all of Britain and western Europe.

554
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,109
And we're screwed.

555
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,020
And so they're like, oh, fine, we'll put a, you know,

556
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,739
and it's like this horrendous cost and it's extremely expensive and painful and,

557
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:32,530
yeah, I guess what happened,

558
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,329
-- I assume it caught on fire. The pile
-- caught fire.

559
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:37,229
Right. Who knew?

560
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:40,630
Thank goodness for that filter. Or else, you know, I mean,

561
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,270
look, this is the classic story of security

562
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,890
is when you do your job correctly, nobody notices

563
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,209
when you don't do your job, everybody notices.

564
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:55,640
And it's always funny when I talk about this. I mean, I, I did a podcast.

565
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,410
It's been a couple of years now, but it was this thing called The Future of Tech.

566
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,410
And I just written an article somewhere basically saying, like, security is boring

567
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,709
and the point was like, if your security isn't boring, you're doing security wrong.

568
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:06,930
Right.

569
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,449
Security should be like accounting where it's just,

570
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:12,410
it is there and it does its job and you don't hear about it.

571
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,349
And like, that's the first thing the host just like, came out swinging,

572
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,719
like you're saying security is boring.

573
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,810
What's up with that. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, security should be boring. Right.

574
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,709
Like, if your security isn't boring, you're doing security wrong

575
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,439
and sorry, it was Croft Sea. I

576
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,030
don't know where I got Seaward from.

577
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,770
I don't know,

578
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,699
it wasn't Seward's Folly Alaska.

579
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,699
-- Was that
-- the guy

580
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,359
that was Alaska? Yeah, that's what I was thinking of. Yeah, you're right.

581
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:35,969
Sorry, I've got a lot of Russia on the brain because, yeah,

582
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,550
Russia was saying they want Alaska back

583
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,290
and apparently the Alaskan governor was like,

584
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:39,800
no,

585
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,469
-- wait,
-- what, when did they say this just recently?

586
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:43,670
Like yesterday?

587
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,670
Remember? Because they're talking about historical territorial claims?

588
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:49,400
Oh, I see.

589
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,599
-- Yeah. Right.
-- Anyway, and it's like, you know, that's not how this works

590
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:54,810
like you sold it.

591
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:58,219
It's not, you know, like buyer's remorse, I get it or seller's remorse.

592
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:02,479
But I think it works that way when you're three, when you're three years old

593
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:05,319
and I want the hot wheel you're playing with.

594
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:07,760
I can claim it as my own

595
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,930
until the parents find out and then I get yelled at anyway, whatever, whatever.

596
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:12,510
-- But
-- right.

597
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,869
So, no, this whole thing is just, yeah, if we do our jobs, right, it is boring

598
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,189
-- and
-- it should be,

599
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,790
I think that goes back to the people want the job to be kind of

600
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,290
sexy and exciting and movie plots and lots of typing on rapidly scrolling screens,

601
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,510
which I never understood because I just might, you know,

602
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,170
if you have two sets of texts scrolling one up and one down like in hackers.

603
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,869
It's just like

604
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,689
-- I feel like I'm just gonna get a migraine headache from that.
-- Whatever.

605
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,770
That looks cool.

606
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,630
I mean, look, man,

607
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:40,199
everyone wants their personal narrative to be something exciting.

608
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,229
Right? Especially when you're young.

609
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,760
When I was young, I was all about, oh,

610
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,209
security should be exciting and more people need to know about this and this

611
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,770
is a big deal now that I'm a bit on the older side,

612
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,280
we'll say

613
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,130
I'm like, I want the most boring job in the world.

614
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,890
Like I want to see no security events ever.

615
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:01,729
And that would make me the happiest person alive and it, of course,

616
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:02,920
doesn't exactly work that way.

617
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,689
But, you know, I, I mean, yeah, it's,

618
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,060
it is difficult,

619
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:09,589
especially in an industry that I think was built on the backs of a lot of,

620
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,680
uh exciting and rock star type things that happened.

621
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:15,260
I mean, you look back in history, you've got like the cult of the dead cow.

622
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,130
You had the loft, you had all these amazing hacker incidents.

623
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,180
You had these hacker conference says it was definitely a very look at me

624
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,329
sort of space. And now there's many reasons for that.

625
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:31,459
I would highly suggest reading the Joseph Mann, wrote a cult of the Dead Cow book.

626
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:34,219
And he kind of, he spent some time discussing like why

627
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,619
they had to do the stunts. They did

628
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,459
and it was to get the attention they needed. But it's like, kind of,

629
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,770
we have a lot of this attention now and I

630
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,420
think it's time to turn this into a maturing industry

631
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:46,229
and

632
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,500
that's going to be the next difficulty.

633
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,260
Just like car safety Ralph Nader had to write

634
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,420
unsafe at any speed and do some horrific demos.

635
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,079
And then now it's, you know, when you buy a car it's kind of, well,

636
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:58,359
how many airbags does it have not?

637
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,800
-- Does it have airbags?
-- I don't know. And I don't care,

638
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,479
like I know that any car I buy in the United States today is going to

639
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:09,064
a reasonable amount of safety. I don't know.

640
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:13,234
I don't, I could not tell you how many airbags are in my car right now. I have no idea.

641
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:16,114
And I don't, I'm not even gonna look now that we said this,

642
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:19,555
I don't care and I'm not gonna care, you know, and that's good.

643
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:20,675
That's what you want.

644
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:24,635
It's kind of like, how many times have you gone to the store and been like,

645
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,834
I wonder if there's mercury in this fish?

646
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:27,505
I'm eating

647
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:32,295
-- probably not very often. So
-- I used to not care. And then I, I learned things like

648
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,810
they'll put made in Canada on the package.

649
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,979
But what they meant is it was put in a box in Canada.

650
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,219
And it was actually like,

651
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,209
so for example, there's, um,

652
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:45,140
shrimp from Southeast Asia that actually has

653
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,119
worryingly high levels of mercury that I,

654
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,219
I won't buy shrimp and stuff from Southeast Asia anymore.

655
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,050
So actually, you know,

656
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,739
I do worry about that because there is shenanigans with that going on.

657
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,310
-- And
-- that's a bad example. Um

658
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,969
Well, no, it's actually a good example because

659
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,089
there's enough information in the supply chain despite the

660
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,270
cheating trying to go on. But I can still make safe decisions

661
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,479
and it's kind of an outlier but

662
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,949
fundamentally, I mean,

663
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:12,699
part of it too is when you have a lack of transparency and information,

664
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,359
like when you have information asymmetry.

665
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,160
Well, perfect example is you end up things like the housing market where it's like,

666
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,229
oh this house is on,

667
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,959
you know, for sale and it's really hot.

668
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,380
So like there's no time for an inspection, you have to buy it now.

669
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:26,579
And yeah, if you buy a house without an inspection, well, realistically,

670
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:29,079
either way you're going to have a whole bunch of issues that you need to fix.

671
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,020
Just kind of

672
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,459
how bad is it? Right.

673
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,689
-- No, II I agree. I agree.
-- At

674
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:38,140
least with open source, we have that information transparency is possible.

675
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,979
I'm not saying it's easy because you know, tracking down every bit of an S bomb is

676
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,089
let me put it this way.

677
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:45,930
If somebody came to me with a sufficiently complicated project and

678
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:48,810
said I have a 100% complete and correct s bomb,

679
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:49,900
I'd be like, no, you don't.

680
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,229
Yeah, I know you don't

681
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:51,469
I,

682
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,349
I think that's ok because I'm very happy to acknowledge that

683
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,550
this is very new territory and it's going to get better.

684
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,989
Right.

685
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,380
-- It, it progress is slow. Even
-- food may contain traces of.

686
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,099
And then it lists a bunch of weird stuff and it's like, oh,

687
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:07,859
I guess it's made it a big plant, cross contamination can happen.

688
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:08,150
Right.

689
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,790
And we accept that's ok because they kind of warn me,

690
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,869
I'm not sure quite how we warn people about that in the

691
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,819
su rule, you know, may contain traces of pearl. I would want to know.

692
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,660
One would think so. Like, II, I agree. I agree.

693
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,900
I think these are, I, I guess if I was going to sum it all up, I would say

694
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,500
it's starting to feel like the security industry

695
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,680
is, is growing up. I don't think it necessarily wants to.

696
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,630
I think there's a lot of being drug kicking and screaming into some of this.

697
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,479
There's still people going against cloud and automation.

698
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,530
-- Oh, I know there always will be
-- like,

699
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,079
there's still people I find who don't want to

700
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,119
remotely manage their fleet and it's kind of like,

701
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,160
why would you not want to do that?

702
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,280
I bet you there were people against automobiles for a very, very, very long time.

703
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:52,939
I mean,

704
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,010
I think there's always going to be laggards.

705
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,560
That's ok.

706
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:59,209
But I, I think at this point they're,

707
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,699
they're irrelevant to the conversation for the most part.

708
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,109
And that's great. That's great. Right.

709
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,209
And I think,

710
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,030
like, in the security world you don't hear very many people saying, oh,

711
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,410
like s bomb is a dumb idea.

712
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,719
I think we can all agree. It's a good idea.

713
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:14,109
I think what we're going to do with it is the next question where

714
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,569
there's obviously varying ideas about what do we actually do with the data?

715
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:17,910
But it,

716
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,000
it's going to get better. Right. Because that's just how,

717
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,489
that's how progress happens. Progress is slow

718
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,939
and that's OK.

719
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,000
It's, it's, I think sometimes it gets

720
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,050
frustrating where it's like I we should be doing this faster but like

721
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,449
sometimes

722
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,910
it's OK not to go too fast because sometimes when you go too fast, you make a big mess.

723
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,040
Well, part of it too is sometimes you can't, it's an ecosystem, right?

724
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,280
Because I, I talked about this many years ago, but why didn't Cloud happen sooner?

725
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,150
And part of it is, for example, we didn't have the bandwidth,

726
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:50,250
we didn't have the compute power to support it. We didn't have,

727
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,890
we just didn't have the software to operationally support it. You know, I

728
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,390
mean, for

729
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,040
example, 20 years ago, if I said Josh, I need you to stand up 20 web servers,

730
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,699
you know what you did?

731
00:30:58,709 --> 00:30:59,520
Best case scenario,

732
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,660
you wrote a script to do it and then you hand checked your results, right?

733
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,739
That was the, that would have been the height of automation.

734
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,079
Yeah, it would have been Ss Hing

735
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,959
into machines,

736
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:10,099
but I still would have had to have installed the operating system probably by hand.

737
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,150
-- It would have been a lot of work for
-- sure. Yeah.

738
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,140
But what I'm saying is like, the height of automation would be, you wrote a script.

739
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,719
-- Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.
-- There, there was no framework for this.

740
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:19,510
There was no ans

741
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,400
or salt

742
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:22,040
or puppet or whatever.

743
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,040
No. No, no, absolutely not. Yeah.

744
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,630
Yeah.

745
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,449
And

746
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,369
I mean,

747
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,270
it, it's getting better, you know, that's kind of the way I look at it.

748
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,329
I, I feel like we, we are improving.

749
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,739
I'd love it if it went faster, but I, I acknowledge that's not how it works. So

750
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,079
I'm, I'm hopeful,

751
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,099
I feel like

752
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:42,520
every time I look at some of the things happening,

753
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,969
I feel hopeful for where we're headed because I

754
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,280
feel like we're going in the right directions,

755
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:47,939
which is great.

756
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,859
I, I like that.

757
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,969
-- I
-- think the simple fact is we've got policymakers at the highest level,

758
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:55,650
like literally the White House is issuing executive orders on

759
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,619
this and it doesn't get any higher than that.

760
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,939
You know, you've got the German government,

761
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,180
you know.

762
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:03,949
Yeah, you've got the German government officially warning people that like, hey,

763
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,579
that Russian antivirus, you

764
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,339
might want to double think about it because

765
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,910
you know what if the government shows up at their offices and

766
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,709
tells them to ship an update with a thing in it?

767
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,890
I mean, look, the US government banned Kaspersky,

768
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,719
like a long time ago.

769
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:18,800
Well, and that's the thing.

770
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,670
So there's a difference between,

771
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,810
like the NSA tailored access operations where they intercept a few boxes,

772
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:24,550
stick a few chips in or do whatever.

773
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,969
There's sort of a level of plausible deniability and also of scale.

774
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,380
It's entirely different when, you know,

775
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,760
like an entire vendor gets subverted,

776
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,540
uh, willingly so well. Well, like the crypto a

777
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,670
thing and the CIA, right.

778
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,359
You know, it turns out that Swiss crypto company was owned by the US government.

779
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:42,829
Whoops,

780
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:47,459
you know, that's, that's, you can't really,

781
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:49,069
you can't really dance around that anymore.

782
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,000
It's like that's a problem. We, we can't ignore it. Is what I'm saying.

783
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,280
-- No, I agree. I agree
-- with

784
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,079
small stuff

785
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,170
anyway, I think it's time to go.

786
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,680
Alright, man, I'm gonna call it.
