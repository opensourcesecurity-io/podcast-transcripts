Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,659
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in building software. Josh Bressler.

2
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:13,409
Ok.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,840
So we were originally going to have an episode where we

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,959
talked about the security of the matrix as in the movies

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,950
because a new trailer just came out a little while ago.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,379
And Kurt and I were like, oh, this would be fun to talk about it.

7
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,239
We made a bunch of notes and stuff and,

8
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,100
and then this week happened

9
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:35,080
where there was what a a Travis C I issue where

10
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:37,689
Attackers could acquire credentials.

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,669
Well, we'll go more into detail of that because

12
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,729
-- I'm just going
-- to high level, high level. There is a Travis issue.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,619
There was an Apple update that fixed a bunch of zero days and

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,520
there is a Google Chrome update that fixed a bunch of zero days.

15
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:49,369
And it's just,

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,990
I look at this and think

17
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,290
I remember when fixing an issue in 90 days was considered

18
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,189
fast and now I feel like 90 hours is too long.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,279
-- Uh
-- 90 business hours would be too much 90 hours hours.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,870
That's what 344 ish days. I don't know, 96 hours is four days.

21
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,730
I would say that's borderline acceptable.

22
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,750
I walk around with the calculator in my pocket all the time.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,360
Now, let's see, 90 divided by 24 is 3.75.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,599
So, if that was like days maybe, but business days, that's absolutely,

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,510
that's almost a week now.

26
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,040
-- And that's not acceptable. I
-- mean,

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,800
I just,

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,779
-- I don't even know what to say about
-- all part of the problem too. is, is

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,940
something like Travis is

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,379
how do I say this?

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,150
There are certain pieces of software that are

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,290
just incredibly important in how they're used and

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,739
what they touch and build systems are sort of the one of the pinnacles of that.

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,160
Yeah. And we ignore them

35
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:47,559
like,

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,730
ok, let's,

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,199
oh, I, I, I'm laughing because I don't know what else to do.

38
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,980
If I didn't laugh, I would cry.

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,330
All right, let's, I'll let, do you want to explain the Travis problem?

40
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,220
I'm just gonna read the wishy

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,639
-- washy statement they made and then we'll pick it apart.
-- Theirs is pretty,

42
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:04,849
it's

43
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,110
pretty

44
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:05,500
lame.

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,410
-- But no, no, no,
-- it's not pretty lame. It's borderline lying.

46
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:09,809
It's

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,809
through a mission.

48
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:13,100
Ok. So what Travis said? And

49
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,229
so this security boltin only got issued about a

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,539
week and a half after the whole thing dropped,

51
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,570
they basically got forced into doing this by people holding them to account.

52
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:22,880
So

53
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,720
it says, hey, all according to a received report,

54
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,869
a public repository forked from another one could file,

55
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:32,184
they pull request standard functionality gene could help it bucket assembler

56
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:35,485
and while doing it, obtain unauthorized access to secret

57
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,404
from the original public repository with the condition of

58
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:40,494
printing some of the files during the build process.

59
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:40,895
In

60
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:44,324
this scenario, secrets are still encrypted in the Travis C I database.

61
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:49,720
This issue is valid only for public repositories, not private repositories.

62
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,589
In the case of private repository repository owners have

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,649
full control of ability somebody to fork the repo.

64
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,759
Um

65
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,509
Travis C I implemented a series of security patches

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,559
starting on September 3rd that resolved the issue.

67
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,479
This issue, sorry.

68
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,059
And uh as a reminder,

69
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,589
cycling your secrets is something that all users should do on a regular basis.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,009
If you are unsure how to do this, please contact sport. Travis C I team. Ok.

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,070
Well, I want to start with that last part as a reminder.

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,770
Cycling your secrets is something that all users should do on a regular basis.

73
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,149
So I'm just going to remind all of our show owners that periodically spraying

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,914
your house down with water is something thing you should do just to ensure,

75
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,225
you know that it's nice and wet and fires don't start.

76
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:26,985
That's the same level of advice. It's like saying

77
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:29,675
Josh, you know, have you replaced your windows recently?

78
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,544
Because, you know, just in case somebody were to throw a brick through them,

79
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,835
you should be, you know, well versed in replacing your windows.

80
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,274
I don't, I don't think that's

81
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:38,304
a reasonable comparison

82
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,115
at all.

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,610
Like we've done the

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,100
-- password rotation, cycling secrets.
-- Well, C I is special.

85
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:52,490
The thing with C I systems is that it's, if you have a properly running C I,

86
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,210
it is going to be

87
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:57,750
conducting authentication or potentially conducting authentication

88
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,570
against some sort of infrastructure,

89
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,889
you know, maybe hundreds of times a day.

90
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,949
And so it's,

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,360
we think of it in the context of typical authentication where you

92
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,399
might have a token or a password or something like that.

93
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,110
But that's

94
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,070
basically a broken way to even think about this because the issue being

95
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,910
you have to store the password or the

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,928
token somewhere and you have an automated system,

97
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,540
which means basically eventually you're going to

98
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,309
have authentication credentials ending up in plain text

99
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,109
somewhere that potentially an attacker could find,

100
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,619
which is kind of what happened here.

101
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,890
And I mean, the right way this needs to be done is basically you have to have ac I system

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,079
that say calls out to some authentication server

103
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,769
with like a one time URL gets back a credential that's only good for like

104
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,049
10 seconds or whatever you need,

105
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,929
you know, does its business and then moves on, but unfortunately, no one does this.

106
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,290
So

107
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,350
it's, it's complicated.

108
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,010
So,

109
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,790
um,

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,329
I, I mean, in my opinion, the, the cycling your secrets, it's,

111
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,700
it's not something you should do on a regular basis.

112
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,899
It something you either build into your

113
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,269
system that happens automatically or it doesn't

114
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,829
exactly like that.

115
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,260
I should have been more clear. That's my concern of this

116
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,309
where they say that all users should do. No, the users should never do this.

117
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,609
The system should do it.

118
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:15,230
Well, it's, it's hard anyway,

119
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,980
we should keep going because I don't want to dwell on this and I

120
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:21,790
think there's some bigger high level concepts we should talk about on this show.

121
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:25,489
Well, like the fact that they tried to ignore the security vulnerability report and

122
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,709
do it for a week.

123
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,869
-- Yeah, that's part of it too.
-- The other challenge is it's not clear

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,029
that the attacker has to sort of,

125
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,350
there are security vulnerabilities where the attacker has to have

126
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,790
sort of actively done something and then exploited it.

127
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,380
And there's other security vulnerabilities where the attacker, you know,

128
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,070
can end up with leaked information

129
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,049
that they can then later use and it's not at all clear here.

130
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:51,519
So like does every public repo that took poll requests during this

131
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,470
last week and a half have they leaked their secrets and stuff?

132
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,149
-- I
-- mean,

133
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,230
that's what happened.

134
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,670
That's what it sounds like because what my understanding, I don't,

135
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,850
I don't have all the details and I feel like we're missing a lot of pieces.

136
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,540
It sounds like what happens is I fork your repo,

137
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,980
I make some changes.

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,890
I submit a pull request and this is not

139
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,049
uncommon at all that a pull request gets submitted

140
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,309
and then the C I runs to see like is it green, is it red? What's going on?

141
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,980
And while that runs me as the person who submitted

142
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:25,820
the pr can generally look at the bill blogs and,

143
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,549
oh, look at that in the BUILD blogs.

144
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,619
We've got some secrets.

145
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:29,619
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,380
So here's the problem. It's kind of like the

147
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,209
um

148
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,130
well, the situation here is that rotating your secrets

149
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,440
while helpful doesn't make that previously disclosed information go away.

150
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,170
-- What
-- I mean? If you rotate them, then the old ones don't work anymore.

151
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,839
I mean, not hopefully that's literally the definition of rotating secrets.

152
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,000
-- Disabling the old,
-- this is where I come back to the users can't do this.

153
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,200
The system has to have already been set up to do this.

154
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,329
This is what I'm getting at, right?

155
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,549
Like to have a human, you're saying to a human,

156
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,720
please go forensically examine these logs and make sure everything got tidied up.

157
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,510
We're talking about software projects that barely managed to

158
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,440
set up Travis and just get it running.

159
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,279
They don't have some sort of security maven that can do this,

160
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,739
right.

161
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,269
That's what I'm saying is this, this cannot be done by users.

162
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:19,420
It has to be built at the system level to be just a normal part of it.

163
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,220
-- Yeah. That's right. That's right.
-- You know, and

164
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,130
my frustration here is that they're basically dumping this on users.

165
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,269
It's just not going to work.

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,910
Well, they don't have a good solution because this is,

167
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:33,579
this is an ecosystem problem. It's not technically Travis's problem.

168
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,750
Travis is just part of the problem.

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,950
All right. So let's go. Let's keep going. What happened at Apple?

170
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,989
We talked about the N SS O group, what like three or four episodes ago?

171
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:45,619
-- Apple because that's where the money is and
-- well, yeah, whatever.

172
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,350
But the point is the NSO group was going after Apple devices.

173
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,670
Everyone knew this was happening

174
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,670
and they released some fixes that

175
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:57,029
as best we know citizen lab has some documents about this that basically

176
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,630
it sounds like they caught at least one of the NSO group.

177
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,089
-- They actually found it in the wild. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
-- Yeah.

178
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,670
And, and they have it and the citizen lab folks have it.

179
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,109
And basically

180
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,160
so there, I think there were 20 days patched in the latest I OS update that came out.

181
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,149
So if you're listening,

182
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,750
I hope you've long ago updated because this will come out like a week or more after.

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,390
But the point is

184
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,510
Apple releases updates, fix zero days.

185
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,809
They have fixed, I think 12 or 16, 0 days already in the year 2021.

186
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,970
And

187
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,369
that should scare us all to our bones.

188
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,390
This won't end until the NSO group decides

189
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,450
to stop spending money on finding these vulnerabilities,

190
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,739
ignoring the NSO group.

191
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,380
Even if the NSO group goes away.

192
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,690
There's, there's a line

193
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:43,650
that is

194
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,299
out the door

195
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,929
of people doing this research and looking to sell

196
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,380
what they found to various entities because it works

197
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,549
and there's cash money.

198
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,390
I mean, you're talking millions of dollars for some of this stuff.

199
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,099
What really scares me is that at least with apple

200
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:03,229
products essentially you're either in support or not in support,

201
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,929
there's, there's no in between ground.

202
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,429
Right.

203
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,010
Whereas with Android.

204
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:11,549
Yeah, exactly. You've grown. Yeah, I can't get a Google phone here in Canada.

205
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,349
So I'm in that indeterminate. I buy something and maybe get software updates.

206
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,309
Maybe it doesn't, maybe matter. Maybe they don't.

207
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,270
So I, I did some research into the,

208
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,104
this was a while and I hate saying the word do some

209
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:25,844
research because I feel like the current state of like COVID.

210
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:29,094
Anyone who says, oh, I did research. It's like, no, like reading crap from me

211
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,684
on Facebook isn't research,

212
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:31,445
but

213
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:33,974
we'll say I read some papers

214
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,554
that we're discussing the current price of various

215
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:40,674
exploits and it sounds like Android exploits that

216
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,344
can affect the Android ecosystem are actually going

217
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,205
for more than iphone exploits right now.

218
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,255
The trick is

219
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:46,885
that

220
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,405
there are like, if you think about Android, it's really like 100 ecosystems.

221
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,164
It's not like a ecosystem.

222
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,169
Yeah.

223
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,679
Which is,

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,380
yeah, that's its own story. But anyway, anyway, uh yes, you are correct.

225
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,770
The Android Universe is

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,770
dicey. Let's call it dicey.

227
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,770
But anyway, anyway, OK, so, and lastly

228
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,679
Chrome just released an update that fixes a couple of zero

229
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,049
days that they know are being exploited in the wild.

230
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:20,419
And I feel like, again, what is going on, why there's all these zero days,

231
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:20,789
it,

232
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,039
it just the thing I keep wondering and this is kind of the question for us talk about.

233
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,690
Are we getting better at finding this stuff

234
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,729
-- or is it actually getting worse? And I don't know which it is.
-- I would say it's both,

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,869
it probably on the one hand, we definitely have better tech,

236
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,090
like, citizen lab.

237
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:40,609
What they're doing out of University of Toronto is flat out amazing.

238
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,630
Like, it's, it's basically nation state level stuff.

239
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,130
-- They're the heroes we don't deserve.
-- Yeah, exactly. And they're Canadian who

240
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,549
are,

241
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,650
-- um,
-- that's right. That's right.

242
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,330
And so,

243
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:53,750
like, they're doing stuff that if you told me that a universe, like,

244
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,469
if you told me 10 years ago that somebody was doing that, I've been like, yeah,

245
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,690
of course, the NSA does that?

246
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,619
Not a university group?

247
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,609
I think Google and Apple are much more cognizant of how

248
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,349
the phones are being attacked and that it matters now,

249
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:06,690
like,

250
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,880
without getting too grim. I mean,

251
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,530
there's a guy named

252
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,179
Khashoggi.

253
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,840
Right. It's, no, I know, I, I couldn't imagine being a journalist these days just

254
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,260
being a journalist that's doing any sort of investigation into

255
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,900
the rich and powerful now has got to be just terrifying.

256
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,140
Well, or, or certain nation states,

257
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,239
I consider those as the rich and powerful. They're powerful and rich, I guess.

258
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:34,369
But, you know, what I mean? It's, it's mind blowing for sure. I mean,

259
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,330
and, and I think on the flip side too, is that, well,

260
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,669
10 years ago, well, ok, 10 years ago we had smartphones but

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,349
we didn't use them like we do now.

262
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,299
Right.

263
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,030
You know. No, no, I think that's an important point. This is something I was,

264
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,090
I was thinking about on my bike ride for,

265
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,099
I don't even remember why this came up in my mind.

266
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,590
But 10 years ago the iphone was like, brand new.

267
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,210
And you think about how much the world has changed in 10 years. Oh, no.

268
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,510
You know what it was? So, you'll love this.

269
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,270
My kids played this game called Genshin Impact

270
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,890
and they, they've been hounding me for months to play with them.

271
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,739
So I'm finally like, fine. Now, the one thing I will say, like, anti

272
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,809
cheat is clearly a huge deal for this game.

273
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,799
It's, it's a Chinese company that makes it.

274
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,080
And

275
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,390
when you run it now, mind you,

276
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,210
I'm running this on basically like a Ringer Windows computer.

277
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,080
It, it, the game runs as admin because of all the anti cheat crap that

278
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:28,799
I

279
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,849
know. I'm like, oh my goodness, my Children are running this on computers.

280
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,510
It's like, I'll just never touch those computers again

281
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,309
because I don't want anyway anyway.

282
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,099
And I was thinking now you can play this game on a PC.

283
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:44,969
You can play it on a Playstation and you can play it on your phone and it's all the same.

284
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,549
Like you can play the game, shut it off on your computer, pick up your phone,

285
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,979
open the game and you literally come where you left off.

286
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:51,710
And I'm thinking like

287
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,559
a decade ago, if you would have told me this was going to be reality,

288
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,859
I would have been like, no way you're completely making this out.

289
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,479
-- There's no way that could happen.
-- I accidentally kicked the plug out of my computer,

290
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,840
plug it back in, turn it on and Chrome's like, do you want to restore it?

291
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,960
And I'm like, God, yes, please, please, please. And all the tabs came back.

292
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,549
Actually. You know, it's really funny

293
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,380
when I reboot my Linux computer and I have a lot of stuff going on in Firefox.

294
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,320
I'll do a Kill Dash Nine, which is just like the kill, you know,

295
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,619
like kill it now with fire.

296
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,549
Don't, don't, like, let anything shut down that way when I restart Firefox again,

297
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,059
it's like, oh, I must have crashed.

298
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,880
Let's just reopen all the tabs,

299
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:28,530
you know.

300
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:33,159
-- Anyway. Anyway.
-- No, but that's the thing. Right? Smartphones matter now, like our

301
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,299
i it's,

302
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,239
you want to get government service, you want to order a meal,

303
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,440
you want to do your banking.

304
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,530
It's a smartphone thing.

305
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,320
Seriously,

306
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:42,880
you know.

307
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,200
Uh,

308
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,549
and so I, I think we're getting better but I think conversely,

309
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,320
especially if you want to do something at a distance.

310
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,109
Uh, what better way than to hack the guy, the person's smartphone. Right.

311
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,719
And attribution is impossible because here's the best part too.

312
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:00,780
If you get caught it doesn't come back to you.

313
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,440
It goes back to, oh, the NSO group is, you know, at fault effectively for this. Cool.

314
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,669
-- That, that's not my problem.
-- Think about

315
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,679
everything going on in the world today. We're online more than we've ever been.

316
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,950
-- There's real money all over the place. I
-- would argue that are we ever offline?

317
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,270
I mean, if you're carrying a cell phone, you're online. 24 seven.

318
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,469
I, I, everything I do. I mean, you think I wake up in the morning,

319
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,030
I use my phone to download podcasts while I'm on my bicycle

320
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,349
doing my ride. I come back, right. I sit down and start working

321
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:34,270
and

322
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,229
that's obviously all online.

323
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:43,940
I might play some video games again. Most online I'll watch youtube or Netflix or

324
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:50,380
even even my, even my broadcast TV. I have set up is a flex client

325
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,320
that talks to my Flex server that is

326
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,690
-- streaming the television to me or a network. You
-- go offline to read a book.

327
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,090
-- And well, how did you buy that book though? You bought that book
-- online?

328
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,210
Actually, I, I love my Ereader.

329
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:06,969
I am one of those people that I think E readers are vastly superior to real books,

330
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:07,409
please.

331
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,989
At me, I love this conversation,

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,489
but like I have an infinite number of books on an Ereader I, I now I,

333
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,169
I don't care for the DRM and everything and that's another story.

334
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,070
But yeah, like

335
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,099
everything I do

336
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:19,460
is online.

337
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:23,059
-- It's madness.
-- We are seeing some really interesting advances in

338
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,869
like

339
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,320
real security where they're squishing entire classes of problems.

340
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,739
We're making things fantastically better.

341
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,830
I love how all the major cloud providers now are

342
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,280
doing secure enclaves in silicon for the last few years.

343
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,340
Right. Amazon's nitro stuff like that.

344
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,909
you know, Apple has their secure enclave processor.

345
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,979
Uh Google is doing it on the Android phones, right?

346
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,869
They have that thing where they can now do um,

347
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,349
voice to text or whatever for subtitles and it's done in like a little stand alone

348
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:50,109
thing so that the rest of your phone doesn't know what's going on and it's private and

349
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,419
it's, it's, I find that really intriguing.

350
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:53,195
Now,

351
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:56,155
now I want to interrupt you though because I know we've

352
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,005
talked about a lot of this technology in the past.

353
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:01,114
I think we did a whole episode in the Apple T two chip back when it came out.

354
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:02,835
But so there is that

355
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:07,604
kind of defensive perspective of let's make technology better,

356
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:10,304
let let's focus on some of this and that's hugely important.

357
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:14,914
But I think the thing we don't talk about very often is the days of taking

358
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:15,885
the data,

359
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,219
the, the time of taking days or weeks or months to patch things

360
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,090
is

361
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,289
I think dead.

362
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,299
And this is one of those things that

363
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,179
matters. Right. And the problem is everything matters now, basically.

364
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,619
Right. Right.

365
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,380
That's just it.

366
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,489
Like, if I'm a company making a product and people are buying my product, be it an app,

367
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,719
be it a thing?

368
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:41,059
You download a game genshin impact on my computer.

369
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,900
Like this thing runs as freaking admin.

370
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:43,239
I,

371
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,159
I guarantee it's full of security vulnerabilities

372
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,739
because it's a freaking video game,

373
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,159
you know?

374
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,479
-- Well, the anti cheat stuff is probably full of flaws.
-- Oh, my goodness. I,

375
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,679
yeah, guaranteed, guaranteed.

376
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,289
And you get the idea of the ability to update

377
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,219
a lot of this quickly is becoming hugely important.

378
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,630
So there's the angle of the company needs to update their products,

379
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,189
but then also the person receiving, it needs to be able to update as well.

380
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,719
And I mean,

381
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,348
I always talk to enterprise people and they're like, oh,

382
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:13,989
you don't understand this is an enterprise.

383
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,868
We can't just update in a day. And it's like, well, if you don't,

384
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:23,848
you're screwed and I, I'm super sensitive to this and I,

385
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,948
I am truly sympathetic to the plight of the

386
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,788
people in, in large enterprises trying to manage all this infrastructure.

387
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:31,489
But it's like,

388
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:32,989
I feel like

389
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:34,948
you're, you're right

390
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,188
and I'm right.

391
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:37,588
And now what?

392
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,569
Well, and now what honestly,

393
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:42,160
a lot of people outsource their stuff to the cloud and just, they're like,

394
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,449
I'm outsourcing this risk.

395
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,239
I'm done with it.

396
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:44,780
That's,

397
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,839
that's quite often what happens.

398
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,040
Things. Sure. But you can't do that to everything.

399
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,140
-- Yes, you can if your risk appetite is willing. I
-- mean, no, you can't like

400
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,209
imagine.

401
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,900
-- Let's, let's pick on Microsoft because we can,
-- dude,

402
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,439
-- there's entire banks that are pure cloud based, but
-- they're still running window.

403
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,939
I mean, they might be in the cloud,

404
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,930
but I guarantee you they have windows servers running that need to be

405
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,880
updated on a regular cadence and their cadence is probably 30 days.

406
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,560
I don't know.

407
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:14,140
I, I

408
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:14,430
do know,

409
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:14,660
I

410
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:15,310
guarantee

411
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:15,660
it.

412
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,510
There is no bank, there is no company over,

413
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,180
let's say 1000 employees that is going to be running in

414
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:26,369
a clearly cloud environment the way you want to define cloud.

415
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:30,270
It is just the honest to God reality of computing.

416
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,750
I am going to respectfully disagree with you because there are

417
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,180
reference studies of banks that are essentially 100% cloud based.

418
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,540
Do they have something outside of the cloud?

419
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,405
No, no, no, they can be cloud based.

420
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:45,974
I'm happy to admit they are cloud based, but there is a difference between Sass

421
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:47,314
and

422
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:52,214
running essentially a bunch of Windows computers in the cloud. You know what I mean?

423
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:52,814
Well,

424
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:56,734
there's this one famous case of essentially this one lives in Aws and uses all

425
00:18:56,744 --> 00:19:00,844
-- the Aws services like LAMBDA and stuff
-- and you can use all the services.

426
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,714
But I I would there is no way

427
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,015
they aren't running

428
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,219
a server. You know what I mean? A Windows server in that infrastructure.

429
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:13,420
-- Uh
-- The one reference case I saw it was all Amazon services,

430
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:16,459
but you can be an Amazon service and run

431
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,939
-- a windows server
-- curtain.

432
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,280
I don't know,

433
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,359
but they had like a complete architectural diagram of

434
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,880
their bank and it was all Amazon services.

435
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,979
-- There were no what you would call classic
-- servers.

436
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:29,199
I'm going to be willing to eat crow. I want you to look this up and send it to me.

437
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,699
But I will be completely shocked

438
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,890
if they aren't using

439
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,709
E two as part of that infrastructure.

440
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,689
And if you're using easy two, by definition,

441
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,250
you're functionally running servers and, and again,

442
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,800
those servers need to be updated.

443
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,250
Right? That's the challenge. Yeah.

444
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,010
Well, and, and what the real challenge though is,

445
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,750
how often do you have to update a server every year?

446
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,910
Well, ballpark at least 12 times once a month. Let's say

447
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:52,329
that

448
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,640
I would say that's a normal cadence once a month,

449
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,089
at

450
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,979
-- least once a month plus, you know, zero day drops. So
-- it's

451
00:19:58,989 --> 00:19:59,729
-- a
-- handful more

452
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,099
apps. Are you running on it?

453
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:01,930
You

454
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,319
know,

455
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,040
-- and
-- so you then take, let's call it 20 updates for a round number

456
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,880
20 updates. What, what is the chance that one of them will cause breakage?

457
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,119
Probably 100%.

458
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,520
Probably at least one or two. Yeah.

459
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,420
And then you handle like the thing with and

460
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,040
then you look at the security and it's like,

461
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,050
well, what are the chances we actually get hit by a security attack.

462
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,920
What compensating controls have we got, you know, ensure that this doesn't happen.

463
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,319
You know,

464
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:32,000
if I'm running a server on a virtual private cloud and it's got a really well defined,

465
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,319
you know, web interface that's protected by a WF and cloud flare and stuff like that.

466
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,959
You know, I might, I might worry less,

467
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,420
you know, I might take that risk. Right.

468
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,489
And, yeah. No, it's, it's, um,

469
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,729
it's a difficult, it's,

470
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,410
it is hard,

471
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,540
you know, cost benefit. Risk analysis is hard. That's

472
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,449
why

473
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,979
this is hard.

474
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,739
This is not an easy job

475
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,780
to do, especially at scale. Right.

476
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,260
And that's the other thing people forget is like, I mean, I

477
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,329
manage a literal handful of servers.

478
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,239
I manage two servers now,

479
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,719
my own little pie box and we have one little VPC running wordpress left in the cloud

480
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:09,189
and that's whatever easy.

481
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,670
But like wordpress.com.

482
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,969
Right. That's a whole different level of scale and operations.

483
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:16,930
You know.

484
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:19,510
Now you need to have somebody whose entire job it is,

485
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,199
is to deal with parking issues and building parking

486
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,180
lots for the staff that runs the computers.

487
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,030
Right. Right.

488
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,280
Well,

489
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,869
they probably automatic has been good about work from home.

490
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:30,540
But you

491
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:30,810
know what I'm

492
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:31,199
saying? Like at

493
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:31,650
some

494
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,270
point you

495
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,420
have,

496
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,619
yes,

497
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,109
you got to have a parking lot person.

498
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,680
You gotta have just all sorts of crazy

499
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,439
things because you have so many people working,

500
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:39,250
doing stuff

501
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:40,599
are mind.

502
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,550
Well, that's it, it's logistics, right?

503
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,810
Like I remember reading this quote that, you know,

504
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,050
fundamentally every large problem becomes a logistics problem.

505
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,839
That's right.

506
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,359
That's right.

507
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:52,329
Well, that's, I mean,

508
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:56,569
I love the description noise of Amazon is like Amazon isn't a technology company.

509
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,469
Amazon is a logistics company but they

510
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,760
needed technology to support their logistics.

511
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,400
So they built

512
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,140
it. I mean,

513
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,739
anyway, anyway, we've gone,

514
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,260
I don't even know what to say. I keep thinking about this.

515
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,760
I've been thinking about this for a lot.

516
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,420
I think the only way out of this is automation,

517
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,839
it's being able to, to apply a patch whack a button

518
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:22,079
and 30 minutes later you have a build that is completely tested

519
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:25,160
and I know saying completely tested,

520
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,869
easy to say those words

521
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,459
and in practice, basically damn near impossible.

522
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:30,500
Right?

523
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,140
And then another button,

524
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,030
you hit another button and it pushes it out to the content delivery network

525
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,150
and people get the update right away and having said that again,

526
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,109
there's people on slow internet.

527
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,930
They can't get a half gigabyte update,

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,410
right? Or, or what about?

529
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,239
I have my parents turn their computer off

530
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,290
and then they don't use it for a week, which is like mind blowing to me. But

531
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,000
then they turn it on

532
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,589
and then they get mad because it takes an hour to turn

533
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,719
on because every freaking thing they have installed needs an update now,

534
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:06,069
you know, and it creates

535
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,550
a silly, I, I just tell him. I like sleep. This stupid thing on it goes to sleep.

536
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,660
It uses like no power. I mean, you get the idea,

537
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,219
you know?

538
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,339
Yeah, there's no good answer to this. I don't

539
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:18,660
-- where we're talking about a problem with no solution,
-- I think.

540
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,050
Well,

541
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,260
the one of the few answers is to look for

542
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,739
vendors that actually provide support and do patches quickly and

543
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,540
that is becoming more and more apparent who does and who does not.

544
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,250
And the good news is for a few things that matter.

545
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,550
Most of the vendors are doing it.

546
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,709
Like most of the web browsers are pretty responsive now.

547
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,550
No, I agree. And now you know what? This is a good example.

548
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,880
I think,

549
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,619
I think you've actually hit on the story is if you look at the web browser universe,

550
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,900
probably 10 plus years ago,

551
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,380
it was pretty dicey. I mean,

552
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:52,140
I would say you had browsers that didn't really care about security.

553
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,000
You know, Microsoft for the most part,

554
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,619
you had Firefox, which I think was doing a pretty good job on features.

555
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,660
But I think some of their security was definitely lacking and then

556
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,000
kind of Google shows up with their sandbox

557
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:07,109
10 years ago. Nobody really cared about security like they do now.

558
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,229
Well, some of us did. I mean,

559
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,790
so fun, fun fact.

560
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:15,170
I remember arguing with the Mozilla developers at one point.

561
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,300
I'm like we, you need to assign CV I DS to all your security issues like we don't care.

562
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,609
And I was like, if I just assign these,

563
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,329
will you put them in your advisories and they're like, yeah, whatever nerd.

564
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:26,589
But, you know,

565
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,119
and these days that's unthinkable for the most part of

566
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,250
not assigning some sort of identifier to your security issues.

567
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,709
And yet here we are with the Travis C I issue and no, Cve.

568
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:39,119
Well, that's because Cve is fundamentally broken.

569
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,160
This is a cloud problem and they don't deal with that.

570
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,319
Now, there's, there's thing obviously,

571
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:46,130
there's things happening to help fix this in theory.

572
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,459
But

573
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,369
Cve isn't, isn't it? I mean, that's just reality. That's another story.

574
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,630
CV is pearl.

575
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,420
-- No CV is straight up pearl.
-- It is.

576
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,589
Anyway, I'm not, we're not talking about that today.

577
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,520
All right, the web browser though,

578
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,680
I really like that comparison because web browser technology has come a long way.

579
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:06,859
It's gone from, we need the ability to sandbox things,

580
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:08,339
we need the ability to harden things.

581
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,869
I mean, Google created a special library to deal with true type fonts

582
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,579
because most people don't know this.

583
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,349
But you can actually literally include true type fonts in your website

584
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,930
to download and render and the true type font libraries

585
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,310
will say weren't the best written things ever.

586
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,989
Well, I mean, historically, we've just assumed you could trust them, right?

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,540
-- So like Google wrote special libraries for this. Well,
-- who would serve a bad font?

588
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,510
I mean, come on.

589
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,380
-- True type fonts are turning complete. Did you know that I was
-- just about to say? Yeah.

590
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,339
Fun fact.

591
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,209
I think all the fonts are though, like postscript, everything printing has been.

592
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:41,770
-- I know, I know. Postscript
-- is.

593
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,229
Yeah, because there's that really nice chess engine written in postscript.

594
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:47,430
Well, my favorite was there was a postscript file.

595
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,810
When I was in college you could send it the printer

596
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,650
that would actually calculate the value of pie

597
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,449
on the printer and then print it. It took like 10 minutes. It was hilarious.

598
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,040
It was weird denial of servicing the printer. We thought it was a joke.

599
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,760
That's actually why I had to buy new printers.

600
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,180
My, my old printers CPU it was an HP laser jet four. It was just too slow

601
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:10,260
to render certain PS and PDF files.

602
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,300
It just literally couldn't print them.

603
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,719
It just would sit there and stare blankly at the wall.

604
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,489
That's awesome.

605
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,819
That's awesome. Anyway. Anyway. OK. So,

606
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,579
but the web browser universe, right,

607
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:23,380
there was all this technology that showed up to help make vulnerabilities harder.

608
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,089
There were, you know, hardening essentially.

609
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,979
But then also there was the aspect of

610
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,500
like, let's just stop telling people what's going on.

611
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,449
We're going to build auto updates into this.

612
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:37,140
And I think part of that auto update system means you also

613
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,969
have to be extremely aware of what could break for users.

614
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:44,410
How do we make sure this is a painless experience? Because

615
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,609
if you're a web browser vendor

616
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,050
and my browser just breaks one day.

617
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,079
I'm going to be mad. I'm just going to switch browsers, you know.

618
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:53,800
Yeah.

619
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:54,359
Well,

620
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,699
I have to say Chrome especially has gotten much better

621
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,890
at bringing all my tabs back the way they were.

622
00:26:58,949 --> 00:26:59,420
Be it,

623
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,199
I turn off the computer accidentally or restart Chrome

624
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,599
for an update because it used to be,

625
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,319
you know, you restarted Chrome for an update

626
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:06,650
and you got a blank slate.

627
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
right? Well,

628
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,829
you didn't restart for an update. You had to go download the new version

629
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,369
and

630
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,579
then install the new version

631
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,140
and it maybe blew away all your bookmarks. Who knows?

632
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,180
And yeah, I mean, it was definitely a weird time.

633
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,989
Well, there were times where I just, I had too many tabs open and I just, I like,

634
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,420
I literally would be writing a security report about the flaw in the browser.

635
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,180
And I'm like,

636
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,569
right, I need to restart my browser, but I can't until I've done this work.

637
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,530
-- It's very
-- meta.

638
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,790
It was a living.

639
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,510
I mean, but, but I guess here's the thing is I feel like browsers are ahead of the game.

640
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,449
I think phones are getting better. I mean, like an easy example is

641
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,869
why on earth can you use

642
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,479
iMessage to root an iphone? I feel like this is a total no brainer.

643
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:55,699
You need to rewrite this freaking thing in something that's memory safe.

644
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:59,579
Well, and they're doing that with blast door and having stuff contained Well, yeah,

645
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:02,380
-- I
-- mean, they're getting there but I feel like, you know what I mean?

646
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,459
This is, this should not exist.

647
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,939
Well, look at the, look at windows and all the traditional, you know,

648
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:09,469
when we found out there's a bunch of font processing in the kernel.

649
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,670
-- Yeah. And they fixed it.
-- Yeah.

650
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,180
Well, but I mean, you know, it took how many years for them to fix it

651
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:17,194
longer than it should have. And, but that's the thing, right?

652
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:24,895
I feel like Apple is operating on a timeline from 2005. Not a timeline in 2021.

653
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,354
-- Yeah,
-- I, yeah,

654
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:29,074
I, I like this stuff needs to be fixed now.

655
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,474
Not like, oh, we're working on it, everyone. We'll have it done in a couple of years.

656
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:35,354
Like no, you have two months go

657
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,035
-- well.
-- And

658
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:39,535
I think part of the brutal reality too is, is

659
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:41,675
playing whack a mole with vulnerabilities

660
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,170
no longer works. There's no, it's, it's untenable.

661
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,280
You need to reengineer stuff very fundamentally

662
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,119
so that

663
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,119
you essentially build it so that yes, the bad guys will get in,

664
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,050
they will get code execution.

665
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,140
But because, you know,

666
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,359
we're running it virtualized in a sandbox inside of a thing with a gun, you know,

667
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,199
a metaphorical gun pointing at it

668
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,920
that, you know, if it steps outside of its memory boundary at all,

669
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,020
we shoot it in the head.

670
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,479
Well, ok, now we're maybe sort of safe.

671
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,500
Yeah, that's part of it. It's all of this stuff piled together, I think. And,

672
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,099
and unfortunately I feel like

673
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,550
I feel like we always just keep switching

674
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,959
our conversations to something else instead of saying

675
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,949
-- it's all the same problem.
-- Well, I mean, fundamentally, as I see, the challenge is

676
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,229
economically,

677
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,989
how do you incentivize companies to spend a ton of

678
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,439
-- money on products that they've already sold
-- well in?

679
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:32,280
-- Right. That, that's obviously part of the issue as well,
-- right?

680
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,405
And traditionally with cars warranties and stuff,

681
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:36,344
but that's not gonna work with software

682
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:40,505
and, and look, man, the world is functioning for the most part

683
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:43,334
and until there's some sort of incentive,

684
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:47,334
be it regulation or financial pressure from customers or whatever.

685
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,339
I don't think we're going to see drastic changes. I mean, let's face it.

686
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:52,000
That's why Apple can spend years fixing

687
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,219
iMessage because no one's saying if you don't do this right now,

688
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,760
we're not going to give you any money.

689
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,420
The reality is apple products are selling like hot cakes

690
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,979
and they're going to keep selling like hot cakes.

691
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,079
Let's be real

692
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:05,869
vulnerabilities in iMessage that are exploited by the NSO group

693
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,449
don't directly affect probably 99.9% of iphone users.

694
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,250
Like my kids both have iphones.

695
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,390
I,

696
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,670
I doubt very much somebody's going to use the NSO

697
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,109
-- group to attack their phones even if
-- they did,

698
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,170
what, what's gonna happen to them?

699
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,729
Nothing noticeable.

700
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:25,329
Now,

701
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,739
do I worry about stuff like the NSO

702
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,800
group being used to steer national conversations by,

703
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,329
you know, killing journalists or by,

704
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,739
you know,

705
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:34,140
that kind of stuff.

706
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,949
That, yeah, I do worry a bit about that because as we're seeing right now, you know,

707
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:40,439
it's been a bit of a rough week in North America for some, you know,

708
00:30:40,449 --> 00:30:42,920
sillier people protesting sillier things

709
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:44,290
in a way that I,

710
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,869
if you told me about this even a year ago I would have thought.

711
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,030
No, that's just, no, that's like bad.

712
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,729
Like, that's a bad story and you're being lazy with your writing.

713
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,780
Like that's just not possible, but apparently that's,

714
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,989
and so

715
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,329
I just, I keep coming back to the fact that like Russia will happily spend a few,

716
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,829
like for Russia to spend a few million dollars on Brexit,

717
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,569
they basically broke a major NATO partner.

718
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,329
That's

719
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,109
-- right. Like, they have food shortages in Britain
-- now. It's probably the,

720
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,209
the best investment they ever made.

721
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,599
Yeah.

722
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:11,420
Yeah.

723
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,839
I it's mind blowing to me this whole

724
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,140
Brexit thing and then now you've got Scotland looking

725
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,359
like they're going to vote for independence and

726
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:18,380
probably rejoin the eu because they're not stupid,

727
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,380
which I just, I love the fact. Yeah. Oh my God. The maps are going to be so complicated.

728
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,650
Those Venn diagrams of what is the UK and the British Isles and everything is

729
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,170
complicated.

730
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:29,819
I mean,

731
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:30,719
but

732
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:34,250
I think I'll try to dig it up. I think C GP Gray made a nice video.

733
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,319
But like what is the eu and it's mind bogglingly complicated

734
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,780
anyway. Anyway, I think we need to call this one.

735
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,060
I guess the, the parting thought and the thing that would give me hope in all of this

736
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:48,099
is

737
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:52,859
I still feel like we're on the right path. At least

738
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,469
-- I think
-- better.

739
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,270
We are actively getting a

740
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:59,410
better ecosystem and better technology that enables more

741
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,579
technology and more automation and more ecosystem.

742
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,959
And it's one of those things that becomes a self reinforcing cycle.

743
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:09,619
The reality is you could set up AC I system now on your own probably in less than a week,

744
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,729
20 years ago. That would have been physically impossible.

745
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:14,569
You can do it in like five minutes and

746
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:18,550
exactly, and 20 years ago that would have been something,

747
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,449
a fortune 100 company might aspire to.

748
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,530
That's right. And, and I think just all

749
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,979
this all sucks,

750
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,930
but knowing about it is the first step.

751
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,380
And I think for a long time

752
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,119
we just didn't know

753
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,219
and

754
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,099
well, or we didn't realize how important it was.

755
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:39,390
Like,

756
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,900
I am so grateful for all those people that spent all that

757
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,719
time working on those MRN A vaccines for the last 10 years.

758
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,640
Thank goodness,

759
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,099
-- no
-- joke
-- turns out they were right,

760
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,109
sadly.

761
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,469
Alright. Alright. Anyway, I'm adding it. Thank you, Kurt.
