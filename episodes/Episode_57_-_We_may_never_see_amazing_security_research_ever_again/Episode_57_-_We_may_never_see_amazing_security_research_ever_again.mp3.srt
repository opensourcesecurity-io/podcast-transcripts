Hello and welcome to episode 57 of the open source security podcast

1
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,510
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner thought crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,600
How are you? Kurt? It's been, it feels like forever since we've talked

3
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:16,940
two

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:21,819
weeks. It's been a while. Yeah, I was, I was indisposed last week at

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,850
Black Hat

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,329
and it was fun. It was, it was a good time.

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,670
But I, I must say

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,770
if, if I was going to take up my, my kind of my whole experience and sum it up in one word,

9
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,189
it would be a mat.

10
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,950
-- It was, yeah,
-- I, uh

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,500
the only thing I actually

12
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:45,040
saw that was even remotely amusing or interesting was that, uh,

13
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,119
somebody finally built like a $200 safe twiddling machine?

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,099
Yes, that was, that was really cool actually. And I like that a lot.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
It, it is

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,259
not surprising in any way that, that this can be done.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,169
But why don't you explain to the listeners what it

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,819
is just for anyone who hasn't read the story yet?

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:04,599
Yeah.

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,230
So, so when it comes to safes, you got your classic safe with the big old dial,

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,190
you know, and you're like, it's like 37 right, 12, left, 17, right.

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,120
You know, you could chunk the little lever thing and the door opens

23
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:24,220
and uh typically you've got to dial between like either zero and 60 or zero and 100

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,949
you know, and you got three numbers you got to enter and then it

25
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,279
could chunks open.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,410
Um

27
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,910
So, you know, in theory,

28
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:36,529
that's a lot of combinations and to like brew force that thing takes a long time.

29
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:42,139
But in practice, um, well, like my, my gym lock, my master lock is a great example.

30
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,650
Uh, you know, assuming the combination is like, let's say 1 1020.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,809
Well, you don't actually have to get like one,

32
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,419
it's like somewhere within one or two numbers of one.

33
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,949
Right. So,

34
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,019
right there, you've vastly reduced the number of combinations by quite a lot,

35
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,910
like on a dial with 60 numbers.

36
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,910
Well, now there's really sort of 20

37
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,510
you know,

38
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,529
um,

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,940
and then the second thing is there's this clever,

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,820
uh because it's not like these safes,

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,229
like you enter three numbers and then you have to start again from scratch,

42
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:16,910
right? Like, as soon as you kind of hit that first number, it dials into place.

43
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,860
And then if you hit the 2nd and 3rd number,

44
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:21,990
obviously they dial into place and if you don't, well, good luck you keep going.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,500
Um, but there's a, I forget the name of the mathematical formula that you can use,

46
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,699
but you can essentially like

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,500
say it's a combinatorics problem

48
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,649
and you can come up with an optimized

49
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:37,320
like number of, you know, to attempt all the possible combinations, right?

50
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,100
So you try like

51
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:42,815
instead of trying like 111, 1112113, you try like

52
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,815
113112749, you know, whatever.

53
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:49,535
And you end up trying a lot of different combinations much faster.

54
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,044
Does that work on combination locks though?

55
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,794
I mean, it depends on the combination lock.

56
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:57,095
Ok, because I know it works for, in fact, I remember back in the day

57
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,335
when people had answering machines,

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,679
you could type in

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,679
like a four digit code to

60
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:07,259
access your messages and someone had worked out a string of like 30

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,300
characters that basically hit every four digit code you could possibly hit,

62
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,119
-- which
-- was

63
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:15,289
one of those classic, you know, it depends on the safe model, right?

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,470
Some also require a key, some require biometric, some are electronic blah, blah,

65
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,919
blah, but fundamentally,

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,720
here's the dirty secret, right?

67
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,220
If you don't have some sort of back off function that says like, oh, you know,

68
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,589
you got the combination wrong seven times in a row,

69
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm going to make you wait a minute,

70
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,940
right? They're just going to keep pounding away.

71
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:37,270
And the beauty is, you know, most of these safes are, are reasonably well made and,

72
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,779
you know, you can dial the combination pretty quickly.

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,899
So that actually,

74
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,899
well, actually we're back into exactly like

75
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,509
the classic security territory of, like,

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,029
my hash function is really fast and efficient.

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,990
So, don't use it to store passwords

78
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,389
because really fast and efficient.

79
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,559
Um, so anyways back to the mechanical locks,

80
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,600
the idea is you basically have like this machine

81
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,660
that you will probably have magnets on it.

82
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,740
So it just kind of chunks onto the front of the safe and

83
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,229
it's got like a little motor to turn the knob back and forth

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,160
and then another little one to kind of put, you know, to try the door basically.

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,220
And then the beauty is, uh,

86
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,480
I think this was in the movie, the Saint, didn't he have one of these?

87
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,649
There was some movie that

88
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,010
James Bond film I've seen

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,070
with this

90
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,040
and, and, you know, and the difference being,

91
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:27,700
except that now with a 3d printer and like an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi,

92
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,269
you can build one of these for Tuna Bucks,

93
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:32,119
which is amazing. Yeah.

94
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,529
And you know, and the thing is like,

95
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,679
you don't, once you've built it, you don't need talent, right?

96
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,480
You just could chunk it to the front of the safe

97
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,209
and like have a smoke while it does its thing.

98
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,070
Um,

99
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,260
and that's the thing to remember about Safes, right? Is,

100
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,920
uh all the Safes I've ever seen or read about,

101
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:53,750
have a rating and that rating is not like how, you know, burglar proof it is.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,769
That rating is given,

103
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,760
you know, this set of circumstances. This is how long it will take to break in. Right.

104
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:03,500
The classic ones being is without tools, it'll take X number of, you know,

105
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,420
hours to brute force the safe

106
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,230
and with tools it'll take like 10 minutes.

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,980
Um, there's actually some really good youtube videos

108
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,769
of this guy who works for.

109
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,549
I think it's one of the, uh,

110
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,179
it's like insurance underwriters of America or whatever and

111
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,880
they actually do the ratings on these safes.

112
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,700
And so his job is to break into these safes and, like,

113
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,670
make sure that what the manufacturer said, like, it's

114
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,950
20 minutes with tools and he's like, no, it's like five minutes because you do this.

115
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,609
It's, it's a crazy job

116
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,190
and there's various levels as well because there's like

117
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,399
normal tools which could be, you know,

118
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,609
a drill and hammer and crowbars and things and then there's

119
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,059
the torch,

120
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:41,529
it

121
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,450
changes the rules.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,739
Yeah, exactly.

123
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,359
Or like, in the case of Mythbusters drill a hole, fill it with water,

124
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,570
stick dynamite in and

125
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:53,739
as it turns out the front of the safe goes a good 50 60 m.

126
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:55,869
I did not see that

127
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,170
episode

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,799
-- but I totally believe
-- it.

129
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,489
It was beautiful

130
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,570
but beautiful.

131
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:02,850
Um,

132
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:06,850
so, yeah, I mean, well, the reality is, for example, I used to the last place I lived,

133
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:10,049
actually, I actually installed a wall mounted safe,

134
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,489
not

135
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,950
to prevent burglars from getting a stuff, but actually

136
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,130
to prevent myself from accidentally throwing out important papers.

137
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:19,980
Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

138
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:23,779
That, that, that was the whole point of it was, I would open the safe up,

139
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,760
put important papers in, like, my passport or my birth certificate and then lock it

140
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,859
and I, I couldn't, like, accidentally throw stuff out.

141
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,440
That was the whole point of that safe.

142
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,559
Yeah. No, I, I do, I do similar things.

143
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,339
I, I, although I use the bank because I'm too lazy to buy safe.

144
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,079
And I kind of, I, I did the numbers

145
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:41,880
a

146
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,200
Costco with free shipping. It was awesome.

147
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,200
Of course you did.

148
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,010
I, I'm a cheapskate and, and what I pay to keep my things at the bank is actually great.

149
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,630
Safe story about my bank

150
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:54,559
is

151
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,029
I, I switched banks at, at one point I moved and,

152
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,529
and so obviously I wanted to go to the branch near my home

153
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,600
and I go into their vault and this is a relatively old bank.

154
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:04,510
In fact, I bet it's

155
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,820
more than 50 years old. Ok.

156
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:13,899
And the boxes are all in the vault. And so I go in the vault and I look at the back wall

157
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
and I said,

158
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,549
why,

159
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,339
why was there a hole in your back wall because it was clearly patched? Right.

160
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,899
And my thought is they, they were broken into at some point.

161
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,899
And the guy looked at me and said, uh,

162
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,149
we, we locked the safe wrong one time and we had to pay someone to break in.

163
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,290
And I said what?

164
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:38,420
And so he showed me, he showed me their safe, which is really cool actually. And

165
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:39,970
there's like all these dials.

166
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,339
So basically, like you lock the safe at five pm and it will not open it.

167
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,179
You like, you, you still have to use a combination,

168
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,619
but you cannot use the combination to open the safe

169
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,880
until say 7 a.m. the next day or whatever,

170
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,160
right?

171
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,579
Whatever you want to set it to.

172
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,140
And apparently what happened

173
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,690
is somebody sent that those dials to an indeterminate date.

174
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,809
So they didn't know when they were going to be able to open the safe.

175
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,559
And so they called in a company

176
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,570
that he said it took them two days to drill through

177
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,440
the wall in the back to get into the safe.

178
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,899
-- And I was like, that's solid. You know,
-- I actually remember reading about that.

179
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,970
There was this company, a small hosting company back in the day that bought like a,

180
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,279
an old bank building,

181
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:20,589
you know,

182
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,149
and part of the idea was they would like the ultra secure hosting in the bank vault.

183
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,929
But of course,

184
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:28,980
that means you need to drill holes for electrical data and air

185
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,489
and you know, it turns out he's like, yeah,

186
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,270
this concrete sucks because it's concrete with rebar

187
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,299
and

188
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,119
they mixed in like these special hard chunks of

189
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,109
some sort of aggregate that like breaks dry.

190
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,359
And he's like, it cost so much money to drill

191
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,789
the holes in these things. Right. Because you're just going through drill.

192
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,770
But it's like Kleenex,

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,909
I'm sure I can

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,179
just kind of the point.

195
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,229
Right. Right.

196
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,900
Um, but, yeah, no, it's,

197
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,460
yeah, I mean, well, and that's the thing. Right.

198
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,210
Like, so in my neighborhood, generally speaking,

199
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:01,280
the response time for cops is like, five minutes or less.

200
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,710
Right. So, you know, and that's, and that's generally how it works with banks.

201
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:05,849
Right.

202
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:09,609
If, if like, an alarm at a bank goes off at three in the morning, chances are, you know,

203
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,190
grumpy cops with guns are going to show up in, like,

204
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,929
probably less than 10 minutes, probably less than five minutes. Right.

205
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,909
You know, and so if the safe holds people off for five or 10 minutes, cool.

206
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,809
It did its job.

207
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,390
Exactly. Exactly. Well, honestly do,

208
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,880
I would be surprised if most banks have a

209
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,309
whole lot of anything worth stealing on hand.

210
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,760
I mean,

211
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:29,590
um,

212
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,909
well, in the safety deposit boxes there's,

213
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,010
you know,

214
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,049
I,

215
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,369
yeah, but

216
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:36,700
like,

217
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,719
so, so my, my bank's vault has like, 2000 boxes in it. Probably.

218
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:45,909
How would, you know, like, the 10% that have, like, minds full of paperwork?

219
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,820
Literally all that's in it

220
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,369
-- is
-- punch the doors open really quickly.

221
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,090
I

222
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,150
guess it's,

223
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,659
it probably be way easier to just steal Ethereum or something. Right.

224
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,099
Yeah,

225
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,299
that guy that got what, nab, for laundering, like,

226
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,859
$4 billion in Bitcoin because the Mount Gox thing,

227
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,320
uh, that. I don't think anyone was caught for that. Were they?

228
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,549
I, I think they're just, they, they know what's happening.

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,289
No, no,

230
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,549
no. Um

231
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:12,679
Yeah, look it up, look it up

232
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,080
anyway. Anyway. So I will say

233
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,440
that was very interesting from Defcon.

234
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,830
And then also there was talk of voting machines

235
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,140
where,

236
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:23,950
sorry, I

237
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,669
as a Canadian those things piss me off immensely because we don't do that in Canada.

238
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,859
Ok. I'm iii, I agree. I mean,

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,489
good for you. I'm jealous.

240
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
-- But for
-- those of you

241
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,210
with circles and you make an X in the circle,

242
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,669
you fold it and then you,

243
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,390
you put it in a ballot box

244
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,010
and then people count it and if the count comes out wonky, they recount it

245
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,150
and people are like, oh,

246
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,830
but how do you prevent the counters from like monkeying with stuff?

247
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,390
Well,

248
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,020
you have people from different parties counting it together and they

249
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,349
hate each other and you have independent scrutineers who hate everybody.

250
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:58,169
So literally you have the watchers watching

251
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,960
the watchers who hate the other watchers

252
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:03,340
with a bunch of extra watchers who hate everybody watching all of it.

253
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,210
-- Let's
-- back

254
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:04,580
it up

255
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,650
and, and you can, you can rage on that again.

256
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,809
I'll give you another opportunity because you're totally right.

257
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,169
But for those of you listening

258
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,059
at, at, at

259
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,909
defcon this year, they apparently had a bunch of voting machines in the I think,

260
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,229
I guess it was a voting village.

261
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:20,940
They called it.

262
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,320
Yeah,

263
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:21,669
that's,

264
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:22,659
-- yeah,
-- why not?

265
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,099
So, like the old pay phone villages of which I,

266
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,690
I only ever saw legitimately leased pay phones.

267
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,679
Right. Of course they were all legally acquired.

268
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,929
Right. But now that there's no such thing as pay phones. Right.

269
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:33,900
Whatever.

270
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:34,880
So

271
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,450
apparently all of the voting

272
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,830
they had, they all were hacked, which doesn't surprise me in any way.

273
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,299
They're all running windows.

274
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,340
If you're lucky, they're probably running windows.

275
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,369
I bet a lot of them are running worse than that.

276
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,090
I wonder if any of them are running always to like those old ATM S.

277
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,070
It would totally not surprise me.

278
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,820
It's,

279
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,190
it's, it's one of those things that

280
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,489
anyone who expected these machines to last against,

281
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,840
like legitimately talented hackers is fooling themselves. There's just,

282
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:04,880
there's no

283
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,200
-- way
-- the

284
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:06,729
thing that really ticks me off.

285
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,559
Defcon takes place in Vegas and if you look

286
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,599
at the actual rules wrapped around slot machines and,

287
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:16,330
you know, electronic gambling machines in Vegas and, well, Nevada in general,

288
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,210
like, why aren't those standards?

289
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:23,140
The voting machines have nowhere near that standard,

290
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,340
right. Because

291
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,219
in Vegas that's real money and then they just bring you into the desert and you,

292
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,500
you dig your shallow grave.

293
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,020
I mean, right. That, that's kind of how that is,

294
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:37,090
but there's, there's two sides to the voting issues. I see.

295
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:41,580
So my suspicion is the kind of in person type of hacking

296
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,090
is probably never going to be a huge deal. Because it's going to be very difficult

297
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,090
to

298
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,780
really mess with these machines.

299
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,369
-- And, and again,
-- that's the beauty of democracy in general is to do.

300
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,690
Widespread voter tampering

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,489
requires essentially like a corrupt government.

302
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,030
Right?

303
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,710
Where, where, like,

304
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:04,070
there's only one candidate on the ballot and you have to vote for him.

305
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,650
And if you don't, they take you out in the desert and shoot you. Right. Very

306
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:06,880
similar

307
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:07,179
to the

308
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,669
communist thing where

309
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,789
the essentially the vote is premarked.

310
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,770
But if you want to change it, you can go off to the little thing and

311
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,320
change it and then they take you in the desert and shoot you. Right. Exactly.

312
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,859
It's pretty simple.

313
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,299
And, and so you're right, scaling voter fraud kind of in person is one thing.

314
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,989
But I, I suspect the real damage comes from

315
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,950
the ability for a remote adversary

316
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,719
-- to mess with things. And, and again, like
-- when you

317
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,549
say it's worse than that because

318
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,710
you don't need to mess with voter

319
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,669
actual voting to commit fraud.

320
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,150
For example, the electoral rolls who's allowed to vote

321
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,690
and you can very much skew

322
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,260
well, who or what is allowed to vote

323
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,390
and have, you know, because some of these elections are, are, you know,

324
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,109
some of these ridings are quite close, you know, so like

325
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,549
disallowing one or 2% of people to vote

326
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,380
-- actually has a very material effect.
-- Yes, it would be huge in, in many instances

327
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:05,429
-- it
-- has been.

328
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,380
What do you mean, it could be that fair.

329
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,950
Have you not seen?

330
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,039
I know, I know. God bless democracy.

331
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,109
It's

332
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:14,390
right.

333
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:16,239
But

334
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,739
I know that, that makes me sad.

335
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,760
But anyway, your, I think your rant from earlier is very well taken is the fact that

336
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,760
even if we had the best of the best

337
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,820
writing software for voting machines,

338
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,739
they're gonna screw. It would

339
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,599
never have.

340
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:32,909
Here's the

341
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,200
beauty

342
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,830
with the Canadian system,

343
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,960
which is also used in quite a few other countries.

344
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,799
I can teach my six year old

345
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,940
how to be a scrutineer and how to

346
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,729
spot voter fraud

347
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:44,869
by

348
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,400
and large.

349
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,729
I mean, that, that's a really good point actually.

350
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,820
And that's the beauty. Right. You and I are technical security people.

351
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,080
You know, we've done this for decades

352
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,780
and I can still imagine, like,

353
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,080
763 ways this could be compromised and I wouldn't spot it.

354
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,010
Oh, totally, man.

355
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,349
And, and you think that the old lady drinking coffee watching me is gonna know.

356
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,109
You know?

357
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:08,570
Yeah.

358
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,359
No, it's, and, and the thing too I love is then whenever I bring this up with, uh,

359
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,039
other people in larger countries, they're like, oh, but that doesn't scale.

360
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm like,

361
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,400
but yes,

362
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,559
it exactly does scale because you have more places

363
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,859
to vote with more people working the voters.

364
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,140
-- But
-- you, you're saying paper ballots don't scale.

365
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,880
No other people are saying paper ballots don't scale and counting it doesn't scale.

366
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,599
And I'm like, yes, it does because you just scale up the number of people doing this.

367
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,419
Like, as long as,

368
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:39,099
you know, some 10th of a percent or 1% of your population is involved

369
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,659
in running the process then. Yeah, that scales.

370
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,619
Well, you know what else you get to? Actually the beauty of paper

371
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,539
is,

372
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,700
I have seen electronic voting machines stop working

373
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,109
more times than I can count.

374
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,440
We have little pencils.

375
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:55,659
Right. Right.

376
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally get it, man. It's

377
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:03,000
sometimes I feel like electronic voting machines are a solution.

378
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,039
Looking for a problem.

379
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,219
-- Yes
-- and no. So, so like in Canada it's a little different, right?

380
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,119
Because when we have say a federal election

381
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:12,859
it's, you know, you're voting for your local MP basically

382
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,390
or, you know, same, well, basically the same with provincial and, you know,

383
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,469
same with municipal,

384
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,700
but we're not voting on issues.

385
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,429
We're not voting on who's going to be the dog catcher or the sheriff or a judge.

386
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,549
So in Canada, for example, we vote on far, far fewer things,

387
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:28,979
right?

388
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,580
Whereas in the US, especially in some states, like say California, you know,

389
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,460
you'll have a ballot with like 20 or 30 or 40 things on it.

390
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:40,260
So, actually the state of Oregon has solved this beautifully.

391
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:41,309
They, they,

392
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,020
they do, they mail you a book,

393
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,099
you fill out your book and you mail it back in and they have the

394
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:51,690
highest voter turnout rate anywhere in the United States and my suspicion is from a,

395
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,419
from a security perspective,

396
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,260
there is probably little to no fraud

397
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,840
in that environment just because the hassle of going through, you know,

398
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,910
duplicating books, filling out books, mailing books back in

399
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,589
is going to be insanely high.

400
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,589
And additionally, just kind of using statistical analysis on your side is

401
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:17,078
if you wanted to throw the vote and let's say you, you mail in bogus books,

402
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:20,678
they're gonna probably number one figure out, ok, like Kurt sent in two books.

403
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,468
Well, you need to like intercept them and place them and,

404
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:27,878
and let's be honest, people complain incessantly about the US postal service,

405
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,298
but to be honest,

406
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,849
uh like they are incredibly

407
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,050
secure

408
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,780
and reliable. Yeah, same thing with Canada Post. Like

409
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,050
honestly given a choice between who's delivering my package

410
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,310
and this is prior to Amazon Prime, you know, delivery people like Uber.

411
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:48,619
Honestly, my, my first choice was always Canada Post followed by

412
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,910
ups, followed by fedex, followed very far behind by DH S and uh Purolator

413
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,880
because

414
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,430
with DH S and Purolator invariably,

415
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,069
I had to drive out to God knows where to get my package from them.

416
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,750
-- So,
-- you know what I used to love

417
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,880
a long time ago,

418
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,050
I worked tech support at a little ISP

419
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,109
and we learned you could put a floppy disk in the mail

420
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,349
and mail it with one stamp,

421
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,670
it weighed exactly the right amount in an envelope.

422
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,910
And so we would have

423
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,219
custody

424
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:19,369
on

425
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:21,719
the

426
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:22,000
front.

427
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,939
You could, I be, you could do that legally.

428
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,520
There was

429
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:25,780
this guy

430
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,050
that

431
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,020
mailed a bunch of weird objects around like

432
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,709
books and stuff and

433
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,790
to find out what would happen and, you know,

434
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,589
of course a lot of them were broken up

435
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,349
to make sure they didn't contain drugs or whatever.

436
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:34,630
But

437
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,099
no, there's like well known cases of,

438
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,390
um, like that gold for cash thing. They just send you a padded envelope.

439
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:41,949
Yeah.

440
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,329
Yeah. Right. It's the postal service is crazy, man.

441
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,819
-- Like they're the real deal I love in
-- my whole life.

442
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,469
I think they've lost one piece of my mail.

443
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,680
I've lost a handful of things. I, I won't lie to you.

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,930
I, I,

445
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:55,869
but

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,829
regardless,

447
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,089
it, it always, it brought a smile to my face that you could,

448
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,329
you could mail a floppy disk in the mail.

449
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,089
You just literally dropped it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and away. It went

450
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,890
and, and it, it showed up and usually it worked, which was awesome.

451
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:14,780
Well, I mean, that's not really postal services floppy doesn't work.

452
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,500
I mean, that's,

453
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,449
you know, oh God, I remember buying boxes of,

454
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,729
well, I remember buying boxes of 40 floppies

455
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,810
and then I would format them

456
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,300
and get rid of the ones that didn't work. I remember doing that.

457
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,550
And the best part is you would collect them in an empty box until you had 40

458
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,109
then you take it back to Staples or Office Depot

459
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,469
or whatever and be like this entire box is defective.

460
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,650
Give me a fresh box.

461
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:38,270
Right.

462
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:40,160
Yep. I remember that,

463
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,130
man. Those are the

464
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,209
days. Thank goodness,

465
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,939
I do not miss them at all.

466
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,099
I hated that stuff. It was, it was miserable.

467
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,199
I just got rid of all my USB thumb drives and bought a

468
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:54,469
bunch of 16 gig USB 3.0 drives because the 2.0 are too slow.

469
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,459
You know what I do though? I keep a bag of them. I have a Ziploc ba

470
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,209
literally full of thumb drives.

471
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,890
And when like my relatives or neighbors need something,

472
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,609
I give it to them and I say, please don't give it back and they,

473
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,640
they generally do give it back even though I don't want.

474
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,680
But I figured this way if they do keep it,

475
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,040
I don't care.

476
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,189
So it works out very nicely

477
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,810
and then also depending upon who I give it to.

478
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:17,979
Like,

479
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,900
there are some people I know that their computers

480
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,729
are generally so full of viruses and crap.

481
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,010
Like I don't even want the stuff back. It's like they give it to me.

482
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,459
I throw it away because I

483
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,650
it's compromised after you've touched it. Right. I mean,

484
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,489
from a risk management perspective. Yeah, that person is bad news.

485
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:34,849
So

486
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,530
anyway, anyway,

487
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,760
uh point being summing up kind of black hat and, and I was not a de conner be.

488
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,770
I, unfortunately, I, I had events

489
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,050
that, that took up my time there. But

490
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,530
I, I did not see anything

491
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,609
that kind of really made me interested it.

492
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,729
I feel like we're stuck in the same old, same old

493
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,729
period right now in terms of security technologies and just happenings in the

494
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,869
actionable stuff is going on.

495
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,060
There's not very much,

496
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:03,770
I mean, I mean,

497
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:03,949
I

498
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,089
had somebody come to me about like a super

499
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,760
amazing CV that they can't tell me any details about

500
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,699
scripting

501
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,099
in

502
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,170
some web form. Right?

503
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,109
Yeah.

504
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,489
Well, it's probably worse than that, but fundamentally, well,

505
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,250
I was thinking about that the other day because um Microsoft, they just um

506
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,680
expanded their bug bounty program. I don't know if you saw this,

507
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,069
they cover windows and

508
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:30,619
server

509
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,099
and it's like, what is it? A quarter million?

510
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,349
It's between like,

511
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,560
it's like some absurdly low number, like $500 or $5000 and like a quarter million.

512
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,339
So, you know, a bit of variation,

513
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,520
which makes sense though. I understand that.

514
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:49,410
Well, a great example being that like SMBV, one SMB Loris attack.

515
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,319
So it's a denial of service attack where you basically send

516
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:53,920
a bunch of packets that eat up a ton of resources.

517
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,089
Um I actually remember writing about the slow Loris attacks like a decade ago and II,

518
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,180
I tried them out on a bunch of,

519
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,959
you know, servers. I was like, wow, that actually really made a mess of things.

520
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,020
Um

521
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,500
But yeah, like again, if you're like, if you're actually using SMBV one, like,

522
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,699
what the hell.

523
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,459
And number two, if you're exposing it to the internet, like,

524
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:19,609
-- seriously, what the hell,
-- I'll agree with that. 100% don't do that.

525
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,119
Yeah. No, that's,

526
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,400
I don't even know what to say at that point other

527
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,359
than to shake my head and walk away because there's just no

528
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,420
helping that.

529
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,680
Um,

530
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,569
you know,

531
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:34,040
it's like, and it's like, honestly it's cute and Microsoft's like, yeah, it's cute,

532
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,810
but we're not fixing it.

533
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,209
And it's like, yeah, I, I agree with that.

534
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,069
Like,

535
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,300
that's just stupid to fix. Like that's a waste of time and money and

536
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,270
once you fix it, then, you know, customers have to deploy that fix and that, you know,

537
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,250
that's tens of millions of dollars globally wasted.

538
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,250
Totally.

539
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:51,400
Totally.

540
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:52,530
You know, well, Speedo,

541
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,689
here's a thing. I was curious, what's your take on the whole Flash 2020 thing?

542
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,979
I had lunch at black Hat with a bunch of

543
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:05,099
the CBE guys and there were some Adobe people there

544
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,569
and I was very clear and I will say it on this podcast as well.

545
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,209
I will die before Flash does.

546
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,410
And I'm going to stand by that

547
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,619
now, granted, now that means my,

548
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,589
my death is kind of the future of humanity depends on it.

549
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,290
So,

550
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,410
so for those of you that don't know,

551
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,680
-- apparently Adobe has committed to killing Flash in 2020
-- and, and

552
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,989
the Adobe guys didn't disagree with me for the record.

553
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,239
-- So, in fairness, how old is Flash? Now?
-- It's really old, but here's the bigger thing.

554
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,160
Nothing ever dies.

555
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:42,089
That's just the reality of it. I mean, somebody is going to show up with a

556
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:42,380
strong

557
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,550
big

558
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,130
money.

559
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,729
Yes, there are. But that, that's slightly different. I mean, that's gonna be like,

560
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:49,550
ok,

561
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,550
actually that's a really good point you bring up because there are

562
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,390
horse drawn carriages but you can't use them on the interstate,

563
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,250
just like

564
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:02,410
-- not the interstate.
-- Well, in Canada, the Amish put those little triangle

565
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:02,739
-- on
-- the

566
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:07,189
-- interstate or just on the
-- road highways and they drive on the shoulder and

567
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,390
roads, not the interstate

568
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,209
highways different,

569
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,650
not the interstate.

570
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,569
Yeah, here they go on the highway.

571
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,829
-- Sometimes
-- some of the highways probably not like a 12 lane divide

572
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:21,589
or the right.

573
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:23,060
Exactly.

574
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,180
You going to die

575
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,920
right away,

576
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:31,260
the day will come when we say no more humans are allowed to drive cars on the highway.

577
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,099
It is going to happen. I guarantee it.

578
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:37,619
And there will still be, you'll be able to go to the, like,

579
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,599
car zoo or something and drive cars, whatever, you know,

580
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,479
and the

581
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,489
right, it'll be just like, I can go ride horses at a farm.

582
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,530
I, I, I'm not going to do it on the road because that would be crazy.

583
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,869
And it's illegal on the interstate.

584
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,089
But I can go to a farm and I can ride a horse and be like, thank goodness,

585
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,849
I own a car as I drive off at the end of the day.

586
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,750
Right. And it will be the same thing

587
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,849
now. So, so I guess

588
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,890
technology can change if there's

589
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,959
the right amount of will and regulation behind it.

590
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,050
Because let's face it.

591
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:14,339
No, no, no, no, no.

592
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,540
Hang

593
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:14,699
on.

594
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,670
There's still, what?

595
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:17,949
Punch cards in

596
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,020
there?

597
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,920
-- No, no, no, no,
-- no, no, it's different. Here's my point.

598
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:26,410
If the government didn't say it's illegal to ride your horse on the interstate,

599
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,930
some idiot would do it.

600
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:28,969
Ok.

601
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:32,310
And the only reason they don't is because the police can arrest

602
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,160
them and say it's illegal to ride your horse on the interstate.

603
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:39,079
If we don't say it's illegal to run flash in your computer,

604
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,760
there's always going to be flash on someone's computer.

605
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:44,810
There is a legit case.

606
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,079
Uh, so there's like a petition to keep to open source flash and keep it around because

607
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,479
there is that huge amount of software written for flash.

608
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,329
Um, like just today, actually,

609
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:57,359
my son played a flash game at the local science museum.

610
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:00,170
You know, they had the, uh, the Mackie. Mackie,

611
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,589
you know, that, uh, it's like the sort of classic nez

612
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,780
controller but you can, like, hook it up with the alligator,

613
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,060
the

614
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:05,449
TF

615
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,069
or whatever.

616
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,489
And so, like, you, you, like, hold the one ground and like,

617
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,250
you press these bits of tin foil and like, you know, for six year olds,

618
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,410
this is amazing.

619
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,969
You touch the banana

620
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:15,270
and.

621
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:15,930
Exactly.

622
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:16,349
Exactly.

623
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,479
Yeah, touch the banana, touch the orange, whatever.

624
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:21,469
And so he was playing like, uh they had like Space Invaders,

625
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,670
Tetris and Pacman and like they were clearly flash based, you know,

626
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,489
they were using some flash based website.

627
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,880
Here's the deal with that though.

628
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,989
I agree with you that I don't think there's

629
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,599
anything wrong with sending flash to a farm.

630
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:40,729
Like, look at, look at archive.org where they have old like M sds and Apple two and,

631
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:45,530
and crazy old games and applications you can run in an emulator, right?

632
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:49,930
If they added flash to that, I would certainly not be opposed to that in any way.

633
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:51,239
But my view of that is

634
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,770
that's the farm, you go ride the horse on for fun,

635
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,729
right?

636
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,400
And unless

637
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:59,040
it is somehow

638
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:05,290
and in my honest opinion, basically illegal to run flash, people are going to do it.

639
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,680
Well, here's the reality, right?

640
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:12,640
Unless Adobe sends out an update that like where it commits suicide,

641
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:15,319
people will just be running whatever the last version was.

642
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,050
II,

643
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:19,839
I don't think they would do that. I, I would love it if they did.

644
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,640
In fact, I remember a million years ago

645
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,209
that that real player

646
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:28,760
kind of ran into this where real players stopped being supported on Linux and

647
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,530
a bunch of distributions sent out an update that caused real player to essentially,

648
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,650
yeah, commit suicide and wiped it off the system and it was just gone

649
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,719
and, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth,

650
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,209
but now it's fine.

651
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,310
It's like, you know, can God microwave a burrito so hot you can't eat it.

652
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,510
Can you have an R PM post and all script that R PM hyphen

653
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,270
itself?

654
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,859
No, no, it didn't delete itself. It was just an empty package essentially.

655
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,989
Right. Right.

656
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,790
Exactly.

657
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,540
-- And then there were, there
-- were binary and

658
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,459
-- like,
-- if you

659
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,199
-- wanted
-- to kind of stick with the old one,

660
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:01,709
there were some steps you could take,

661
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,829
but it was certainly like you really wanted it at that point.

662
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,369
Right.

663
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:07,390
This wasn't an accident.

664
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,339
-- We,
-- we need to let people do stuff like that because for example,

665
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:12,680
um,

666
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,810
well, like, you know, Bonte.

667
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,430
Bonte

668
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:17,359
have to, at some point train with real stuff

669
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,030
to some degree. Right. Like

670
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,030
firemen, firemen have to train, you know, in

671
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,349
scenarios that

672
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,469
potentially.

673
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,109
But again, this is, this is the

674
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,390
-- farm with the horse on it.
-- Exactly. It's a controlled,

675
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:31,989
right.

676
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,550
The firemen don't like, go light your house on fire and then save you from the fire.

677
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,869
They live, you know. You know what I mean? It's a controlled environment.

678
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,390
-- Well,
-- yeah.

679
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,750
And that's, yeah, and that's the thing.

680
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,510
But, I mean, I guess a lot of people,

681
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:44,699
II,

682
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,670
I think the problem would be probably there's enough

683
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,020
people that want it and will pay some tech,

684
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,260
like 50 bucks to make it happen and then, you know,

685
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,609
-- two years later it's a problem.
-- Actually. That's a good point.

686
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:58,599
You figure come out the day after flash is end of life.

687
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:02,609
I bet you can make a decent sum of money with a flash installer

688
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:02,949
that

689
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,260
anyone could download and use,

690
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,540
even though it would be horrifying.

691
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,839
Yeah. Well, I mean,

692
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,979
yeah, II, I just, I don't know,

693
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:17,699
part of me just would love to see Flash dead and gone forever.

694
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:21,319
But on the flip side, I get that there's a huge

695
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,849
corpus of software and content, not just software but content.

696
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,660
You know, it is part of our history.

697
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,420
It is and give it to archive.org and give them like a freaking emulator and,

698
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,300
and that's enough, right?

699
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,099
That's the solution. The solution isn't to keep running this crap.

700
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,040
They just need a copy of flash running on Windows XP.

701
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,829
-- Right.
-- Exactly. That should be no problem. Right.

702
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,630
They have no, they have Windows 31 running just fine.

703
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,910
I'm sure you can get flash going on it. Right.

704
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,959
Do you ever see that video of that guy that did a screencast of like upgrading from?

705
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:56,500
-- I think it was like D OS one
-- to

706
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,739
it was Windows

707
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:02,170
one point. Oh, all the way. I think it was past XP. It might have been in the vista

708
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,260
and it was, it was fascinating that it worked.

709
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,180
I love that.

710
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,489
I'm also impressed that you could get a machine

711
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,280
that would actually run all those different versions.

712
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,449
He just did it in a VM, I think, didn't he?

713
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,260
But still, I mean, from AC P architecture point of view,

714
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,920
I feel like if I'm remembering correctly and I could be mistaken,

715
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,099
but I believe he had to basically

716
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,849
build the VM,

717
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,180
do the install and then basically take the disk and import

718
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:33,479
the disk into like another VM that had different architecture settings,

719
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:33,699
right?

720
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,869
Like different video and sound and things like that.

721
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,119
He did a little bit.

722
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,339
Right? Because

723
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,459
I don't think you could expect to run windows one point. Oh, on

724
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,550
any modern

725
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:43,689
art,

726
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,219
those customers that feel that way.

727
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,859
No, nobody should do that. If you do that, you're a bad person.

728
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:52,660
All right, I'm just gonna say that now

729
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,560
you are the person riding their horse on the interstate.

730
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,819
You're gonna get killed and you're gonna deserve it. Right.

731
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,459
That's basically the way it is.

732
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,170
Yeah.

733
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:06,699
Anyway,

734
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:12,359
no, that's what gets me about the last, I don't know, the last 15 years,

735
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,319
I've kind of paid attention to black hat and defcon.

736
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:19,420
There's been precious few talks I've seen where it's been like, wow, you know, and,

737
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,319
and conversely, it's interesting because you look at the whole Dev

738
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,930
ops agile development thing and that came out of a conference. Um

739
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:28,689
It's a, there's a Wikipedia page about it. We can put it in the show notes, but

740
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,079
that has actually changed the world quite a lot.

741
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,500
You know, this whole Dev

742
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,400
ops agile development thing where you know,

743
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,689
we went from like waterfall development to a

744
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,000
bunch of Kanban

745
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,589
Trello boards

746
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:42,250
and

747
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,189
you know, freaking Netflix.

748
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,520
That's the thing now.

749
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:46,040
So,

750
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,550
so here's kind of my take on that is we may

751
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,359
never see super amazing security research ever again at a conference.

752
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,000
It, it, it, it would kind of surprise me if we do at this point.

753
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,189
However,

754
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,319
I,

755
00:31:57,329 --> 00:32:00,560
I think there's immense value in going to these shows

756
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,680
because you get to talk to people and in fact,

757
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,420
I didn't even get a proper pass this year.

758
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,369
I had a booth pass from elastic.

759
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,280
I'm like, this is good enough. I don't, I don't need anything else.

760
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,839
And yeah, I just, I, I hang out and talk to people and,

761
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,329
and I went to parties and talk to people and, and it was, it was fantastic.

762
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:19,219
Part of it too is, I mean, no offense. Even if you show us an earth shaking, like,

763
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,069
hi, here's the hack where you sneeze funny and like you compromise windows,

764
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,000
it's like we call that Thursday.

765
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,760
You know what I mean?

766
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,609
Like, it's just things are so fundamental, like voting machine tampering and,

767
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,969
you know, shenanigans.

768
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:33,400
Like,

769
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,020
no, they're, they're computers, like, of course, they're terrible.

770
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,959
Right? Like, it's just,

771
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,319
it's like a web browser. I found a hack for all the web browsers. Yeah, like,

772
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:44,479
yeah,

773
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,500
that, that just happens every once in a while,

774
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:49,469
you know,

775
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,989
so part of what this kind of, this whole thing reminds me of is like, car safety in the,

776
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,589
let's say, fifties to seventies in that.

777
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,420
Like, we know, cars are incredibly useful. Right. They make life better

778
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,180
and, yeah, people die in them a lot,

779
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,959
-- like a lot.
-- It was banned

780
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,790
and computers are kind of the same way right now. Like,

781
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,949
even like these windows, 10 tablets I have, you know, they,

782
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:19,189
they want basically an hour a week of me managing them and

783
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,550
God,

784
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,170
it just

785
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,459
so frustrating,

786
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:26,380
but at the same time they're quite, you know, sort of useful and handy.

787
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:27,689
And,

788
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,459
but the, the difference being is that, you know,

789
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,859
I, I don't think anybody's going to come up with the magic three point safety belt,

790
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:34,969
anti lock brakes

791
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:36,089
and airbags

792
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:37,750
in

793
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:38,260
this.

794
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,459
And I have a, a talk I've been working on for a long time and, and I,

795
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,900
I've tentatively titled it.

796
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,449
It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better

797
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,239
if you look at.

798
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:53,900
Yeah, it is, it has literally zero call to actions at the end.

799
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,979
-- I like that. You think it's going to get better?
-- It, it, it,

800
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:57,550
it

801
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,260
better unless it gets a lot worse. That might be a better title actually. But

802
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,670
here's the thing is part of this.

803
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,020
I did research into things like pollution and car

804
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,418
safety and industrial safety and like mine safety.

805
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,050
I remember telling

806
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,260
you all these terrible things,

807
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,458
right? And all this stuff and

808
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,320
you look at like, so I'll pick on car safety.

809
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,840
I mean, Ralph Nader basically stunt hacked

810
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,040
the government into caring about car safety.

811
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,958
I mean, that, that's essentially what happened

812
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,040
and

813
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,389
it's one of those things that the automakers just kept wailing about how, oh,

814
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,600
we can't possibly do this.

815
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,090
We can't possibly do this. Right. It's too hard. It's too expensive.

816
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,629
It's impossible. Sound familiar.

817
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,938
It's essentially our industry where we just keep saying, oh, we can't do that.

818
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,199
We can't do that. Nothing's fixable. It's impossible.

819
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,309
But then one day when the government showed up and said, you know,

820
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:49,228
you have to do this or else they were like, ok, I guess we can do it.

821
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:53,168
And now, granted, I'm not necessarily saying regulation is the answer.

822
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,319
It is a possible answer I will say. But I don't know if it's

823
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:56,599
part of,

824
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,409
uh, I, well, so the problem we're going to have with the regulation though is

825
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:06,860
the, the world of security and computers moves so fast

826
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:07,860
that

827
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:08,469
it's

828
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,209
international. Well, that too. Yes. And, and so,

829
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,500
I mean, a

830
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:11,750
great

831
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,139
example

832
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,750
though.

833
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:13,739
Right.

834
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,330
Well, yes and no, but you have imports,

835
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,489
software is a little different because like

836
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,280
when you physically import a car, you have this nice 2000 pound thing

837
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,659
-- that you can relatively easily intercept at a dog. Ok. So
-- I'm gonna get to that.

838
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:30,560
All right. That, that's part of something I, I think about a lot is

839
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:34,260
so, yes, regulating software would be difficult,

840
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,629
especially with github and stack overflow and open source and all this stuff.

841
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,409
However,

842
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,800
companies that sell things and, and I use the word things loosely,

843
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,760
not just software because literally everything is full of software.

844
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,080
Now,

845
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,350
there, there should be certain expectations around that.

846
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,719
And so the trick might not be regulating directly,

847
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:55,179
but rather having some sort of liability

848
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,780
where if you have a device or a product

849
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,239
and it runs software

850
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,889
and it does something that, that damages a person, be it, you know,

851
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,780
financially or physically or whatever,

852
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,820
there should be liability against that software perhaps.

853
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,760
And that could get really interesting because then

854
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,310
we're not dealing with regulation necessarily,

855
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,419
nor do we have to worry about kind of the,

856
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:19,919
it's not keeping up with the times because, you know, if your product maims someone,

857
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:23,100
it doesn't matter what the latest, you know, version of open SSL is,

858
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,229
you just maim someone, you know, don't do that.

859
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:25,860
That's bad.

860
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,959
So, basically the class action lawsuit theory of responsibility.

861
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,040
Yeah. Yeah, essentially. And, and it's a possibility,

862
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,560
-- I, I know it's
-- not. And then the challenge becomes though, is that

863
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,060
some of these companies just don't give a

864
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,719
damn or they're structured to deal with that or

865
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,469
an extreme example being the Grenfell Tower disaster

866
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:48,050
where apparently the police have now said that.

867
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,040
Yeah. No, we don't think like any charges are needed.

868
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,909
That is interesting

869
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,030
and, and sometimes that might happen

870
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,179
where,

871
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,820
where it's difficult to necessarily blame someone or, or,

872
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,939
well, in this case, there's a relatively clear,

873
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,830
a chain of events where they approved this cladding that was not,

874
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,000
uh, correct, you know, for that application.

875
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:17,239
Um,

876
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,370
uh, but apparently it seems like, you know, I, I think part of it is if they did that,

877
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:24,060
then it would set a precedent where like

878
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:28,120
Britain's housing market would be kind of up the creek

879
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,689
and, and right, that, that could be part of it. And this is,

880
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,409
this is one of the really interesting things about liability

881
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,070
because, well, at least in the U SI can I can speak on,

882
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,060
I don't understand it necessarily elsewhere, but obviously,

883
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,050
judges use precedent

884
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,409
of past cases to determine their decisions of today.

885
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:50,770
And as well, one of the things they will consider is kind of

886
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,090
what does this mean for kind of the, the public good.

887
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:58,040
And so if it's something that would like just totally screw up society,

888
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,159
-- they're not gonna do it. And, and I
-- don't know, it's the loss basically,

889
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,649
right?

890
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:07,310
Like to put it bluntly sometimes, you know, we, we have situations where it's like

891
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,679
to make it right.

892
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:13,300
We would essentially expose ourselves to so much liability or so many lawsuits.

893
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,719
That

894
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,709
-- sucks to be you. I
-- mean,

895
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,550
it, it, it's tricky to say the least. And

896
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,929
my point is though of, of all of it, regardless of how things get better,

897
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:24,590
assuming they can get better is

898
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,739
I think we have a long way to go

899
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,340
before it gets so bad. People care

900
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,780
because let's face it. I mean, look at kind of the problems we see today.

901
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:37,159
There, there are annoyances but for the most part society continues to function.

902
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,659
Right.

903
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:41,060
I actually personally suspect it won't get bad

904
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,580
enough to get bad enough that people care because

905
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:45,139
it will get bad.

906
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:48,860
But it will offer so much more benefits that people will be like, yeah,

907
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,040
this totally sucks.

908
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,300
-- But hey, it's worth it.
-- I mean that, that's totally possible.

909
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,969
I, I will not disagree with you. It is very conceivable.

910
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,290
My one example for that would be alcohol.

911
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:04,280
-- Uh, there's no way alcohol would be approved nowadays,
-- whatever.

912
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,120
-- We, we banned it in the US and look how well that worked out.
-- Right.

913
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,850
Well, and that's the other part of the problem, right?

914
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,120
Even if you ban alcohol, it's like, well, I've got like fruit and a bucket.

915
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,070
So

916
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,439
I, I saw a thing one time. It was a grape juice manufacturer from prohibition in the US

917
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,199
and the instructions said

918
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,739
do not put in a bucket in place under your sink for three months, you know,

919
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,580
like will result in

920
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,620
fermented alcohol or something. And it was like, this is hilarious.

921
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,929
Yeah.

922
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:39,500
But see, that's the thing, right.

923
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,169
It's like cars, right?

924
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,600
I think in 20 years from now when we have self driving cars,

925
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,580
we're going to look back on the number of deaths

926
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,229
caused by cars much like smoking and be like,

927
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,500
that was completely insane.

928
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,820
But like, right now we're like, yeah, whatever,

929
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:53,739
you know.

930
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,179
Um, I did a bit of

931
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,350
a,

932
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,370
I did like a 3.5 hour, um,

933
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:02,459
drive to and from another city over the weekend and, like,

934
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:08,060
we saw three accidents. One pretty bad.

935
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:16,699
We almost got killed twice. Um, a guy in a guy with a truck towing a large camper van,

936
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:23,219
uh, uphill onto the highway. Uh, the highway is about 100 and 10 kilometers an hour.

937
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,530
He was doing about 60 sweet.

938
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:27,590
Uh, and he, like,

939
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,020
made rather rude gestures at us and then he pulled off at the next exit

940
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,239
half a kilometer later because he basically didn't want to drive through the town.

941
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,929
He wanted to take the highway as a bit of a shortcut

942
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,979
and just stuff like that. Like it's just,

943
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:40,939
oh God, we just,

944
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,110
uh,

945
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,500
yeah, so much, so much,

946
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,139
you know,

947
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:45,229
I,

948
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:46,419
I, but I, I, you know,

949
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:49,959
we'll look back at this and be like that was clearly insane and terrible.

950
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:52,139
But I suspect with computers

951
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:55,350
here's the thing with a lot of computer security. Unless

952
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:59,729
a great example being a defcon, the whole car wash, you know, will kill you thing.

953
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:01,709
Um,

954
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:02,479
unless,

955
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,860
but unless somebody actually takes control of that car

956
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,129
wash and tries to use it to kill you.

957
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,979
Uh, computer security probably won't kill you.

958
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:11,570
And,

959
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,719
well, ok, so

960
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,929
I would compare it more to pollution in that regard where pollution

961
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:24,050
didn't really directly kill anyone in the manner a car would.

962
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,649
But it eventually things got so bad.

963
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:31,929
Society had to basically say, ok, like this river lit on fire. That's bad.

964
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,510
Uh, funny story.

965
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,780
It wasn't society that had a problem with that.

966
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,760
It was the railroad companies because their bridges were being damaged.

967
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,429
That was the problem with the Hudson catching fire

968
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,260
is the railroad

969
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,520
that is unacceptable. It's messing with our bridges.

970
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,760
-- And
-- ok, so even if that's true, which I, I don't know, I'm gonna,

971
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,919
I'm gonna research this now,

972
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,320
but it's all on the Wikipedia, I'm sure. Of course it is.

973
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,159
I'm ok with that.

974
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,959
Right. I, I'm perfectly ok

975
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,639
with,

976
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,550
with kind of the side effects of the

977
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,520
badness being what actually gets the attention because

978
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:10,919
I'm looking for the outcome

979
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,879
of secure software,

980
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,000
how we get there is

981
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,030
not quite as concerning to me

982
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,800
that goes back to my discussion with some Google people about how

983
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:26,139
I don't fully trust Google, but the fact that Google is based on ad revenue

984
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,239
and they want to protect their ad revenue through a variety

985
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,709
of means like a secure web browser and http s everywhere

986
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,850
that meshes with what I want.

987
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,610
Yeah,

988
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,250
the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Right? I mean, that's totally what it is and I'm

989
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:46,449
comfortable with that as well because I think

990
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,770
there are many enemies

991
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:49,830
and

992
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,530
it, it's, we're losing,

993
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,929
right. But we're not losing bad enough that anyone really cares.

994
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,110
Yeah, exactly.

995
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,209
Uh, anyway,

996
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,459
anyway,

997
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,689
all right, there, there's one last thing I think we should talk about and, and we,

998
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,979
we brought this up from, I don't know, maybe, maybe a couple of weeks ago and,

999
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:08,939
and we just never got to.

1000
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:09,540
It is

1001
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,439
Schneier

1002
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:14,100
wrote a thing about password masking and how it's on the way out

1003
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,570
and you seem to think password masking is great and I legitimately.

1004
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:18,659
So

1005
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,060
let's, let's argue, man.

1006
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:23,500
I don't think password masking is great.

1007
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,510
I think it solves a legitimate problem of, for example, my six year old

1008
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,810
the protocol is now that he must turn around,

1009
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,550
bury his head in the couch and go la la la la la

1010
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,979
while I tap in my passwords

1011
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,429
because he shoulder surfs passwords constantly.

1012
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,810
-- Ok.
-- But, but you, you have mass passwords and you still do this

1013
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:46,820
because you can see my fingers on the keyboard or on the thing.

1014
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,340
But if I didn't have a mass password, then you could just, you know,

1015
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:56,620
from across the room with a pair of binoculars do it or set up a phone or God knows what.

1016
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:57,110
And so

1017
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,300
fundamentally,

1018
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:04,580
I think masked passwords should be the default with the option to unmask them.

1019
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:05,570
I,

1020
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,919
that's fair. I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't disagree with that. I, I think

1021
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,060
because if I enter my passwords in public, for example,

1022
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:15,639
I don't necessarily want, you know,

1023
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:17,879
somebody might not be able to see what I'm typing,

1024
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,709
but they might see what's on the screen or,

1025
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,620
you know. Um,

1026
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,560
I just, I think it makes, here's the thing, I don't see a, I don't see any downside

1027
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,300
to masking passwords by default and then

1028
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,149
maybe optionally allowing people to unmask them.

1029
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,800
-- So,
-- here's, here's my, my downside is when I'm using my phone

1030
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:42,350
and I'm typing in my absurd password.

1031
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,000
I get it wrong like 10 times in a row

1032
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,919
because I can't see what the freaking

1033
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:51,280
so on an iphone, when you type the character into a password field,

1034
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,639
-- it shows the character for like a brief part of a second and then
-- starts,

1035
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:57,330
I type it too fast or I try to

1036
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:01,110
and then I get many of them wrong or if I can just unmask it, I can say, ok,

1037
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,389
that's not my password.

1038
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,419
I'm, I went to go fix, this is a four and not a three.

1039
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:08,419
And my second comment there would be is you're doing it wrong.

1040
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,840
-- You should use a password manager.
-- And that's what I do.

1041
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,290
Actually, it's, it's generally unlocking my password manager.

1042
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,080
I mean, although, although I,

1043
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,050
I do have a password manager now that can do a fingerprint on my phone.

1044
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,050
So I'm,

1045
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,520
I'm happy and I,

1046
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,540
I refuse to research if Android is storing any of

1047
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,510
that correctly or safely because I'm pretty sure it,

1048
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:29,850
-- but regardless
-- what could go

1049
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,260
-- wrong,
-- it makes me happy.

1050
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,260
So it's good.

1051
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:35,080
Well, I mean, honestly that's why I'm looking at,

1052
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,239
buying a new Macbook is for the fingerprint scan.

1053
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:42,459
Yeah, this is a place like the eye stuff. Definitely does a much nicer job.

1054
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,169
Yeah.

1055
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,270
Well,

1056
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:45,580
using those windows tablets,

1057
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,939
I'm so annoyed that I have to type in stuff and I can't just, like,

1058
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,419
swipe my finger on something or push something with my finger.

1059
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:54,290
Why do you even have passwords on them just to, they're crappy windows tablets.

1060
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,010
Who cares?

1061
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,010
-- Oh, why do I have a
-- password on them?

1062
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,459
Because

1063
00:45:58,729 --> 00:45:58,750
the

1064
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,540
paranoid

1065
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:00,780
it was

1066
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,969
my kids from just camping out on them.

1067
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:04,729
I see.

1068
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:05,080
So

1069
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,280
it was to sort of,

1070
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,889
you know, time limit my kids a bit,

1071
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:10,610
like 1245,

1072
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:16,449
pretty much because essentially the parental control software I've researched

1073
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,149
is

1074
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,649
garbage.

1075
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:20,370
It's terrible.

1076
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,510
It's, it's like, I mean, here's the thing,

1077
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,850
Tavis Ormandy went and looked at antivirus scanners and

1078
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,969
found all the horrible stuff.

1079
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:33,389
I would bet a lot of money, like a mortgage payments worth of money.

1080
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:34,169
But

1081
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:38,120
-- parental control software is far worse.
-- You know? It's terrible.

1082
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:43,989
I, I would be amazed if it's not completely horrible and just mostly awful. Right.

1083
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,729
It's, it's one of those things that

1084
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,360
let's face it. Anyone who knows how to do it. Right.

1085
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:51,260
They're not going to work there. That's just,

1086
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:52,520
you know.

1087
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,310
Yep.

1088
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,520
Anyway. Anyway. All right. So that, that was much less arguing than I'd hoped for.

1089
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,199
Well, it's, it's, I think it's a good thing to have on by default because

1090
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,830
the thing too is, I mean, well, here's a great example.

1091
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,600
I was walking home today and uh canceling one of my bank accounts and,

1092
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:09,750
um,

1093
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,199
because basically I had like a 5, 10 minute walk home.

1094
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:16,500
So, you know, rather than just, you know, use the time productively,

1095
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:20,050
but at the same time it's, you know, there's nobody around me hearing me like,

1096
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,850
recite out account numbers and stuff,

1097
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:25,449
you know, even though the risk of that going wrong is quite low because,

1098
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:30,129
you know, some random dude, uh reciting random numbers while he walks by,

1099
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,689
chances are somebody's not going to hear that and be like,

1100
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:35,320
oh ho I'll get into his bank account and like, wipe him dry,

1101
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,320
you know,

1102
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,350
but still like,

1103
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,320
I only did that because I knew that nobody would overhear me on the walk home, right?

1104
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,330
I wouldn't do that and say at a party or something.

1105
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,120
Uh

1106
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:46,100
Yeah, I,

1107
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,520
yes, I agree with you and I totally understand,

1108
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:54,010
I think from a risk management perspective that is relatively low risk.

1109
00:47:54,729 --> 00:47:56,500
Yeah. And I see no issue with that.

1110
00:47:57,689 --> 00:47:58,300
That's fair.

1111
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,610
Uh I guess one other interesting point

1112
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:02,669
before we go

1113
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,229
is

1114
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,360
during the CBE lunch

1115
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:07,840
that I attended.

1116
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:10,060
Uh I did forget my credit card at the House of Blues,

1117
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,719
which was super embarrassing for me actually.

1118
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:12,379
But that, that's another

1119
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,389
story. Um

1120
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,620
I left it at the House of Blues and II,

1121
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,729
-- I forgot to take it
-- because in America you have to

1122
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:21,310
give

1123
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:21,689
it to the

1124
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,030
-- server. I
-- paid

1125
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:26,040
and then I was talking to somebody and we just like left

1126
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,560
and it was still sitting in the little book where you pay.

1127
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,229
And

1128
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:29,709
it was,

1129
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:32,500
that's something that's so bizarre to me. I,

1130
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,209
I don't have the little term. At

1131
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:35,790
least they, they had it,

1132
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,370
they gave it back to me and I don't have any fraudulent charges on it.

1133
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:39,250
So there's that.

1134
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:39,719
But

1135
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,370
anyway, anyway, uh

1136
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,729
well, I was talking to these guys,

1137
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,689
I mentioned that I had put all of the CV data into elastic search and I like I

1138
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:50,489
could do fun things with it and I kind of showed it off a little bit and stuff.

1139
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:56,090
And then I mentioned there are uh what like 419,000 references.

1140
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,919
And I said, I wonder how many of them are valid?

1141
00:48:57,929 --> 00:48:59,580
And they said, man, I wonder how we could do that.

1142
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,729
I said I'm going to do that on the airplane ride

1143
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:02,929
-- through.
-- W

1144
00:49:03,629 --> 00:49:04,030
well,

1145
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:05,260
basically.

1146
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,330
Oh, and just for so for those of you wondering what the hell we're talking about.

1147
00:49:09,649 --> 00:49:13,100
A CV reference is a URL pointing to something

1148
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:15,510
that references that CV.

1149
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,270
It could be a vendor advisory, it could be a security advisory,

1150
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,020
it could be a change log.

1151
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,020
It's just something

1152
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,300
you know, of value and related to that CV.

1153
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,439
Either it's typically the patch, the vulnerability or

1154
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:32,139
other information related.

1155
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:38,179
-- So anyway,
-- 419,000 URL S it took me about 24 hours to tear through them.

1156
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,669
And, and would you like to guess

1157
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,149
how many of those URL S returned? A 200?

1158
00:49:44,979 --> 00:49:50,530
Well, so they might return to 200 but they actually return content

1159
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,350
only looking at

1160
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,060
return

1161
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,340
response codes,

1162
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,419
codes.

1163
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:56,159
Uh

1164
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:59,800
Well, I know we've gone through and tidied up a whole bunch of, I think it was neo

1165
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,260
haps

1166
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:01,530
recently and some other word,

1167
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:01,719
a

1168
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:02,149
bunch of those.

1169
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,820
So all the

1170
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:03,909
s Yeah.

1171
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:04,729
Well, no, no, no,

1172
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,479
but so there's been a bunch of websites

1173
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:08,719
that have gone away or changed significantly.

1174
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,610
I would guess

1175
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:14,209
I'd be really quite happy with 5 50%.

1176
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:16,439
It's about 50%

1177
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,489
give or take. Uh And, and then there's also three,

1178
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:24,620
-- vary by year. Like is the recent stuff
-- I haven't made up into that yet.

1179
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:28,330
That's the next thing is to graft them by year and understand.

1180
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,270
Well, then I'll tell you now,

1181
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,010
-- the
-- old stuff I would say also graph them by year end vendor,

1182
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,879
please because for example, sun.com,

1183
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:37,750
yes, that's a good point. I, I, well, that's the beauty of it.

1184
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,550
I can do all those things now because I just,

1185
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,620
I have this data sitting in elastic search.

1186
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:41,889
But

1187
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,770
to give an idea, I can look at the breakdown here about half or 200

1188
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,969
about another quarter, give or take are 30 ones and 30 twos which are redirect.

1189
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,129
And I did not log any of the redirect information, but it's not very many.

1190
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:56,889
Well, it'd be easy for me to just tear through just those.

1191
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:58,290
Right, because they, they're small.

1192
00:50:58,649 --> 00:50:59,239
But then

1193
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,649
probably around 12%

1194
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:02,729
where

1195
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,020
basically, like the web server just doesn't exist anymore.

1196
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,010
-- There's no domain there, there's nothing. And, and, well,
-- roshi.org,

1197
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:12,540
that's true. That was a great site.

1198
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,929
It, it was, and it's crazy too. I'm looking at this.

1199
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,689
I've got some really weird areas like this. A 523 is in here.

1200
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,010
Like, I don't even know what that is.

1201
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,169
Uh 521. No clue.

1202
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,879
And so it'll be fun to just kind of looking

1203
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:26,149
up with some of these weird error messages are that,

1204
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:26,919
that came back.

1205
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:27,169
But

1206
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,770
-- no, it's,
-- oh, you know what? Those are cloud flare errors.

1207
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,909
Oh, really? Oh,

1208
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:34,760
523 origins is unreachable.

1209
00:51:36,189 --> 00:51:36,699
Interesting.

1210
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,729
Well, cloud Flare or somebody else was using, you know, a proxy in front.

1211
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,209
Interesting. Wow, that's wild.

1212
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,310
Well, and the other thing I was thinking could be fun is,

1213
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,770
I don't know if archive.org has the ability to check like a URL,

1214
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:53,010
but it could also be interesting to look at some of these ones that failed

1215
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:55,409
and see if there's an archive.org copy.

1216
00:51:55,419 --> 00:51:58,129
But that's, that's, that's the next phase of the project.

1217
00:51:58,209 --> 00:51:59,610
So we'll, we'll get to that.

1218
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,120
-- But anyway, anyway, if, I
-- mean, that's just a simple said script,

1219
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,169
-- you know. Nothing
-- simple. Kurt don't, don't say that

1220
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,800
it'll be Python

1221
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,129
and talk to last

1222
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,409
because that's more fun.

1223
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:14,389
So anyway, anyway, if I actually I put my graphs on Twitter,

1224
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:17,239
if anyone wants to look at them just, just find me and take a peek.

1225
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:17,649
So.

1226
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,639
Alright, man, I think it's time any parting words

1227
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:23,290
uh

1228
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,909
if you're gonna buy a safe,

1229
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:29,489
make sure your six year old doesn't get into it but beyond that, like,

1230
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,889
who cares anyway?

1231
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:36,169
Ok. Ok. All right. All right. Thanks Kurt. That's, that's fabulous advice.

1232
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,729
Thank you for listening. Everybody.

1233
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:41,169

1239
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,669
Thank you, Kurt. It was fun as always. And I guess until next time, take care, man.

1240
00:52:59,939 --> 00:53:01,370
Yeah. See you guys next week.

1241
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,449
Hopefully. Now you've doomed us. Right.
