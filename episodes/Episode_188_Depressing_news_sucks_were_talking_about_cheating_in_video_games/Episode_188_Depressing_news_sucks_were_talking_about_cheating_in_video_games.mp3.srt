Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 188 with myself,

1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,220
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:15,310
All right. So here's the deal. This virus can go

3
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,760
off and eat a big bag of,

4
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:19,579
as far as I'm concerned, we're not going to talk about it.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,610
We're going to talk about fun things because the thing,

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,139
the world needs more than anything right now is a beacon of hope.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,729
And so talking about

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,850
the only thing anyone's talking about right now is

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,009
stupid and it's bullshit and we're not doing it.

10
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:36,868
We're going to talk about video games instead because everyone loves video games.

11
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:37,629
-- Yeah,
-- I was quite shocked.

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,738
I was reading about this and Activision has a league that

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,508
guarantees a minimum of $50,000 salary for about 100 players.

14
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,208
So not only does everybody love video games but like I had known that, you know,

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,648
like I'm into Starcraft Two and when I say I'm into Starcraft two,

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,328
what I mean is I used to play it 10 years ago

17
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,528
and then I got old and now I'm too slow and old,

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,758
so I just watch it on youtube.

19
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,969
-- Starcraft
-- Two is 10 years old now.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,118
-- More than 10.
-- Oh, my goodness. I feel I'm old

21
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,998
if you would have asked me how old Starcraft Two was.

22
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,938
I would have been like, I don't know, three or four years, maybe.

23
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:09,828
Sorry, I lied. Nine years old. It's released July 27. 2010. Yeah.

24
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,718
So, wait, that is 10 years old now.

25
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,068
Well, almost 10. Anyway, point is,

26
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:17,557
you know, point is like when I say I play Starcraft two,

27
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,877
what I say what I mean by that is now I watch it on youtube.

28
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,797
You know, I watch the professionals play like, you know,

29
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:23,477
some of these professionals over the years have

30
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,597
earned in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

31
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,888
Some of these professional video game players do really well now and

32
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:32,507
it's, and not only that watching them play is amazing.

33
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:35,986
And the thing I always remind my Children because my kids are like, oh,

34
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,507
I want to be a video game player.

35
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:37,836
Sometimes

36
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,607
this is how this works. You have to be really good.

37
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:47,046
You have to be well above average, which is step one. That's the easy step.

38
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:54,147
Step two is you have to be willing to basically practice nonstop over

39
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,967
and over and over again and never get sick of doing it.

40
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,496
And you have to like doing it

41
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,316
-- and that's the hard part
-- well and not only that,

42
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:03,545
but you have to do that against several 1000

43
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,905
other people that are doing the exact same thing

44
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,096
and probably

45
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,055
more than you.

46
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:10,695
And this is, I mean, this is the thing I always,

47
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:14,766
when I discuss Children playing professional sports with other parents,

48
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,266
-- this can get, be a touchy subject,
-- peoples

49
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:20,175
-- like physical sports.
-- You know, Little Bobby is great at baseball.

50
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,925
He's going to play in the major league

51
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:22,246
and

52
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,026
it's like

53
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,576
little Bobby

54
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:27,384
only plays on the weekends.

55
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,455
If Little Bobby was going to play in the professionals,

56
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:34,824
he literally needs to do nothing but practice baseball all week long and

57
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:38,104
he doesn't do that because he's playing with my kid on the swings.

58
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:41,625
-- Most of the time
-- I remember seeing a documentary about this about like those,

59
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:42,214
those quasi,

60
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,205
you know, amateur pro kids.

61
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,625
And when I say that I'm talking about like eight and nine year olds

62
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,104
that, you know, they were, for example,

63
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,214
going to like month long baseball camps in the summer.

64
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,824
And they showed this one farm kid and he had like

65
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:56,393
these targets set up that were like, basically twice the size of the ball,

66
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:57,593
like a little hoop or whatever.

67
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,393
And he's just throwing the ball through

68
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:02,373
these like hoops thousands and thousands of times

69
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,274
every day.

70
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,324
-- Yeah, basically
-- that's what you got to do.

71
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:07,664
And it's the same deal with these video games though.

72
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:10,654
So there are obviously there's people like to stream on,

73
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,123
I'm gonna pick on Twitch a lot,

74
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,583
but I know there's other streaming platforms so feel free to like, you know,

75
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,253
at Kurt on Twitter or whatever about it.

76
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:16,593
I mean,

77
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:17,343
and

78
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:20,753
you, you watch some of these people on Twitter and one of the things you'll see,

79
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:22,432
they'll say, oh, I'm grinding this out

80
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:27,242
and they will literally practice one trick for eight hours.

81
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:32,402
-- And I think who can do that? I can barely play
-- one of the Starcraft. Two guys.

82
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,003
I, I watch sometimes I forget his name but he was like,

83
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:37,942
he essentially decided on a strategy of only making.

84
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:41,692
Oh, what the heck was it like? It was, it was two particular units. It was like

85
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:45,593
widow mines and the science research vessels or whatever they're called.

86
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:48,692
-- Now,
-- I have no idea what any of those things are.

87
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,951
You have like 20 or so offensive units available

88
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:54,031
to you that have different strengths and weaknesses.

89
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,651
And he just basically was,

90
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:58,171
his plan was to get to Grand Masters just using

91
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:01,132
two units and like one variation on a strategy.

92
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,251
And, and so he wasn't grinding this for like a day.

93
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:08,251
-- He was grinding this for several weeks.
-- Oh, I have no doubt. I mean, no, no.

94
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,412
When I say grinding, I'm not talking about people grinding like a game.

95
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,692
They literally grind like one section of one game to learn one trick. Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:16,611
Yeah, there is no

97
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,690
way I could do that.

98
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,510
I mean, if I sit down to play video games,

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,621
I can play for maybe two or three hours and then I think I got to, you know, I'm done.

100
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,631
I can't do this anymore and these people obviously have

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,420
the talent but also the willpower to do it.

102
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,080
And I mean,

103
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,300
I'll tie this back to security a little bit is I kind of think

104
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:38,101
about this in security sometimes too where when you have a motivated attacker,

105
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,740
they will do things for days or weeks or months or even years,

106
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,010
sometimes that we can't imagine.

107
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,540
And so

108
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,630
it's very difficult to defend against an attacker like that.

109
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,630
And oh, you know what a great example.

110
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,510
So I was watching an interview with Teller from Penn and Teller,

111
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,149
the magician and he was talking about the fact that one of the

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,109
greatest strengths the magician has is that

113
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,640
normal people don't understand the links.

114
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,160
They will go to, to do a trick.

115
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,640
Like for example, they will pull out every two of clubs from 52 decks.

116
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,390
So they can build a deck with only two of like

117
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,670
normal people can't imagine that because we would never spend,

118
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,470
you know, three hours.

119
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,398
I remember I read a book called Scarring on Cards.

120
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:17,598
And he was like the world's best car cheat from World War Two.

121
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,158
He talked about things like the deck of cards

122
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,549
that has like the diamond pattern on the front.

123
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,558
What is it, bicycle or whatever? I have no idea.

124
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:26,278
Anyways, you buy several dozen, maybe 100 decks of this

125
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:30,118
and then you because the cuts are slightly off. And then you basically,

126
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:33,319
because you can see the diamond pattern on the edge of it and you basically just,

127
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,968
you make a deck where you know the pattern on the

128
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,088
edge from the diamond pattern on the front of the car,

129
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,239
it's bananas.

130
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,208
-- But then you have like a perfect cheating deck.
-- But again,

131
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,648
this is a thing that a normal person

132
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:49,328
would never do and wouldn't ever think of it as well.

133
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:53,358
And like, yeah, video games are, are the same deal. It's, oh man, it's,

134
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:57,028
but at the same time I love watching these people. It's so much fun.

135
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:57,268
Yeah.

136
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,618
-- And
-- see what's interesting to me is I was like,

137
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,338
I've tried playing video games and I'm too old.

138
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,898
I don't have the time to put into it, so I just get stomped. Right.

139
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,317
-- Let's be, let's be charitable.
-- Don't play online if

140
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:09,136
you know what we need.

141
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:14,096
Just if anyone listening works for a game company, like you literally need like,

142
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,457
I have a job and family servers

143
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:17,617
well,

144
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,826
and let the kids play on their own place and let us old people play somewhere else,

145
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:24,796
-- you know,
-- Starcraft two, for example, does that with matchmaking, you know?

146
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:27,497
Oh my God, I'm a reasonable mid-level bronze player.

147
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,937
I can actually beat certain cannon Russians and stuff.

148
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,796
There's a lot of games where that kind of thing doesn't work,

149
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,766
but also no offense if you're playing with all

150
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:36,226
the people at your level it kind of sucks.

151
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:36,869
Right.

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,579
It's kind of like, have you ever seen, like, 60 year olds playing, you know,

153
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,299
softball?

154
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,980
-- It doesn't look anything like 20 year olds playing softball.
-- No.

155
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,640
But when I'm 60 I don't want to play softball against 20 year olds because they're,

156
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,079
I'm going to break a hip, man.

157
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:52,579
-- I'm 40 I'm going to break a hip.
-- Well, this brings up cheating though. Right.

158
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,690
Like, if I could use an aim bo

159
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,190
or something.

160
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,230
And,

161
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,709
and actually one thing that was raised that I

162
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,850
thought was actually pretty legitimate was people with vision

163
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,679
disabilities or other disabilities that need kind of these cheating.

164
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,320
Help things to actually see what's going on or to, you know,

165
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,820
have a little more control aiming.

166
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,399
Sure.

167
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,600
So like using an aim bot for somebody maybe who, you know,

168
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:11,950
has not as much muscle control, which opened my eyes because I, you know,

169
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,920
I always thought of cheaters as well like cheaters like it was bad, right?

170
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:17,670
I didn't never thought of people say with

171
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,230
disabilities who want to play these games and

172
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,190
you know, not be completely

173
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,160
-- stomped even worse than I am
-- for what it's worth on consoles.

174
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,649
They do this, they call it a

175
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,799
mist because obviously let's say you're playing like Doom

176
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,730
on a

177
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:35,200
-- Nintendo
-- switch. But is this playing against the computer or against other people?

178
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,679
Well, it doesn't even matter, right? So I'll give you an example.

179
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:44,299
I Doom is 25 maybe this year it's old on the Nintendo Switch, which I have.

180
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,549
Well, we talked about the switch,

181
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,109
what a couple of episodes ago because I had to replace the fan.

182
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,410
So Doom went on super sale and I bought the Doom One. Doom Two and do

183
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,265
three for like

184
00:07:55,395 --> 00:08:00,265
three or $4. Right? It was like, ridiculously cheap and

185
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:04,066
I've never played Doom Three. It's a, like a modern looking game

186
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:08,605
and you can like jump for example, unlike Doom one and two.

187
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,865
So I thought, oh, this will be fun. I'm gonna try this.

188
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,656
And you can imagine playing these games on a console is

189
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,165
really hard because without the mouse to kind of aim,

190
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:16,966
it's very, very different

191
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:22,082
-- to aim.
-- Oh, you're playing with a console controller like the whatever. Ok.

192
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:22,291
Yeah.

193
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:23,131
Yeah. Right. Right.

194
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,812
So they have this thing called aim assist,

195
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:28,071
which of course I turned down and I play on easy mode and I still die a lot.

196
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:31,761
But like basically a assist means as long as the gun is pointed,

197
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,731
kind of in the direction of an enemy,

198
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,650
it will basically like lock onto them and let me actually hit them with bullets.

199
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,410
By the way, Doom is 27 years old. Awesome.

200
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,630
It's still good.

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,039
You know, in all seriousness,

202
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,599
I bet I still play Doom Two is the one I really like the most.

203
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,159
I probably beat Doom Two once a year still where I'll just, I'll,

204
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,549
I'll spend like a week playing it.

205
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll do, like, a level a day or something

206
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,789
and I'll just, like, tear well more than that. But, you know,

207
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,255
I tear through them and,

208
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,414
and I love it. I still love that game so much. You have no idea.

209
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:03,895
The other thing I found that was interesting is I didn't realize how much,

210
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,344
just how bad the whole anti

211
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:07,025
cheating situation is.

212
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,684
Like, there's, there's, you know, what is it va the valve,

213
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,315
anti cheat system and stuff like that.

214
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:12,215
But,

215
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,284
and what's interesting is a lot of this seems

216
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:17,364
to boil down to like voting systems where,

217
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,974
you know, essentially you're playing a game, you know, like,

218
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,094
say two teams of five or six people or whatever

219
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,489
and people can basically vote that you've cheated or otherwise

220
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,280
mispaved because obviously if somebody cheats like a lot,

221
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,549
it's going to become obvious, right?

222
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,950
Like if they, you know, consistently doing 360 no scope head shots,

223
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,969
which I'm not even sure what that means, but it's a term I read, you know,

224
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:37,190
they're probably cheating,

225
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:37,900
right?

226
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,789
Because even the best players can't do that consistently.

227
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,429
It's interesting because, you know,

228
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,780
there's these services you can pay 10 or 20 bucks

229
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,789
a month and they'll keep giving you updated cheats.

230
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,679
And what's really fascinating is at one point the va anti cheat stuff was kind of

231
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,812
because it was looking at people's DNS caches.

232
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:55,312
Oh, interesting.

233
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:55,872
Now,

234
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,892
the reason it was looking at DNS caches is

235
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,012
because some of this cheating software has DRM in

236
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:03,432
it and makes a call out to the mothership server to make sure you're still paid up.

237
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:07,711
-- And so they were looking for that activity to ban people. That's
-- wild.

238
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,142
I mean, it's clever.

239
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:09,752
Well, you know,

240
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:13,062
we talked about this on that episode about poker machine cheating where, you know,

241
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,632
they run the thing on their phone but the

242
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,572
data gets sent back to Eastern Europe or whatever,

243
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:17,552
for the processing.

244
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,872
-- Yeah, that's
-- right, man, that was a long time ago. Yeah.

245
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:21,151
So, I mean, it's, it's,

246
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:24,153
it, to me that, you know, even the cheating industry is like, well,

247
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:25,754
we have to do DRM and we have to, you know,

248
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,544
-- maintain control of these things
-- and think about your clientele.

249
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:32,453
You're working with a person who's interested in

250
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,843
breaking the rules to get themselves ahead.

251
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,244
So, why wouldn't they just pirate your software? Right.

252
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,133
Why are they going to pay you for it? So, you,

253
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:39,744
without

254
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:43,934
-- DRM, it's just going to get Pirated all over the place.
-- Yeah, it's, I had no idea.

255
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,533
Like I knew it was a big thing in certain games,

256
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,674
but one thing I still don't quite understand is how in, like,

257
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,633
the truly competitive games

258
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,625
that works because in Starcraft,

259
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,515
the preseason people play from home and stuff on

260
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:57,596
tournaments online and then as the season progresses they,

261
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:57,796
you know,

262
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:02,125
they go places to play on computers controlled by who's providing them Right.

263
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,195
Sure. That makes sense.

264
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,395
You know, and you don't get to sort of, like, load, like,

265
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,495
you don't get to bring your own PC.

266
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:09,635
It's like, no, everybody's playing on the same PC connected to the same land, blah,

267
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:09,995
blah, blah.

268
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,916
Yeah, that makes sense. Makes it fair, makes it easier. Whatever.

269
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:16,395
And now what's interesting is, I mean, there's enough money now in video games,

270
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:16,846
for example,

271
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,546
there was like a Starcraft two match fixing scandal a

272
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,297
few years ago where a guy was throwing matches,

273
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,927
like intentionally losing them

274
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:28,598
to get somebody else ahead and to basically, well,

275
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,547
essentially the online betting places if you know how

276
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,288
a match is going to turn out in advance

277
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:39,617
and intentionally losing a game is, well, it's super easy. It's harder to do,

278
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:43,377
you know, like, oh, whoops, I just deleted all my units or whatever.

279
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:46,918
I dropped the mouse on the floor. I'm, I'm trying to get the mouse. I can't reach it.

280
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,388
Oh, I knocked it under the table some more. Whoops.

281
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:54,119
You know, like I knew video games were big business but like match fixing and then,

282
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,280
you know, and people getting permanent bans for

283
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,539
not even just match fixing.

284
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:01,030
But this one guy who apparently was like

285
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,979
a professional Fortnite player was banned for life by

286
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,080
Epic Games because Epic Games straight up says

287
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,640
they have a zero tolerance policy for cheaters.

288
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,960
You have to have that though because if

289
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,799
you give people an opportunity for redemption.

290
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:14,140
They're going.

291
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,239
I mean, my favorite example of this is Pete Rose in baseball in the United States.

292
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,520
So there's this guy named Pete Rose who is actually a really good

293
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,219
baseball player and he would be in the baseball hall of fame.

294
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,500
Had he not been kicked out of baseball for basically

295
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,109
betting on games and being accused of purposely losing games.

296
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,960
I thought generally speaking,

297
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,909
professional sports players weren't allowed to bet on

298
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,530
their own

299
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,090
league, let alone their own team games.

300
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:41,880
And he did

301
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,369
and baseball kicked him out and he has a lifetime ban and now people are saying, oh,

302
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,109
well, Pete's old and he's a good guy and we should let him back in.

303
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,460
But in all seriousness, if you let him back in,

304
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:55,099
people know as long as I clean up my act a little bit after

305
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,700
the fact I'll be good and I'll get in the hall of fame.

306
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,539
Like, no, you got to kick him out and you gotta stick.

307
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,919
It's, it's like with your kids, right?

308
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:05,059
Where if you punish them, then they're like, oh, I promise not to do it again.

309
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,760
You're like, oh, ok.

310
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,789
You can have the candy after, like, no, you stick to that and like,

311
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,859
you make sure they know you're serious.

312
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:11,780
It's funny because,

313
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,489
so this guy is 17 and on the one hand, I'm like, ah,

314
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,299
17 year olds are generally not the smartest people on the planet, but ok,

315
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,739
but while he was using this aim bot on another account of his,

316
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,570
he was saying people should be careful to use

317
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,940
aim bots because he could get your account banned.

318
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,900
And I'm like, well, ok, at that point, he kind of understands, but then he's like,

319
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,359
I didn't realize they'd banned me.

320
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,390
I thought it was just my account,

321
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,320
which obviously that's why he was playing a different account.

322
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,700
-- Right. Not his main,
-- listen to you using gaming terms. His main.

323
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,380
Yeah. Well, it's a Starcraft thing.

324
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,210
So I know the star Trek

325
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,760
lingo,

326
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,239
you know, I mean, in an adult, you know, in the barcodes anyways.

327
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,440
Well, because that also boils down to like one of my,

328
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,039
my famous pieces of advice I have for most people which is, you know,

329
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,159
if you're going to commit a felony,

330
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:57,320
don't videotape it and if you're going to videotape it don't live stream it.

331
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,320
-- No,
-- just don't videotape it or

332
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:00,419
don't commit

333
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:00,809
fies

334
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,559
also.

335
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,700
That works too.

336
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,513
Yeah, if you're going to break the rules, especially when, if you're breaking rule,

337
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:10,953
don't let live stream it and acknowledge that you're breaking the rule

338
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,593
and that you understand what could happen and then complain later that,

339
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,033
you know, I love it because there's this like video of him crying saying, oh,

340
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,573
I didn't understand the consequences and I'm I

341
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,583
I take full accountability for my actions.

342
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,193
And my, my one thought is like, well, yeah,

343
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,874
and the accountability for your actions is you, you got banned.

344
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:28,314
That's the way it has to be because you need other people have to look at that and say,

345
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:31,223
I don't want to get manned. I don't want to be crying on youtube

346
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:32,987
to get my account back. Right.

347
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:37,187
It has to happen that way. I'm ok with it. It's harsh but it's necessary.

348
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:37,567
Well,

349
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,338
it's interesting too because then a lot of people and I can sort of buy into this,

350
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,627
this idea that he's a content creator and

351
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:45,187
helps kind of push the Fortnite community forwards,

352
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,348
you know, by making content and getting people into Fortnite.

353
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,778
But fundamentally at the same time cheating, generally,

354
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:55,148
especially cheating in multiplayer games kind of really makes the game suck.

355
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:59,822
-- Of course,
-- it does, it makes everything suck. Cheating in anything makes it worse.

356
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,822
Like I'm ok with people cheating against

357
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:03,461
a game they're playing against the computer

358
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,421
actually.

359
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:09,901
Yes, that's fair and watch speed runners, speed runners cheat constantly.

360
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:13,882
And it's awesome because, but they're not, it's obviously not multiplayer games.

361
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:14,942
There's no money involved.

362
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,271
It's just people are trying to beat the game really, really fast.

363
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:21,255
So they do insane, ridiculous things. And it's, it's lovely.

364
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,466
So, yeah, it seems to sort of boil down to, you know,

365
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:26,445
as long as you don't make the rest of the world the worst place for everybody else.

366
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:30,075
Cool. Like whatever you do in the privacy of your own home, so to speak. Great.

367
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:30,676
You do that,

368
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,315
you know. But, yeah, if you're playing against other people and cheating.

369
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:36,976
Like, I, I remember playing games against people who are clearly cheating and,

370
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,286
you know, it's not fun.

371
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:42,695
-- Like, it's just not, no,
-- it's, it's not fun playing any game against any.

372
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,645
Well, although I, I will,

373
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,979
I was having this exact discussion with my Children

374
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,789
not probably three days ago and I will say

375
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:56,159
there were, uh, some games I would play in college. We'll say while we were at the pub

376
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,770
that

377
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,530
revolved around cheating, the point of the game was actually to cheat.

378
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,049
It was, you know, dice games with cups and stuff. And those are marvelous games.

379
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,739
When everyone is cheating, everyone knows they're cheating.

380
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,489
-- Well,
-- but then, but then you're not cheating, that's part of the rules.

381
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,130
If you're caught, you lose.

382
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
But, you know,

383
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,830
it was so I was,

384
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,739
I loved those games. They were and I didn't even care that I lost a lot.

385
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,219
It was just,

386
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,179
it was amazing to cheat and to watch other people cheat because I loved it.

387
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:26,710
-- But anyway, anyway,
-- most people are comically terrible at cheating.

388
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,729
Most are, some are amazing.

389
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,190
And I knew some people who, it was like magician level cheating,

390
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,750
they could pull off and it was phenomenal.

391
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,309
But then I, I was saying to like, one of,

392
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,289
one of the favorite things is me and one of my friends,

393
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:44,229
we would stand apart and put like someone between us that we say was less experienced

394
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,140
it was beautiful because they didn't even know what was going on most of the time

395
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:55,030
and we were obviously cheating with each other against the unknowing mark.

396
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,489
-- I was, like,
-- every time I see video of three card Monty and it's just like, oh,

397
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,969
that guy that just won money.

398
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:03,109
Like, he's part of this, you know that. Right.

399
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:07,560
-- No, no, I can do it too.
-- Yeah, you can spot the red queen.

400
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,130
That's right.

401
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,569
That's,

402
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,069
I

403
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,089
was watching a street magician one time and my kids are like, oh,

404
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,890
we want to go watch a street magician and I literally took my wallet

405
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,949
out of my pocket and just clutched it in my hand the entire time.

406
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,829
The guy was doing his tricks.

407
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,550
Yeah.

408
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,670
Well, we should link to if, if we can find it this, like,

409
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,348
he's the world's best pickpocket and you can do things like,

410
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,670
uh, what was it?

411
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,010
He did this with Penn and Teller and he, like, removed the inside of their pen.

412
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,579
Like he basically took the pen away from Penn and Teller at some point unscrewed.

413
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,270
It took the inside out,

414
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,729
put the pen back together and gave it and

415
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,869
put it back in Penn and Teller's whatever pocket.

416
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,270
And then he's like, ok, well, can you write that down and they're like, click, click?

417
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,050
What? Like, oh, he's like, do you need this? And I'm just like,

418
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,750
like I get lifting somebody's wallet or heck

419
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,890
even removing their tie that's pretty impressive.

420
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,349
Like,

421
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:54,140
-- but like taking the inside of their pen out,
-- it is amazing.

422
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,089
And you think Penn and Teller are,

423
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,439
-- they know the craft
-- and that story could be wrong.

424
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,160
Well, some of the stuff on, you know, Penn and Teller fool us like they're like, yeah,

425
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,319
-- you fooled us
-- and, and they know that they know the art, they know what to look for.

426
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:11,699
They look for things we don't even understand and they still get fooled. And, and

427
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,079
I mean,

428
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,339
this again comes back to the beginning where

429
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,680
we were talking about like a motivated attacker.

430
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,574
It's very difficult to defend against them because they have motivation.

431
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:24,074
-- They have time and they have no. How? Well,
-- also what's interesting for Attackers

432
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:25,545
is in general,

433
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:27,064
they get to try and try again.

434
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:27,824
Right.

435
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:29,104
You know,

436
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:31,645
there's certain types of attacks where you don't get to try repeated times, like,

437
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:32,704
say robbing a bank.

438
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:33,905
Although

439
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,645
there are quite a few people,

440
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:38,224
dozens of banks before they got caught.

441
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:38,675
But, you know,

442
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,375
but when you're online and you're coming from a non extradition

443
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,185
country or a country that doesn't generally extradite to the US.

444
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,750
Yeah. So what right. Keep trying. What are they going to do? Phone the FBI.

445
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,020
We

446
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,420
were actually,

447
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,910
I was talking about this with someone this

448
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,589
morning is robbing the bank is easy spending.

449
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,939
The money is the problem.

450
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,310
Well, a lot of these people, you know,

451
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,390
don't have the best spending habits and their you know?

452
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,040
-- Yeah,
-- they're,

453
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,000
they're buying things that you can buy with cash

454
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,180
that you probably shouldn't be consuming at all.

455
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:05,780
Right. Right.

456
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,709
But, no, I mean, I, I hear you because they, yeah,

457
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,079
there's definitely countries in the world where they're not

458
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,979
going to send you to the United States so

459
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:15,630
you can hack anyone in the US you want and you're never going to get in trouble.

460
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:15,660
No,

461
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,130
this whole video game thing.

462
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,709
It really had me thinking because quite frankly I've, I've decided now I'm, I'm not,

463
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:21,380
I just,

464
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,310
I can't play multiplayer games unless I'm allowed to

465
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,410
cheat because I'm just that terrible at them.

466
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,040
Let's play Minecraft. Minecraft is nice and easy.

467
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,430
Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

468
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:34,510
Yeah, because, like I see my son playing Team Fortress Two and, I mean,

469
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,709
admittedly he's not good at it yet, but he's actually improving.

470
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,680
Right. He's, you know, he's slowly getting less terrible at it.

471
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,079
So I will play Fortnite with my kids every now and then

472
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:49,770
I consider it a success. If I'm not one of the 1st 20 people killed,

473
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
I'm so bad at it.

474
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:53,689
And it's funny because they,

475
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,369
at first they were like, oh, we'll be on a team together.

476
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,550
-- No, they don't even suggest that anymore
-- because, and now they're like,

477
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,530
-- we don't even,
-- yeah,

478
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,479
I'm dead.

479
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,089
Like they don't want me.

480
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,760
You're the tethered goat.

481
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,479
But here's the thing too. Here's the way I look at this is,

482
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,560
there's playing a game because you're good at it.

483
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,089
And so like,

484
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,510
I will play Mario Kart online and I played a lot of

485
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,709
Mario Kart when I was a kid so I can win.

486
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,680
I would say I usually place in the top three when I do an online

487
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:24,989
race and I'm obviously up against people of relatively similar skill levels to me.

488
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,319
But like, I don't suck at that game, but now Fortnite, I genuinely suck at it.

489
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,896
But when I play it, I also have attitude of, I'm bad at this game,

490
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,927
but I'm doing this to spend time with my

491
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:37,286
Children doing something they like to do and like,

492
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,317
-- that's
-- ok.

493
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,687
The biggest thing I've noticed, you know,

494
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,756
the biggest thing I've noticed the change in games from when you and I game to now

495
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:47,156
is how rapidly the games change, right? When we bought a copy of Duke, that was it.

496
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,636
And then, you know, we're lucky to get new maps

497
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:54,677
and now Minecraft has a full elemental table. They have

498
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,677
animals and bees

499
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:57,634
and you can,

500
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,754
I think the bees do pollination even

501
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:00,394
like

502
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,083
it's crazy.

503
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,634
Or you look at something like Fortnite and they just introduced helicopters.

504
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:06,614
Oh, did they?

505
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,514
Yeah, they just introduced helicopters.

506
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:10,234
-- Oh, man,
-- they had airplanes,

507
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,254
airplanes were awesome in that game and then they took them away and I'm like, oh,

508
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:14,713
man, I'd love the airplane.

509
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:17,394
Well, because they were broken. But apparently helicopters, they fixed a bit.

510
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:20,394
-- So for example, guess what happens if you jump off the helicopter at
-- height,

511
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,484
you can pull out your parachute thing and fly around.

512
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,831
No, you die.

513
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,431
What about your parachute thing though?

514
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,890
Uh, I think that doesn't count later in the game.

515
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:31,270
Like, it's sort of counts as packed away or gone. I'm not sure.

516
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,961
I don't, I don't know how that, but I, yeah,

517
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,041
because you jump out of the bus anyways point is like,

518
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,090
they're like, this is great because, you know, you can't just use the helicopter to,

519
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,441
like,

520
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,230
just kind of, you, you actually have to use it

521
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,201
with a plan and some sophistication. Right. And that's cool.

522
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:45,311
I'm ok with that, you know.

523
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:46,260
But, I mean,

524
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:48,220
do you think you and I could pull that off?

525
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,869
We could be like Thelma and Louise you get in the helicopter,

526
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,819
I'll fly the helicopter and then I'll crash and kill us both.

527
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:56,349
I'm in.

528
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:56,780
That

529
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,430
sounds fair.

530
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,750
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

531
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,280
And I think that's probably the best outcome.

532
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,369
See, again, if Fortnite just had a server just for like, old people who suck.

533
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,030
It would be way more fun, I think, than,

534
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,180
than running into the game and having some kid shoot

535
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,290
me in the head in the 1st 2.5 minutes.

536
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,969
And it's like, well, that sucked. I mean,

537
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,170
there's actually, I,

538
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,410
I will try to dig it up but there's an old penny arcade cartoon about this.

539
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,944
And it's like, you think one of the guys basically said, like,

540
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:25,824
do these kids even know how to shoot you anywhere but the head anymore?

541
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:26,444
It's

542
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:26,655
like,

543
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:27,895
it's so funny

544
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,224
because they're obviously making fun of the fact that,

545
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:33,114
you know, the kids are really good and now that they're getting older,

546
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,405
like they're getting just destroyed playing these games.

547
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:37,104
Well, that's the thing too.

548
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,964
Like watching, it's not just that you have to be good at playing the game,

549
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:43,564
You have to understand the strategy and the meta because the games keep changing,

550
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,439
right? And that's the thing, right? You and I,

551
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:48,859
you learned how to play Mario Kart Cart. I learned how to play Tetris.

552
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,030
That's not how like a game like Fortnite or Starcraft

553
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,680
works now like Starcraft two has completely different units than

554
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,219
it did 10 years ago.

555
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,619
So actually, I, I must,

556
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,859
I will tell you now the Nintendo switch has something called Tetris 99

557
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:04,020
which is like Tetris Battle Royale.

558
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,000
And I thought I was good at Tetris till I played this.

559
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,660
And I'm like, I am really bad at Tetris like these people are ridiculous.

560
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,819
Yeah, I uh the whole slamming down thing. I never got super great at like I got

561
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:16,699
rotating.

562
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,339
Nothing like, yeah, so there's a way to like rotate you,

563
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:23,959
you create certain structures and then you can like rotate blocks into them.

564
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,380
You get like extra bonus points for rotating things like it's nuts.

565
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,260
And I, I have no idea these people are basically,

566
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,540
it might as well be magic because I have no idea how it works and I

567
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,089
can't possibly compete with them because they're operating

568
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,260
on a level that I don't even comprehend

569
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:39,719
well.

570
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:42,739
But that's true of a lot of things like you look at like wood carving or painting,

571
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:46,859
right? You give me all the same, you can give me a block of wood and the same knives

572
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,930
and I, I am not making you a sculpture. I'm making you a best an ashtray

573
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,010
and it's gonna be a little lumpy.

574
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,680
I am completely familiar with this problem.

575
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:58,520
Yes, I, you know though, OK,

576
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,959
so here's the way I will describe this and I'm going to do it in the context of

577
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:08,160
video games and this is true of security is the same way or a learning any skill,

578
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:08,569
right?

579
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:09,290
Where

580
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,410
like when I started playing minecraft,

581
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,209
I basically would just mine some things that

582
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,744
build these crappy little structures and be like,

583
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:15,665
wow, this is neat.

584
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:16,864
And then eventually

585
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:18,185
I got sick of that

586
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,964
and then I would do more things and do more things and I made more

587
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:24,645
tools and I made different blocks and I eventually reached a point where like,

588
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,505
and I, we, I think we just talked about this. I, I like literally built a machine

589
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,295
that would kill and cook chickens for me automatically because

590
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,104
I got sick of having to go and get food.

591
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:34,974
Like

592
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,109
what,

593
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,410
what just happened there right. It's,

594
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:42,130
and it was actually I had a lever on it because it would either just the way it worked,

595
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,109
the way chickens work is they lay eggs in Minecraft.

596
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,109
And there's a one in eight chance that an egg will hatch a chicken if it,

597
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,949
if you throw it.

598
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,949
And so basically, I have a machine that the chickens lay eggs.

599
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,709
The eggs are re hatched into chickens.

600
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:57,359
And so it, obviously it's, it's kind of like this repeating cycle and,

601
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,489
but, but the way,

602
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,780
the way I had it set up is I could flip a switch and stop making new chickens because

603
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,040
sometimes I'd get too many chickens because in the

604
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,520
game would start to lag because it'd be like,

605
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,489
you know, 7000 chickens in this machine.

606
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,089
But it was like,

607
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:13,030
I, I keep thinking about that and it's like, what the heck, I mean, I,

608
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,459
but it's like any skill, right?

609
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:20,859
I made a trampoline, you know, the trampoline is, um, it's piston blocks with the,

610
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,660
um, the, the, the slime.

611
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,930
So it's bouncy and

612
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:25,780
you put trip wires over it.

613
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,359
So that when you cross the tripwire, the, the piston fires the block up

614
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:31,469
and then down.

615
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,699
And so it's like this automated trampoline, you don't have to jump, you,

616
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:35,609
you bounce on it.

617
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:35,819
Oh,

618
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,199
yeah. Right. Right. And this is,

619
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,969
this is how any skill works, right?

620
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:43,949
Like when, when my other favorite example is elastic search where

621
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,410
like using elastic search is really complicated.

622
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,689
And when I started doing it, like,

623
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:51,489
I was proud if I could just make a little graph and like, now I,

624
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,609
I do all these wacky crazy things in it and it's like

625
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,079
some, you know, new people will say, how did you do that?

626
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,969
It's like, I don't like, I use it every day for the last three years.

627
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,359
It reminds me of the UNIX

628
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,000
landline, right? Like I had,

629
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,290
um what it was, yeah,

630
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,959
we wanted to essentially take a PDF and get all the most common words out of it.

631
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,119
And I'm like, OK,

632
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,050
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, you know, uh PDF to text bunch of stuff, count,

633
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,930
sort unique.

634
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,609
Uh Still don't have a stop word list. I need to add that in.

635
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,219
But I'm like, I'm like, cut and paste, I'm like, yeah, here,

636
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:26,239
here this will work on like, you know, any Mac Os Linux, whatever,

637
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,069
right?

638
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,349
But I look at it and it's like, it's like basically a pile of line noise, you know,

639
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:34,430
with like tr you know, upper, lower, you know, and,

640
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,229
and it's funny because I actually documented what each of these commands do.

641
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,550
And I'm like, well, that kind of helps. But,

642
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,170
you know, it's funny because I'm looking and I'm like, well,

643
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,790
this is really obvious what this thing does and why you would do it this way.

644
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,790
But yeah, obviously to a normal person, they're like, what now?

645
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,109
-- Like, you can convert a PDF to text.
-- No. And, and that's fair. And I guess, right.

646
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,189
And you know what though,

647
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,800
just kind of thinking about this and especially

648
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,609
in the context of video games and cheating

649
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,550
is,

650
00:26:56,709 --> 00:27:00,790
I think you could view it as two paths where you could either work really, really,

651
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,209
really hard, like many hours a day and become really,

652
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,130
really good or you could be like, screw it.

653
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,119
I'm just going to buy this cheating equipment and

654
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,920
go do something else with my free time.

655
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,359
Well, use a framework. Use an assist. I mean, that's why people buy elastic stuff.

656
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,489
Right. They could write that stuff themselves or

657
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:14,786
they

658
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:15,255
just,

659
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:15,926
you know.

660
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:17,125
-- Yeah,
-- that's fair.

661
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,936
Yeah, that's, that's exactly true. Actually, that's a very good point.

662
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:21,495
I'm not going to write my own web browser.

663
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,735
You know, I had to mirror website and I'm like, scrapy.

664
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:27,416
What are the config options for scrapy? Like scrapy literally scrapes websites.

665
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,595
-- I'm like, man, somebody wrote this amazing tool. I've
-- never heard of

666
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,015
this tool.

667
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,326
-- It's a Python library. That's
-- fantastic. Cool.

668
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,426
I should look at that because any time I need to mirror something I run W

669
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,336
get and it's ugly.

670
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:41,302
Yeah. And WG will work just fine. It's scrapy is a little bit more modern.

671
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:41,901
But yeah,

672
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,491
by and large W get is what I would use if

673
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,541
I didn't want to look up the options for Scrapey.

674
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,141
Because, yeah,

675
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:51,212
like many things I've used W get long enough to know what five options I need are

676
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:51,641
WG

677
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:51,982
dash

678
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,452
-- R that's all you need
-- and

679
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:54,991
no parent and mirror

680
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,741
whatever. Yeah, that's right. Mirror is the one you need, isn't it? Right. Right.

681
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,141
Yep. Yeah, that's true.

682
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:01,390
So,

683
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,880
I guess,

684
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,609
oh, my goodness.

685
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,189
I guess it's boiling down to learning how to use your tools and,

686
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:08,630
-- and even just knowing that these tools exist, I mean,
-- yeah, that's,

687
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,260
that's definitely part of the game.

688
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,910
Absolutely.

689
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,099
I think one advantage of open source is at this point,

690
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,449
I assume every problem I have that somebody else had that problem

691
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,040
-- and wrote an open source tool and released it on
-- github.

692
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,270
Or the answer is on stack overflow.

693
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,530
Yeah,

694
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,650
-- exactly. You know, and then the trick is just finding it.
-- No, I hear you.

695
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,369
And I mean, this is the whole point of open source, right?

696
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,719
Is the fact that if you need something,

697
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,790
it's there and you don't have to do it because if you're,

698
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,739
if you're writing a library that isn't

699
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:37,500
a core part of whatever it is you're doing, you're wasting your time

700
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,260
pretty much.

701
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:38,839
So, yeah.

702
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:42,099
And I suppose the same thing with you want to be a professional video game player,

703
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:42,420
right?

704
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,699
If you want to be the best of the best and you're not just practicing all the time,

705
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,140
you're probably basically wasting your time.

706
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,459
Right.

707
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:51,939
Well, you know, like when I look at these Starcraft two players, you know,

708
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,939
they live in these houses in Korea, they practice, you know, 8 to 10 hours a day.

709
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,160
They have coaches, you know,

710
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,170
I've watched some of their practicing and it's like the comment,

711
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,170
like they're talking at such a high metal level that like the stuff I need to

712
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,890
learn they don't even talk about or mention because it's just so taken for granted.

713
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,069
Right. Like they're like, oh, yeah.

714
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,810
And then when you did that and they're like, oh yeah, that, yeah, with the, yeah,

715
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:11,989
on the pass and the, yeah, and then the outer range.

716
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,150
Yeah. Ok. So don't do that. Ok.

717
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,010
And then, you know, onto the main, yeah, when you did that thing. Yeah.

718
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,719
Oh yeah, that, no, like put the t

719
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,630
like over to the left there on this map

720
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:20,680
and I'm just like,

721
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,699
what are they talking about? Like,

722
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:25,040
I thought they played a really good game,

723
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,790
-- you know,
-- it, it's probably like when I watch cricket,

724
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,680
I have no idea what's going on in a game of cricket.

725
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:33,150
Something I still don't understand is so in cricket you can

726
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,719
get a really high score and then they stop playing.

727
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,290
They

728
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:37,719
see that's why I don't get right.

729
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,099
Like, yeah, I don't even understand how the,

730
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,750
how the fundamental most point part of the game.

731
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,640
Where is like, when do you stop playing happens?

732
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,630
Because my understanding is that they can choose to stop playing at some point.

733
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,439
So I don't know if somebody wants to explain cricket. To me it's been tried before.

734
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:52,239
-- It didn't stick. Obviously
-- everything I know about cricket.

735
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,459
-- I learned from Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy. That's
-- pretty much,

736
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:56,130
yeah.

737
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,599
Anyway. All right, man, I think,

738
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,459
I think we should call this one. I don't, I don't want to spend too much time.

739
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,319
It's, this has been lovely. I must say. Thank you.

740
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:08,500
I needed to talk about something that wasn't that terrible virus.

741
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,560
So this is, this has been great and kind of for everyone listening.

742
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:14,939
This is my intention. We have enough crap news right now.

743
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:18,989
We have enough to worry about. I want us to try to keep this as fun as we can.

744
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,609
So if nothing else, we can be a beacon of hope.

745
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,040
And we also have like me and Josh are not experts on any

746
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,064
on anything. Literally nothing,

747
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,064
-- especially security. No
-- good Lord. No,

748
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,584
I can barely mow my lawn.

749
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:34,385
That's right. That's right. Wonderful. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you

750
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,844

source security podcast.com, hit up the show notes.

752
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:41,785
I'll try to put links to all the videos and other fun things we talked about today.

Kurt have a fantastic rest of your day.

755
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:52,334
-- You too. Thanks everybody. Thanks
-- everyone. Stay safe out there. Bye bye
