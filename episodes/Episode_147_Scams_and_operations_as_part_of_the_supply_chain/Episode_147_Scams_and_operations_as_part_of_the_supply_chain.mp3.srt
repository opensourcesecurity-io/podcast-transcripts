Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 147

1
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,149
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:12,840
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,810
-- what's new
-- Kurt?

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,149
-- Uh,
-- apparently you can pay a dollar to get into somebody else's house. Now,

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,790
-- like anyone you want or not,
-- anybody,

6
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:26,809
-- anybody who signs up for the service where
-- crowbar as a service, right?

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,170
Yeah. So lock boxes, right. If you've ever done,

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,150
uh, if you've ever had to go buy a house or rent a place, right.

9
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,069
Obviously, you want to like,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,840
go in and look around and make sure it's not full of raccoons or something.

11
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:37,189
Right.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,750
Right.

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,689
And traditionally that's been a real pain, you know, I remember the last time,

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,900
like not the last time, the last,

15
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,229
last time we were house hunting and you had to coordinate with the other

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,090
realtor for them to show up and like unlock the house and stuff,

17
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:49,419
right?

18
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,110
Ok.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,150
And for example, now,

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,610
locally they have these lock boxes that are actually Bluetooth enabled

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,259
so that

22
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:59,134
you go with your realtor and they have an app on their phone that allows them to,

23
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:01,125
you know, ok, lock box number 217,

24
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,255
I need to unlock now so I can get the keys out of you,

25
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,894
so I can open up this house and like show my clients around,

26
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:06,635
right?

27
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,004
But obviously, you know,

28
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:10,845
not everybody wants to spend money on expensive Bluetooth lock boxes.

29
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:13,334
So most people just get the cheap ones that have like a combination lock,

30
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:15,934
like and not a proper combination lock, but like

31
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:19,004
a four digit, you know, like 1234, click it opens.

32
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,044
But at the same time, you kind of want the advantages of,

33
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:25,095
you know, for example, you're a landlord and you're

34
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:28,260
in a different country or heck you're at work or whatever,

35
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:29,330
you don't want to have to drive out to,

36
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,879
who knows where to like let somebody interview the apartment so that

37
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,690
they can decide whether or not they want to rent it.

38
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:34,739
So you put the green a

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,900
lock box and then you basically subscribe to a service that

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,690
allows you to kind of publish those and they charge a dollar to get access to it,

41
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:43,089
right?

42
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,309
So if I want to see somebody's apartment and it's, you know,

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,470
subscribing to the service,

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,709
I go and I pay a dollar and I

45
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,614
get the code to the lockbox.

46
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:55,025
Hopefully I'm somewhat honest and I don't, you know, trash the place or whatever.

47
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:56,184
So I go there

48
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:56,694
on

49
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,194
the box, get the key, look around, go, ok?

50
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,165
I want to rent it or no, I don't want to rent it or whatever,

51
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,625
go back out, lock the place, hopefully put the key back in the lockbox, lock,

52
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:05,535
the lock box and

53
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,209
you know,

54
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,360
continue my email conversation with the landlord whether

55
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,788
or not I want to rent this place.

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,070
Right.

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,690
And my suspicion is the purpose behind the $1 charge

58
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,330
is you're going to use a major credit card,

59
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,639
that way they can use that for verification purposes.

60
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,960
And I think we all know how this story ends now.

61
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,595
Well, it's a little more subtle than that in that.

62
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:29,065
So I can pay a dollar using a stolen credit card or something.

63
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:29,664
Right?

64
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,845
So now I have a code for a lock box that I

65
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:34,934
can use more than once because this is a mechanical lockbox,

66
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:35,005
right?

67
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:36,145
It's not sophisticated.

68
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:39,854
And now I can put up an ad like on Craigslist in the US or maybe Kaji

69
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,574
in Canada

70
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:43,524
saying I have this place for rent,

71
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,100
you know, contact me if you want to view it, I'm remote.

72
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,649
So I'll have to give you the lock box code to get in and look around.

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,770
So somebody replies, they go, I give them the lockbox code, they look around,

74
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,490
they go, yeah, I want to rent it and I go cool.

75
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,199
You know, here's your contract and you need to make a deposit of, you know,

76
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:00,029
1000 bucks or whatever and they send me that money and you know,

77
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,009
I disappear with the money

78
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,690
and what really was interesting to me is it, got me thinking

79
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:06,100
if I go to a physical

80
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:11,160
location in the world, be it a building, an empty lot, a parking lot, whatever,

81
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:16,110
how do I know that that guy standing over there who claims to own it or to,

82
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,470
claims to be in control of it actually is.

83
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,559
And he's not just some random guy who showed up, like,

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,750
you've been to major events where people are selling parking

85
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,149
on their lawn right around the stadium or whatever.

86
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,399
Oh, yeah,

87
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,820
that happens all the time where it's scammers selling parking or something.

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,940
How do you know that guy is actually like the

89
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,910
owner of that house and they're not on vacation?

90
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,789
You don't? And

91
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,179
I think even in the instance where they're not, the owner,

92
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,070
generally speaking, I think everyone gets away with it.

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,059
-- And so people mostly just don't care.
-- Well, and that's the thing, right.

94
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,479
So what's happened apparently is like this lady paid

95
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,699
money kind of started moving in and then,

96
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,100
you know,

97
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,600
people from the cleaning company actually hired by the

98
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,899
owner of this place showed up and they're like,

99
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,899
get out, right.

100
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,000
You know, you don't like, we don't know who you are, get out or we're calling the cops.

101
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,880
And so this poor lady, her money and

102
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,630
has, uh, let's face it.

103
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:03,899
You know,

104
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,860
the cops are not going to be able to track whoever

105
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:07,929
-- did this down most likely and get her money back
-- No,

106
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,240
no, they, they almost certainly don't care.

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,880
And even if they did care,

108
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:15,139
it's almost certainly someone in a foreign country using

109
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:19,200
stolen credit cards and stolen credentials for email,

110
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:19,855
whatever.

111
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:21,845
And you're never going to find them.

112
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,204
Well, and more importantly, you're never going to get the money back.

113
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,785
Right. Yep. Yep.

114
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:30,774
And I think I read in this story they, they used a Bitcoin ATM to send the money.

115
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,714
-- So, like it's gone. Gone.
-- Right.

116
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,234
Well, and, and it's, again, that's a classic case of like,

117
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:35,725
yeah,

118
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,364
we could use money mules and we could do all

119
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,274
sorts of fancy things to make the money less traceable.

120
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,135
But yeah, man, like an ATM Bitcoin transaction,

121
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,140
you know that just turns money into Bitcoin, send it to this wallet,

122
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,230
run it through a Bitcoin washer and boom, it's gone. It's easy.

123
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,690
You can do it from anywhere in the world

124
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,239
and you don't need to involve people. That's the big thing, right?

125
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,519
You don't have to have accomplices

126
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,109
when you use

127
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:57,440
banks and credit cards and things like that.

128
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,000
There are, I'm not going to say all the time, but there are

129
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,609
there there for certain transactions and

130
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,989
certain things you have fraud protection.

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,510
So if you do get nailed,

132
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,149
you can fill out a form

133
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,100
and they will, in some cases you can get some or all of your money back.

134
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,420
But I think the other important aspect is

135
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,779
if you do get defrauded from using like proper, you know,

136
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,779
we'll say monetary vehicles,

137
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:22,459
you can file the,

138
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,920
the bank will probably help you file a police report at the very least.

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,059
Whereas if you file a police report because you used a Bitcoin ATM,

140
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,140
they're gonna be like, yeah.

141
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,500
Yeah, we just, no, no. Right on out. Right. We're not, we don't care.

142
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,690
Well, it's not that they don't care.

143
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,779
It's that they know that there's currently nothing they can really do about it.

144
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,420
Yeah, that's probably fair. I'm sure they,

145
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:44,170
sure they're sad. You got ripped off. But they know they know they can't help.

146
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,329
-- But
-- this really drives home.

147
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,170
Like, I was browsing reddit and this guy was like, oh,

148
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,149
I'm selling a console online and, oh,

149
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,239
somebody accidentally sent me a too large check.

150
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,390
Is it safe to deposit?

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,640
No,

152
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,269
if somebody somehow accidentally sends you a check for like,

153
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,929
three times the amount of what they were supposed to pay and is like, oh, that's cool.

154
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,980
Just deposit it and wire me the difference. Number one.

155
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:04,429
Why didn't they just wire you the money in the first place?

156
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,730
Right. Like

157
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,690
I live in Canada, we can email money to each other for a buck

158
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,940
using, you know, the intact,

159
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,739
essentially it piggybacks on the intact debit card system.

160
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,290
You register your email address.

161
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,750
So, like if you want to send me money, you,

162
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,220
you email curtesy.org a bunch of money and you know, I'll, I'll,

163
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,209
I'm not going to click accept because I'm gonna be like,

164
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,619
I don't know what this money is and I don't

165
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,260
want to get involved in whatever is going on.

166
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,890
-- Did you hear that? Everyone listening? Yeah, please
-- send me money.

167
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,549
-- But don't seriously don't email
-- KT

168
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,029
money,

169
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,059
see what happened,

170
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,179
you know,

171
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,470
and even apparently Craigslist has like a warning all over the place saying, like,

172
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,640
don't, you know, don't take money orders and like,

173
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,140
cashier's checks for stuff and cash it because like, those are all scams, you know,

174
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,369
don't mail this stuff to some foreign country

175
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:49,350
just because you got what looks like a check because, you know,

176
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,290
checks take a while to clear sometimes like weeks

177
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,679
or more.

178
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,299
That's right.

179
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,519
Well,

180
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,929
and these scammers know how to construct the checks in a manner

181
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,440
that takes the longest amount of time possible for it to clear.

182
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,760
Yeah.

183
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,109
So, and it got me thinking because there's been stories.

184
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,489
Um, so this is a, this is a first hand story from somebody I know directly

185
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,149
that happened quite recently. So

186
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,410
essentially they were out drinking, they wanted to get home. So what do you do?

187
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,369
You call an Uber? Right? Cool. So they're waiting for the Uber basically.

188
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,220
And this guy

189
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,980
comes up to them and he's like, oh, you know, can I use your phone to call a cab?

190
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,089
And they're like being reasonable human beings like, oh, ok.

191
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,859
Yeah, we'll call you a cab. Sure. So they call the guy a cab.

192
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,820
Cool.

193
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:35,010
Uh their Uber comes up and these guys get into the Uber

194
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,019
and the other random guy gets into the front of the Uber

195
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,829
and the Uber driver, of course, just assumes they all know each other because

196
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,429
and starts driving and of course, the guys are called, the Uber are like, you know,

197
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,619
you got to stop and like,

198
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,130
dude, you, you need to get out like this, this is not a cab, this is an Uber,

199
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,730
this is an hour.

200
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,339
Anyway, there's a bunch of police cars and the Uber driver, of course,

201
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,649
uh apparently his thinking was because there's too many

202
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,589
people in the Uber and not enough seatbelts,

203
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,380
he's going to get in trouble.

204
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,059
So he kind of

205
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,170
just kept going, didn't stop

206
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,309
for the cops.

207
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:04,470
So more

208
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,100
cops show up. I know that that's what I love. But here's the thing, right?

209
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:11,559
-- Do Uber drivers get any training?
-- I would be shocked.

210
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm sure they have a phone book sized terms of service. They have to sign that

211
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,420
says,

212
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,480
yeah.

213
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,290
So anyways, but what, but as an Uber driver,

214
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,470
when four cop cars surround you and they come at you, you know,

215
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,399
and they draw their weapons and start yelling

216
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,040
apparently, then you do stop. Uh Right.

217
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,880
So they basically hauled everybody out of the Uber.

218
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:33,465
And the deal was the guy that, you know, had asked to call a cab and got in the Uber was,

219
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:34,625
was, had just

220
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:38,325
done something rather improper in the eyes of the law and, you know,

221
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,804
they wanted to get a hold of him, but of course they're like, you know,

222
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,135
what's the story here?

223
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:45,335
Right? Like, is this your getaway car? Is this your, you know, your accomplices?

224
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,534
And, um, so the majority of the cops apparently were, like,

225
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,145
after talking to these guys, they're like, ok, well,

226
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,664
this one guy has a long history of criminality and did something really,

227
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:53,344
really horrible

228
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,875
And these other guys, you know, they're like 18,

229
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,880
they're 10 years younger than this guy. They have no criminal history, right?

230
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,770
Like one of these is not like the other, um,

231
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,359
but one cop wanted to hang on to them to just make sure everything.

232
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,250
So these, these guys had to spend, you know,

233
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,809
the night in the cells while all of this got sorted out.

234
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,200
But it just got me thinking, you know, like, I've seen multiple videos where

235
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,429
people, uh what do you call those

236
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,909
influencers? Right.

237
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,989
Those Instagram influencer people that, like, live stream their life or whatever.

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,299
So they're like holding their phone up and

239
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,030
like walking around life and talking and whatever.

240
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:25,049
And there's like several cases now where those people have gotten into a

241
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,909
car that they thought was like the Uber they ordered and it's not.

242
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,989
-- Right. Right. I've, I've heard of that.
-- Yes.

243
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,034
You know, and of course the person's kind of like,

244
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:34,065
like, get out of my car. Right.

245
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,445
And this is what I'm beginning to really appreciate the fact

246
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,104
that my car doors automatically lock when I start driving now.

247
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:40,465
Right. Right.

248
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:44,104
I mean, and I guess this would really apply, you know, anybody driving a Prius.

249
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:45,825
I guess this is a real problem for them. Right.

250
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,294
Because I think all Ubers by law in the States are like Priuses mostly.

251
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,275
I don't know. That's my impression

252
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,010
I've never seen, I've ridden in countless different kinds of Ubers.

253
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,619
Actually, I had a guy pick me up in a pickup truck once that

254
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,750
is wild. This,

255
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:04,400
this can't be economical in any way. Like the amount of gas this thing eats.

256
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,109
Well, I was just thinking that would actually be really handy because like,

257
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,590
you know, if you, if you're a millennial and you go to IKEA, yeah,

258
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,440
you need somebody with a pickup truck.

259
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,080
Uh, that's fair. Actually.

260
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,830
Uh, I don't think you can

261
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,770
order an Uber pickup.

262
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,059
You can order, what is it like? Uber? Uber XL and Uber, like fancy

263
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,049
-- Uber black.
-- Uber black. That's the one.

264
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,390
Yes.

265
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,400
But yeah.

266
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,719
So anyways, like, it's just, for example,

267
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,320
this just reminds me of this whole home thing.

268
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,030
Like you and I were kids of the eighties, stranger danger, you know,

269
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,830
don't get into a stranger's car.

270
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,739
Don't go into a stranger's house. Don't, you know, like

271
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,419
all these things now where the opposite of that is the basic business plan.

272
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,530
Like, yeah, go into a stranger's car

273
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,380
and have total strangers come into your car

274
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,659
and, and I've,

275
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:50,109
I've gotten into strangers cars and they offered me a

276
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,809
little basket of candy and I've eaten their candy.

277
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:58,650
Yeah. And water. Yeah. Or like a USB charge port for my phone.

278
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,159
-- Yeah,
-- I don't use those. But actually I have a, I have a hilarious story.

279
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,530
So, when, when my daughter was very young, this is many years in the past

280
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,340
we were going over, like, the dewey, good

281
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,770
strangers, cars. Do we like, do we go home with other people?

282
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,630
Like all this kind of stuff?

283
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,719
And at one point we're like, do you get in a stranger's car?

284
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,539
And she goes, no, we say what if he has candy and she goes, well,

285
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,559
what kind of candy is it?

286
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,289
No, the answer

287
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,109
is no,

288
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,710
the answer is not. What kind of candy is it?

289
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,869
But yeah. Anyway, anyway, I, I, that's, that's such a crazy story, man.

290
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:31,469
I,

291
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,849
I, I guess here's, here's my takeaway from this is

292
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,469
there have been

293
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,510
many situations

294
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,510
where I've seen something happening

295
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,109
or someone has asked me for assistance

296
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,869
and I've opted not to get involved. And this is why, because

297
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,789
there are depending. I mean, it's all very,

298
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,315
of course, but

299
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:56,885
generally speaking,

300
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,604
it is not uncommon at all to try to help someone

301
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:04,875
-- and end up in a world of hurt
-- or they grab your phone and run away. Oh,

302
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,075
thank goodness. That's never happened to me.

303
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:07,604
That's a,

304
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,445
apparently that's a very common way of

305
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,684
stealing cell phones in some places is literally

306
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,280
they ask you to like,

307
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,109
check something on your phone or like,

308
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,419
can you look this up for me or can I make a call and they like,

309
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,349
grab your phone and run and let's face it.

310
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:22,390
Most people don't do enough cardio that they could chase that person down

311
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
and assuming you do do enough cardio to chase the person down.

312
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,989
-- Then
-- what I, I wouldn't because look,

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,700
if someone's willing to steal your phone in that manner,

314
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,619
it is not unreasonable to assume they could potentially be armed or they're

315
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,150
just going to beat the crap out of you if you catch them

316
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:41,409
because like, I'm not even going to pretend like if I get in a fight I'm losing. Right.

317
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:41,799
I'm,

318
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,799
I am not the kind of person who's going to win a

319
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,679
-- fight and I have enough sense to just not get in
-- them.

320
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,099
Speaking of which II, I have the perfect, we'll, we'll post a

321
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,659
clip to the video of the, uh,

322
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,789
the guy that was setting vehicles on fire along

323
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,760
White Avenue got chased by two by four guy

324
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,640
and Hawaiian shirt guy

325
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,409
locally that happened a few weeks ago.

326
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:00,049
Yeah.

327
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,270
Like I, and that's something I kind of hate about the modern world is, yeah,

328
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,549
the modern world kind of sucks because nobody wants to help each other.

329
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,210
But I've literally had cases where, you know, I'm,

330
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:11,809
I'm carrying leftover pizza and somebody asked me, you know, hey, I want some, like,

331
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,969
money for food and I'm like, oh, well, like, I don't have that

332
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,320
or I don't want to give you money for food because I think you might be lying.

333
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,969
But, hey, here's like half a pizza and then they, like, launch into me

334
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,030
and start screaming at me and it's like

335
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,909
-- that worked out well.
-- Uh. Right.

336
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,659
I've, I've had that too where someone says, you know, I need money to buy food.

337
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:29,570
And I'm like, look, there's a mcdonald's across the street.

338
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,520
You tell me what you want. I will go get it for you.

339
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,270
And yeah, and then I, I got yelled at, it's like, yeah,

340
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,349
you're clearly not getting money for food,

341
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,590
you know, and I don't want to be a jerk. But yeah, at the same time, I also

342
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,210
locally, I mean, in an

343
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,640
extreme case, you know, Panhandler asked some guy for money. The guy said no. So the,

344
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,809
the panhandler stabbed him and it's like

345
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,359
that escalated quickly.

346
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah.

347
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,080
Right.

348
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,440
No, I know. It's,

349
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,539
this is one of the challenges I think of modern society.

350
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,280
Well, it's really been a challenge forever.

351
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,659
It's just obviously law of large numbers. So we just, and global news.

352
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,500
So you hear about it way more often. But

353
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,159
no, it's, it's one of the things I struggle with because I want to be a nice person,

354
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,330
but I also don't want to, you know,

355
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,049
bleed to death in an alley.

356
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,979
So it's, I don't know, it's a tough one man for sure.

357
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:17,010
And I guess this again kind of comes back to like, like,

358
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,575
what's your personal threat profile?

359
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,164
And for everyone it's very different and

360
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,825
I imagine mine is ratcheted up in weird ways compared to most people.

361
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,534
-- It's always something you got to
-- think about.

362
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:29,424
Like, not plugging your phone into anything weird.

363
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:32,284
Ever, like those little charge cabins at the airport or whatever,

364
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:33,835
just buy a battery.

365
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,645
There's such an easy solution for this. Buy a battery, put it in your backpack.

366
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:41,244
You never ever, ever have to plug your phone into anything weird ever again.

367
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:41,895
So,

368
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,039
so speaking of which uh threat profiles,

369
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:50,330
so Slack has actually publicly stated that they are probably,

370
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,469
I think this was in their, what filing was it?

371
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,309
The S one or something? Because they're going to IP O

372
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,859
they, they basically as one of their, you know,

373
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,710
in your s one you're supposed to list like all

374
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,789
the sort of reasonable existential threats to your company,

375
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,710
right?

376
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,500
You know, like, oh,

377
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,409
somebody invents a new technology that makes us obsolete or like dinosaurs.

378
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,080
And one of the threats they published was that, you know,

379
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,770
they're a target for Nation State

380
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,820
hackers.

381
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,830
And well, so for number one,

382
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:19,469
everybody's a potential potential target of Nation state hackers.

383
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,750
And number two,

384
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,000
Slack is actually a probable target of Nation State hackers

385
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,109
because I was thinking how many companies now use Slack

386
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,900
to coordinate incident response,

387
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,340
-- most of
-- them

388
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,609
or even more for their just day to day message backbone for all their

389
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:38,809
-- employees to talk to each other, like all of them, basically.
-- Absolutely.

390
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,570
Well, the even crazier thing about Slack is

391
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,719
I don't think you can get rid of messages.

392
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:48,119
I think once you have information in the slack,

393
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,000
I guess, universe for your organization, it's pretty much there forever.

394
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,219
-- And I don't think you can get rid
-- of it.

395
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,520
The one thing you can do now is they,

396
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,080
they have a thing where you can have your own private key to encrypt stuff.

397
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,169
-- Oh, my goodness. That is. Don't get me started.
-- I

398
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:00,840
know

399
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,979
it's a, it's a start, I wouldn't say it's a solution yet. Yeah.

400
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,520
So it got me thinking because we,

401
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,799
we've spent a lot of time talking about software supply chains and how like, oh,

402
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,039
you're pulling in 1000 dependencies or you're pulling in some random open

403
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,520
source project that was handed over to this guy who put,

404
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:14,950
what was it?

405
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,479
The malware that stole not Bitcoins but some other coin.

406
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,140
-- Oh, yeah. If you had a certain wallet running. Yeah,
-- exactly.

407
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,309
And I was thinking about operational supply chains. Right. So

408
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:29,090
people just kind of forget that for, you know, for example,

409
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,989
if somebody were to hack one of the big phone companies,

410
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,599
they would have access to a lot of interesting data,

411
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,169
ignoring the fact of actually listening to phone

412
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:38,059
calls just that to know who's calling,

413
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,349
who when uh could be very interesting

414
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,299
and obviously having access to Slack,

415
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,489
you'd have access to all the internal track of the traffic of that company.

416
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,039
And I'm wondering for example, other companies that discuss, you know,

417
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,669
mergers and acquisition on Slack.

418
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,169
I would be shocked if there aren't,

419
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,299
you know, I mean, we use Slack all the time and we talk about

420
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,619
material information being, you know, material information, like,

421
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,859
like things that could affect the stock price, for example,

422
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,050
constantly.

423
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, Morgan

424
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:08,098
Point, what are you going to use to talk about that stuff?

425
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,750
That's not

426
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,459
telephone,

427
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:10,819
you know,

428
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,819
unless you go to some solution like signal or

429
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,579
whatsapp or you have end to end encryption.

430
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,500
Basically every email, the phone, Skype,

431
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,640
Google Hangouts, Slack all have this problem.

432
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,680
Um, you know,

433
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,250
it's just hopefully like Google is mature enough to have a

434
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,719
massive security effort to keep all those bad guys out.

435
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,520
Right. And I, I have a suspicion Slack

436
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,239
has. In fact, I know Slack has a fairly mature security team. I, I,

437
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,939
I've met some of them and they're good,

438
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,130
but I think listing Nation State activity is fair

439
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,469
because it doesn't matter how good you are,

440
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:44,859
they will get you.

441
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,609
And the reason being a Nation State

442
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,699
has essentially unlimited resources and unlimited time.

443
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,459
You don't.

444
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,369
And

445
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,550
the willingness to do things that rational and typical people,

446
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,839
even irrational people

447
00:17:57,229 --> 00:17:59,420
either can't do or won't do like you know,

448
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,260
kidnapping and threatening their Children.

449
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,859
You know, no matter how bad you make your customers angry,

450
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,719
chances are they're not going to kidnap your Children and demand a refund.

451
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,319
-- I'm pretty sure that's not happened on a regular basis.
-- Nation states can do that.

452
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,329
Right. And, and some of them totally would, where they would,

453
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,790
they would go to great lengths to acquire your cooper.

454
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:19,699
Yeah.

455
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,420
So I, I,

456
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm actually really glad that they said this because I think

457
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,099
this is a good sign of maturity to say that.

458
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,939
Yeah, we're,

459
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,770
we're aware of this problem

460
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,050
and a lot of companies I don't think, are aware of this problem or,

461
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,729
or they don't think, you know, the classic thing is, oh, why would anybody attack us?

462
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,810
Well, number one, they may not actually attack you.

463
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,510
It may be part of an automated attack like the, the,

464
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,260
the crypto malware stuff where it's like,

465
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,119
dude, we just let that stuff loose.

466
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,989
Like we just emailed it to 10 million email addresses and

467
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,640
like 1/10 of 1/10 of 1/10 of 1% clicked it.

468
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,920
And of those like 90% had antivirus that caught it and 10% didn't.

469
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,290
And so of that 10% now, you know, hopefully 1% pain.

470
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,760
We get like three bitcoins and that totally made it worth that email campaign

471
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,800
in the context of claiming nation state

472
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,119
activity.

473
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:08,709
That's not

474
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,709
like a random, let's just email a billion people. That's a very targeted event.

475
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,589
Right. Well, and that's what I'm saying is that, that

476
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,709
no longer applies like that, even that

477
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,390
random stuff quite often works. But, yeah, if you're targeted,

478
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,069
yeah, good luck.

479
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,510
Like,

480
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,770
you need to have a lot of resourcing and a lot of

481
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,709
discipline to build systems so that even if somebody is kidnapped or,

482
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,310
uh, compromised

483
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,630
or bribed

484
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,510
that

485
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,750
they still can't do the bad thing that the bad guy wants them to do. Right.

486
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,589
And I've been looking around and I haven't seen really any good

487
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,479
public resources for how you architect those systems.

488
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,550
You know, for example, like the two man rule, right?

489
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,750
Where you need two people to,

490
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,640
to actually do an activity versus just one person approving it.

491
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,030
Right.

492
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,550
-- Uh
-- Right.

493
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,619
And it, it, there are a few organizations that are probably ever going to do that.

494
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,459
And I think part of the challenge there is

495
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,910
how many, how do I say this?

496
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,599
It is often uneconomical to plan on that level and it is

497
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:10,189
actually more beneficial to acknowledge the risk and just take the hit

498
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,150
when it may, it may or may not happen.

499
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,589
And I, I don't know what Slack's plans are. In this case.

500
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,109
I, I can't say I have no insight into it, but it is, I mean, it's cool,

501
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,109
they list it as a risk, but at the same time

502
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,579
are how, how do you stop it?

503
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,459
And

504
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,739
I don't think you can to be honest.

505
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,239
Well, there's, there's some technical measures like, you know,

506
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,219
end to end encryption that would help and there would be other measures, like,

507
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:34,810
for example,

508
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,969
like code reviews just don't let people randomly

509
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,579
check code in and push it to production.

510
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,880
I would be shocked if they don't already have those sort of activities.

511
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,819
And that's the problem is a lot of the stuff is basic hygiene, but let's face it.

512
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,449
Not everybody has. Right.

513
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,449
And I, I'm assuming Slack does because their client doesn't completely

514
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,369
-- crash every other week. Uh
-- That's, I've never had their client crash on me actually.

515
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,910
-- Now that you say that, yeah, like,
-- yeah, it's reasonable quality.

516
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,949
So, but that goes back to that thing.

517
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,959
Like we know in the financial world we have certain

518
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,760
kind of guidelines and rules to help prevent financial

519
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,719
shenanigans like the two man rule or for example,

520
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,920
my favorite is you have to take two weeks off

521
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:13,369
so that if you have some sort of scam that requires constant feeding and watering,

522
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,729
like

523
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,719
backdating invoices or, you know, monkeying with floats

524
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,349
that

525
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,260
if you're away for two weeks and you can't keep the scam up, it,

526
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,609
it, it comes out, it becomes, you know,

527
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,150
-- it becomes obvious. Right.
-- Interesting.

528
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,890
-- I, I didn't know that.
-- Oh yeah.

529
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,469
No, there's a lot of scams that involve where you have to, you know,

530
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,229
for example,

531
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:33,069
you steal a bunch of money but then to cover up that the money is missing you know,

532
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,630
you keep

533
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,400
like the account has less money in it, but you keep enough in it.

534
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,109
So that actual transactions work

535
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,569
things like that where, you know,

536
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:41,689
it needs kind of constant care and watering or

537
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,130
you're shifting money from one account to another account.

538
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,989
So that, that account has the right amount of money when an auditor checks.

539
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,170
But, you know, a minute later it's like gone, things like that. Right.

540
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,810
So by making people take like a two week vacation,

541
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,280
you know, they, they, their scam hopefully falls apart a little bit.

542
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,550
Um, or,

543
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,739
you know, my favorite was they had a two man rule at this large bank,

544
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,000
but the copper trader and the person approving it or whatever were married.

545
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:08,430
Whoops. And that was, that was over a billion dollars.

546
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:09,869
Well, that's great.

547
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,660
Actually, here's a really important point is

548
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,760
you can put all the process you want in place

549
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:16,589
and

550
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,469
a motivated attacker can generally get around it.

551
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,819
And I think it's really important to always recognize that

552
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,979
the purpose behind most of these processes isn't

553
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:29,540
to stop a motivated and knowledgeable attacker.

554
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,680
It's really to make sure the normal people don't make dumb mistakes.

555
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,989
It's kind of like door locks aren't to keep up criminals.

556
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,079
They're to keep out opportunistic, honest people. Right.

557
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,310
That it's like, oh, I just lost my job and this door is open and look,

558
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,900
there's a pile of money on that table.

559
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,920
I, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna take it versus the criminals.

560
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,760
Like, yeah, I got a freaking crow bar. Like, who cares if they lock the door?

561
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,150
I'm not even checking, you know,

562
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,969
and, and that's,

563
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,719
I think we lose sight of that a lot where I go

564
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,119
through this on a regular basis where I talk to someone about,

565
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,479
ok, we need to do X

566
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,459
and it, it's, it turns into, well,

567
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,939
we have to build a rocket ship to go to the moon to get some rocks.

568
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,069
It's like, no, we don't need those.

569
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,420
Just, no, we like it just needs a lock on the door like that's fine.

570
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,780
We don't need moon rocks coating the door to keep out, you know, ghosts or whatever.

571
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,119
And, and I think especially in security,

572
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,849
we are so notorious for trying to over engineer everything

573
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,229
and, and it's kind of like the thing I keep saying

574
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:22,770
it

575
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,329
and if you look at perfect and nothing, they're the same.

576
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:28,270
And this is why because if you try to build the perfect system,

577
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,390
you end up doing no actual work because you've just spent all of your time and effort

578
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,619
concocting

579
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,949
a ridiculous ru Goler

580
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,810
-- machine that has no possibility of ever working.
-- Yeah.

581
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,150
No, I,

582
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,670
I was thinking about how would you prove that somebody in that

583
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,650
space and location actually owns or controls that space and location.

584
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,910
And the answer is

585
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,699
without a lot of work on a case by case basis,

586
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,790
you really can't so you have to kind of take people

587
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,859
at their word and kind of hope for the best,

588
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:53,770
which isn't great.

589
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,770
But you know, what else are we going to do? Right.

590
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,010
Have a public registry or something.

591
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,569
I, I don't think

592
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:00,250
we can.

593
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,689
So I guess here's the way I would frame this and we'll kind of close on this note is,

594
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:08,550
it seems poetic. We take the story we started with and we end with it. But

595
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,319
it's,

596
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,810
if this becomes a big problem,

597
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:17,089
then you're going to see some sort of intervention from a regulating body.

598
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,130
And I don't know what that even means and I don't know how it would end.

599
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,089
But as long as these scammers keep it low key enough,

600
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:26,280
it's always just going to be a couple of people

601
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,780
getting screwed and it's going to be one of those.

602
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.

603
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,849
It's like anything in the world where people don't care

604
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,010
until someone gets killed and the river lights on fire.

605
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,650
And I mean,

606
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:40,869
it's, it's,

607
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,349
that's where we're at with this is until enough

608
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,420
people get scammed or the right person gets scammed.

609
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,630
Because if like some politician gets nailed by something like this,

610
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,290
then it becomes really important,

611
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:50,890
right?

612
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,709
And that's like I always say this to people

613
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,219
when we go out for drinks or something like,

614
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:54,750
oh, we got it.

615
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,609
You know, how are we going to fix privacy and all this and that I'm like, look,

616
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,270
if you want to fix privacy, you just got to, like

617
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,430
a

618
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,739
Senator's Facebook account and it's going to get fixed overnight like that.

619
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,859
That's how you see change here because let's face it. They, they really don't care.

620
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,750
And, and I think it's a similar situation here is

621
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,560
II, I have a suspicion.

622
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,089
We're never going to see it fixed because it's probably not

623
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,229
going to get big enough to necessitate any sort of intervention.

624
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,550
And I guess at the same time,

625
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,050
this is where

626
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,790
if, if you're a person

627
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,989
kind of being put into a situation similar to this is, you know,

628
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,209
be mindful of what's happening.

629
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:30,930
If they're asking for dodgy payment methods, be careful of that. If,

630
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,829
if something doesn't smell right, trust your gut and,

631
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,709
and most importantly is when possible, make sure you're,

632
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:40,770
you're paying people with vehicles that are very official and

633
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,189
there's like fraud protection and recovery protection in many instances.

634
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,564
Yeah. Like, as we discussed credit cards, like, uh,

635
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:47,854
I, I'm now

636
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:50,925
just after having dealt with this one furniture store,

637
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,724
I'm so glad I use my credit card and I was able

638
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:55,084
to painlessly get my money back because I never got my couch

639
00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:58,305
and had I paid cash or with a debit card, I would have been,

640
00:25:58,314 --> 00:25:59,665
I would have had to go to the company.

641
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:00,574
Yep. Yep.

642
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:01,675
Exactly. You know, they're not getting

643
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:02,594
my money back

644
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:06,125
-- so,
-- well, it's not even, it's, it's also common where

645
00:26:06,324 --> 00:26:09,505
I forget I just, I had an incident the other day where

646
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,959
I, I had, I, I paid cash. It was like, it was some delivery.

647
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:17,790
It was a food delivery thing for an event where we ordered a bunch of food.

648
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,349
The guy showed up, I paid him in cash because usually cash is just easier.

649
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,069
And then I made the mistake of not having him sign my receipt.

650
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,939
And then basically, the company calls me up and this is,

651
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,810
it was literally three months later

652
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,670
and they said, oh, you didn't pay for this.

653
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,030
And I was like, I paid the delivery guy,

654
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,430
how did it take them three months for that to show up?

655
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,880
Like talk about we internal control.

656
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:39,005
I

657
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:42,854
have no idea how it took three months. But anyway, I talked to him for a few minutes.

658
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:45,234
I'm like, look, I paid this guy cash,

659
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:49,505
you know, I gave him a 10% tip. It's, I, I don't know what to tell you.

660
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:51,625
And they were actually really cool. They said, ok, fine.

661
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:54,114
I'll tell you what, you know, you've been good to us in the past.

662
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,275
We've never had a problem. I'm going to trust you here.

663
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,800
And of course, if it had, you know, if it happens again, they're going to be like,

664
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:03,089
yeah, you're, you're screwing us over, but it won't because from now on,

665
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:05,439
I'm going to have the delivery guy sign the receipt and, and you know,

666
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:06,790
specify I paid him.

667
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,130
Well, and it makes me laugh that somehow signing it would be this because,

668
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,349
you know, he could just sign with his left hand and be like, that's not my signature.

669
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,250
And this is honestly,

670
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,300
this is one of the reasons I love my ring doorbell because now I have for one year,

671
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,880
a little video clip of every single delivery to my house.

672
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,030
Yeah. And, and that's fair too.

673
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,270
I mean,

674
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,579
granted that that wouldn't have helped me because it wasn't in a

675
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:29,089
place that would be recorded even if I had a doorbell.

676
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:29,319
But

677
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:30,079
it's,

678
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,390
it's also,

679
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,510
I think the situation of even if the delivery

680
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,170
guy like tries to scam me out or something,

681
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,660
I think I have a stronger case talking to the company if I have a signed receipt

682
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,400
that has what resembles the name of the delivery guy because like, I don't know

683
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:44,265
his name was right.

684
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:48,005
I didn't ask him his name and in fact, I'll make him print it as well,

685
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:50,645
which I think would be beneficial, but whatever, it doesn't matter, it's,

686
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,286
well, you could just put John Smith

687
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:55,235
and then claim I never saw that or signed it. Right.

688
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:56,086
That's the thing you're forgetting, right?

689
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:59,926
He could just claim I have no idea what this is. This is not at all like my signature.

690
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:02,005
I'm willing to accept

691
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:02,826
that

692
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,485
the odds of that happened

693
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:07,932
are going to be drastically lower than what,

694
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:11,332
what was basically a bookkeeping mistake in this case, right?

695
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:15,011
Like a signature from the delivery guy will catch a bookkeeping mistake.

696
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:16,891
It will not stop a malicious delivery guy.

697
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:17,072
Well,

698
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:19,151
the most important thing is to remember is that this delivery

699
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,932
guy can only run this scam a handful of times.

700
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,562
Right. Yes, exactly. Hopefully before

701
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,099
somebody calls them out on it

702
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:30,089
because I, and I don't know what their non payment rates are and more to the point,

703
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:35,099
why did the delivery driver leave the food with you and leave without getting paid?

704
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:37,290
Right. Like that's the part of the story that makes no sense.

705
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,030
Well, no, no, that's normal. They, they, it's, it's

706
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,359
so it's this pizza place and they have like these big heated

707
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:46,770
containers and they drop you off the food in this heated container

708
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,170
and then you just pay them when they pick it up at the end. It's very normal.

709
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,439
Oh, ok. We do this all the time. Yeah.

710
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,140
Yeah, it's fine and,

711
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,400
and obviously I assume part of that story is

712
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,819
they want their containers back because they're very nice.

713
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:59,979
Ok. That makes sense.

714
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,060
-- Yeah. Yeah,
-- that it's fair. It's cool. Uh, anyway, anyway, any parting thoughts?

715
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:09,780
Well, just, you know, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. And

716
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:10,959
I

717
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,579
mean, ii I don't want to say like, oh, you should, like,

718
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,689
learn all the common scams because

719
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,839
the majority of people aren't going to do that.

720
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:19,349
But at the same time

721
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,319
I do teach my kids to look both ways when we cross the road,

722
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,709
even when it's at a crosswalk or a red light because

723
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,729
-- not all, you know, not all, all the car drivers may not be paying attention
-- and, and

724
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,109
I will, I will add one more thing to this closing thought is

725
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:36,329
someday

726
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,770
you're gonna get scammed

727
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,209
and it doesn't mean you're dumb.

728
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,339
-- It doesn't mean you're bad and it doesn't mean you deserve.
-- I've been scammed.

729
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,770
I mean, I bought a couch and they never delivered the damn thing.

730
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,010
And then they were like, they just, they were like, oh, sorry, well,

731
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,130
we'll get it eventually,

732
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,030
you know, delivery dates five months from now and I'm like, cool. I'm gonna call my

733
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,359
credit card company.

734
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,380
Yep. Yep.

735
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:00,000
And, and it, it happens sometimes and it sucks and you're just gonna,

736
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,800
sometimes you gotta, you gotta live with it, right?

737
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,959
