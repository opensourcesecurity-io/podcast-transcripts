Welcome to a special edition of the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,789
It's the news edition

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,010
coming to you live from the internet. It's myself, Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,709
-- and Josh Bresser
-- from the internet.

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:18,850
That's exciting.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,829
No, this is fun.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:20,299
Uh

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,110
We decided to do a special news podcast because

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,079
the last podcast we just did was kind of the, the open SSL show and there was honestly,

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,829
we probably could have talked about that for, for hours,

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,389
but we didn't wanna torture anyone.

11
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,659
So we decided it would make more sense to just

12
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:38,189
do two short shows instead of one incredibly long,

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,790
probably boring show.

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,869
So, Kurt, what's new man since, since yesterday? Right.

15
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:46,159
Uh New, since yesterday or new. More recently,

16
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,459
there's this one story I love to death and it is

17
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,090
the Canadian Mint.

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,029
Uh They make coins and commemorative gold coins and, you know,

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,229
all sorts of precious metals are smelted and minted into things

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,700
and one of their employees was caught stealing a whole

21
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:06,339
bunch of gold over a period of several years.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,480
And, and here's my favorite part. Well, there's two favorite parts.

23
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,230
I have number one. My favorite part is

24
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:12,889
his

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,290
current defense from his lawyer is that

26
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,290
my client didn't do it because the mint hasn't reported anything stolen

27
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:22,129
because their inventory control is so weak. They,

28
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:23,720
they haven't complained yet.

29
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,519
I'm gonna guess that's not a valid defense.

30
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:34,129
Well, but it does raise a question of how do you prove he's like, if,

31
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,690
if you can't account for these missing gold,

32
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:38,470
they're like apparently these gold pucks that are

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,949
round and apparently small enough that they fit

34
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,110
in certain parts of the human body.

35
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,769
I'm not gonna ask for details of that. But so here's fundamentally, the question is

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,080
I assume

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,970
-- they caught him with items on his person. Right?
-- No,

38
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:53,730
no.

39
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:54,970
You know how they caught him,

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,250
how

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,470
that

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,760
his bank became a little bit concerned because he kept

43
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,300
depositing these huge checks from a gold sales place.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,809
Like he would smuggle out a pack of gold, take it to the mall, sell it to a jeweler,

45
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,830
get it, uh, like get a check for it, like

46
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,059
a, a

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,970
cashier's check or whatever,

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,190
then he would take it to his bank account at a bank at the same mall

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,660
and deposit it. And these checks were like several $1000

50
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,899
and this was happening, you know, repeatedly over a period of a few years.

51
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,410
And the bank teller actually got a

52
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,139
little suspicious and concerned because she's like,

53
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:26,630
well,

54
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:27,619
hm,

55
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,460
he's depositing these big checks from the jewelry store

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,339
and I know he works for the mint.

57
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,570
Maybe I should tell our security officer.

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,940
So the,

59
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,029
the bank security officer got involved and of course they looked at this and went,

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,660
yeah, that, that looks really kind of weird.

61
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,820
So they told the mint and then the mint suspended him.

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,929
But as of yet, there's been no, uh

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,179
well, they haven't publicly stated how much was stolen or anything.

64
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:52,820
Now,

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,259
I will say this comes back to the human

66
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,820
angle of people often are good at seeing problems

67
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,380
that don't quite make sense

68
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,699
and, and this always comes up in news stories. But

69
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,970
man, this is, this is wild.

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,919
Well, it's also, it's one of those things to me where, you know, in hindsight,

71
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,800
connecting the dots, it's really obvious, right guy works at the gold mint.

72
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,740
Guy deposits big checks from a jewelry store on a regular basis.

73
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,309
You know, guy lives above his means.

74
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,940
But what really blows me is you think, I mean,

75
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,380
in general

76
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,160
banks and mining companies, people that deal with precious metals

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,529
are good at not getting robbed because we've, you know,

78
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,190
they've been being robbed for several 1000 years.

79
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,130
Yeah, I mean,

80
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,699
I would expect the mint to have some sort of inventory of what's going on.

81
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,720
And I will say that if they cannot show

82
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:46,399
that they're missing inventory,

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,910
they probably have multiple huge problems just like this. And this guy is

84
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,250
without a doubt.

85
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,539
Well, I shouldn't say without a doubt but it,

86
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,119
it's probably one of their smaller problems if I had to guess.

87
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:03,309
Well, and, but inventory can be very difficult, especially with, you know,

88
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,210
physical process because um I know firsthand account, um,

89
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,380
-- grocery
-- stores can do inventory

90
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,710
but they

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,160
don't have

92
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,059
those things have barcodes and gold doesn't have barcodes.

93
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,580
A perfect example of this is uh one of the local, well,

94
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,459
not local to me but local and Canada uranium producers

95
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,529
did a massive inventory after 911.

96
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,829
Right, because there was a whole bunch of panics about,

97
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,290
you know, these kind of things

98
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,670
and they came up several 100 kg short

99
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,410
and

100
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:32,230
uh well, of, of yellow cake powder uranium, right?

101
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,910
So stuff that had been started to be processed and wasn't fully processed.

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,190
Yeah. And, and of course, you know, oh my God, that's not good.

103
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,679
Well, it turns out it was the,

104
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,390
it was the exact same problem that remember in breaking bad,

105
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,109
right. There's just crud and junk collecting in the tanks at the bottom,

106
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,250
right.

107
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,559
So they started to basically open up these tanks and poke around the bottom of

108
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,910
them and they found all this built up crud and gunk and they're like,

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,890
oh, ok, there it is.

110
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,440
But the cost of cleaning it out, you know,

111
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,269
it's just such a nightmare to clean this stuff out there.

112
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,220
Just like, yeah, whatever

113
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,660
man,

114
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,029
that's close

115
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,630
enough

116
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,519
and that's industrial process for you.

117
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,809
Yeah. But when you're dealing with

118
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,049
valuable items,

119
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,660
whatever the definition of valuable is,

120
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,760
I think you,

121
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,540
if you're not paying attention to that degree. I, I feel like that's a failure.

122
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,350
Well, but if you're making money and you're, I mean, if, if the cost of the loss is,

123
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,799
is acceptable, then,

124
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,369
you know, grocery stores don't have perfect security people.

125
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,170
Like I know locally now, uh, there's a big thing with meat theft at grocery stores.

126
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,209
You know, people go in and steal meat and cheese because it's,

127
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:37,950
it's pretty expensive now too.

128
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,790
I mean, that's fair. That's fair. It's

129
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,730
so like Costco, for example, actually has an employee standing at the meat counter,

130
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,850
like just standing at the meat counter. I'm like,

131
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,640
just staring at all of us, you know.

132
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,420
Oh, my goodness. This,

133
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,420
I don't even know what to think of it. I mean, so on one side, I feel like

134
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,140
there's reasonable doubt.

135
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:02,559
Ok.

136
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,869
And, and obviously in, in any free society, you need that holy, guilty,

137
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,809
beyond a reasonable doubt.

138
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,279
But at the same time, if you work for the mint

139
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,489
and

140
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,119
you are consistently going to a gold,

141
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,720
um, purchasing company, I don't even know what they're called, you know,

142
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,769
gold dealer maybe.

143
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,480
And you're selling gold

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
regularly

145
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,880
and you can't explain to the investigators where did all this gold come from?

146
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,820
I keep selling,

147
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,320
I think there

148
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:34,010
that I, I, if I was on a jury, I would say that is a, a

149
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,250
reasonable doubt or rather isn't a reasonable doubt.

150
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,850
Like this person is almost certainly stealing from work.

151
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,059
It'd be like, if,

152
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,890
if, imagine if I was suddenly, you know, selling laptops

153
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,299
and,

154
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,510
and people are, like, where are these coming from?

155
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,100
And I just, whatever I'm finding them, you know? No, no, certainly not.

156
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,299
You're, you're probably stealing them from work and

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,440
you're bringing them somewhere and selling them. I mean, come on.

158
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,380
-- Nobody would even think twice about that.
-- Right.

159
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,579
Well, see, to me, I, I would say two arguments.

160
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,140
Number one,

161
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,130
if they can't actually prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he's guilty, then they,

162
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,440
they, they have failed. I mean, both the mint and

163
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:11,339
the police.

164
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:17,755
And secondly, I would say, you know, it's people will bring up, you know,

165
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,075
these slippery slope arguments.

166
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:22,864
Well, what if he has like a secret gold mine that he does want to disclose?

167
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,625
You know, what if

168
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:24,154
he has

169
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:24,515
a secret

170
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:24,825
stash

171
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:25,424
of Nazi?

172
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:25,934
No way,

173
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:26,665
no way, man.

174
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:32,154
Because if he has a secret gold mine or his secret Nazi gold stash or whatever,

175
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,945
like the goose that poops eggs,

176
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:38,934
you just, you show it to them. You say I have this, let me show you.

177
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,584
So I don't have to go to jail,

178
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:41,320
right?

179
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,380
You don't say, oh I have, you know, a magic death ray that,

180
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,980
that turns people into gold.

181
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,059
That no, that's not a defense. I mean,

182
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:51,279
you could make insane defenses against literally everything.

183
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,500
Then where it's like no, I

184
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,799
have

185
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,750
a transporter

186
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,119
-- and it transported the goods to my house. I didn't steal them. You know,
-- it's like,

187
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:57,429
no,

188
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,220
you know, that would be the job of the prosecution to disprove that.

189
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,260
You know, like I said, in my mind, as much like this case,

190
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,089
I hate to say, you know,

191
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,059
I,

192
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,929
to me innocent until proven guilty is a very important concept.

193
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,179
And in this case, you know, there's a big part of me that's like, yeah.

194
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,730
No, he's not innocent. Like he is definitely guilty. Like, come on

195
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:18,190
at

196
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,750
the same time, I wanna, you know,

197
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't want to lose that, that cornerstone of our justice system.

198
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,160
We're in such a rattle.

199
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,589
Let's do this.

200
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,410
Human beings

201
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,750
are the most effective

202
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,789
security mechanism we have today in many organizations.

203
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,400
Let's just leave it at that. Ok.

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,549
Well, and I think a big thing would be teaching people if you see something weird,

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,940
please mention it. You know, we get that all the time like with uh with sec

206
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,020
alert dot Red Hat, the product security team, right?

207
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:52,109
Where people will literally, I'll be on the phone with them and they'll be like, oh,

208
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,229
by the way,

209
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,390
our QE guy noticed this weird little thing and I'm like, oh my God

210
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,469
loosely sink ships, man.

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,390
Yeah.

212
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:03,989
And so, you know, it's, it's people spot things and please, you know,

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,390
mention it to somebody because

214
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,719
yeah,

215
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,940
it might be nothing and I would much rather deal with something that

216
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,640
turns out to be nothing than to have those things that are a problem

217
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,099
-- just quietly lurking.
-- It is true. It is true.

218
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,229
All right, let's, let's keep going. I, I love the next story about

219
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,599
plugging in USB sticks.

220
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,369
Yeah. Yeah. I, ah, jeez, I mean,

221
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,450
the, the whole USB thing, you know what, it really reminds me of his email,

222
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,539
remember 20 years ago where we were, like,

223
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,000
you know, a virus by email.

224
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,820
Well, don't open that dot exe and run it, you know, of course,

225
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,559
you can't get a virus from just receiving an email,

226
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,099
you know,

227
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,929
and of course now,

228
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,989
and, and it used to be true now it's really not true anymore. Um

229
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,450
And I feel like USB is the same way like it used to be like, yeah,

230
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,950
you can plug like random USB junk in your computer.

231
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,010
What could possibly go wrong? And now we have,

232
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:55,640
you know,

233
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,770
we have those guys who made those usb kill sticks

234
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,919
with capacitors that like taser your system to death.

235
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,609
Um And it even happens unintentionally.

236
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:06,809
Do you remember that guy, the Google guy that was testing all those USB C cables,

237
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,440
-- right?
-- And one of them like fried his laptop.

238
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,619
Yes.

239
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:16,159
II, I think about that all the time when I buy a new cable and I'm like, man,

240
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,549
I hope this doesn't ruin anything.

241
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,890
This is why I use an external USB hub,

242
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,539
right? Like, because I don't wanna fry the,

243
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,880
I don't wanna fry the USB ports on my computer.

244
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,809
So, ok, so we've definitely got the super malicious, like,

245
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,039
you know, taser USB key thing.

246
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:35,929
So, you know, and, and how do you test that right short of plugging it into something.

247
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,289
-- Um, then we've also got the USB keys.
-- You don't test that, you don't plug in

248
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,609
USB crap you find in the ground. I mean, there's been the,

249
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,229
all those,

250
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,200
uh, uh, studies done where people, like,

251
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,239
dropped a bunch of USB drives in a parking lot and something like 70% of

252
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,650
them got plugged in because they had malware on them that phone home essentially.

253
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:56,650
I mean, that's crazy.

254
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,280
Yeah. No, it's um

255
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,280
but I mean, we've been taught that it's safe to do this, you know,

256
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,200
because up until recently it has been safe to

257
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,690
USB.

258
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:06,440
I

259
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:06,710
think

260
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,320
it's human nature, it's

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,530
kind

262
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:09,929
of,

263
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,760
and, and additionally,

264
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,520
if you want me to do something, tell me not to.

265
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,950
So there's kind of that part of it too.

266
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,200
Yeah.

267
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:23,059
And then what's really interesting to me is those guys that manage to stuff a,

268
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,559
you know, a human interface device like a keyboard into a USB drive.

269
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,229
So that when you plug the USB drive into your machine,

270
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,270
it sends keyboard commands to your machine.

271
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,570
So like on a Windows machine, it would send, I think, what is it like a

272
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:39,280
command C or a Windows key C for the to open up a command prompt

273
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:43,549
and then it would like type in a bunch of shell commands like add a user,

274
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,960
make them privileged,

275
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:47,760
you know, and then like phone home to tell, you know,

276
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,719
the attacker that this computer now has,

277
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:54,599
-- you know, been compromised.
-- So here's the real question is, could you write

278
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,030
a

279
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,340
string of keyboard commands

280
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,580
that could work universally on Windows? Linux

281
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,679
and Mac Os

282
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,979
trick question, you don't have to,

283
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,159
right? Because you just, you just cycle through them.

284
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,710
Yeah.

285
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,969
But as a, a person sitting at the keyboard,

286
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,940
I might notice if it takes 10 seconds to cycle through.

287
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,000
Whereas if there's one string

288
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:17,830
and I mean, this,

289
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,809
this is obviously purely academic because no one's really gonna do it.

290
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,140
But, and let's face it too.

291
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,340
The vast majority of users are on windows,

292
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,900
right? If, if you're gonna target a platform, you're gonna target windows.

293
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,830
You know, I'm wondering if the USB key could be smart enough to recognize the USB.

294
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,919
Do the USB host hubs, don't they have like an identifier that they send?

295
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,700
Because I know USB devices that I plug in all have an identifier.

296
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,669
Ah, that's a good question. I have no idea

297
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,530
because in that case, you could just use that string to, you know, oh,

298
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:48,570
I'm talking to a Mac.

299
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,349
Send this, oh, I'm talking to a Well,

300
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,070
Adele send this.

301
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,739
It's interesting. All right. So, uh all you USB security researchers out there,

302
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,590
let us know how this works and, and uh send some demos to Kurt.

303
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,679
He'd love to test them out.

304
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:04,609
Yeah.

305
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,590
Yeah, I'll have to get a sacrificial laptop.

306
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,580
Right. Right

307
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,630
now, I will say though, there, there is one cool thing that's,

308
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,789
that's happening right now is, you know, you've got a note here about, you know,

309
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,109
glue the, the pork shop, which is still the best option without a doubt,

310
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,309
but there's something being worked on in Fedora right now called USB Guard.

311
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,549
And it lets you define policy for what you want to plug in.

312
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,690
And so, for example,

313
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,280
you could say that uh user Curt can't plug in USB

314
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,390
flash drives and user Josh isn't allowed to plug in keyboards,

315
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,369
which is, yeah, it's kind of cool actually.

316
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,130
And so, and not only that if you run the Applet, which I,

317
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,250
I have running because I've been, I've been doing,

318
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,859
I'm putting a presentation together that, that involves this is

319
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,450
when I plug in a USB device, it pops up a little window that says, you know, hey,

320
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,090
you're plugging in, you know, a joystick.

321
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:53,239
Is it a allow? And I remember type questions?

322
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,229
And so I can basically make it not work, which is kind of cool, but that of course,

323
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,010
doesn't solve the problem of

324
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,969
like literally malicious sticks that cook things, right?

325
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:07,280
Because if you have the, the fry, the computer stick in USB

326
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,650
is not gonna save the day there.

327
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,659
Yeah, I've kind of wondered about that because I mean,

328
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,409
it would be a great way for a computer store to generate business

329
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,169
moving on.

330
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:24,580
-- Please don't blame me if you do that,
-- please don't do that.

331
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:25,739
Yeah.

332
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,729
All right, man. What's next?

333
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:33,929
Well, I think the, uh, the terra bit denial of service from security cameras.

334
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:35,349
Oh, man.

335
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,109
-- The world's largest analog service attack. Thanks to security cameras.
-- That

336
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,390
man, it's,

337
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,630
well, security cameras are the start. Right.

338
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,419
It's,

339
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,099
it's going to continue to get worse just because there's so

340
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:53,190
much iot crap out there and a lot of it is Punt

341
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:55,950
or will be because it's never gonna see updates

342
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,239
and,

343
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,630
and this denial and, oh, man, I just, I don't even know to

344
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:01,359
even more.

345
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,440
It's not that it doesn't see,

346
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,909
it doesn't even see management or maintenance. Like,

347
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,460
uh, a friend of mine lives in a condo and they just had their, uh, a GM and

348
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,070
it turns out they spent 60 grand on their, uh,

349
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:15,320
their camera security system like 10 years ago

350
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,140
and now it's a potato.

351
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,140
Yeah, basically.

352
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,960
Like they, they actually had to post of, uh, uh,

353
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:26,659
an image of some guy who was stealing mail and it was potato quality.

354
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:28,219
Like, it was seriously,

355
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,239
quite, quite hysterically terrible.

356
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,590
Uh, but the point is this,

357
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,690
this system has been there for 10 years

358
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,099
and it is not like they have like an on site it, or, you know,

359
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,219
they're not like here's what's interesting to me.

360
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,969
-- Is,
-- is it hooked up to the internet?

361
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,719
Probably so you can check it remotely. Right.

362
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,340
Because how else are you going to check this?

363
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,140
And, but here's the thing that's interesting to me is there's, there's,

364
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,219
as far as I know, there's no legal requirement anywhere

365
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,239
in North America for security systems to have like, maintenance contracts.

366
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,729
Like, say, unlike things, like, say elevators or escalators where you, like,

367
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,559
in most jurisdictions legally have to have somebody maintaining it.

368
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,859
So it doesn't, like, kill anybody.

369
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,940
But as far as I know for security systems, there's no,

370
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,859
you know, people get home security systems all the time with monitoring but not

371
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,840
-- like a maintenance contract.
-- Yeah.

372
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:15,299
But your, your home security system isn't going to kill you when it stops working.

373
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,830
Well, if it doesn't, you know, sound the fire alarm, it might,

374
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,239
it has like a, a gun at the, at the door. Right.

375
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,500
But, uh, so, yeah, I mean,

376
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,849
the rea, I, I think, you know, these are, it always goes back to that lowest.

377
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:36,380
The problem I think is, so this denial of service went after Ryan Krebs's website.

378
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,929
And Krebs is a

379
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,500
security reporter who has

380
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,530
often

381
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,700
had the ire of the underbelly of security on his case.

382
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,510
And this guy, if you, if you look through his history, there are a number of

383
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,080
insane things that have happened to him

384
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,150
in the past,

385
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:55,309
right? And

386
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,049
he's a good guy.

387
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,849
So no one's gonna deny that.

388
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,280
But the bad guys don't like him because

389
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,710
he keeps showing people what they're doing and,

390
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,709
and that's I think historically speaking,

391
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,709
that is a common occurrence, right?

392
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:11,670
And so obviously some group of bad people decided to denial of services website,

393
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,750
which I still maintain

394
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,670
is a rather silly way to burn your botnet.

395
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,838
-- But I don't think it's burned
-- though.

396
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:20,159
That's the sad thing.

397
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:23,048
And we should actually have him on the show to interview.

398
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:23,848
But I know a guy,

399
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:27,568
Zachary Wilson who specializes or used to specialize in iot security stuff

400
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,909
and he would be sending out emails, you know,

401
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,269
because he worked for a large provider sending out emails

402
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,249
to these people that were denial of servicing them saying,

403
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:34,348
you know,

404
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,438
please like every single one of your uh hotels

405
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,958
in your hotel chain is like attacking our site.

406
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:40,889
Please, you know,

407
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,568
you have this device on your thing. I can tell from the signature. Please go fix it

408
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,030
and, or you know, hospitals or you know, universities and

409
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:54,250
you know, and the response rate is man, it's not 100% that's for sure.

410
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,829
Is it 10 percent?

411
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,510
Yeah. You know, so I mean, when you say burn up, I think

412
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,699
that's what really worries me about these new botnets is

413
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
you can use them.

414
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,030
And I mean, here's the thing, Josh, if somebody phones your grandmother

415
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,410
somehow gets a hold of her phone number and says to her, look, I have proof that you,

416
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,790
you have a bunch of IOT devices in your house that are attacking my network.

417
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,859
I need it to stop,

418
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:17,050
dude, my grandma,

419
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,839
like she had an old rotary phone.

420
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,709
Yeah. So she's actually safe.

421
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,770
But I mean, or even, you know, even a 20 year old,

422
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,780
you, you try and convince, you know, I mean,

423
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,930
ok, so that's fair if, if say

424
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,689
my neighbor

425
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,420
who is moderately technical

426
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,729
got a phone call from a random person saying, you know,

427
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,349
your it devices are attacking me.

428
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,349
He would say,

429
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,189
I don't know what any of the words you just said are

430
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,540
right and that that would be the normal response for most people.

431
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:52,390
And so that part is fair, but I can see the the problem here is so I would imagine

432
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,180
that

433
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:57,699
all of the activity directed towards Krebs has been locked.

434
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,790
And so now there is a large collection of IP addresses

435
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,140
and I think

436
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,949
the future

437
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,430
is going to be,

438
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,939
there are going to be known bad IP addresses and there are going to be blacklists.

439
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,859
And so as soon as your device makes it on a list like that, it,

440
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,069
that data is going to fall apart and be dropped.

441
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:15,569
Now,

442
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:20,030
one of the issues you're gonna have is things like the big routers on the internet

443
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,469
already struggle with memory pressure.

444
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,949
And so trying to add a big blacklist would be a challenge. But I think,

445
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,310
I think it is inevitable

446
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,229
that some sort of infrastructure ends up in place

447
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:34,219
that gives us the ability to essentially black hole

448
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,979
individual IP addresses because of stuff like this because this

449
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:39,989
is going to become a bigger and bigger problem.

450
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,189
I think.

451
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,869
I, I agree in theory, but my concern is that to properly, you know,

452
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,119
to properly block these attacks, you have to get as close to the source as possible.

453
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,430
Right. That's, that's where the blocking works best.

454
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,630
And the problem there is two fold. Number one, that's a lot of money,

455
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,170
you know, for these providers to spend on ids or IP S or whatever machines.

456
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,479
And number two,

457
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:02,920
it begins, you know, the, at least in the US and Canada,

458
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,369
they've always trumpeted their, their common carrier status.

459
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,449
You know, we just carry the traffic. We don't know what's in it.

460
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,130
We don't care, it's, you know what I mean? Unless it's music.

461
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,989
Yeah, or, you know, streaming video or

462
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,209
youtube or

463
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,410
any of those other sites that we're competing with.

464
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:17,560
And so

465
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:22,790
I think fundamentally, uh you know, unless there's some legislation that

466
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:26,160
the problem is the people, they're gonna end up eating the cost like Krebs,

467
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,569
you know, the industry,

468
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,310
like the ISP industry has historically shown that

469
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,530
they're ok with passing costs to random people.

470
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,130
I mean,

471
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,650
look at their attempts to claw back like this whole thing

472
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,109
with uh charging youtube to send traffic over their networks,

473
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,250
right?

474
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,979
And I was trying to explain to people they're like, oh,

475
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,709
it's not fair that youtube gets to send traffic for free over, you know,

476
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,849
my IP network and I'm like,

477
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,229
well,

478
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,170
that's not how that works because that,

479
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,140
that traffic was already paid for and they're like, well, who paid for it?

480
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,689
And I'm like, well, you did, you know,

481
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:53,780
you paid for the bandwidth that you then used and requested this service

482
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,910
and you're like, oh, right. Oh, yeah,

483
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm like, because it's not like youtube just randomly streams video to people

484
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:01,609
didn't ask for it.

485
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:01,920
This

486
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,530
connection is brought to you by Pepsi Cola.

487
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,359
Exactly. So, I think the unfortunate part is, uh,

488
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,579
as well, even if we had legislation and even if we had good blocking devices,

489
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,359
the rate of IOT is going to vastly

490
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,020
it's gonna grow faster than we can handle it.

491
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,180
Especially when you start thinking about things like, like driverless cars

492
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,469
and all the stuff on wireless networks that's physically gonna be moving around,

493
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:27,839
you know?

494
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:29,189
It's,

495
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,630
yeah, I mean, how do you do IP tracking when the IP S keep changing?

496
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,339
The bigger problem there will be with I PV six

497
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,839
is

498
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,300
you could potentially have a one terabyte blacklist

499
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,420
and that's not something that's going to be reasonable.

500
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,589
Yeah.

501
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,680
Yeah. Even if you do networks and not just individual IP S at the I PV six level.

502
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:51,930
That's,

503
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,349
yeah, it's just too much.

504
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,439
We're all doomed

505
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,839
and that is all

506
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,969
which I guess actually that brings us to, this is a good segue to the next story,

507
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:04,689
which is

508
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,719
something from Schneier

509
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,390
about the cost

510
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,550
of security

511
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,739
and the fact is that it sounds like

512
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:15,050
cyber attacks don't cost as much as a lot of people think.

513
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,050
And

514
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:20,489
I think one of the great challenges we have with security is justifying

515
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:21,729
what we spend

516
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,910
versus how effective it is. And today we kind of suck at that.

517
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,930
And this is one of the, the things where that it's, I think it's going to be solved,

518
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,060
but let's face it. You look at

519
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,920
virtually everyone out there

520
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,079
and their security isn't very good,

521
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:40,319
but like their business is still functioning for the most part, things are going ok?

522
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,390
And so, and, and ransomware falls into this,

523
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,520
it is generally cheaper to just pay the ransomware than

524
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,619
it is to actually have a proper security infrastructure.

525
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:49,949
I mean,

526
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:54,869
it as a security person, as much as it pains me to say this, that's kind of a no brainer.

527
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,750
And if the bad guys are smart,

528
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,949
they're going to make sure that whatever it costs to

529
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:03,170
deal with what they're doing is less than doing security,

530
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,699
right?

531
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,069
And if they keep that in mind and I think they

532
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,739
are because these guys are like they're running a business now.

533
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,310
I suspect they're gonna keep this in mind

534
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,810
and it is going to mean that security will always be starved for funding,

535
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:20,589
which by definition means that the bad guys will always be ahead in this game.

536
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,969
Yeah, my concern there is, you know, you enter into that dimension where,

537
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,560
ok, economically. Yeah.

538
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:30,089
Maybe it's cheaper to deal with $10 million a year in fraud

539
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,040
than it is to spend $100 million a year preventing it.

540
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,000
But

541
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,069
then you potentially end up like,

542
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,750
so a great example is kidnapping in the US and Canada, right?

543
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,729
It just doesn't happen very often

544
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,989
because the police and especially the FBI made it

545
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,359
impossible. Right? They will track you down to the ends of the earth.

546
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,209
Even if it's not economically viable,

547
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,010
they will do it because kidnapping is not a problem in the US and Canada right now.

548
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,489
And you look at other countries like some

549
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,680
South American countries or some Eastern European countries,

550
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:56,949
right?

551
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,689
And, you know, it's an endemic problem, right?

552
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,040
And that's kind of my concern is that I don't

553
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,430
want the internet to be this place where it's like,

554
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,520
oh, you got kidnapped?

555
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,949
Yeah. Ok. Fine. We'll push lunch back to 2 p.m.

556
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,540
-- You know,
-- your, your analogy breaks down

557
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:13,859
because

558
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,900
imagine if someone from Russia could kidnap you without going to Canada first.

559
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,079
And that's the internet.

560
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:21,920
Yeah. Oh,

561
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,739
totally.

562
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,349
And I mean, and until we get, you know, International Cooper,

563
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,939
that will always be the case.

564
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,500
You know, and, and the reality is we never will have true International Cooper,

565
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:34,819
-- right? Because all these countries hate each other.
-- Are you familiar with the UN?

566
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah, exactly.

567
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,250
So

568
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:41,689
then, and, and so I, you know, the realist,

569
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:44,420
the realist in me has to acknowledge that and

570
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,939
say, Well, you know, reality often isn't how we want it to be. So, and

571
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:53,099
it is the way it is. So, you know, how do we productively deal with the way it is? And,

572
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,770
and quite honestly, like you said, I mean,

573
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,199
yeah,

574
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,469
paying the ransomware guys might be the best way to

575
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,910
deal with reality being the way that it is currently.

576
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,150
You know, you know what the, the true stink in me always comes back to is

577
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,180
I, I,

578
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,880
are we going to reach the point

579
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,800
where

580
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:12,540
the ransomware

581
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,670
we'll say company

582
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,280
has

583
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:18,079
when you pay the ransomware,

584
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,469
they also guarantee one of their competing ransom wares won't be able to get in

585
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:26,619
and infect your system because you're now paying them the protection money

586
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,199
to

587
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:27,900
the

588
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,109
recurring revenue streams. I mean,

589
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:31,339
how

590
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,339
do you think that, that,

591
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:38,520
that may be a reasonable conclusion to this whole crazy universe of ransomware?

592
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,920
Do you know what it sounds like you've

593
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,439
just described to some degree as the antivirus?

594
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,579
I know, I mean,

595
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:49,079
quite frankly what you know, like,

596
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:49,959
yeah.

597
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,920
Yeah, I just,

598
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,219
uh, I, I pity, I pity normal internet users.

599
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,250
And quite frankly, I think this is one of the reasons I'm at the point where,

600
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:01,520
you know, when people ask me what computer should I buy and I'm like a smartphone.

601
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,160
Well, although like chromebooks are pretty solid. These

602
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:05,959
trees, my,

603
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:10,760
my son just got one at school and I'm impressed by how usable the thing really is.

604
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,010
Yeah,

605
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,750
I think that's a lot of the future because the reality too is these,

606
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,910
these devices are actually quite powerful now.

607
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,579
Right. Like,

608
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,040
I mean, it's true,

609
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,689
you know, I, I'm doing web surfing on my phone.

610
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:27,229
I can ssh from it, I can run, you know, games that have slight 3d capabilities.

611
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:27,819
I mean, it's,

612
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,770
you know, this thing has like, 32 gigs of storage, I think.

613
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,530
I don't even know or care anymore.

614
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:35,959
Like, just don't get the 16 gig one is the only rule I have,

615
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,160
you know, never buy the 16 gig.

616
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:39,369
Yeah, exactly.

617
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,449
How much free space do you have on your phone? Who cares?

618
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:43,050
Yeah.

619
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:43,650
I

620
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:49,709
mean, my favorite of this is, uh, I got someone, um, a Cobo

621
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:50,439
Ereader

622
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,750
and it's got like two gigs of built in storage and an SD card slot.

623
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,260
And I'm like, why, why do I need an SD card slot?

624
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:59,359
Like two gigs of text books is

625
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,689
-- more than I'll ever read in a lifetime. But
-- people love that stuff.

626
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:06,760
People like their SD slots. All right. I have, uh, 15 gigs free

627
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,640
on my 32 gig phone.

628
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,390
So, yeah, I have, I have no idea.

629
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,650
Whatever

630
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:13,449
it works. Don't

631
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:13,660
care.

632
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,479
Yeah. So, no, I think I,

633
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,469
and, you know,

634
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:19,449
because there was also an FBI report I read a long time

635
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:23,130
ago talking about how we'll probably never have a crime free society because

636
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:26,369
even if you can make crime,

637
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:30,250
not pay which, in many cases, you know, for a lot of crime, it really, like,

638
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,709
like that whole thing with drug dealers that earn less than minimum wage, you know,

639
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,369
they'd be better off going to mcdonald's.

640
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,040
Um,

641
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,040
but there's just that certain

642
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,160
elements and groups and people in society that will think it's,

643
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,040
it's a better way to make a living by, say,

644
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,260
shoplifting and selling meat on the corner.

645
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:48,079
Uh, you know, or, you know,

646
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:50,579
those guys that sell speakers out of the back of a van because like,

647
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,420
honestly how much money can those guys make?

648
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,920
Like

649
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,270
it can't be a lot.

650
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,199
And so you know that,

651
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,239
but these people will continue doing that and we just

652
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,790
have to live with it and minimize it where possible.

653
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,650
Yeah, that's, I mean, heck man, even in Star Trek,

654
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,079
there are villains,

655
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,729
right? People committing crimes.

656
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,670
It's

657
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,560
although, although

658
00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:13,510
I wonder if we had

659
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,050
kind of the post

660
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,550
scarcity economy where you had something like maybe a universal basic income or,

661
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,500
you know, easy access to goods, what that will do to crime?

662
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,520
I think it would definitely help because, you know, a lot of crime is,

663
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,829
it's not people being evil, it's people being desperate and needing money,

664
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,469
you know, for their,

665
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:38,530
for their drug habit or their alcohol or, but the challenge is there's, there's,

666
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,989
again, there's people, for example, people with a gambling problem,

667
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,530
right? You can give these people a billion dollars

668
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,589
and they'd burn through it,

669
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,349
I mean, well, like a classic example, like, look at all these lottery winners,

670
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:48,589
right?

671
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,819
These people win the lottery and they just wreck their lives, you know,

672
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,170
something like 80%

673
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,380
end up going bankrupt or something stupid. Like, it's just horrifying.

674
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,400
Well, I mean, I guess

675
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,209
now on that note though, like,

676
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:05,290
if you're the kind of person who plays the lottery in the first place,

677
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,459
you probably don't

678
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,329
have the ability to make good decisions on a regular basis.

679
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,689
I mean, let's just face that. Right.

680
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,540
Well, you're not,

681
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,989
you're not definitely not making good statistical decisions

682
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,890
and probably not good long term decisions.

683
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,489
And yeah, and I mean,

684
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,130
these things matter when you have like a million or a billion dollars to deal with.

685
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,310
And,

686
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,750
and so I think the reality is with a post scarcity economy.

687
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,130
It would have to also be combined with things like mental health care.

688
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,829
Uh you know, some sort of new drug policy, new new crime policies.

689
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,130
Um because, and then the thing is to remember too, there's also crime, you know,

690
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:39,760
there's crimes of passion, there's crimes of, you know, having power over people

691
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,560
and no amount of money or goods will, will solve that.

692
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,709
Yeah, I mean, that's fair. That's fair.

693
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,390
So

694
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:47,369
in summary,

695
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:48,689
we have no idea.

696
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah,

697
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,319
that is all.

698
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:54,530
Yeah, I, I think the biggest thing, you know, honestly,

699
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,530
the biggest reason I wanna see basic income

700
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,579
is an end of bureaucracy,

701
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,119
whatever man,

702
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,880
you know, they're gonna find a way to make it crazy.

703
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,650
Hopefully not. But, uh,

704
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:07,719
yeah, I mean,

705
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:10,780
because when you think about what poor people have to go through to get the,

706
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,479
the help and the assistance that they need,

707
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,560
you know, like, think about computer users, right? The same thing, right?

708
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,449
Like somebody, my laptop's slow,

709
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,619
right? Oh, ok. I need to go.

710
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,609
Yeah.

711
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,839
You know, I need to, you need to malware bites it.

712
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:24,930
You need to antivirus it, you need to a

713
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,250
block it. You need to.

714
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:26,979
Yeah.

715
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,170
Yeah. So,

716
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,319
you know, and, and quite often the new laptop is actually

717
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,689
cheaper now than like two or three hours of a technician's time.

718
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:36,530
-- Seriously,
-- man,

719
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,020
especially if you're using something like a chromebook

720
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,750
which ironically will probably have far fewer problems.

721
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,130
But,

722
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,160
yeah, I mean, chromebooks are what, like, 2 5300 bucks usually and

723
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,089
paying a dude to look at your computer is probably 100 bucks an hour at least.

724
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,500
Yeah.

725
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,520
Yeah.

726
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,239
I've, uh, the last time I actually had to get a computer fixed, I looked online and,

727
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,359
yeah, and I think it was 100 and $50

728
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,319
was sort of the, the cheapest,

729
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,400
like,

730
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:03,859
like

731
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,719
there were places that were cheaper but they were pretty dodgy looking, you know,

732
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:09,109
like, it was like a guy

733
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,030
with

734
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:10,910
Drake

735
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,969
and computer repair.

736
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,079
Yeah. Well, or, you know, probably a student or something. Right.

737
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,489
Trying to make some money on KGG. That's the Canadian version of Craigslist.

738
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,930
So, just to clear that up

739
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:22,369
because nobody outside can,

740
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,180
yeah, nobody outside. Yeah, Craigslist, like, just cratered out in Canada.

741
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:26,469
So,

742
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,479
Gigi even mean,

743
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,959
what does

744
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,819
Amazon mean?

745
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:31,400
What is,

746
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,119
-- well, ok. Craigslist is actually crazy. How do I,
-- how do I spell

747
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,510
this? I

748
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,390
want to look this up.

749
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:36,910
Uh, hang on a sec. I don't know.

750
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:38,410
Uh, I just,

751
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:39,969
I just, I start typing,

752
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,479
start typing KJKJ, I into Google

753
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,520
and it'll figure it out. I'm sure.

754
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, K

755
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,319
looks like Kijij. I

756
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,319
pres in Canada.

757
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,459
Yeah,

758
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,199
it looks

759
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:55,380
a

760
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,810
lot like Craigslist.

761
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,760
It's

762
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:58,199
basically

763
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,300
the exact same thing.

764
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,109
I'm not sure. That's a good question.

765
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,589
I wouldn't be surprised if they do.

766
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,060
Uh, is there an, about,

767
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,900
about

768
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:08,589
Kaji?

769
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:10,540
Pronounced

770
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,750
kgggggg?

771
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,099
Oh, it means Village in Swahili.

772
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,109
And,

773
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,079
yes,

774
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:25,410
reading websites on a podcast is by far one

775
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,270
of the more interesting things you could do,

776
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,479
but

777
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,689
55% of Canadians use

778
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,280
GGG on a monthly basis.

779
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,430
Wow,

780
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:33,930
it's

781
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,160
a

782
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,310
lot, it's a fully owned subsidiary of ebay.

783
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,459
-- Ah, I see. So
-- that

784
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:40,959
makes sense.

785
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:43,329
Making sure Craigslist stays out.

786
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:44,400
Yeah.

787
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,819
But, uh, yeah, it's weird to me these regional variations. Like

788
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:51,000
all, no, we're not going down this rat hole. I'm gonna stop us now.

789
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:53,920
I

790
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,640
don't want to know we're gonna end up if we, if we start talking about this. But,

791
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,390
all right, man.

792
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,890
What else are we gonna talk about? A few other stories here?

793
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:05,229
Uh, let's see. I think there was, well, there was someone, it's not.

794
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,199
Oh, here's another good one. The world of vnc.net.

795
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,819
Uh this is very iot related.

796
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:12,709
Yeah.

797
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,000
So I don't know if um well, let's back up a, a step first.

798
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,199
Uh I don't know if our, our listeners have heard about Show Dan Shodan.

799
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,550
Uh but show Dan is basically a search engine

800
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,349
that goes looking for stuff on the internet and by stuff, I mean,

801
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,310
like servers and cameras and you know, network attached storage devices

802
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,030
and it offers a really nice search interface and that you can basically go like,

803
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,589
I want to see all of like this model of network

804
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,640
camera from some company because I know it has a flaw

805
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,680
and world of VNC is an even more specific one where basically they, I mean,

806
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,050
because the reality now is you can scan the entire I PV four space of the internet in,

807
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,209
you know, several tens of minutes off of a fast connection, right?

808
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:57,290
So scanning for, what is it? I think port 5900 by default for VNC.

809
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,530
And so it's BNC is

810
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,290
uh

811
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:03,260
stands for virtual network computer and it's

812
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,969
basically like remote desktop for computers.

813
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:06,760
And

814
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:06,900
so

815
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:09,668
when

816
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:09,938
that came

817
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,340
out,

818
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,570
uh I remember when it was like,

819
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,320
yeah,

820
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,530
some AT&T lab in the UK came up with it and gave it away for free or something.

821
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,090
I don't know so long ago.

822
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,478
And yeah, so anyway,

823
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:24,149
so these guys basically trolled the entire internet for VNC servers and then,

824
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,929
you know, made a search engine for them

825
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,728
and like these,

826
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,909
I mean, some are, you know, ok, it's like a,

827
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,570
it's like a restaurant point of sale system or it's, you know,

828
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:35,129
but some of them are like, mildly terrifying, you know,

829
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,409
like building control systems and,

830
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:38,409
you know,

831
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,250
just all sorts of random stuff and what I love is they have these screenshots,

832
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,719
you know, and you can, it's just so

833
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,478
it's like those, uh, search engines for people's cameras in their homes, you know,

834
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,149
and you can just watch people sleeping.

835
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,270
So

836
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,770
you bring that up and I,

837
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,770
I'm browsing these screenshots and I just hit one that is clearly

838
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,510
someone's like home entertainment system and it shows a picture of their car

839
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,429
which I assume is a security camera pointed at their car outside.

840
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:04,659
Awesome.

841
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
Yeah. So,

842
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:10,709
yeah, because there was a recent thing in the paper actually where some lady was on,

843
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,149
decided to look for one of these, um,

844
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,610
for some reason was looking at one of those, you know, uh,

845
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,189
camera search engine things

846
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:22,959
and, uh, found, uh, like a bedroom with some furniture she recognized as being like,

847
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,429
you know, from, um, like a local brand or something

848
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,689
and then, you know, posted it to Facebook and it turns out, you know,

849
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,510
somebody's baby monitor or whatever.

850
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,510
Um, you know, just,

851
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,360
but, uh,

852
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,459
not like I know a friend of ours they just had

853
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:37,760
a baby and she posted a picture of herself at Starbucks

854
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,360
with what looks like a little tablet.

855
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,189
And it's a, it's a specific, like it's a tablet specific to her

856
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,439
baby camera

857
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,290
so she can carry this little tablet device

858
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,280
around and watch her baby sleeping at home.

859
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,929
Well, obviously this thing is talking to me and I'm sure that is.

860
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,179
I, you know. Yeah.

861
00:35:56,189 --> 00:36:00,100
And I, I, how do you even begin to explain to somebody, you know, that like,

862
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,540
-- well, so
-- it's even more than that.

863
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,669
I was at a security conference this summer and of course, they've got, you know,

864
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,219
like the wall of sheep where they're,

865
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:09,659
they're sniffing all the internet traffic and all that kind of stuff

866
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,260
and somebody connected to their home

867
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,330
security system and was streaming video and so you could see

868
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,969
the video what's happening in their house on the screen.

869
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,060
It's like this is a freaking security conference.

870
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,419
Like what the hell's wrong with you people?

871
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,669
Like, if there's no hope of security guys, everyone else is doomed. End of story.

872
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,020
Yeah.

873
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,459
I, I sometimes wonder, you know, like people are frustrated that for example, both,

874
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:32,979
you know,

875
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:34,860
Apple and Windows are sort of taking away a bit

876
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,300
of choice and a bit of control from consumers.

877
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,540
And

878
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,100
for example, Windows is apparently now going to be forcing updates on people.

879
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,739
And part of me is like, you know,

880
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
I have no problem with that.

881
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,419
Yeah, I'm not so sure. That's a bad thing.

882
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,739
I mean, it, it kind of sucks if you have software that fails. But, um,

883
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,899
no, however, I would imagine if you're an enterprise customer,

884
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,590
-- you have the ability to disable that
-- functional.

885
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,060
You do as an enterprise customer.

886
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:02,179
But think about all those, the people who, for example,

887
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:05,189
bought like AC NC milling machine with a windows machine attached to it.

888
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,649
Uh, you know.

889
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,790
Yeah, I mean,

890
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,290
if it's on the internet though, which it obviously is,

891
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,949
if it's receiving automatic updates,

892
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,040
you need to update that stuff.

893
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,570
Right? And, and especially

894
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,439
in the case of like a piece of actual physical gear,

895
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:26,669
somebody could get hurt or die if there is a malicious insider in the device.

896
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,729
So I totally am ok with that.

897
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:29,189
Of course,

898
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,149
I'm sure it's running some software that's never going to be updated and it,

899
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,639
it's beyond terrible as far as security goes, but it at

900
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,550
least windows will be ok.

901
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:38,540
Yeah.

902
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,229
Yeah.

903
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,949
And, and part of me thinks it's kind of like the whole vaccination argument,

904
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,629
you know, like,

905
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,459
unless you have in my mind some very specific medical reason not to vaccinate

906
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,189
you, you have to vaccinate

907
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,870
that, you know, that's just part of living in polite society.

908
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,370
You're gonna get so much hate mail. Now,

909
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,770
-- I agree with you. But mail curt everybody, not
-- me.

910
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,959
Yeah, I just found the weirdest thing on the VNC browser, by the way,

911
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,090
a Linux machine booting

912
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,260
the actual text part of it.

913
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,889
Ok.

914
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,459
No, I, I wonder if it could be,

915
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,250
or it could be something like when you connect to this port,

916
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:21,449
turn on the computer sort of thing. Right. Like, like a sort of port knocking magic

917
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,260
to

918
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,550
boot

919
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:23,020
the

920
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,810
boot screen. It's not completed booting.

921
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,310
Right. Right. No, no, I'm saying. Oh,

922
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:29,699
but I seen one here that says booting from hard disk, boot field. Not a boo,

923
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:30,300
I

924
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,659
keep clicking through. This is like fascinating. Um I

925
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:32,780
know

926
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:33,739
it but, but

927
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,370
if I had to guess

928
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:37,719
and this is something I think about a lot actually is

929
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:42,550
what, what if you set up a system? So when you connect to it, it turns on

930
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,719
and,

931
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:47,340
and I especially want this for Minecraft servers because

932
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,300
my kids have a bunch of Minecraft servers and

933
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,610
I keep thinking what if I put them all

934
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,060
in a container or rather one container per server

935
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:54,919
and then set it up because you, you know,

936
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:58,959
I think this is possible with system D which is everyone's favorite in it system

937
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,120
but have system D

938
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:03,320
well, it does basically the same thing

939
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:05,419
but when you can, right, you connect to the port,

940
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:08,850
it spins up the container starts the Minecraft server and then

941
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,149
you play your, your, you know, do your thing.

942
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,379
And then obviously after there's a certain amount of no connections,

943
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,689
it just powers it down.

944
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:20,070
OK? So I have to say this because it's too perfect a marketing opportunity.

945
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,090
But Openshift Enterprise does exactly this.

946
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,879
Uh, yeah.

947
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:26,649
Ok.

948
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,649
-- That's cool.
-- But it might be overkill for your needs.

949
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,649
It is probably overkill for my needs.

950
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:34,209
And, like, I, I know certain things can do this kind of stuff,

951
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,770
but I'm also more just because I'm weird.

952
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,929
I want to do it myself. Right. I don't,

953
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,889
I don't want to let someone do it for me because my time is obviously worthless.

954
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:45,169
It's funny because to me, I, I've gone the opposite way.

955
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:45,340
Like,

956
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,739
I'm seriously considering getting my kids Xbox accounts so that they can play

957
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,550
Minecraft on Microsoft servers and I just don't have to deal with anything.

958
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,290
And part of me is just, like, feel so icky.

959
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,370
-- And then another part of me, it's just like, I
-- don't have to

960
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:57,540
do

961
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:57,840
that

962
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:01,719
though. I mean, it's, it's expensive enough that I am too cheap

963
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,889
to get it

964
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:04,800
if,

965
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,949
if I, I just, and the thing is too, like,

966
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:10,409
my kids will play Minecraft for a month like crazy.

967
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:12,449
And then they take two months off and they don't touch it again.

968
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:14,010
And so I'm not paying Microsoft

969
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,729
for nobody to be using their stuff. Right.

970
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:18,860
Yeah.

971
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:19,699
Yeah.

972
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,100
Yeah.

973
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,489
No, it's the whole, these,

974
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,179
these economics of security are tough because the other thing

975
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,169
and I don't know if you saw that email but,

976
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,679
uh, somebody was asking me about,

977
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,739
um,

978
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,350
sort of the science behind information security and I was like, we don't have any.

979
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,239
I mean, we don't even have a basic vocabulary, let alone

980
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,199
I think saying we have witch doctors would be optimistic at this point.

981
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,280
Oh, that would be such an improvement.

982
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,800
And you know, I I've done some writing on this in the past is

983
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,149
this is one of the challenges we have.

984
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,760
We have a number of experts in this field and, and you and I

985
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:59,510
are familiar with this is where did, how did we start?

986
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,870
We started with pain and suffering is everything we learned.

987
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:06,310
We essentially had to teach ourselves. There were very few people to talk to

988
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,979
that you could learn. I mean, there were a handful, right? Don't get me wrong. But

989
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,590
fundamentally,

990
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,770
we taught ourselves almost everything we know and

991
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,770
it is a lifetime's worth of knowledge.

992
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,070
And this isn't the sort of thing that like if a

993
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,419
new person wanted to start and they were saying in their,

994
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,989
their middle of their life or the middle of their career

995
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,780
and they said I want to be a security guy,

996
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,929
I'd be like,

997
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,520
like good luck. I, I don't know what to tell you.

998
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,850
There's just, there's not an easy way to do this stuff.

999
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,530
And when you're young and you have

1000
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,419
in your limitless amount of time,

1001
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:38,389
you can spend a week learning how buffer overflows work and

1002
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,340
learning how to write shell code and all this stuff.

1003
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,610
But like at this point in my life, if I have to learn a new skill.

1004
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,389
There's not a lot of time to do it,

1005
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,429
right. It is definitely a challenge.

1006
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,350
But however,

1007
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,169
now I will say that this is a huge problem security has I think is

1008
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:56,870
we do not have a nice way to pass our knowledge to the next generation.

1009
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:57,959
Well,

1010
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,159
especially

1011
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,969
termites do this

1012
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:02,010
and we don't.

1013
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,370
Well, what's frustrating to me is we have,

1014
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,239
there's a huge number of certifications around, for example,

1015
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,729
development and system administration and stuff that are actually pretty decent,

1016
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,169
you know,

1017
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:16,929
um, in the windows ecosystem in the red hat ecosystem

1018
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,550
in the security ecosystem,

1019
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,530
we have some sort of these sort of more generic if you will,

1020
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
things like the Cissp, which don't get me wrong.

1021
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,889
I actually am really glad I wrote the Cissp about a decade, decade and a half ago

1022
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,219
because it gave me the sort of management view of security, right?

1023
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:37,760
Because I mean, part of the problem is the technical side of security is so

1024
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,429
it's changing constantly.

1025
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,270
And, you know, for example,

1026
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,520
what's available to an enterprise customer versus what's available to, you know,

1027
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,780
a small business versus what's available to your,

1028
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,840
your friend who has a laptop that they want to use to get work done.

1029
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,040
You know, I, I don't, there's not one set of advice that, you know, fits for all,

1030
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,760
apart from some very basic,

1031
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,709
you know, things like, uh,

1032
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,330
maybe don't send money to those guys in Nigeria that you know,

1033
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:06,820
need some help out freeing up that, you know, shipment of gold or whatever.

1034
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:08,100
Yes.

1035
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:08,750
And

1036
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:10,000
I mean,

1037
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:11,760
so you made a point

1038
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,899
and at the beginning of, of what you just explained that I think is important is

1039
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:20,370
the knowledge we have isn't good for very long,

1040
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:22,479
which makes it very difficult to teach

1041
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,199
and it's very temporal

1042
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,050
now at the same.

1043
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,090
And I guess so here's,

1044
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,090
here's where my thought process always goes is things like having an Rh

1045
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,169
Ce or having an M CS E or whatever Microsoft calls it now

1046
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,409
is that is very similar where every couple of years they need to update what's

1047
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:43,729
going on and what you learned say five years ago isn't necessarily valid today.

1048
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,719
Security kind of has its problem as well.

1049
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:49,550
But I think one of our challenges is it's already

1050
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,870
such a small group of people that have this knowledge

1051
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,909
and most of them for one thing are, are just bad at talking to other people.

1052
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,189
And I'm comfortable saying that,

1053
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:00,620
but

1054
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,520
who's going to build the information

1055
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,879
that's going to teach the next group of people

1056
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,020
and you need to constantly update that and constantly add to it.

1057
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,500
And so that's kind of the challenge there. And

1058
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,399
now

1059
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,459
I'm not gonna say it's impossible because I think we need to figure this out,

1060
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,939
but I do not know how we can do that in a reasonable way.

1061
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,199
And of course, there's always people who talk about, oh well,

1062
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:24,820
this university is doing this or there's this certification here,

1063
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,090
there's this training program here.

1064
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,629
And I'm not,

1065
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:28,379
none of those are bad.

1066
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,260
But if you look at the people who are truly leading this industry,

1067
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,100
like that's not where they started.

1068
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,600
And I think a lot of this stuff has been around long enough that if

1069
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:41,439
it was truly effective at conveying knowledge and the way we need it done,

1070
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,300
we would see more leaders

1071
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,840
and more, I guess just impressive talent

1072
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,560
that talk would talk about, hey, this is where I came from, but I,

1073
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,639
I have not yet seen an instance of that and if someone can prove me wrong, please do.

1074
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,080
I would love to know.

1075
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,399
Well, you know, recently this reminds me of,

1076
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:58,709
I started watching woodworking videos on youtube

1077
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,600
and there are amazing woodwork like how to make

1078
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,219
a dovetail joint like a 10 minute video where

1079
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,879
not only do they talk about like how you do

1080
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:09,659
it in the basics but like all those hidden gas,

1081
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,719
like talking about how you can dry the wood out so that

1082
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:14,639
you can then fit the wood together and then let it,

1083
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:15,070
you know,

1084
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:17,729
come back up to whatever level of humidity is

1085
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,610
normal.

1086
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,330
You know, all these little tricks and tips that, you know,

1087
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,719
it's that extra five or 10% that really,

1088
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:27,590
you know, that's what makes people an expert, right? And, and so, but this is like,

1089
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:29,030
and we don't have anything like that.

1090
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,040
Well, but now in defense of us, wood working has been around for, you know,

1091
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,310
a couple of 1000 years.

1092
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,709
So they have that going for them, right.

1093
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,360
But I, I also think that it is,

1094
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,610
it could be worth saying that there are

1095
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,550
some fundamentals of woodworking that have always existed,

1096
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,409
right? Like

1097
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,860
you could take a guy from 200 years ago

1098
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,560
who was a, a professional woodworker

1099
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,290
and they understand certain rules about how it works

1100
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,209
right now. If you handed him a table, saw he'd chop his arm off. Right. No,

1101
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,719
no questions asked.

1102
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,899
But there's still some fundamentals.

1103
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:03,080
And you could take a woodworker from today,

1104
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,570
a woodworker him 200 years ago and

1105
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,560
they could probably have a meaningful discussion.

1106
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,000
What is the thing in security that binds us all?

1107
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,629
And I don't think we can easily answer that today, but that's,

1108
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,550
that's what we need to find out and that's what you need to learn.

1109
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,979
And then the rest, once you have that,

1110
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:23,030
that foundational knowledge you can build on top of it.

1111
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,020
But we don't even know what that is today because

1112
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,270
I bet if I ask you what the foundational knowledge is

1113
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,139
and then I call someone else up in 10 minutes and ask them,

1114
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,739
I'm going to get two answers that are so different.

1115
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,550
You wouldn't even guess it was the same industry.

1116
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,850
I would even go one further to say that I've never actually

1117
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,570
seen a good statement of what like when you wrote about it,

1118
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,770
why do we do security?

1119
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,090
Like literally,

1120
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,550
is it, is it a cost control measure

1121
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:48,050
to, you know, prevent,

1122
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,840
you know, from people from taking off with everything or is it like

1123
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,310
because we have a moral and an ethical duty, for example,

1124
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,530
to protect people's personal information, which by the way,

1125
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,169
I believe that we do have,

1126
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,889
-- um, you know, is it because it's, is it
-- mo most organizations will disagree with you?

1127
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,739
However, that's where compliance and regulation I think can make a big difference.

1128
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:09,530
Yeah,

1129
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,959
so I, you know that that's what gets me is if you ask people, what,

1130
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:14,780
why are you securing this?

1131
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,540
Like what, what is the framework for why you're securing this?

1132
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,899
Like how you assign costs and benefits?

1133
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,979
And I've never seen a good one.

1134
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,399
And

1135
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,899
yeah, in 20 plus years now,

1136
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,639
I don't know, man, but I think this is one of the great challenges

1137
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,320
we have to deal with.

1138
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,530
Well, here's an idea.

1139
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,760
If you want, you can write into us and tell us why do you do security?

1140
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:44,360
You know, I, I would actually like to know from people why they do security.

1141
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:45,489
That is

1142
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,699
fantastic. In fact, we

1143
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:47,169
going

1144
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,919
to be,

1145
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:51,360
I I didn't do it on the last episode, I just realized, but on the bottom,

1146
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,239
if you go to the open source security podcast.com and you click on the episode link,

1147
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,229
there will be a link at the bottom to send Kurt and I A

1148
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:03,949
Twitter message and Twitter is by far the best way to contact us.

1149
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,610
Finding our email addresses isn't difficult, but I already get too much email.

1150
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,520
So the odds of me replying to you are probably very low. But Twitter is

1151
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:14,120
my guilty pleasure when I need to waste time during the day.

1152
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:16,110
So I will certainly look at that and get back to you.

1153
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,209
Yeah.

1154
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,879
All right, man.

1155
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,510
I think we can wrap it up there.

1156
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,409
That, that, that's enough talk about horrible,

1157
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:25,149
crazy problems that nobody can solve.

1158
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,370
I just wonder how many people are going to spend a couple of hours on world of VNC.

1159
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,560
I, I, my day is ruined. Kurt. I,

1160
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,899
I don't think I'll get anything else done today.

1161
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:34,459
I

1162
00:48:34,669 --> 00:48:34,820
mean,

1163
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,540
it, it was a pleasure as always. Thank you everyone for listening.

1164
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,500
I really appreciate it. Until next time. Stay

1165
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:40,090
shiny,

1166
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,350
shiny.
