Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:12,060
and my partner in reading CV entries, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,510
-- I mean,
-- I try not to but it's been,

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,059
it's been a week man.

4
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:20,930
I realized I say that and I, I don't think I've actually read a CV E properly

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,540
in

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:25,879
-- months, years.
-- I look at them every day for sure, for, for various reasons.

7
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,420
But like I scan, like, if they show up in the news,

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,760
I'll scan one but like I used to read all of them

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,979
talking about news.

10
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,069
We're going to discuss

11
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:38,689
NVD. Well, that's going to be part of the discussion.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,590
I don't know if we can, can I read the announcement?

13
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:40,909
No,

14
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:43,009
I'm gonna read you the announcement and I want you

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,029
to tell me what you think that would mean.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,110
So for anyone listening, NVD, the National Vulnerability Database,

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,759
it's something hosted by Nist in the United States.

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,709
Nist is the National Institute of Standards and Technologies.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,340
They do things like they have standards on cybersecurity reference.

20
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,000
Peanut butter. Yeah, they, they $1000 a pound peanut butter. They like

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,639
clocks and, and

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,569
you know, my favorite is all the people I know who are like, oh,

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,599
there's two kinds of countries,

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,970
those who use the metric system and those who went to the moon,

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,480
except do you know what the definition of an inch is?

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,160
-- Yeah, 2.25 0.4 millimeters.
-- That's right. They literally have defined the inch

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,449
off of,

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,970
off of the metric system.

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,410
It's not about 25.4

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,930
millimeters that's defined

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,059
by.

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,529
Anyway, here's what

33
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,949
NVD has put on their website. They put this on the website on February 15th.

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,050
-- I use a way back machine to figure out exactly when this went on. I love
-- that.

35
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:36,389
They went with a very

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,660
-- calm yellow.
-- Hold on. We, we'll get to that. All right.

37
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:42,089
So here's what the notice says.

38
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,059
-- It's in big yellow, a big yellow box, but
-- a very soothing yellow.

39
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,699
And it says Nist is currently working to establish a consortium to

40
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,860
address challenges in the NVD program and develop improved tools and methods.

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,980
You will temporarily see delays in analysis efforts during this transition.

42
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:01,690
We apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your

43
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:04,419
patience as we work to improve the NVD program.

44
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,779
How would you interpret that statement?

45
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,190
It's

46
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,630
-- no, you know the answer, but that's not the question. It's
-- pining for the fjords.

47
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,059
OK.

48
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,919
Here's what a normal person would think when they read that

49
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,139
they would think.

50
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:17,539
And

51
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:20,912
VD has slowed down that they're overwhelmed

52
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,472
and they need to figure something new out. And

53
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,742
I think that would be a reasonable

54
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,632
way to interpret that.

55
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,272
That's not what happened.

56
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:32,921
-- But
-- then that's ignoring the actual what the growth of CV E

57
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,632
entries is and the growth of the nist work and everything.

58
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,102
We, we'll talk about that in a minute.

59
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,742
-- I want to talk about what NVT is doing first
-- as an outsider with

60
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,643
no domain specific knowledge about this.

61
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,333
It's kind of weird but like, OK, the,

62
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:47,313
this government program is kind of rejiggering stuff

63
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:48,923
and it's gonna get their stuff together.

64
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:49,783
But

65
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:53,714
I would even knowing nothing about Mr CV E or NVD,

66
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,164
I would point out when is the last time

67
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,363
you saw a government notice like this?

68
00:02:58,563 --> 00:03:02,063
-- And the answer is never, I,
-- yeah, I don't think I've ever seen something like this.

69
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,953
This is not something that I,

70
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,776
I've never seen a government agency in Canada or

71
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:09,606
the US or basically anywhere on the Planet Post.

72
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:14,175
This is like a restaurant saying, you know, we're closed for, uh, renovations.

73
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:15,975
Totally not the health department shutting us down.

74
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:19,205
Yeah, exactly. Now, here's kind of what happened.

75
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,085
I saw this notice

76
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:21,936
and

77
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:25,796
there were a handful of folks and like linkedin and Master on and stuff that, like,

78
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,166
what's going on at NVD.

79
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,100
And I didn't think anything of it.

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,330
I just figured, oh, there's, they've slowed down a little bit,

81
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:36,300
there's gonna be a lag between CV ES being released and CV ES being analyzed like,

82
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:37,529
whatever that happens.

83
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,009
And I didn't think twice about it. And then

84
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,770
a couple days later,

85
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:45,160
I was actually doing some data analysis work

86
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,210
uh on the Linux kernel data specifically.

87
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,500
And I have a graph I in

88
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,399
it's saved in my elastic search instance that I used to do this work

89
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,199
that just shows the current CV E data

90
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,750
versus what NVD has enriched.

91
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,309
And I opened that graph

92
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,160
and NVD hasn't slowed down.

93
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,839
They stopped.

94
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,259
And I was like,

95
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:14,220
oh boy, like what is going on here?

96
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,550
And now I wanna,

97
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,399
I wanna add before we go on because we're probably gonna crap on NVD

98
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,369
a lot and I know we've crapped on them a lot in the past.

99
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,988
Like they have a monumental task.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,910
It's very hard and they actually do a pretty good job, all things considered

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,899
like it's a, it's a tough job.

102
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,989
I know Nist as a whole is like chronically underfunded,

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,329
I'm sure the NBD program is underfunded and I'm sure all of the people who work on this

104
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,352
are doing vastly more work than they should have to do.

105
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:43,572
So by all means anyone involved in this program, please do not

106
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,692
like, pick on these people or crap on them or think they're bad people.

107
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,993
They are not bad people, they are like superheroes doing the Lord's work here.

108
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:55,513
Well, and I would also argue that having the NVD do this, uh How do I phrase this is, oh,

109
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:58,553
I'm just going to go with is wrong in the sense of number one,

110
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,912
the NVD will only ever enrich data,

111
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,156
the US government cares about because that's who funds this.

112
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,966
-- No, they enrich like everything.
-- Let me finish.

113
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,786
Like, so they will definitely, most definitely

114
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,966
enrich data that the US government cares about and

115
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,476
that the US companies and users care about

116
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:19,756
-- and then they kind of go to everything else.
-- Sure. That's fair, that's fair

117
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:20,526
and that's

118
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,006
great that they did that.

119
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:25,645
But relying on them to do this for something that is

120
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:28,276
like when people consume CV E data,

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,790
there's a 90

122
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,540
I'm gonna make up a number 98% chance they're

123
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,959
pulling from the NVD database and they don't even know

124
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,709
how to get the data from Miter,

125
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,829
like the fact that it lives in a github

126
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:40,880
-- and there's sort of an API
-- now

127
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,200
they have an API now for C five

128
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,070
people don't even know about.

129
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,769
And so

130
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,239
have like,

131
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,630
like, it's nice that the US government was paying for this.

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,510
And I know for a fact way back in the day, like, and N I

133
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,760
didn't actually do the analysis. It was outsourced to a contractor.

134
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,980
-- I suspect it still is.
-- I would assume. So. Actually,

135
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,959
I, yeah,

136
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,540
but the problem is like, this is something that is so, so

137
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,260
widely used and relied upon.

138
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:11,899
And, and we've,

139
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,609
you and I personally have tried to fix this with the DWF and the GSD and all that stuff

140
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:19,109
to try and build a con like to try and build a consortium of people to do this.

141
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,010
But the fundamental problem is anybody that can do this work can sell that.

142
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,429
And why would they give it away for free?

143
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,350
And that's one of the core problems here is, is

144
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,829
anybody that is capable of doing this work is like, but or we can charge for this data,

145
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,899
why would we fold it back into a public data source and give it away for free?

146
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,130
I I will answer that question later

147
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,350
because that's exactly what we're going to do at

148
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,619
ANCAR. Exactly.

149
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,149
Here's the other piece to this that not everyone can see.

150
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,829
So like it was, it was funny because like on linkedin,

151
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,899
-- there were people I saw reply to comments that were like,
-- and actually there's

152
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,660
one more thing if this was due to like a US government shutdown or something,

153
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,959
like if there was some sort of external event that like, oh n

154
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:02,809
just had a massive budget cut or there's a US government shutdown or whatever,

155
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,489
then this notice would kind of have a context and make sense.

156
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,510
But there isn't anything like that

157
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,019
-- as far as I know, I,
-- I know nist is underfunded.

158
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,339
-- I mean, there's some news stories about that,
-- right?

159
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,160
But I'm just saying like,

160
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,390
it's not like they just lost half their funding and they're like, well,

161
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,109
what can we cut?

162
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,549
Not recently that, that I'm aware of

163
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,109
and, and not only that like this notice is

164
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,739
I think

165
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:25,779
it is

166
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:30,510
maybe technically correct, but ethically questionable is how I would describe it.

167
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,750
Well, here's the thing,

168
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:33,570
I'm just going to point something out.

169
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,329
Nist is currently working to establish a current consortium to address challenges

170
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,660
in the NVD program and develop and improve tools and methods.

171
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:43,059
If this were actually what they were truly doing

172
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,839
-- there, be like a link or a contact or something
-- too. So

173
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,489
I've been informed,

174
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,220
they're going to put a notice on the federal register at some point in the future.

175
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,640
But there's, there's some other pieces to this. I want to get to.

176
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,700
But I, I want to start out first by saying

177
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,070
there are,

178
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,519
there have been people who, who like made jokes and saying, oh if,

179
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,600
if you're relying on the N

180
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,029
data,

181
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,799
you're screwed anyway and stuff like that because like it has some quality issues.

182
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,040
But here's the thing,

183
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,019
I don't think a lot of people understand

184
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,970
in the US, in the federal government,

185
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,570
there are a number of regulations that specifically call out the NVD severity.

186
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,100
Like for example, if you're a fed ramp product or serve service,

187
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:25,250
it's a fed ramp service.

188
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,829
The fed ramp standard specifically says you have to use the NVD severity

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,530
which ironically don't exist now.

190
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,469
But,

191
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,570
but that's kind of a different problem,

192
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,869
-- I guess. Divide by zero, it's fine,
-- it's fine. They're all zero. That's right. Well,

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,510
there is a language to say like if an NVD severity doesn't exist,

194
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,890
fall back to the vendors severity.

195
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,309
But fundamentally, you are expected to use the severity NVD is setting.

196
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,280
So this isn't like some data set.

197
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:54,659
You can just be like whatever, I'm gonna blow this off. It doesn't matter like

198
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:57,950
it's literally named in these standards.

199
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,409
This is a lot like plumbing and electrical code in the sense of

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,020
for the vast majority of us, it just doesn't matter.

201
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,099
But we don't care if you,

202
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,000
if you took the plumbing code or electrical standards away

203
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,869
and let people do kind of whatever they want,

204
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,190
we'd have some problems.

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,359
Well,

206
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:15,179
it would basically be back when all the houses kept burning down for some reason.

207
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,099
Right. Right.

208
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:16,739
Ok.

209
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,700
Now

210
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,650
-- there's so many moving parts in this story,
-- man.

211
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,119
And I mean, that's part of the problem here is there's so much complexity,

212
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,989
this is part of an ecosystem as a whole.

213
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,640
And I love these people saying that

214
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,380
you shouldn't rely on the NVD data when

215
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,140
they sort of conveniently ignore the fact that,

216
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,460
well, how else do you get the CV,

217
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:35,909
data with this enriched stuff that everybody wants and uses?

218
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,474
Because like I can speak of authoritatively here.

219
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:39,854
I worked for I

220
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:43,054
site partners and I defense where we basically consumed CV,

221
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:46,664
and a bunch of other stuff and enriched it and sold it for an ungodly amount of money.

222
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,085
Like it started at six figures back in the day

223
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,034
and

224
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:54,804
now that you can kind of get a lot of that through NVD for free. Well,

225
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:55,554
yeah,

226
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:56,674
like, yeah.

227
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,580
And so these people that are, like, oh, this is no big deal or?

228
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,369
Oh, this doesn't matter. Yeah. They're sort of ignoring reality.

229
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,200
-- Oh, for
-- sure. 100%.

230
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,250
And, and I know there's companies that,

231
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,280
that do this sort of work on their own and things like that.

232
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,559
But the reality is

233
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:12,400
every

234
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,075
private database I have ever interacted with had

235
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,734
very, the, the data quality was not good.

236
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:19,424
Well,

237
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,434
it's because it's like a bunch of people like me grinding

238
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,635
about these reports trying to do the best we can.

239
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:28,275
Yeah. And to give you an idea, you're talking like 100 of these a day, give or take

240
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,520
no 2 to 300 a day with NVD and a bunch

241
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,000
-- of other sources because N
-- VD has with other sources.

242
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,130
-- Sure. Yeah,
-- that's fair.

243
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,419
Like they don't, there's like no uh last I checked, I don't uh I want to say like hai

244
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:40,309
or somebody,

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
there's a Japanese vendor that does a ton like probably about 100 vols a month.

246
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,739
I forget which one

247
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,969
that are like, just not an NVD or CV at all. Maybe they are now

248
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,859
interesting. I didn't know that back in the day.

249
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:54,809
So like when you start covering not even and I'm ignoring the open source world,

250
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,700
but when you start covering major vendors,

251
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,510
a couple of them have become CNAs. Like I think Schneider Electric became one.

252
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,820
There's quite a few now. There's, there's a lot of CN A s. Ok.

253
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,590
There's over 1000 skater companies globally,

254
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:10,830
-- I think. Like two of them are CNAs. Uh,
-- yeah, it's not that many.

255
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,390
And that's, that's what people forget is that like, there's accounting software,

256
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,539
there's

257
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,469
like a jillion of them.

258
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:18,940
And, and the other thing, I mean,

259
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,429
the thing I always talk about with CN AC N CV E numbering authority, right?

260
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,010
This is an organization that could basically coin their own CV ES

261
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,179
we just talked to Greg Kh about the Linux kernel becoming one.

262
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,849
Not everyone should have to be ac na

263
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:31,020
I

264
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:34,619
the reason almost everyone is doing it is to just

265
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,125
deal with the Brokenness of the system.

266
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,215
I mean, this is,

267
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:41,494
this is one of my pet peeves about like this whole vulnerability universe

268
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,395
is

269
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:44,614
if you talk to people doing the work,

270
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,354
they basically detest these systems because there's

271
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:49,135
a lot of systemic problems in them.

272
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,854
But then you go and talk to the insiders

273
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:54,335
and they spend all their time convincing you you're wrong,

274
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,554
which is like,

275
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,215
that's not OK.

276
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,169
I'm gonna say this as kindly as I can

277
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,729
CV E was created actually 25 years ago, roughly 1999

278
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,890
and it was totally appropriate and applicable back then.

279
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,119
And it has not changed significantly

280
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:12,570
at

281
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,479
all

282
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,530
in that time.

283
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,840
There's been incremental progress like I got them into github,

284
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,080
but they still use that weird magical backend

285
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,840
that imports and exports data from github.

286
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,400
Github is not the source of truth. Github

287
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,450
is just republishing,

288
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:24,729
they at least use

289
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,380
-- json instead of XML. So you're welcome to for that world like,
-- well, in the new

290
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:30,159
JSON format,

291
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,570
the CV E five format is significantly nicer than the CV E four format was.

292
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,969
And you know why the CV four format is so terrible.

293
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,520
It's because I invented it and nobody gave me feedback and I,

294
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,450
the CV four format solved every single problem I had

295
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,070
and nobody else wanted to contribute. So

296
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,400
that's what we got,

297
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,919
right? And that's how it works for sure,

298
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,159
for sure.

299
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,690
It's a classic open source. But the thing is like the CV board is the same people.

300
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,030
There's been no turnover, like there's been no significant renewal in

301
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,750
over two decades. Like that's insane.

302
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:03,869
Oh, it's, it's for sure.

303
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,669
Now, we, we, we ranted about all this on an episode a while back.

304
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,419
So I don't, I don't want to rehash all that. I want, I

305
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,809
want to talk about NVD in this context.

306
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,809
So now you mentioned about like the consortium aspect of this, right?

307
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,130
I don't know what to think of that piece

308
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:23,099
because the reality is if you look at how the US Federal government works,

309
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,849
they have a very hard time working with anyone outside of the US federal government.

310
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:34,650
Well, yeah, if you don't have an office with an address in Maryland or Virginia,

311
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,020
you're not going to be part of this consort.

312
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,729
That's quite likely. And, and that's one of my concerns is

313
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:47,109
I'm not sure how they can do this in a way that will actually be effective

314
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,809
just because it's, this is not what the US government does.

315
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,020
I mean, this is why Miter runs CV E because the US government can't run CV E.

316
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,710
They had to find someone else to do it

317
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,150
well, and I mean, it does fit with Miters.

318
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,750
One of their main things is cybersecurity and they do a lot of

319
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,460
CV, ecwe and a whole bunch of hardware software. You name it,

320
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,580
blah, blah, blah.

321
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,419
I think fundamentally, this is a classic problem of,

322
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,739
it's like the time zone file guy.

323
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,190
It started out like, ok, we need a time zone file du and ok,

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,780
so this one guy seems to be maintaining it cool.

325
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,380
Let's like, let him do it because

326
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,010
that is a lot of work and annoying to coordinate and it's tricky

327
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,039
and

328
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,719
there's a lot of

329
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,760
stuff in society that underpins

330
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,719
everything in that industry.

331
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,539
Like here's a crazy thing. You're gonna hear trick question.

332
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,989
But what's generally the smallest

333
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,440
ridge breaker in North America?

334
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:45,719
-- And the answer is 15 amps.
-- Well, it was 15 amps.

335
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:49,030
-- Ah So you heard about the new 10 amp
-- breakers? 10 amp now

336
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:54,400
-- only for
-- lights. Yes, with 14 gauge wire. So because like all the lights got

337
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,919
stupid efficient.

338
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,270
And now we can, like, run them off of, like, basically cheap toy wire and,

339
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,716
and it's, it's that kind of weird, small,

340
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:08,176
boring detail oriented stuff that underpins

341
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:13,026
-- the cybersecurity industry is CV E and NVD.
-- It's very wonky. Right.

342
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:15,145
It's Wonkish in that regard where it's,

343
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:17,226
and I mean, this is something that

344
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,296
I, I forget I was talking to someone about this and they were,

345
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:22,666
they were basically saying, like, why aren't more people talking about this?

346
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:25,176
And I'm like, well, it's very niche.

347
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,245
This is like a niche of a niche.

348
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,731
I mean, the cybersecurity industry is already kind of niche.

349
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:33,771
But the vulnerability identifier piece of that industry is

350
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,791
even more niche than an already niche industry.

351
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,872
You've got it, then you've got information security,

352
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,771
then you've got vulnerability management,

353
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:43,971
then you've got the foreign vulnerability identification.

354
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,122
And a perfect example of this is we tried to do this with GSD and

355
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:50,531
DWF and failed because there's just so

356
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,101
many weird economic issues and externalities and internal

357
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,791
that. It's just, this is really hard

358
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:02,039
and there's also like 100 people that really kind of know this and do this

359
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,349
in the world.

360
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,440
Yeah, it's small.

361
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:04,750
Anor

362
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,200
has an interesting idea

363
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,919
that

364
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,119
we're, we're pushing ahead with. So, so there's,

365
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,070
there's a guy I work with who is involved in the GSD in the past.

366
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,719
His name is Weston Steimel and Weston's like, really bright.

367
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,530
He knows more about vulnerabilities than either you or I do

368
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,179
or probably both of us put together.

369
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,890
That's good because if we know the most, we're, but we're screwed as a species.

370
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,710
We got problems. But anyway,

371
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,059
so one of the things we're, we're going to do and, and

372
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,369
we have

373
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,340
a V vulnerability scanner called Gripe.

374
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,859
Right. And Gripe can work on bombs. You can scan all kinds of stuff with it.

375
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,210
It does a pretty nice job

376
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,919
and we use as many of the, like, upstream ecosystems to match against like github

377
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,700
and redhead and Debbie and ubuntu.

378
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,429
All all those kind of things, you know, the usual suspects whenever we can.

379
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,210
However, there is some vulnerability data

380
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:56,969
that just doesn't exist anywhere else and we we would fall back to NVD for that data,

381
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,690
right?

382
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:00,905
And so the idea of being like my example would be Curl, right?

383
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:03,205
Like curl publishes their own advisories.

384
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:08,145
But curl is a binary on a disk quite often, right? Busy box, a binary on a disk.

385
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,954
It's not part, it's not there from a package manager.

386
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:15,145
-- If curls from a package manager from like Debian or red hat
-- curl on an Apple device is

387
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,060
made by Apple in a way that Ashley Curl has some issues with

388
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,219
-- which was to get into in another show.
-- But anyway, so

389
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,618
there is some NVD data we need

390
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:29,209
because it's like that we call it the matcher of last resort.

391
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,239
We like this data doesn't exist anywhere else.

392
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,500
This is the only place to get it from and now it's gone.

393
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,599
-- No,
-- it's just, it'll be updated later. Where

394
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:40,650
is, maybe it's, it's delayed temporarily, but it's like, what's the,

395
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,209
the, the gull of French

396
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,109
Arc fleet from Hitchhikers down to the galaxy where they're

397
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:49,250
there? What is it, the like 100 year temporary delay or something?

398
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:51,760
Anyway,

399
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:52,260
we're,

400
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,290
we're going to create a repository to just start capturing the things we need

401
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,989
and we're going to focus very much on the things we need to start.

402
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,810
But ideally,

403
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,650
we would like to try to build some sort of open community to work on some of this

404
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,449
data because there's a bunch of other things you

405
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:09,079
can enrich a lot of vulnerability data with.

406
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,469
But I think here's the difference because like DWF and GSD,

407
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,750
like those didn't work out.

408
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,040
But I think the reason they didn't work out is there was

409
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,935
isn't like a specific demand for that data. At the time,

410
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:21,055
we have a demand for that data.

411
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:24,844
Like we need this data, we're doing it whether people come and help or not.

412
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,045
Here's the classic problem.

413
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,515
But everything trying to replace Bitcoin or Ethereum

414
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,974
or fax or email or the internet has,

415
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,535
which is

416
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:33,074
how do you build something

417
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:36,665
that is so much better than the existing solution.

418
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:40,574
But at the same time, familiar enough and similar enough to

419
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:41,734
use

420
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,079
that people will actually use it.

421
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,760
And it's a sort of innovation trap of like how do you move forward significantly.

422
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,479
But in a way where it's like

423
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,300
this, but just a little bit better,

424
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,140
but it is so much, significantly better.

425
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,520
And that is another problem that DWF and GST I,

426
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,130
which is we weren't doing anything significantly better.

427
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,579
No.

428
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,699
No,

429
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,680
not at all.

430
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,770
Right. That's just it.

431
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,979
-- And now there's this asteroid extension level event coming for CV E basically.
-- Yes.

432
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,209
And, oh, well, now the dinosaur

433
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:12,116
-- were a little worried,
-- I mean, you know what this feels like this is like

434
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:15,496
if you don't schedule downtime, the universe will schedule it for you.

435
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:18,957
Like the universe just scheduled us some downtime. So we got to deal with it.

436
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:22,057
-- Now,
-- like imagine if the Linux kernel team just said like, hey,

437
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,376
we're taking a 30 day break.

438
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,896
They had to kind of do that when Linus's power went out.

439
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:26,457
Yeah.

440
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,536
But I mean, imagine then if, but here's the thing, this isn't,

441
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:33,817
this notice is not like a 30 or 60 or 90 day thing. It's like, uh you know,

442
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,813
maybe and that's that uncertainty risk.

443
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:40,093
-- So
-- here's, here's some information I do have about the notice

444
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:45,034
that uh you can imagine many people have mailed NVD

445
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:49,494
asking for more, more details and they started replying to people.

446
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:54,043
But not until after like, basically, the story broke across the, the,

447
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,673
the vulnerability ecosystem which displeases me.

448
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:57,994
It, it, it basically has been,

449
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,354
it was three weeks essentially until this like

450
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,994
became public knowledge that what was actually going

451
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,890
on, which I think is way too long.

452
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,730
But then they started replying to people and there's

453
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,661
a conference at the end of March called Von,

454
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,681
which is all of the vulnerability insiders going to Raleigh North Carolina. Uh,

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,691
you know what? Oh, the Von

456
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:19,281
conference. Yeah, it's just the CV conference. But rebranded

457
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,171
was there a CV E conference?

458
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:24,161
There was, well, there was once at that satellite campus because,

459
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,571
oh, ok. I, I don't know.

460
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,850
it's, it's basically, it's probably the same people in the same ideas. But anyway,

461
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,010
so the response

462
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:33,030
is

463
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,030
exactly that.

464
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,140
But the response NVD is now giving is that, oh, we're going to announce something at B

465
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,859
Khan. By the time B

466
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,469
Khan comes around,

467
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,410
you're talking about basically a month and a half from the time the,

468
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,489
the faucet was turned off which in the vulnerability world,

469
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,829
a month and a half is a really, really, really long time.

470
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,069
-- Also,
-- I feel like they could have just posted a web page.

471
00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:00,540
I mean, this is one of my complaints is I feel like that notice,

472
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,339
it probably went through 600 layers of government lawyers,

473
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,780
but like it doesn't contain usable information.

474
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,420
And I think it's, it's misleading to a degree which I don't approve of it all.

475
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,329
So, so anyway, now we're now we're here.

476
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,512
-- This is
-- actually I'm going to be blunt, this is one of the reason I

477
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,733
left Red Hat is I got tired of

478
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:24,062
the vulnerability management space being such a cluster.

479
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:27,753
It's a mess. I mean, it's, it's been difficult forever.

480
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:31,912
It's the same problems I had, we had 25 years ago.

481
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:32,753
I mean,

482
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:36,652
I won't disagree with you on that. Right.

483
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,113
And what I really love every time CV, and quality of CV comes up, you know,

484
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:41,072
what people propose

485
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:42,526
should have two levels of CV.

486
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:43,475
We should have ones that are like,

487
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,845
good and golden and standard and the ones that are like,

488
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,956
maybe so like almost like a candidate

489
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,526
and a CV, which

490
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:51,936
I'm being facetious here because if you look at it

491
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:55,265
that they, that's how CV started. They had candidates that then

492
00:21:55,615 --> 00:22:00,255
-- the board as a whole had to vote on.
-- Yeah. Oh, it was. But they were, they were like,

493
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:03,926
they were like 100 a year back then. Like you could do that.

494
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,979
But even 100 year like anyways.

495
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,790
So it just makes me laugh where they're like,

496
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,140
people are proposing solutions and it's like, no, no, we,

497
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,849
we tried that 25 years ago and it failed 25 years ago to do scale issues.

498
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,180
And, and look, here's one of the things I have to say about that is

499
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:24,780
this sort of problem is fundamentally an open source problem

500
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,890
is what I would say is the vast majority

501
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,310
of these ideas are applying to open source products.

502
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,119
The things most people actually care about is open source dependencies.

503
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,479
Like there's a lot of open source going on here and this is an open source

504
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,310
-- scale problem that needs an open source solution.
-- Well, it's an open

505
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:40,859
source scale

506
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,619
solution. And I think that's one thing,

507
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,119
people keep forgetting the law of large numbers here. Like

508
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,780
we're talking tens of thousands of events per year, which means

509
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,680
tens to hundreds of events per day.

510
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,199
So it, it's crazier than that.

511
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:55,300
I,

512
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,349
I'm giving a talk at Cipher Con the first week of April where I

513
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,479
think the talk is titled Open Source Security is bigger than you can imagine.

514
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,239
And like here's something to think about

515
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,239
we have right now there. I think it was like 28,000 cbes last year, right?

516
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:18,219
There are literally 8 million open source packages being like not versions,

517
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,750
just the packages like the, the the projects being tracked.

518
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,469
There's, there's a data set called Ecosystems. A guy named Andrew

519
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,369
Nesbitt runs it. It's a very cool data set.

520
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,729
But anyway, Ecosystems is tracking eight. I think it's 8.8 million packages.

521
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:33,250
And if you break out all the versions you're talking about,

522
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,130
I think it's like 40 or 50 million, I forget the exact number.

523
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,439
But like it is an insane amount

524
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,199
of, of packages in version

525
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,235
being released.

526
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:45,406
You think there's 28,000 security vulnerabilities

527
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,995
in tens of millions of packages.

528
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,816
No freaking way.

529
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:53,796
And what's even better is he has no visibility into the closed source world,

530
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,296
which is bigger.

531
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,296
No, I don't think it is. I don't think the closed source world is bigger at all.

532
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:58,806
There's

533
00:23:58,916 --> 00:23:58,926
a,

534
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,036
well,

535
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,605
there's a lot of badly written stuff that never sees

536
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,296
the light of day but is attached to the internet.

537
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,395
-- Let me put it that way.
-- Oh, for sure there is.

538
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:09,936
But I, I have a suspicion, open source probably eclipses a closed source

539
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:11,842
by several magnitudes. At least

540
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:12,161
-- my
-- code

541
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:13,052
is probably true.

542
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:13,291
Now,

543
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:16,771
I want to tie in the Linux kernel to this conversation because

544
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:20,352
this has also been a topic that's come up in the vulnerability universe

545
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:21,312
because

546
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:26,011
a lot of the people running these like secret private databases

547
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,692
are very upset by what the Linux kernel is doing.

548
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:30,041
And the reality is,

549
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,942
can I just tell people what the Linux kernel actually did versus what

550
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:36,342
they think they did because there's what people think the Linux kernel did.

551
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,521
Hold on. Let me, let me explain first. So

552
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,469
there are all of these organizations that, that parse all the vulnerabilities.

553
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,119
You know, we mentioned them a little while ago

554
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:50,189
and I guarantee they're all running like on the very edge of what they can do.

555
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,609
-- And so if you increase,
-- I worked for two of them, I can confirm that statement.

556
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,089
-- You literally
-- know exactly.

557
00:24:56,199 --> 00:25:00,290
But if you increase the volume of vulnerabilities by let's say 10 or 20%

558
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:01,194
which is

559
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,594
literally what's happening.

560
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:06,055
If you look at the, the CV E data in the Linux kernel editions,

561
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:10,714
they're accounting for around 10% of all CV ES now, which is quite a lot.

562
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,925
-- But basically the Linux kernel, it
-- is kind of used widely

563
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,094
and it is kind of big.

564
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:20,775
It's one of the most used applications on the planet and off the planet.

565
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:21,645
So,

566
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,099
is

567
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,109
it on Mars?

568
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,260
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. Ok.

569
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,310
We'll just say yes, even if it's not

570
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,290
anyway.

571
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,859
So curls probably be there too

572
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,530
is absolutely on Mars.

573
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,060
Yeah. Yeah.

574
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:36,060
But, but you get the idea, a lot of these organizations,

575
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,699
they're really angry and they're,

576
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:42,484
they're complaining a lot to the CBE people as well as the Linux kernel people.

577
00:25:42,494 --> 00:25:43,285
And of course, Greg

578
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:46,885
doesn't care. So he's gonna just keep doing what he does.

579
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,324
So, and here's the beautiful thing.

580
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:49,895
A lot of people are complaining saying, oh,

581
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,954
the Linux kernel became a CV numbering authority and

582
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,795
is assigning CV S to things that are not

583
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:56,604
confirmed as a vulnerability

584
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,204
and going back to Greg's argument, which is,

585
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,650
if

586
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,800
it looks weird enough,

587
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,979
we kind of have to say it's security related because we

588
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:07,319
cannot guarantee how or what people are using this for.

589
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,869
-- And so we have to err on the side of caution,
-- right?

590
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,839
Like as he pointed out, it's running on literally rockets and milking machines.

591
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:14,400
Like

592
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,739
-- that's amazing.
-- And what's interesting.

593
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,599
So what's what the Linux kernel actually did

594
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,180
is they're not,

595
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:26,005
people ignore stuff anymore. They're actually labeling it clearly.

596
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:28,446
Now in the past, they could have like put a security tag on it

597
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:33,686
and the reality is at most organizations no CV, E, no harm, no foul.

598
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:34,965
It is literally that simple.

599
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:37,755
And the moment you assign a CV for a lot of organizations,

600
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,926
a 30 day clock starts ticking or a 90 day clock or whatever

601
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:41,845
for sure.

602
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,562
And that's what they're ticking awful about it is

603
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:46,112
because they have all this process wrapped around CV.

604
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,572
Identifiers, make it real to put it bluntly

605
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:49,531
100%.

606
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,261
There's that whole argument with people trying to get

607
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,302
CV S to count K to improve their resume.

608
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,251
And my take on this always was, is it a real CV E like,

609
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,202
is it legitimately a vulnerability?

610
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,102
Yes. Then

611
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:03,732
that's what we're trying. Like we want people to game the system and get these.

612
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:04,732
That's the point.

613
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,349
Yeah. Right. Right.

614
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:09,390
And, and look, the world isn't ready for kind of that thing.

615
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,109
But I think the reality is if,

616
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,900
if most projects started kind of doing what the Linux kernel is doing where

617
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,869
they're being a little more generous with

618
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,520
what they're defining as security issues,

619
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,780
I think we wouldn't have 28,000,

620
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,300
we'd probably have

621
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:28,709
-- 280,000 or 2 million.
-- I've actually run the numbers and done spot checks.

622
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,180
So a great example is quota quota,

623
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:31,462
a Blockchain project.

624
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,182
They actually very clearly label all their security stuff

625
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,531
as security with all caps security focal and blah,

626
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:36,901
blah, blah.

627
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,182
And they have, you know, about 10 or 20 a year.

628
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:43,062
They're not abnormal if you actually look at the data

629
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:46,102
of just stuff that is actually labeled as security fixes,

630
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:46,631
like in github.

631
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,781
Like, oh, this fixes a buffer overflow and stuff.

632
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,562
The actual number of CV ES for the English speaking

633
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,722
world should be about 1 to 10 million a year.

634
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:55,202
I wouldn't, I

635
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,494
not be surprised if that's true. Well, I know like,

636
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:03,244
uh, what we had a meal from um Debret on the show. It's been several years now. I think

637
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:07,104
where one of the things he talked about was he basically built the

638
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:10,413
system to go look at like get commits and try to determine,

639
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,274
is this

640
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:16,524
pull request or commit or whatever? Is it a is it fixing a security vulnerability?

641
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,754
And he found hundreds of thousands

642
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:20,816
and when he tried to bring his research to people,

643
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,605
they basically were like get out of here.

644
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:25,796
-- Now. We do not want to talk about this.
-- I didn't even try anything fancy.

645
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:28,475
I literally just was spot checking projects

646
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:30,765
and looking at stuff where the maintainer said

647
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,605
this fixes a security flaw

648
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:33,605
and

649
00:28:34,306 --> 00:28:35,956
like that low of a bar,

650
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,666
not even a maybe but a confirmed is like I

651
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,086
said 1 to 10 million a year because simple numbers.

652
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:45,245
Yeah, there are 522,833 PP projects.

653
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,050
-- There are millions of N PM, there are right.
-- Like

654
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,040
they all have

655
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,910
the ecosystems data 8.8 million packages right now and it is going up,

656
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,949
which is nuts.

657
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,349
The problem is historically,

658
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,770
we've been able to ignore the vast majority of security vulnerabilities.

659
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,010
And what's interesting is there's a lot of places

660
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,510
but do actually reasonably update software.

661
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,530
But then there are places and this, I think where

662
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,822
will actually make a difference? And that was posted on Mastodon, where

663
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:14,952
was it? A car?

664
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,291
Anyway,

665
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:18,722
somebody pointed out this close this entity that was using

666
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:20,741
open source and they were using stuff that was 8,

667
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:21,702
10 years out of date.

668
00:29:21,712 --> 00:29:21,722
Oh,

669
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:25,092
-- those are the avanti routers,
-- right? Sorry. Yeah, the Avanti routers.

670
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:27,322
Yeah, which are definitely connected to the internet, right?

671
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:28,661
Maybe. Yes

672
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:29,241
and yeah.

673
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,432
And they were pointing out like I think it had a

674
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:32,302
version of curl that was eight years out of date.

675
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,411
Like it was wild. I feel like they fixed a few flaws

676
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:39,093
-- since then. Now
-- I want to finish up this conversation

677
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:39,973
on

678
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:42,394
an important point is we talk about how

679
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:44,843
there's probably millions of vulnerabilities per year.

680
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:48,923
The world is not prepared for that future

681
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,404
at all. No.

682
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,913
And the problem I see right now

683
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:56,573
is all of the conversations I'm seeing around NVD

684
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,293
and about the Linux kernel putting out all these vulnerable

685
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,515
ideas.

686
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:06,576
It's not about like maybe we need to rethink some of this. Everyone's screaming.

687
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:09,845
We have to go back to the way it was and here's the thing

688
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:14,046
we will never go back to the way it was that is over now

689
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,605
and now we have to think about what is going to come next.

690
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:23,395
And if we obsess over like individual CV E findings like we've done in the past,

691
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:26,517
we will be crushed under the weight of those boulders.

692
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:30,517
Like we have to find new ideas and new ways to deal with all of this.

693
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:30,947
Well,

694
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,878
a good analogy here would be forestry management which basically

695
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:35,417
used to boil down to if there's a fire,

696
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,478
put it out right away.

697
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:41,498
And we've done that for 50 years and now last year, about 5% of my province burnt.

698
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,887
And this year we already basically,

699
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:46,708
they declared the fire season started early because we

700
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,907
also already had 100 wildfires burning underground under snow.

701
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:50,680
And

702
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,880
so, for example, here we need to start thinking about

703
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,000
massively rethinking forestry management.

704
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:59,329
Like we don't even, we're not even at the point where we can really fix forest fires.

705
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,119
Like we, we've hired more firefighters,

706
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,479
we've declared the fire season starts like now,

707
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,560
like a few weeks before it officially starts.

708
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,239
But like, fundamentally,

709
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,520
we need to rethink forestry management and how we

710
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,020
manage our forests and do we let them burn?

711
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,530
Where do we, you know, it's, it's to put it bluntly, it's too late.

712
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,949
We already built cities and towns where they should not have been built.

713
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:21,170
And that's exactly what's happened here in the open source world is

714
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,969
we've got

715
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,119
not just technical debt but like a like a cultural debt of how we look at software.

716
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,069
So a perfect example of this is I don't

717
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,609
care about vulnerability management as much as for example,

718
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:32,609
your ability to

719
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,359
ship an update.

720
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,099
Like if you can't ship an update, no amount of vulnerability management matters.

721
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,219
And so for example, with

722
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,290
uh with shipping and update,

723
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,959
you need to have test cases,

724
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,010
so you need to have testing frameworks,

725
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:50,619
you need to have feedback loops so that if because people will find bugs that are bad,

726
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,439
like if you don't have a way to ingest that and then

727
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,660
ship an update and fix it,

728
00:31:55,989 --> 00:32:00,069
none of this matters. And the vast majority of project

729
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:03,770
and especially closed source. Yeah, their test cases are weak

730
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:05,229
if they exist at all

731
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,949
and their ability to ship an update confidently

732
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,040
without breaking stuff like the Linux kernel does.

733
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,689
Like I'm, I will disagree with Greg here. The Linux kernel is special.

734
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,560
They do some magic, they have the discipline

735
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:16,449
like

736
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,689
I'm sorry, but like at like expecting an N PM to have a full test suite.

737
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:21,949
I'm I'm not going to hold my breath.

738
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,390
What if it's one person who only has two hours

739
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,170
on Saturdays to work on their N PM project,

740
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:29,959
right? And 17 N PM projects in total,

741
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:31,109
there's some of that too.

742
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,280
So the majority of these people don't have just one project.

743
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,390
This is we, we talk, I mean,

744
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,140
what we had to on a couple of times we had the sovereign Texan people.

745
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,599
I'm like,

746
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,359
yeah, we don't know what to do with this.

747
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:45,000
But what I'm pointing out is until we look at, until we look at this as like this is not,

748
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,979
I'm gonna say this, this is not a vulnerability management problem.

749
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:51,349
This is a software ecosystem management problem

750
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,199
of which vulnerability management is just a very

751
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:54,979
uh

752
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,040
noticeable issue that we can no longer ignore.

753
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,810
I, I agree with that.

754
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,869
Like people are breaking like ransomware is still a

755
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,079
thing and they're still using six month old vulnerabilities.

756
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,140
And as I understand it,

757
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,910
the healthcare system in the US is still crippled from

758
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,290
that cyberattack against that one major healthcare provider that,

759
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,209
you know,

760
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,699
-- I know who you mean.
-- Yeah.

761
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,780
And so that's, I think like I'm not saying we don't try to fix CV and NVD and all this.

762
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,880
But what I'm saying is as much as we fix those things,

763
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,079
even if we had magical solutions for them, which we do not,

764
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,640
we would still have a lot of problems. We need to start thinking bigger and better.

765
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:31,750
And I,

766
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,300
I'm gonna say this, I think open source,

767
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,819
not just the licensing, not just the,

768
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:39,579
the way of doing open source, but the culture is

769
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,689
really the only way forwards significantly

770
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:47,339
for a lot of this stuff. I think that's right. I think expecting,

771
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,699
-- it's the only thing that'll scale
-- it. Right. It has to scale to the moon

772
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,660
100%.

773
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,489
And, and the challenge

774
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,459
is going to be how do you bootstrap something like this

775
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,290
because it's not free. I mean, like let me give you an example,

776
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,979
Acor is going to do all this work and we're going to dump it out and,

777
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:06,060
and hope some people come and help us out

778
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,889
but like it's not free, it's it, we need the data anyway.

779
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,418
I think that's our superpower here because we have to have it. But you know, like

780
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,899
this is one of those things that

781
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:20,060
the data will be available, but that data has a cost behind it.

782
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,340
And, and when you look at like, and we're only doing a really small sliver of the the

783
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,668
-- system
-- and the data is very temporal in that I

784
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,478
need it as soon as possible because the the the value

785
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,739
of the data

786
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,300
-- drops off a cliff because
-- like, I don't think it drops off a cliff.

787
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,219
-- But
-- if the data is 30 days late, that's 30 days added to my response.

788
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,370
That's what I mean.

789
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,540
That that's, and that's,

790
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,879
that's a subtle thing most people don't realize is

791
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,300
that like especially vulnerability management of scale is all about

792
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,370
like when Microsoft Tuesday comes around, I used to have,

793
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,449
I actually had a written contract with my ex-wife

794
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,520
that she would not speak to me on that

795
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,978
because I was so stressed out and horrible. No, I'm serious.

796
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:01,379
That's one of the reasons I left that industry is it was in hindsight, it was so gross,

797
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:02,889
especially Microsoft Tuesdays.

798
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:08,360
But my point is like this data, I, I people don't need it in a month or a week.

799
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,219
They need it. Now.

800
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:11,379
Like when Microsoft drops Microsoft Tuesday,

801
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:16,659
every infosec team on the planet starts scrambling to digest it and give guidance

802
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:20,159
and to start patching because sometimes there's stuff in there that it's like,

803
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,800
oh, you know, there's this little thing, if you visit a web page,

804
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,439
it just hijacks your kernel at the

805
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,659
like ringing zero level. Oops.

806
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,179
Yeah. Right. OK.

807
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,540
So here's how I want to end this show because we're, we're run ourselves out of time.

808
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:32,219
Like

809
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:36,979
I have no doubt the US government is going to think

810
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:40,780
about and have a lot of meetings about specifically NVD in

811
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:41,300
this

812
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:44,719
-- because they need the data, right? They, they don't have a choice
-- one. Comment.

813
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,360
CIA just got a budget increase.

814
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,780
And I always wondered, like I look at NVD doing this and I'm like,

815
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,260
this seems more like a CIA thing.

816
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,760
-- It might
-- be and it wouldn't surprise me if they take it over.

817
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,459
But fundamentally at the end of the day,

818
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:57,560
I think one of the challenges that the government is going to have and like

819
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,830
I know Anisa in Europe is trying to do some of this as well,

820
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:01,350
but

821
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,429
we need to do things different

822
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,969
because if we try to keep doing it, the way it's been done,

823
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,270
we're going to have the same problems.

824
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,699
And, and additionally, I mean, this is always one of the challenges for new things

825
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,629
is expecting the same people to do something in a different way,

826
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,909
generally doesn't happen. And so this is where I think

827
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:30,176
you need like a very open source like model where you have many people

828
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:32,696
can come and sit at the table and,

829
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:35,395
and work on this stuff because when you restrict

830
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:38,555
something like this to a small group of insiders,

831
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,456
it can't change and grow.

832
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:43,206
There's a good reason why they're doing that is because they don't

833
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:47,862
want to change and grow the people that consume this data, especially at scale,

834
00:36:47,892 --> 00:36:50,251
do not want to have to make significant changes.

835
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,521
It's very risky and

836
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:57,281
-- costly. I mean,
-- no one wants to change, right? And we've avoided it for a long time.

837
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,332
But I think like

838
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:02,041
the asteroid has hit the planet. What happens now?

839
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:05,241
Well, back to the forestry management thing. We have all this dead wood now

840
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,162
it's gonna burn at some point.

841
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:10,201
We have all these vulnerabilities that we've ignored successfully.

842
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,179
Yep, at

843
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,629
scale and most people are not keeping their stuff up to date.

844
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,310
No, no. That's the thing.

845
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,790
We can't keep up as it is and how, what would happen if,

846
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,899
if we went from 28,000 CV ES to a million CV ES

847
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,189
like we would crush the world.

848
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:28,415
I literally looked at just Parson

849
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,604
github for things like thank you.

850
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,385
-- This confirmed fixes a buffer overflow that alone would double the size of CV
-- S.

851
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:34,735
So I've, I've searched github.

852
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,495
You can type a buffer overflow into the search box, put it in double quotes

853
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,705
and I think it's 9 million issues

854
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:41,695
like

855
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:43,344
it's

856
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:50,125
-- not zero or
-- look for how many people add the html special cares wrapper in a PHP app.

857
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:52,205
Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Basically every single one of those is

858
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:52,844
scripting,

859
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,800
cutting us off.

860
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,169
I think

861
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,199
we don't know what's coming next,

862
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,219
but it's going to be a wild ride. That's about all I will say.

863
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,989
I actually have a suspicion

864
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:05,679
that the

865
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:10,379
language specific ecosystems will really help within their domain.

866
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,600
But people forget that there's a lot of corporations and

867
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,520
organizations that have to consume all the data because they have

868
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,429
all the systems. No. Like I think people forget like a fortune 100

869
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,360
will have

870
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,290
-- their inventory of it. Basically boils down to. Yes. Every
-- everything ever.

871
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah, for sure.

872
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,469
Yeah, Windows 95 is on the list folks

873
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,979
anyway. All right, I've cut this off.

874
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,719
I'm sure we'll talk about this more in the future.

875
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:39,320
Hopefully we find out some more in the coming weeks. Goodness knows

876
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,840
it's, it's wild out there. So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
