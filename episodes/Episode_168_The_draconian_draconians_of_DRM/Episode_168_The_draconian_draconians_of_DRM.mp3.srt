Hello.

1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,300
And welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 168

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,350
with myself Kurtz Fried and my partner in Thought Crime.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,470
Josh Pressers. It's new man.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,360
Uh, well, I was almost bit by an aggressive dog this morning.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,209
Oh, that's exciting.

6
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,030
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,100
So I was walking and, uh, this lady had, you know, about a 1520 ish pound kind of, uh,

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,379
that fluffy white dog.

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,350
But I don't know, whatever, that small fluffy white lap dog type of dog.

10
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,919
Not really. I, I don't know, dog breeds apart from like, the popular ones, you know.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,520
Um,

12
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,830
and, you know, I'm walking on the sidewalk and, um,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,500
the dog notices me and just lunges at me and starts snapping and snarling and,

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,430
and I'm like, you know, who?

15
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,549
And I take a step back because I don't want to get bit by this thing.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
And I'm like, you know, that's, that's a pretty aggressive dog and she's like, oh,

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,810
I'm like, you know what if I was a child?

18
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:52,139
Right?

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,029
Like,

20
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,580
you know what if it attacks somebody and she's like, oh, no,

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,229
no, it's fine. She's, she's perfectly fine with Children.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,979
She only is aggressive towards men.

23
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,230
And I'm like, seriously like,

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,650
ii I didn't know what else to say because clearly this lady just doesn't care.

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,400
And, and she also had the dog on like one of those elastic retractable leashes.

26
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,209
So my, my thinking here is this really,

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,930
I think demonstrates uh kind of a perfect

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,809
example of a security risk incident waiting to happen

29
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,410
much like, you know, an out of date piece of software or, you know, oh,

30
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,250
I don't know what database protecting financial

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,360
details with the password and user name admin

32
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:30,410
a fact.

33
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:32,589
And, um,

34
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:36,809
so this lady knows her dog is aggressive towards men.

35
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,010
She, she's perfectly aware of this fact

36
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:44,379
and there's a couple of really easy things she could

37
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:47,639
do to reduce the risk of this dog attacking somebody.

38
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,860
Uh, number one would be having a leash that's not

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,500
spools out when the dog runs away from you. Right.

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,910
Just actually have it on a proper leash. Right.

41
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:57,730
Right. Right. Number two, she could have put a muzzle on it.

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,150
I believe that's something we typically do with

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,830
aggressive dogs that try to bite people.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,839
I mean, I mean, and I actually tried to,

45
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,459
but,

46
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,149
well, I tried to Google when muzzles were invented for dogs and, and I basically,

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,929
it's, they've been around for so long, nobody knows.

48
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:16,220
I believe that. I mean, it seems pretty obvious.

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:16,860
Right.

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,350
You know, I mean, we even put them on horses and stuff because, you know, there's,

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,539
I've met some bitty horse, one of which had been the nickname Hannibal,

52
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,169
the cannibal,

53
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,389
uh, very bite horse. And again, because he'd been abused and he hated men.

54
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,809
And so everybody at the stable knew that this horse hated men.

55
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,949
So only, you know, women worked with this little nasty pony.

56
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,509
Yeah. Anyways.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,570
But so I, I was just thinking because, like, she knows her dog has a problem.

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,350
She know, like, to be blunt if this dog hasn't hurt somebody,

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,029
it's just a matter of time.

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,029
Right. Maybe

61
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,770
and maybe not. Right. Exactly. Maybe it

62
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,210
never happens, you know. Well, look, man, so

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,850
I deal with this on a regular basis.

64
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,130
I own a dog and my dog is actually really big and really stupid

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,500
and everyone's afraid of him because he looks really scary

66
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:05,149
until you actually see him and interact with him.

67
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,570
And then it's like, all right, this dog is just a big idiot.

68
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,149
And

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,050
so I go to lots of dog things, right. He loves other dogs.

70
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,389
We go to the dog park,

71
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:18,809
we call it school where he goes to like this doggy daycare and it's wonderful

72
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,050
because he runs like crazy and then comes home and just sleeps for a day,

73
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,669
which is marvelous because the dog needs a lot of exercise and I'm fat and lazy,

74
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,039
so I'm comfortable with that.

75
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,690
But anyway,

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,250
you go to a lot of these things and like, for example,

77
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,059
someone's dog will take a big old poop

78
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,250
in the middle of the dog park and then they just walk away and it's like, hey,

79
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,800
now you got to go be picking that up.

80
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:42,220
It's like, oh, it's ok. The rain will come later today. I'm like, no, that's not.

81
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:46,940
And you get this kind of behavior out of people constantly and I think it's

82
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,860
extremely related to security where you have that it won't happen to me aspect.

83
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:54,529
You have the, I'm special so the rules don't apply to me aspect and you have the,

84
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,949
I don't care whatever man

85
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,460
kind of aspect. Right.

86
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,710
Well, that it's, it's externalized. Right?

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,460
He's not going to get that dog crap on his shoes. Right.

88
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,309
Yeah, because he knows where he is, he's walking away from it,

89
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:06,949
you know? Right. Right.

90
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:10,869
And then, and then like the good security person, I am. I go and pick it up. But

91
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,710
I, right. And I think this is human nature where

92
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,529
we have certain rules that have to exist for us to function as part of society.

93
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,910
And if we kind of lay the, the security overlay on top of that, there's

94
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,929
just kind of certain things that have to happen for any environment to be secure

95
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:31,440
and there's always going to be people who are like, I don't need to follow the rules.

96
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,609
I don't need to, to use two factor off.

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,010
I don't need to worry about patching my, you know what I mean?

98
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:39,130
And I think these go hand in hand and it's just kind of,

99
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,369
this is who people are and what they do.

100
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,750
And I mean,

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,299
I think my favorite example of 11 of the solutions to problems like this are,

102
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:49,079
if you give people a choice,

103
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,130
most will probably do the right thing.

104
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,410
But there's always a subset that are going to do what benefits them the most.

105
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,010
And this is like having airbags in cars, right?

106
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,049
Why can't people turn their airbags off?

107
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,364
Well, you kind, they can in some cars, you know, generally speaking,

108
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,704
you can't because a bunch of people would turn them off and then they would

109
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:06,674
die and then they would blame the airbag manufacturers for letting it be turned off,

110
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:07,035
right?

111
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:11,345
Like you need these, these controls that are just built in.

112
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:13,554
One thing I'm thinking is I, I can't help but wonder.

113
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:18,915
So this seems to be a very deep seated human nature type thing, right?

114
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:22,954
And I can't help but wonder if part of it is due to the fact that like up until recently,

115
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,410
resources were scarce, right?

116
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,619
Having enough food, having enough shelter, having clothes,

117
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,049
you know,

118
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:33,230
people forget like cloth used to be incredibly expensive

119
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,730
and difficult to make and clothing by extension,

120
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:39,470
you know, people had like a change of clothes, that's it up until, you know,

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,450
a couple 100 years ago.

122
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,230
And so, I mean, it makes sense if you have something that is a risk,

123
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,720
like let's go back 300 years, you have an aggressive dog.

124
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,369
Well, number one, you're probably really happy about that because that's,

125
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,609
you know, your guard dog.

126
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,929
But, yeah, let's assume for a moment you have an aggressive dog

127
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,750
that's unnecessarily aggressive. Right.

128
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,640
It's attacking people who aren't breaking into your house.

129
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,359
So you could go make or get a muzzle for it. But,

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,269
you know, leather goods again or you have to go kill an animal process.

131
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,570
It tan the hide, cut it up, make a muzzle. This is not cheap.

132
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,290
I mean, it's cheap now because, you know,

133
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,950
manufacturing got ridiculously efficient and plastic.

134
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,649
But, you know, uh, 100 200 years ago, I'm guessing a good dog muzzle would have been

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,570
probably the equivalent of a day or two salary for, you know, a decent job,

136
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:25,510
I

137
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,179
guess.

138
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,170
And so then,

139
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:29,750
well,

140
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,619
are you going to do that or just maybe let your dog bite somebody,

141
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:36,190
especially if they can't really effectively sue you or punish you for that?

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,720
What

143
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,869
is the context of your story to the modern age?

144
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,480
So, essentially this lady has something that she knows might be a problem.

145
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,290
There's a, let me put it this way if that dog does end up biting a person. Well,

146
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,730
it's not a surprise, it's not. Oh, we couldn't have foreseen that. It's

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,970
no, no, no. This lady

148
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,570
knows her dog is aggressive towards men and tries to attack

149
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,359
them and yet she hasn't taken any steps to reduce the

150
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:03,130
risk and what is the bad thing that will happen to

151
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,459
her if her dog does attack and bite a person,

152
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,019
I would assume she maybe gets sued.

153
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,649
Although in Canada it's difficult that, that kind of lawsuit is,

154
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,649
is quite difficult.

155
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,320
So, yeah.

156
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:15,679
No, I mean, it, it, I think fundamentally she's one of those people, you know, that

157
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,420
walks away from the dog poop and somebody else will take care of it. or the rain.

158
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,540
Dude, the rain does not take care of dog poop. I imagine it doesn't,

159
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,640
it does not.

160
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,119
But like I said,

161
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,359
it just got me thinking that this seems to be a recurring theme in security.

162
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:28,440
I mean, uh the,

163
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,549
what's really fascinating to me is Microsoft is doing something sort of,

164
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,119
I don't want to say, get ahead of the race, but they're, at least

165
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
they're addressing

166
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,500
a really fundamentally difficult

167
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,459
problem in security, which is firmware, right? So

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
the way most people think a computer works is that

169
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,100
you have ac pu and hardware and it just runs software

170
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,559
but, you know, you control, that's absolutely not how it works anymore, right?

171
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,540
Your, your hardware comes and we've discussed this in previous episodes.

172
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:57,570
I mean, your average hard drive or your, I mean, your video card. Good Lord.

173
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:01,579
I can't even imagine how many millions of lines of source code are living in

174
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,220
your video card now or on your motherboard or in your CPU you know,

175
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,130
micro code updates.

176
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,529
And so,

177
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,820
uh Microsoft is basically

178
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,820
looking at several problems, one of which is, you know,

179
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,459
firmware that's malicious or mangled or modified

180
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,500
and, you know,

181
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,790
when people load it and it messes up their system or compromises their system.

182
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:23,290
And number two attacks that try to then load hostile, you know,

183
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,019
malicious firmware so that the attacker can stay in your system.

184
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,170
Right?

185
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:31,500
Because I mean, if, if an attacker loads malicious firmware into your CPU,

186
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,729
good luck like getting them out of there, you basically, as we discussed in the past,

187
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,808
you basically have to throw the hardware out and buy new stuff.

188
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,770
You, you can't 100% guaranteed to say we cleaned the system, right?

189
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,999
They're looking at essentially the classic security co processor with, you know,

190
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,119
essentially console type security, you know, like all the,

191
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,359
all the game consoles have, right?

192
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,948
Because the console makers don't want you uh loading,

193
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,528
burned C DS into your console and not paying for games.

194
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:57,359
That is correct.

195
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,799
So, yeah, it's, they,

196
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,328
they're actually apparently in talks with a couple

197
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:02,999
of the major CPU makers and they're actually,

198
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:07,679
it sounds like going to be, I mean, it sounds like there's actually going to be

199
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,000
progress and products coming up in the next few years

200
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,590
helping to address this vulnerability.

201
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,109
And I couldn't help but think that this is

202
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:18,349
going to be especially critical with IOT stuff because

203
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,510
like with a desktop computer, I at least have

204
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,770
like I can uh, I can go to, uh, what is it?

205
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,590
Malware bytes, download their stuff and try and clean the system off. Right.

206
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,250
How do I clean off my internet of things? Light bulbs,

207
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,349
you throw them away and you buy new ones.

208
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:34,380
Yeah.

209
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,799
I mean, I'm completely serious.

210
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,690
It's not worth your time or effort to actually try to recover them.

211
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,400
Well, it's, it's not even possible more to the point, even if it was,

212
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,820
unless these things, I mean, in all seriousness,

213
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,549
unless your device costs more than probably $100 it's more worth your.

214
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,179
There are,

215
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:57,299
there are light bulbs with speakers built in that cost more than 100 bucks an hour.

216
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,580
I believe it, man. The fricking Phillips hue

217
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,200
bulbs, I have the ones that I

218
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,140
had to return. The, one of

219
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,900
that was, I think they're 50 bucks,

220
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,039
which they were gifted to me. I would not pay $50 for a light bulb. But

221
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,380
like, yeah, they're expensive

222
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,340
again.

223
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:17,650
Even if I could clean them though, for $50 would I, I probably would,

224
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,380
I probably throw them away and go buy cheap ones.

225
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,340
Well, more to the point.

226
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,539
So even if you remove the infection or whatever's on there,

227
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,359
you're not going to get a software update to prevent it happening again.

228
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,210
I mean, it probably not. How does this relate to your

229
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,070
dog story? I'm trying to connect these two. Well, essentially that

230
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,969
there are steps we could be taking, but to be honest, as the owner of the dog,

231
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,409
is it worth it to make that effort?

232
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,659
If there's really no significant negative externality and you

233
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,739
just fundamentally don't care about other people getting bitten.

234
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:45,590
You know,

235
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,690
there's always that argument that people should keep their

236
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,330
computers kind of clean and virus free because A,

237
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,409
it benefits them

238
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:52,609
and b

239
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,669
it benefits the rest of us.

240
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,020
You know,

241
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,429
how many systems are compromised in sending out spam or being used for a classic,

242
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,520
the distributed denial of service attacks?

243
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,789
What was the one that took down D DNS back in the day? And it was based on um

244
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,859
uh what specific thing was hacked but those were

245
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,719
routers with what they call the Mariah Botnet.

246
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:13,760
I think it was known

247
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,320
as,

248
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,059
I mean,

249
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,140
OK,

250
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,140
I guess here's the thing

251
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,820
that always eats me

252
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,369
with these security code processors on, on anything

253
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,940
we could get into a long drawn out philosophical debate. But fundamentally

254
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,280
the sort of DRM you're talking about

255
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,150
has historically been used to remove rights from users. It's not,

256
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,750
it,

257
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,640
you could make an argument that it's been about securing the systems to a degree,

258
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,320
but let's face it.

259
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,950
Fundamentally removing rights has been the purpose behind this stuff. And so

260
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:50,070
it has a black

261
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,159
for that. And I think

262
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,150
Microsoft trying to come around now saying, oh,

263
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,609
but think of the Children where we want to do it for the good reasons now,

264
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,849
like I don't buy it, man.

265
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm sorry, I, I don't think I'm gonna, well,

266
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,809
it's tough because Amazon is already doing it

267
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:06,390
right.

268
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,609
Amazon has security code processor in their cloud

269
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,760
stuff Apple has their T two chip in.

270
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:11,650
Well,

271
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:14,239
all of their devices now and I mean there was that

272
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,250
recent USB based exploit that allows you to jailbreak your,

273
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,729
all the previous phones and allows you to get around this uh

274
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,799
all the older security co-processors and, and boot loading,

275
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,250
you know, security in the older Apple devices.

276
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,200
So

277
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,229
whether we like it or not, it's happening. It is, I agree

278
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,929
and whether or not we can disable it.

279
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,460
Like, I mean, I, that laptop, uh, I think I mentioned, you know,

280
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,799
that friend's laptop that I had to fix a few weeks ago,

281
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,190
like I had to go into the bios to disable the trusted boots so I

282
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,419
could boot off of a USB stick that had lyrics and the malware removal stuff.

283
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,840
And that's normal. We still have that control. But yeah, at some point,

284
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,969
well, you know, for your own good, we're taking that away from you and,

285
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:56,890
and as long as they're clear, they've taken it away.

286
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,609
I'm

287
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,010
less grumpy like Apple, for example,

288
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,840
they make no qualms about the fact that we've taken away all of

289
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,210
your ability to do all of this stuff and we don't care.

290
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,469
And while I can disagree with that, I can at least respect them for not pretending

291
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,549
there's some other, like altruistic purpose behind it.

292
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,229
Oh, we're going to make the world a safer place.

293
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,979
It's like, no, you just don't want people to mess with your stuff. It's fine.

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,010
I would say, you know,

295
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,659
apple's gone even beyond the walled garden metaphor into like a

296
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,265
botanical garden where it's like you can walk around and look,

297
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,275
but you better not touch anything.

298
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:33,405
They have a botanical garden with sniper towers, right?

299
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:34,844
Like you get off that path pretty

300
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,525
much like you, you're going home in a bag

301
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,364
and,

302
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,205
but they, they're not,

303
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,544
they don't pretend it's something that isn't,

304
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,864
which I think is the most important part of all this.

305
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,844
If somebody is working on,

306
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:47,765
you know,

307
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,344
signed lockdown firmware that's going to make sure

308
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,684
you can never touch your computer ever again.

309
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,909
Don't pretend it, it's something that it isn't,

310
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,619
is always been my attitude on this stuff.

311
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,309
Like we're not idiots. We know what you're doing. Yeah.

312
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,340
And on the flip side though, I mean, I have, I mean, well, let's go back in time.

313
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,130
Do you remember a

314
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,979
minor CV E incident which involved firmware updates from ac pu

315
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,599
maker that ended up breaking a whole pile of systems.

316
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,599
I mean, I don't remember it off the top of my head,

317
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,849
but I know it's happened more than once.

318
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,890
You know, the whole, uh, heart bleed thing or not heart bleed. Sorry. Uh, what's the,

319
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,789
wow, I'm getting old and forgetful. What was the CPU stuff that was named in all big

320
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:34,289
one. Specter and meltdown. Yeah. Those ones where there's been a bunch of them now

321
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,630
where the whole, yeah, I mean, there's just, what was it with?

322
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,429
Uh, especially if you were running VM ware or something,

323
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,169
you would completely break your system pretty

324
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,200
instantly.

325
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:42,640
I

326
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,760
don't remember.

327
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:45,119
I, I didn't care.

328
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:46,119
I'm not gonna,

329
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,200
I didn't run computers and the internet and whatever. It's fine.

330
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,080
Everything's fine. I mean, I think we need to address firmware security and

331
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,630
part of the brutal, honest truth is we don't

332
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,280
really have any other tools other than DRM,

333
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,859
like nothing comes off the top of my head that would really

334
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,830
make this better other than trying to lock down the process,

335
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,320
make sure only good stuff gets in and,

336
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,799
you know, prevent bad guys from loading stuff. So I would say

337
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,909
this is the same problem we have around writing secure

338
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,780
software which to date we train people and whatever.

339
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,929
There's all these stupid things that don't work.

340
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,070
I, I feel like we are at a tipping point in the world of security where we need

341
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,760
brand new concepts and ideas that don't exist.

342
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,010
Well, we tried that with A, I remember A I and me ML were going to save us all.

343
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,010
I'm still someday the A I will take over and it will be a beautiful day.

344
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,559
I'm, I'm waiting for it but I mean, like, like for real ignoring like our

345
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,280
silly jokes about all the marketing BS around A I and ML.

346
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,679
But I, I think the reason they got so much hype

347
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,760
is because people secretly know

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,789
we need new ways of doing things.

349
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,239
And there was a subset of people that was hoping that was it.

350
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,679
And I think you can safely say

351
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,690
at least up to the point of the time we record this,

352
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,130
that has not been true.

353
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,020
Maybe it will be someday, but it's not true today.

354
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,229
I mean,

355
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:09,530
heck we talked about David Brumley with his for all secure

356
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,289
crazy hacker computer where they won the DARPA Grand challenge.

357
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,409
Like maybe that sort of thing has some potential. But I think fundamentally

358
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,409
we need new ways to do everything we do because the way we do them

359
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,280
isn't working and pretending using Draconian and

360
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,690
DRM to make your firmware more secure.

361
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,289
I'm skeptical it's going to work.

362
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,090
I just, I keep coming back to the, I'm not sure we even,

363
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:33,020
it's not so much that we need new technical ways to solve this.

364
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,820
I suspect a lot of this is just based on the fundamental business

365
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,049
and economics of these problems and that I sold you a device.

366
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:41,090
I got your money.

367
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,919
Cool.

368
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,059
Like why, why am I supporting it?

369
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,320
Uh Well, I mean, historically,

370
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,280
that's been the way nearly all consumer goods

371
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,500
work where once the transfer is complete,

372
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,890
we're all done here

373
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,340
and this is where some of these subscription concepts get

374
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,580
interesting where like obviously I pay Netflix money every month,

375
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,650
right?

376
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,640
That is beneficial to them versus if I would have just written them

377
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,400
a big fat check once and then I use their thing forever.

378
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:09,579
Well,

379
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,420
I can't help but think this is one of the advantages of

380
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,949
cloud computing and that they have to keep your business monthly,

381
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,250
right?

382
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,069
And being secure is going to be a part of that.

383
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,608
Uh Yes, they do except owning a device is different because obviously

384
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,150
how, how, how does that work out? Like

385
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,089
how do I pay for hardware and then pay for a service or whatever? Right?

386
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,869
I have Apple phones and I pay a few extra bucks a month for extra storage.

387
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,729
Same thing with Google, right? I was just watching a review of uh what was it?

388
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:38,140
The new Google pixel four phone that came out.

389
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,479
Yeah, that thing sounds like a hot mess.

390
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:41,770
Yeah, and well,

391
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,329
even better though he pointed out that the free cloud storage uh no longer applies

392
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:50,069
the full quality of the image like the high quality, full quality image

393
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,479
won't you have to pay if you want to store those, basically,

394
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,060
you can store the lower quality ones for free.

395
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,750
And uh so I mean,

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,810
I'll be blunt, these phones top out at what 100 and 28

397
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:01,930
gigabytes.

398
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,709
He was pointing out, you know, if, if you're into taking photos,

399
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,420
you're going to fill that thing up pretty quick.

400
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,349
And if you can't offload the photos.

401
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,469
Yeah, it's going to get full fast

402
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:16,140
so you have to pay for it. So the reality is the majority of hardware, like my

403
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,540
doorbell and security camera.

404
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,510
I mean, they're nice and all and that they work as a doorbell and a security camera.

405
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,209
But the real value is

406
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:27,469
the cloud video storage. So I can refer to an incident, you know,

407
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,030
60 days from now or a month from now or something.

408
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,949
Um, because, you know,

409
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,630
I may not have realized something important happened

410
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,589
or that car that drove by then was,

411
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,140
you know, later spotted,

412
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,430
uh,

413
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,479
associated with burglary in my neighborhood or something. What's your point?

414
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,959
Well, that basically we're there.

415
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:45,040
I,

416
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,599
I think that subscription model and you talked about

417
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,800
how you buy hardware and you own it.

418
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,079
Well, no, I mean, most of the hardware you're buying now

419
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,199
is attached to a subscription service because

420
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,812
that's what the companies want.

421
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:57,853
But I think what they're doing is they front load the

422
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:02,453
cost onto the hardware and then the subscription fees are minimal.

423
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:04,373
Not in the case of Google Photos because holy

424
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,572
crap buying storage from Google is crazy expensive.

425
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:11,133
But I think in the case of most like we'll pick on ring

426
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:15,853
where like the doorbells aren't super cheap and then the service is affordable.

427
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,225
It's pretty pricey. I mean, 60 bucks per, uh, it's, what is it?

428
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,316
30 or 60 bucks per device per year.

429
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:22,495
That's not

430
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:23,786
terrible.

431
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:27,265
And no offense but that video compresses because

432
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:28,105
like

433
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:31,985
it, well, think about it, it's a doorbell looking out at my front lawn. Basically,

434
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,865
the picture never changes

435
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,515
the, I mean, this is exactly what NPE four was designed for.

436
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,826
You know, the mailman walks up, walks back, you just need those,

437
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,229
the data of him walking.

438
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:44,500
The rest of the frame is the same unless it snows literally the, you know,

439
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,699
the that video compress is so tight

440
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,219
that I, I can't even imagine how many,

441
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,520
I I'm guessing my entire video storage back

442
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,479
end at ring is probably tens of megabytes.

443
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:56,880
I bet it's a lot more than that. I bet they have terrible compression.

444
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:58,040
That's my guess.

445
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,239
Ok. But even so whatever I feel like again,

446
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,000
ring, like you don't own your ring doorbell,

447
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,760
I mean,

448
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,099
right. You, you have no control over that.

449
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:13,459
Not at all. And maybe that's the answer is just admitting I have a computer.

450
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:16,579
I don't own it and I'm part of someone's ecosystem

451
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,140
and that's just the way II, I don't know, man, I,

452
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,699
I go around in circles on this one and I think like from my perspective,

453
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't like that.

454
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,260
But I look at my parents and

455
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:26,180
I mean,

456
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,459
their computer is a hot mess because like they,

457
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,250
they don't know what they're doing and they type things into Google.

458
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,890
I'll never forget the time my dad got uh a

459
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,540
virus because he needed Canon printer drivers.

460
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,650
He typed in Cannon printer drivers and ended up on a spam site

461
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,630
that installed like a back door in his computer. And it's like, oh, my goodness.

462
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,800
And I even told him, I said you have to go to Cannon's website. Right.

463
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,829
And, but did he listen? No, because he didn't understand what I told him.

464
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,689
And it was annoying and it was my own fault and

465
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,400
I ended up paying for it anyway because I cleaned it.

466
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:54,780
But

467
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,079
I don't know.

468
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,599
I don't know. And that is part of the problem for me.

469
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:03,430
I hate it and I don't want it, like, I want to be able to do whatever I want with my stuff.

470
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,189
But then I look at my parents and it's like, holy crap,

471
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,430
don't let them do whatever they want to their stuff.

472
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,859
I mean, I looked at building my own security camera system.

473
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,430
Uh, two main options were, uh, the Linux

474
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:14,430
based stuff,

475
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,310
uh, which actually now there's even just a pie

476
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,310
image

477
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,599
like that, you load on a raspberry pie and bam.

478
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:23,849
It's a security camera and then there's a couple of security

479
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,119
camera options like kits where you actually control the data,

480
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,099
have the storage locally, so on and so forth

481
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,699
and they have the full, you know,

482
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,219
thing where it'll alert you via email or your phone or the app or blah, blah, blah,

483
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:34,569
blah, blah.

484
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,959
To be honest, the cost of setting it up and maintaining it,

485
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:42,099
it's definitely more than paying ring 60 bucks per year. Uh, unquestionably.

486
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,739
I agree with that 100%. It's,

487
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't know, I don't know.

488
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:47,209
This is,

489
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:51,400
I don't know what to tell you. And I feel like

490
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,410
again,

491
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,729
we come back to the fact that there is

492
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,670
mostly draconian problems

493
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,349
we're trying to use

494
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,050
or no, I, I, you mean solutions that? Right.

495
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,390
It's draconian solutions to new problems.

496
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,630
And I think we need some breakthroughs in this space and I,

497
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,969
I don't know what they are and if I did, I

498
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,369
probably be not, not doing what I'm doing today. Right?

499
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,109
So, well, I mean, again, a related topic of these. So a vast got hacked

500
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,790
and Nord VPN also got hacked.

501
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:27,530
Everyone got and again, sorry, I said everyone got hacked, man, that's life. Now

502
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,290
it's fine. Everything's fine.

503
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,979
And what, what I can't help but wonder is like just

504
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,650
the,

505
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,290
the amount of time it took for these guys to realize they were hacked and then the,

506
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,489
the really waffly, well, you know, they didn't hack anything that important.

507
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,349
We think so it's ok, hand waving.

508
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,614
That's perfectly normal behavior when someone gets hacked.

509
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,944
Because first of all, they didn't really know what happened, I'm sure.

510
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,104
But then as they learned,

511
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:54,265
they wanted to brush it off as being not true or not

512
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:58,145
as bad as people said it is because that's what people do.

513
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:02,104
But it also makes the story way juicier which gets you way more

514
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,984
attention versus if you're just like here's what happened and then people say,

515
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:05,584
oh OK,

516
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:07,464
I can't help but think a lot of this keeps coming back

517
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:10,635
to sort of that transparency and that food labeling idea of,

518
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:12,165
you know, what like

519
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,510
these cameras, where is the data stored? How you know, how is the data processed?

520
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,510
For example,

521
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,829
my smoke alarms have microphones in them. I did not know that when I was buying them,

522
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,829
that was not mentioned

523
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,670
that was found by accident, right? By somebody,

524
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,989
right? Yeah.

525
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,160
You know, and the fact that uh what is it Google, Alexa

526
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,609
and all of these other things have human beings

527
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:38,099
listening to the conversations and transcribing them for,

528
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:41,469
you know, when the device gets confused and can't figure out what you're saying.

529
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,349
So, you know, they're trying to make it better, right?

530
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,670
So that, you know, they're trying to

531
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,569
um

532
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:49,380
create their machine learning corpus of, you know, Ham and spam as it were

533
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,979
so that they can then train the machine learning on it and

534
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,390
understand people who have accents or whatever better.

535
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,380
But again, you know, this was

536
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,000
my understanding was Alexa

537
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,479
was a computer, you know,

538
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,180
analyzing this data, not actual human beings.

539
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,099
Does it make a difference if it's a human

540
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,589
listening to you versus a computer listening to you?

541
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,260
It's kind of like that classic thing where you

542
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,819
remember call centers had people taking your credit card

543
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,540
number and some of them would like memorize your

544
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,709
credit card number and then rob you later.

545
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:17,729
Uh,

546
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,150
which is one of the reasons I prefer

547
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,579
using online commerce because with the bigger sites

548
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,109
that have generally reasonable security,

549
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,650
I can be reasonably assured that giving them my credit

550
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,709
card number isn't going to result in me having to

551
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:32,530
get a new credit card a month from now when they get hacked,

552
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,050
you know,

553
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,119
versus using my credit card at some dodgy gas station in the middle of nowhere.

554
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,050
You know, with the guy

555
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,140
who's like, oh, the machine's down, I got a

556
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,699
like, I literally have had a cab driver who's like, oh, my machine is down

557
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,920
and he like

558
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:50,319
wrote down my credit card number and CV V code on a slip of paper with the amount

559
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,810
and that thing's getting stolen.

560
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,050
And then I was like, can I get a receipt?

561
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,589
And he's like, yeah, and he handed me a blank receipt and I'm like, ok,

562
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,650
then that's how this works.

563
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,180
Right. He's like, you can put in the amount. I'm like a ha.

564
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,060
Right. I'm expensing my $2000 cab ride now. And

565
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,180
yeah, exactly.

566
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:08,660
So,

567
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,310
so here's my takeaway on that and I don't

568
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,780
want to dwell on it too much because honestly,

569
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,630
I don't think these stories are all that interesting.

570
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,619
I think the Nord story is funny

571
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,359
in a sad way

572
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,369
just because they were kind of ridiculous about everything.

573
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,130
The story isn't, they got hacked.

574
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,250
No one's actually talking about that.

575
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,479
They're talking about the fact that they responded like clowns.

576
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,810
That's the story.

577
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,790
If you don't respond like a clown and you don't try to hide it,

578
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,609
there's no story

579
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,569
because you people say, oh, they got hacked. Oh, ok. Right. That's all great.

580
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,520
But when you,

581
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,260
when you respond to this stuff,

582
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,040
like a clown that becomes a story and nobody ever seems

583
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,150
to remember that that when you try to cover up,

584
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,839
you try to lie,

585
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,930
you try to make things look better than they are that

586
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:53,069
always becomes a story people talk about in that story,

587
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,439
you can't make go away

588
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,640
because the there's literally nothing you can do to make that better,

589
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,199
right? Whereas the other story like, yes, we got hacked and we fixed it.

590
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,229
What do you want?

591
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,670
It's like no, OK,

592
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,099
like there's no more story there, right? It's all done.

593
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,589
Well see and that's there's, you know, I think cloud flare is a good example of that.

594
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,729
Every time they've had a hack or an incident,

595
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,869
it's like here's an incredibly detailed postmortem and we fixed it

596
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,229
and we did a bunch of stuff to make sure it doesn't happen again.

597
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,859
And we put in some new process to like look

598
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:24,829
for similar things that may or may not happen again.

599
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,430
Right.

600
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:25,880
Right.

601
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,449
So they basically they put a muzzle on their dog and got a leash

602
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,270
and put the dog in a crate and took the dog to obedience school.

603
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,540
Like, thank you. But, yeah, most companies don't seem to be willing or,

604
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,640
I don't know that it's not that they're willing to do it.

605
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,859
I think fundamentally, a lot of these companies just can't,

606
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:40,780
because quite honestly if they were,

607
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,420
if they were capable of being competent at security,

608
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,540
they wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. No.

609
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,219
No, I'm going to disagree with you there. I think it's easy to say

610
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,060
you're not competent.

611
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,219
No, I don't mean in the sense they wouldn't get hacked.

612
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,439
I mean, they would still get hacked even with competent people.

613
00:26:56,449 --> 00:27:00,219
But just that, like you said, it would be such a non event because they would be like,

614
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:02,119
well, we, we isolated the problem,

615
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,250
fixed it and put a new process to make sure it doesn't happen again.

616
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,209
Thank you. Bye. II. I can, I mean, I can tell you how this happened is

617
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,310
they probably have pretty smart people at both places.

618
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,449
A bad thing happened and no one knew what to do.

619
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,359
And this is,

620
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:18,709
this comes down to your security leadership is how it ends up being resolved where

621
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:22,209
a good leader can take control of the situation and they can calm the storm.

622
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:26,109
But they also need a certain amount of worldly experience to be able to do that.

623
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,810
Because

624
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,949
if you've never been through an event like this,

625
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,209
you're going to freak out and you're going to make a lot of bad decision

626
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,790
if you've been through an event like this more times than you can count,

627
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,969
you're gonna be like, oh, ok.

628
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,319
Yeah, we can, we can handle this

629
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:43,359
and it makes a huge difference, man. I mean, how many times didn't you?

630
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:47,400
And I go work with heck and still do this where you, you go to an open source project.

631
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,890
It's like I have a security problem.

632
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,319
I need to report to you and they start freaking out and you just say,

633
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,319
I, I will help you. It's going to be ok, here's what you need to do.

634
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:56,959
But if someone isn't there to help them,

635
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,510
they freak out and they start making bad choices.

636
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,630
And this is just, again, it's human nature, right?

637
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
When people are under duress, they don't make good decisions

638
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:07,140
and that's what happened and then the lawyers show up

639
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,699
and the marketing people show up and they're like,

640
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:09,430
oh, I know what to do.

641
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,599
We'll say this and we'll say that and we'll say that and the security people are like,

642
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,689
ok, I guess, sure, why don't you go, go do that, help me out.

643
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,569
And the reality is those people are making it magnitudes worse for you.

644
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,329
So anyway, it, but again, like it, it's security leadership.

645
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,619
That's what it comes down to. If you have, if you have a weak leader

646
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,599
and you have a big problem that appears like you're

647
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,459
in trouble and that's the way it's going to be.

648
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,219
And there's nothing you can do about it because the lawyers and marketing

649
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,920
are gonna take over and they're gonna spin this in some crazy way.

650
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,579
That's going to make the story 100 times worse than it should be. Yeah.

651
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:42,050
No, I'll buy that. I think you're right. Yeah. I,

652
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:42,780
I know,

653
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,050
I'm right because I've been through this on every which side

654
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,359
of it you can imagine more times than I can count.

655
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,719
And I can tell you now, the only way to deal with this is just

656
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,819
tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth right away the first time.

657
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:58,880
And it's much, much better long term. It sucks at first.

658
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,410
But things go away quickly.

659
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,719
Whereas if you try to spin something in the wrong way,

660
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:06,199
the story doesn't die and you get beat up for a very, very,

661
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,329
very long time and it's terrible.

662
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,540
All right. Anyway,

663
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,579
any parting thoughts on that topic, where do people get this training?

664
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,219
Right. Because it doesn't scale to have people learn this on the job.

665
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:18,900
The school of life, Kurt,

666
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,599
the training is from the school of life.

667
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:26,500
There's nowhere you can go. Unfortunately, I don't think that's gonna scale.

668
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,459
I don't think you can teach it. I think you,

669
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,819
this is just how it is. You need like trial by fire man.

670
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:36,839
And I would love to say we can train people to do this stuff.

671
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,359
But I don't, I don't know if you can,

672
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,410
I think you just have to deal with it because I remember when I was young,

673
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,619
I would run around like a crazy person and make terrible decisions.

674
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,380
And I remember I'd get mad at the old guy.

675
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,189
I'd be like, go sit down, go sit down for 10 minutes and then come back in my office.

676
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,489
Like, no, but you don't understand, like,

677
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,800
just go sit down for 10 minutes and then come back and I would like,

678
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,699
I just sat there for 10 minutes and freaked out.

679
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:59,729
And in reality now that I'm an, I'm an old man, I'm the old man telling people to stop.

680
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:00,050
I

681
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,410
get that like in 10 minutes,

682
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,369
nothing is going to change. That's really going to make a difference.

683
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,689
And that's the thing you need to understand. And unfortunately,

684
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,119
the only way to do it is to get angry at an

685
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,369
old man who tells you to go sit down for 10 minutes

686
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,959
and

687
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:14,589
yeah,

688
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:15,280
I,

689
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,020
yeah. Again, it, it's a leadership. Let's pick on CEO training.

690
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,479
Is there CEO training

691
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:24,459
probably. Is it terrible? Probably do the best CEO S take that training.

692
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,300
Definitely not, right.

693
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,010
It's no different.

694
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,910
So, anyway, anyway, all right, man, I think we're going to call it.

695
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,750
