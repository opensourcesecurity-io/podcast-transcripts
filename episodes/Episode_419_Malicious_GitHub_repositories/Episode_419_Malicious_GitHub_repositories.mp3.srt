Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,930
and my partner in reading massive amounts of email.

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,909
-- Josh Bresser, dude,
-- I, I haven't read email in like three days. It's fine.

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,010
Oh, no.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,049
Yeah, it's piling

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:18,239
up.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,870
I can't wait, I can't wait to go back to it. I'm in the middle of a bit of an emergency.

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,649
That should be,

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,469
hopefully by the time this show comes out exactly what's going on will be known,

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:28,260
but it's been been a treat anyway.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:28,920
Anyway.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,400
-- So,
-- um, it's funny because that emergency is kind of related to today's show topic

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,430
which is

13
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:34,930
github

14
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:35,430
getting

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,009
sacked.

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,970
Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:40,569
So there's, there's an article and this has been going around a little bit,

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,319
but I'll just

19
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:41,720
the,

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,849
the title of the article is github besieged

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,900
by millions of malicious repositories and ongoing attack.

22
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,610
And I really like this story

23
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:49,860
because a

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,279
bunch of people are calling this a supply chain attack

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,779
and it's like this is not a supply chain attack,

26
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,830
this is a github

27
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:57,689
attack,

28
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,919
Ashley. I'm gonna disagree with you

29
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,680
because Github is people's supply chain.

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,519
I mean, it is, but this is like saying

31
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,709
anything that happens to github

32
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,760
equals supply chain attack.

33
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,160
Yeah, that, that's how the world works. Now,

34
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:13,989
I don't

35
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,830
-- think
-- I agree with that.

36
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,250
OK. Find me an open

37
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,569
source project, not hosting on github.

38
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,480
OK?

39
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,160
I agree with that.

40
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,080
Github

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,260
is critical path

42
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:24,166
in that regard.

43
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:26,106
It's not just the critical path, it's,

44
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,496
and we're gonna, I'm gonna throw it out. Now,

45
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:29,085
github

46
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:33,125
is the discoverability aspect of open source by and large. Now

47
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:35,335
it is now, I agree with that,

48
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:39,325
but I don't think every single incident

49
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:39,505
at

50
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:42,125
github equals supply chain attack.

51
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:42,456
I'm

52
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:42,606
gonna

53
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,136
disagree.

54
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:45,236
I think it, I I'm not gonna say, OK,

55
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:50,811
single incident obviously, but the this incident very specifically has the intent

56
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:53,891
of polluting the open source supply

57
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:57,101
by getting Typo squatting names, getting close names.

58
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,211
But also for example, perfect example,

59
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,931
I needed a

60
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:04,202
HTML to mark down library.

61
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:05,391
OK. Right.

62
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:07,211
And so I went to P Pie

63
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,919
and there's a couple,

64
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,860
the top rated one was not updated since 2019. I'm like maybe it works, maybe doesn't.

65
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,429
Then I looked on github

66
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,149
and how do you determine what is the best on github?

67
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,679
I mean people love stars and,

68
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,710
-- and, and
-- they are usually a good indicator because it

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,119
can be, they were

70
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,610
a lot of stuff I look at

71
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,070
it works except well now it's not going to because

72
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,679
you're gonna find some garbage repo with 10,000 stars,

73
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,070
10,000 forks.

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,940
We need to explain this story before we

75
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,500
go on because we're already ahead of ourselves.

76
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,490
-- So,
-- so all that's happened is somebody automated the

77
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,699
production, if you will, I guess production is the right word.

78
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,309
Uh the mass production of forks of github

79
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,830
repos

80
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,509
where they make a few changes.

81
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,520
And they're also

82
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,000
to put it bluntly, this is uh this is Web Farm

83
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,850
seo blink farming

84
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:02,160
seo, but they're using it to distribute malware.

85
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,860
Well, and that's the catch, right?

86
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:06,919
So they get this repo that is more popular than the real repo.

87
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:07,320
But what,

88
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,660
what is the attack angle and the attack angle is malicious backdoor software stuff.

89
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,160
Well, it's not just that

90
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,889
they're also going,

91
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,639
it sounds like they're going to like to Discord

92
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:21,929
and forums and places like that and suggesting these links

93
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,679
as a solution to the problem and because they're

94
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,770
spamming these bad repos with stars and forks and things

95
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,580
when an un

96
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,740
suspecting user looks at it, they say, oh, it has 2000 stars. It must be legit.

97
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,800
And I think historically, that was a reasonable conclusion to make.

98
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:44,720
This is exactly how I go and look at restaurant reviews is first of all, I want no, no.

99
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,419
First of all, I want to see a 4.5 and higher,

100
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,580
ideally or four and higher.

101
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,339
But I also look at the number of reviews because no offense.

102
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,869
But if you have a restaurant with 10 reviews and a five

103
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:55,899
star rating like,

104
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,529
yeah,

105
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,729
they got 10 friends to review it.

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,529
Whereas perfect example, we went to Flat Burger the other day.

107
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:05,179
Flat Burger has a 4.9 rating on 450

108
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,410
ratings spanning the three years they've been open.

109
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:10,559
I mean, that's not bad. D A 4.9 is not bad.

110
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,270
-- No, that's
-- spectacular. No, I was more thinking the 450 ratings.

111
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh, yeah.

112
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,230
So 450 ratings over three years. And it's like, so there's consistency there.

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,720
Right, going back three years.

114
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
So I'll look at the oldest ratings and the

115
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,660
newest ratings because I also have been to a,

116
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,100
a really high rated restaurant

117
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,140
that had just changed hands. And then when I actually,

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,390
after ordering I'm like, this is wonky,

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,959
what's going on and I looked at the newest ratings.

120
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,359
I'm like,

121
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,040
oops, I've made a horrible mistake

122
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,679
and this is exactly what's happening. Is it pollutes discoverability

123
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,630
and validation? And now you have to do more. It's not enough to just

124
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,739
like, type in, you know, html to,

125
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:50,950
uh, mark down Python and, you know, the top three results are probably ok.

126
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,890
Well, now there's a whole bunch of malware and stuff like that. Ok.

127
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,089
Well, I guess I'll look at like,

128
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,429
Forks and Stars to see who's the most popular and well established.

129
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,589
Well, that's not helpful anymore. Ok.

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,649
Now I have to look at which one's kind of been around for more than a few years

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,269
and all of a sudden you're asking people to

132
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:06,950
uh need to be experts

133
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,962
in reading the tea leaves of github

134
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:09,481
repos

135
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:12,242
-- to determine what's good and bad.
-- Sure. Sure.

136
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:16,041
And, and that's a related problem, I think,

137
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:20,571
but I would not call it necessarily a supply chain problem specifically.

138
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:23,502
-- I think it's maybe related.
-- Can I make a suggestion?

139
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,471
I think I know what the problem is but github

140
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,652
has effectively become something like pi pie or N PM Js.org.

141
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:32,802
-- But it does not behave like that.
-- It does not,

142
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,342
-- but people treat it like it
-- is.

143
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,641
These Attackers could almost certainly publish

144
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,053
these packages into pie pie or N PM, right?

145
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,213
Like it's been proven time and time again that

146
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,903
the verification process is not amazing there. Right.

147
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:45,303
Right.

148
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:48,694
But they also have done that in the past and the name space owners have cleaned it out.

149
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,623
I mean, that's fair and well, and I guess

150
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:54,074
the other aspect of that is if you look at pie pie,

151
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,813
it becomes harder to fake

152
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:01,563
-- the the like linkages and
-- well, there's no forks and stars,

153
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,194
not just that.

154
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:06,414
No, no, the the like pi pie and M PM will say like, oh, there are 4000

155
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,346
and other

156
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:12,985
projects using this dependency and that you can't fake, right? You can't,

157
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:16,645
-- well, you could, but it would be really hard,
-- you can fake it. But

158
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:20,226
but it's also easy to detect because it's an island, it's a new island. And

159
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,265
so that's why remember all these people who are always like,

160
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,705
hey, you got a great blog. Can I get a link in there

161
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:31,036
because they want, they want to connect their island to the mainland

162
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:32,376
for sure. And so,

163
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:35,686
but I think this is a key thing. I just, I never thought about this but

164
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:37,328
I know that github

165
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,037
is not

166
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,838
a name space managed,

167
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:41,338
it is name space managed,

168
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,567
but they don't behave like a name space managed place like PI

169
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:47,187
P or N PM js.org like perfect example is github.com/red Hat.

170
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:47,838
What is that?

171
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,597
-- As far as I can tell some random guy, I don't
-- think they own that. They were

172
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:52,358
to

173
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:52,597
get

174
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:52,877
it.

175
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:54,977
-- Yeah. And
-- it's some random guy with like two commits. Did

176
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:55,717
they get it?

177
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:56,157
No,

178
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,958
-- they still don't,
-- they still don't.

179
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,928
Red Hat has something like 100 orgs in there. It's a mess.

180
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,308
And so that's the problem is github

181
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,988
does do name space management

182
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:05,787
but they don't

183
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,029
do curation is maybe the word I want to find or

184
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,839
look for and but people treat it like they do.

185
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,089
-- I
-- I think

186
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,769
something you said is important, especially when it comes to

187
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,750
github. As you were mentioning, you're talking about an island, right?

188
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,570
I think by definition,

189
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,980
Github is basically a bunch of islands that are not necessarily connected.

190
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:27,970
What's the world?

191
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,010
It's the world

192
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:29,429
is

193
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,119
the world,

194
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,309
but it's we don't have the kind of connective

195
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,880
tissue in a lot of ways specifically on github

196
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,929
and I think

197
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,760
it, it, you are correct at the beginning when you mentioned there's

198
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,809
like a certain amount of like trust and authority

199
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:46,440
in github

200
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,540
things going on. Right. Rightly.

201
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:52,079
So, because generally speaking, it's where everything is going on today.

202
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,540
Well, implicitly, I have to trust github because I

203
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,149
have to trust github.

204
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,619
Like I, I have,

205
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,160
I have over 100 and 50 fork repos in my personal thing because it's all stuff I use

206
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,170
and need and I want to have a copy of it in case they ever delete the repo,

207
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:08,369
right? I'm

208
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,359
here with this. I

209
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:09,510
do

210
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,470
-- the same
-- thing and it makes me laugh when people are like, oh, you shouldn't do that.

211
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,579
And I'm like, what? And they're like, you should,

212
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:16,795
you should start it, not fork it, forking takes space and I'm like, well,

213
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,475
you can start and fork.

214
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:22,904
That's not how enterprise disk storage and git works.

215
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,274
It's I'm not taking up any space, I promise.

216
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:28,424
-- Oh, wait,
-- they're saying forking is using up this space.

217
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:29,875
Yeah, they don't understand how git works

218
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:34,474
anyways. It was funny because I was like, I'm gonna not even try and educate them, but

219
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:35,690
regardless

220
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,500
github

221
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:44,299
gives the sheen of authoritative trust just like a linkedin page for a company.

222
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:45,739
-- I mean,
-- to a degree.

223
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,039
Now, I, I think there's another piece to this though we need to bring into play

224
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,419
is so there are Attackers

225
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,380
doing the shenanigans on github,

226
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:54,890
but github

227
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,489
is also fighting them

228
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:57,070
and they

229
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,755
taking down a ton of this stuff on a pretty regular basis. So it's not like

230
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,966
Github's just sitting there throwing their hands in the air and saying, oh,

231
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,065
poor little Github.

232
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,375
There's nothing we can do.

233
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:09,356
Poor Microsoft. If only they had some security and technical expertise to battle,

234
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,195
maybe you could start a gofundme to, to hire security people or something. Right.

235
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:16,426
I mean, and that's the good news is at least it's github

236
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:17,955
that's getting whacked by this because they

237
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,635
have the backing of Microsoft and Microsoft.

238
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,182
It does have several decades of

239
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,581
like dealing with fancy Bear, let alone these people.

240
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,831
Yeah, they're pretty good. They know what's up for sure,

241
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,302
for sure. But the problem is, for example, there's some very

242
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,341
conceptually simple things they could do

243
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,781
to really murder this like we did with DNS tasting, which is like a 25 cent fee.

244
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:36,581
But then github

245
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:39,682
would become literally unusable for everybody without a credit card,

246
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,981
which globally is a lot of people.

247
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,349
So one of the problems is github because they want to

248
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:48,599
be accessible and available to the community and to the world.

249
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,960
Well, that makes life for Attackers a lot easier

250
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,500
and that I think is one of the interesting challenges here.

251
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,559
I I don't think I would say it makes life for Attackers easier. I think

252
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,039
Attackers are opportunistic

253
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,739
and defenders by definition have to chase the Attackers.

254
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,900
It's the perpetual cat and mouse game right?

255
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:12,400
And now you have Attackers focusing on this particular aspect

256
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,010
of github

257
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,520
and now it is fundamentally up to github

258
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,190
-- to decide how to react to that. And for now they're taking down repos.
-- And I like that

259
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:22,765
not even pretending

260
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:26,515
that the end users being affected like the people on Discord server saying, hey,

261
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,044
how do I do X?

262
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,914
And somebody's like, oh there's a library that does X here it is.

263
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:33,645
I like that we're not even pretending that we can educate those people.

264
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,184
Like, no, no, we can't. This is like this to me is the phishing thing.

265
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:41,315
Like I love that phishing is like who educate users to only click trustworthy links.

266
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:42,724
And I'm like, cool, it goes through bitly,

267
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,520
is it trustworthy or not?

268
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,559
And they're like, uh

269
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,049
it's

270
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,039
-- like
-- this, this can't be up to use. I mean, this is where

271
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,130
so as much as I've complained about it and I complained about it constantly.

272
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,340
Like the open SSF has their scorecard project,

273
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:59,429
which I still think is fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons because there's

274
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,109
the lack of scientific rigor behind the score.

275
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,119
But like this is an example of the kind of thing

276
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,919
that

277
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,299
I think we need to understand better is what are the signals

278
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,309
in like github

279
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,250
and open

280
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,330
source projects and dependencies and things like that.

281
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,289
Like what are the signals that actually matter in that data?

282
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,409
And the trick too is that there are the

283
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,979
counter examples like youtube downloader is a perfect example,

284
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,690
youtube Downloader, youtube dash DL is effectively broken and dead last I checked.

285
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,869
Maybe they fixed it but for over a year

286
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
they haven't done a release because some release,

287
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,080
part of their process is broken and youtube made a change in the I DS.

288
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,020
And so it doesn't work anymore and there's like a,

289
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,070
like a couple of line fix you can do to make it work,

290
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,039
but somebody forked it. YT dash D LP.

291
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,729
And not only did they fix that, but they've been keeping it up to date.

292
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,580
Yeah, that's the one you want.

293
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,229
But, and

294
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,789
well,

295
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,250
that could have also like,

296
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,820
and that's kind of what these malicious people are preying on is like, oh,

297
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,260
we forked it and we're making it better.

298
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,380
We're improving it, we fix this problem, whatever,

299
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,580
you know.

300
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,960
And the thing is there's also a lot of repos that are like stale that you can fork,

301
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:02,840
like things that haven't been updated in years.

302
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:07,030
And so it's forked and like there's some new commits like, oh, well,

303
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,950
this looks better and more up to date,

304
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,419
I guess it is like you're not going to audit that.

305
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,400
Like, come on,

306
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:13,390
we're gonna

307
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:13,750
grab

308
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,650
the most recent reasonable sounding, you know,

309
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:20,369
html to mark down Python Library that we can get our grubby little hands on.

310
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,760
Right. But, but now I will say that

311
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,479
I think historically

312
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,570
no one would have thought twice about just

313
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,309
looking solely at Stars and Forks and I think

314
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,760
for the

315
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:30,770
future

316
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,710
people are still going to do that. Right.

317
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,659
Yeah,

318
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,530
I mean, I will also look for example,

319
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,419
at the commits because there's typically the pattern is there's

320
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,700
one person with like 80 or 90% of the commits

321
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,340
and then there's like a long tail

322
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,460
and then I kind of look at that person and in some cases, you know, like

323
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,059
-- curl, it's like, oh yeah, I know that guy who was on the show, he's trustworthy.
-- Ok.

324
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,739
So I've just changed my mind.

325
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,940
I do think you can call it a supply chain attack,

326
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,520
but I'm going to create two buckets for supply chain attacks.

327
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,619
There's the, we'll say existing supply chain attack, which this is not.

328
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,820
And then there is, we'll say more of a Greenfield supply chain attack.

329
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,059
And I think they're, they're very, they're very different

330
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,700
-- when you kind of think about them. Can I
-- suggest the word is

331
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:10,590
the first one is targeted and the second one is

332
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,979
sort of like putting out a box saying free kittens,

333
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:15,739
but it's actually full of alligators.

334
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,929
Like it's opportunistic. It's, you know what I mean?

335
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,880
-- Like it's, it's kind
-- of what it is, it kind of

336
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,169
is I would for now,

337
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,799
I would be comfortable saying targeted and opportunistic.

338
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,219
I mean, that's kind of all attacks work like that though.

339
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:28,409
But in supply chain,

340
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,700
especially like this is back to the whole like fishing email thing is like

341
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,190
there's fishing where it's uh what is it? Spearfishing?

342
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,380
Yeah, spearfishing where,

343
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,250
like I find out your CEO S name and his name of his dog

344
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,739
and then I find out your CFO and I email your CFO saying like,

345
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,049
hey, my dog is sick and I need you to send me like gift cards to pay the vet.

346
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,299
I need itunes gift cards to pay the vet.

347
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:47,840
I love

348
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,020
it.

349
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,299
And then there is

350
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,900
the kind where you just blast out

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,010
a

352
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:54,369
million emails and hope one person clicks and you don't really care who.

353
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,299
And maybe it's high value, maybe it's low value, don't know.

354
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,570
You know, it's kind of, it's this,

355
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,020
it's like those people who walk around jiggling car doors to see

356
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,840
if your car's locked or not and if it's not locked,

357
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:06,330
they like go into your glove box and grab your, uh, your car wash changer or whatever,

358
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,799
you know, you keep in your glove box

359
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:09,780
and I think that's part of it is

360
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,190
the industry has never been good at these opportunistic attacks at scale because

361
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,239
I can basically solve them sort of for myself.

362
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,729
But that doesn't help anybody else. Like I could have the best anti spam on the planet

363
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,429
and spam is still going to be a problem for everybody else.

364
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,849
Same thing with the same thing with everything else

365
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,820
that's very normal. I think in, in this context is

366
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:35,609
like I have locks on my doors it doesn't really affect

367
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,479
me if you put locks on your doors or not.

368
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:41,969
In fact, it might be a benefit to me if you don't have locks on your doors because now,

369
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,210
now you're the easy target and maybe they won't get to me.

370
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,770
Yeah.

371
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,380
And so this is like, I see people

372
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,651
when I see people grabbing code and using software and all that, they're just,

373
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,870
what choice do they have?

374
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,801
They don't, if they have the expertise to audit this stuff, by definition,

375
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,991
they wouldn't be on stack overflow asking how to do it.

376
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:03,231
I want to say something right now that you often hear people talking about, oh,

377
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:06,351
you have to verify your dependencies and you have to inspect this.

378
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:06,830
No,

379
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:11,171
the reality is almost all developers unless they have

380
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,072
like some heavy handed security or risk department above and

381
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,111
funding.

382
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,012
Right. Yeah.

383
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,642
Well, that too, you need the funding for it,

384
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:22,192
but most developers are going to just like literally take whatever source code

385
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:23,952
they find laying on the ground and they're going to use it.

386
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,252
If it solves the problem they have, they don't care where it came from.

387
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,091
Stupid question at Redhead. Did we truly validate?

388
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:31,992
Like, as far as I know,

389
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:34,021
I don't know anybody that ever read like all

390
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:35,692
the source code for something we were shipping,

391
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:39,481
we didn't read the source code. But I would say for one thing, it was a different time,

392
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,771
right? Where I think it was the, the projects,

393
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,953
they had a much higher bar of entry, I think in a lot of instances.

394
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:49,072
And additionally, the thing Redhead did that was really quite clever

395
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:53,312
is they would often hire people from these ecosystems to work on things.

396
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:53,963
So for example,

397
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:58,713
you weren't just like dumping some random person into packaging up pearl things.

398
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,793
You had a actual pearl developer

399
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:03,672
and they understood what was going on and,

400
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:07,172
and most of those dependencies weren't there specifically.

401
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,182
It was I want to package this piece of software,

402
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:11,072
but this piece of software has these dependencies.

403
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,304
So I also need those. And again, in that instance,

404
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:16,133
you have no choice, you have to package those.

405
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,114
If you want the thing, you actually want to work, right?

406
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,814
No, I think going back to this,

407
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:23,773
I think the problem too is that these attacks are getting much cheaper,

408
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,424
especially with A I being available to kind of

409
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:29,734
like like doing the scripting to and you know,

410
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:31,693
to fire up a VPN connect to github,

411
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,174
create an account, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

412
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:35,133
Yeah, they're totally doable.

413
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:39,153
Um Even if you have all the the the the cloud flare

414
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:43,155
verification blocks and you know, captions and like move a little like which,

415
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,445
which green frog is standing the right way things.

416
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:49,515
Yeah, you have a person do that takes some 10 seconds. You pay them a dollar an hour,

417
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:50,635
they grind through these.

418
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:54,715
Like that's, that's a well established market capability. For Attackers.

419
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,234
And so the problem becomes like,

420
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:00,195
because I remember gaming this out in my head at Red Hat and kind of bringing it up.

421
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:00,655
I was like,

422
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:04,973
how are we protecting the email address that people report stuff to at Red Hat?

423
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,194
Because like what happens if we get a flood of crap?

424
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:10,000
Like, what are we going to do? Because we, we got

425
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,770
like, we got emails that were like, very,

426
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,170
I don't want to say suspect.

427
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,079
And once in a while they turn out to be a gem of like, oh my goodness,

428
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,689
we need to go deal with this crisis

429
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:23,540
and a lot of them were not like, like ftp.redhead.com has source code on it and like uh

430
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,868
yes it does. That's the point.

431
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,618
But the problem

432
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:29,280
is what do you do when you get 100 emails a day?

433
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,619
I remember hearing one time that Microsoft security

434
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,949
at or whatever that, that email address was gets like literally like,

435
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,560
I think it was 300,000 emails a year.

436
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,109
That's it.

437
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,709
That's it

438
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,520
1000 a day globally.

439
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,239
That's a lot of email.

440
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,420
Also. Security at microsoft.com is their old campus security email address.

441
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:50,890
They're actually

442
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,530
one is I forget what it is.

443
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,119
1000 emails a day is an absurd amount for humans to sit through.

444
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:58,819
-- I
-- get

445
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,060
a

446
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,959
get 1000 a day. There's no

447
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:06,219
not counting that crap. I mean, like, and this is you're not sending github

448
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,939
spam to like your security address. Right.

449
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,550
Well, but what I'm saying is like,

450
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,859
what happens when you start getting 1000 or 10,000 or 100,000 emails?

451
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,489
Part of what's interesting is it breaks

452
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,170
discoverability because how do you actually have

453
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:19,599
determined?

454
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:23,170
Like, oh, like, remember that time those random guys in New Zealand,

455
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,270
the right point of sale software

456
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,530
found a flaw and came to us and I'm like, oh my God,

457
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,500
we're gonna help you and it even affected IIS and I

458
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,349
had to go talk to Microsoft and stuff like it was,

459
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,229
I I can't even remember the vulnerability now,

460
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,229
but they were like,

461
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,420
like we were point of sale software. We don't want to deal with this.

462
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,609
Like we want to sell point of sale systems,

463
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:45,550
but we found this nasty proxy security clothing that affects Apache, you know,

464
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,989
and on further testing, it affected everything,

465
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:48,670
right?

466
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,819
You can't discount kind of these random sounding weirdos because

467
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,839
no, no. And I'm not saying you should,

468
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm not saying you should at all.

469
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,420
-- But the
-- problem is what choice do you have when

470
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,170
you get say 1000 of these a day from random people

471
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,469
that are A I generated like curl is dealing with

472
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,930
this where people are using A I tools air quotes,

473
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,119
-- right
-- to generate these like

474
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,849
really not great

475
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,430
security reports.

476
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,420
I mean,

477
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,979
there's I I think you've conflated different

478
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,349
problems together and you've made this confusing.

479
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,329
So let's ignore all of the email and reports and all that and go back to

480
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:24,939
github

481
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,800
and the challenge to github

482
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:31,099
now becomes we historically use things like Stars and Forks

483
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:34,469
to try to discover the signal hiding in the noise.

484
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,290
And

485
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,239
github

486
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,829
is probably going to work really, really hard to keep that true

487
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,949
because it's in their best interest to have the ability for users to know

488
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:48,540
what they're looking at is like a real thing versus a bad thing,

489
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:48,939
right?

490
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:49,430
And

491
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,939
I'm sure they're doing a ton of things that they aren't going to tell

492
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,849
us about because one of the things that happens are these sort of detections,

493
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,979
you can't advertise what you're doing because then Attackers work around them.

494
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,079
Well, that's the problem like, yeah,

495
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,319
with all of these security measures for anti spam basically is,

496
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,050
yeah, if you tell people what you're doing, then they engineer around it.

497
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,880
-- And they also do, you know black box testing essentially where
-- they

498
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:09,959
seo, right?

499
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:14,540
This is why no one knows what Google's algorithm actually does because if we did,

500
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,030
like the seo problem would be a million times worse than it is now.

501
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:25,750
And so we now as developer have this problem of ascertaining

502
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:29,290
like what is good versus what is potentially not good in,

503
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,719
in this whole like open source ecosystem.

504
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,760
And this has been a problem that's building for a long time.

505
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,079
And like security people have been complaining about this for forever

506
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,359
claiming, you know, someday you'll be sorry, which will never happen. But

507
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,380
I do think this is

508
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,689
we are coming to a point

509
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,890
where there is so much open source and, and

510
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,890
let's pretend every github repo equals open source you're talking about, you know,

511
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,969
like probably tens to hundreds of millions

512
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,030
of things.

513
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,770
And we now have to start unwinding all of this.

514
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:04,270
The thing that gets me is finding a

515
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,849
library to scratch my itch is

516
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,300
often

517
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,099
the biggest challenge I have is not finding a library. The scratches my,

518
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,430
just that I find 10 or 20 or 30.

519
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,579
And then it's like, ok, the one that had, you know,

520
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,520
basically my rule of thumb is anything not updated in the last two years

521
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,060
because it'll have a bug at some point that I need fixed. So, ok, let's ignore that.

522
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:23,750
And then, you know, like,

523
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,579
and I kind of winnow it out and I'll end up

524
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,260
with two or three and then I'll try them and like,

525
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,369
whatever, whichever one kind of works first.

526
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,739
I just sort of go with that. Like, I'm not going to spend a ton of time,

527
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:32,699
you know,

528
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:34,060
uh I,

529
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:36,449
I just, I don't have a ton of time.

530
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:39,500
Like I could spend five hours evaluating these libraries or I could spend five

531
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,449
minutes valuing the libraries and four hours

532
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,510
and 55 minutes writing the software I need

533
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,890
and be done with it. Right.

534
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,869
And

535
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,560
with github, I've already seen

536
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,369
github

537
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,810
search is

538
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,739
not useful really anymore.

539
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:56,180
To put a belly.

540
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,589
And I'm gonna actually generalize that

541
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,680
traditional algorithmic search as we think of it like.

542
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,560
So this is going back to the days of like Alt Vista,

543
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,400
which for those of you that are under the age of 35 or 40

544
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,699
alt Vista was, you know, a web search engine that crawled a big chunk of the web.

545
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,569
And then you could look for keywords using and or not. And it was amazing because

546
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,119
that

547
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,000
Netscape

548
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,989
directory and Netscape directory was literally

549
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,329
a list of links somewhat categorized and

550
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:27,930
you had to click through them and like find the page on cats.

551
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,160
Well, there were only 10 cat pages at that time.

552
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,109
It was fine,

553
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,709
but I think algorithmic search is dead for two big reasons. One,

554
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,020
there's too much stuff and teasing out the teasing out the

555
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,390
signal from the noise using the traditional algorithmic approaches like,

556
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,770
oh

557
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,729
like pagerank was amazing because

558
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,209
instead of like, oh this page has all the keywords.

559
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:49,500
It's like, oh,

560
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,449
this page has all the keywords and 10 different sites linked to it clearly.

561
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:53,260
That's the better one

562
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:57,064
until you know seo link blog spam stuff,

563
00:22:57,074 --> 00:23:00,214
-- which
-- I guess ironically is basically the way

564
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:02,915
looking at stars and forks work on github,

565
00:23:03,104 --> 00:23:04,435
right? It's that idea.

566
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:07,035
It's exactly the same thing and I'm going to pause it.

567
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:10,275
The second problem is algorithmic search is too easy to game,

568
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,319
right? It's just too easy to generally abuse at

569
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,969
scale. Though, how do you have

570
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:17,209
a

571
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,760
trustworthy person sort of review a library and give a consensus of it.

572
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,540
Because for example,

573
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,510
I do this all the time where I go like alternative to

574
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,020
X and I find some blog post where they compare several alternatives

575
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:27,800
for, you know,

576
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,260
downloading web pages or whatever and they're often I

577
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,140
know incorrect or missing stuff because I'm like,

578
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,160
oh,

579
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,520
there's also this solution that's better or

580
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,819
this solution that's better or whatever.

581
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,959
And I hate to say it, but I like, apart from a, I,

582
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,780
I don't see any tools that are going to allow

583
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,319
us to categorize and analyze this data at scale.

584
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,579
I'm, I'm skeptical a,

585
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,500
I could do it either because there's too much

586
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,150
crap and A I struggles to cut through crap.

587
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,599
I mean, that's the current it might someday.

588
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,609
But I think the reality is and let's focus on open

589
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,180
source because I'm not going to turn this into some,

590
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:58,079
like, bizarre A I discussion.

591
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:00,225
But like from the open source angle, right?

592
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,176
We have all these open source projects,

593
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:05,066
we need to try to figure out what's good and what's bad and like,

594
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,105
lots of organizations are trying to do this.

595
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:10,156
You have all these open source program offices that huge companies,

596
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,465
you've got all these foundations doing some of this work

597
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:15,426
and the reality is like, we don't exactly know what to do.

598
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:18,456
And for the most part it's cargo, cult security

599
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:20,776
where you've got people saying we're going to do this

600
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,702
and it seems to work. So we're just going to keep doing this thing and assuming it was

601
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,472
they have, they don't have the resources

602
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:26,911
to do A B testing.

603
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:29,011
Like you want me to do twice as much work,

604
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:29,741
right?

605
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:33,161
The other thing that I was just thinking, for example,

606
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:36,991
in theory, if we had feedback loops like, oh you know, of these two libraries,

607
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,812
1000 people use this library and it works without too much

608
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:43,371
trouble and 1000 people use this library and are constantly complaining about

609
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:43,501
it.

610
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,060
So for example, looking at github

611
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:48,459
issues might be kind of helpful. But again, there's like

612
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,979
people don't report issues unless it's really bad.

613
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:57,130
Right. Right. So II, I generally, I don't know what the answer to this is.

614
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,020
And I think honestly one of the better answers is to have

615
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,140
a

616
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,849
really good end to end testing framework so that if

617
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:05,880
you start plugging and unplugging stuff in the middle,

618
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,800
you'll kind of know if it breaks or not

619
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:08,800
for sure.

620
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,910
But again, that's like saying, you know,

621
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,880
have you tried being less poor to the answer of like, how do we solve world hunger?

622
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,140
It

623
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,920
is. Yes.

624
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,250
I mean,

625
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,250
I think the thing I'm coming back to right now and maybe this is a foolish connection.

626
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,250
But it's like when we were talking to Tama a while back and he was,

627
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:24,800
you know,

628
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,160
going on about how there's like all this open source that

629
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,319
is like critical path and functionally abandoned at this point.

630
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,369
And this is where some of the groups like the Sovereign Tech Fund, for example,

631
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,109
like that might be a good example is

632
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,410
the sovereign, if the Sovereign Tech Fund is, is financing a project,

633
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,040
that's a pretty good signal, I'd say. Right.

634
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,819
Well, and actually it's funny because I just,

635
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,550
I finished the evaluations and one of the questions

636
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,369
I had for several of these people is what?

637
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,640
Ok.

638
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,520
Now you have to tell people what you're doing

639
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,160
-- with the Sovereign Tech Fund because they don't
-- know.

640
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,270
Ok, so I did some base. So for the Sovereign Tech Fund, they hired a bunch of

641
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,964
people like myself to essentially stack rank a

642
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,584
couple of projects for funding to determine,

643
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:05,734
you know, which one should we fund.

644
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:11,165
-- Let's ask these experts and why and
-- the projects have to request to be funded, right?

645
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:14,645
-- This isn't like random projects. No,
-- this isn't like cash cab.

646
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:16,640
That's

647
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:16,819
not

648
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,410
-- really also,
-- that's, that would be, you know, hi, I'm from the Sovereign Tech Fund.

649
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,589
We'd like to give you money.

650
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:23,550
That's I don't think I'm gonna make it

651
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,599
answer

652
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,260
10 questions.

653
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,260
But anyways,

654
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,180
so with respect to the Sovereign Tech Fund,

655
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:31,349
one thing I'm noticing is some projects wanted

656
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:34,829
money to essentially pay people to do stuff

657
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,199
on sort of a like sort of very specific stuff like um there was one, it's a web

658
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:44,280
related thing and it's like we need HTTP three support. We cease to be relevant.

659
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,770
And I'm like, yes, that is correct.

660
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,790
I mean, that's fair.

661
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,709
Totally fair.

662
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:50,520
And, but that's interesting because that's kind of like implement HTTP three.

663
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,989
And then, well, it's, it's,

664
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:55,599
I don't want to say done, but it's in maintenance mode and it's, you know, it's a,

665
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:58,430
there's a heavy shift at first and then sort of a maintenance cost.

666
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,989
But some of them, it was like, it was a, it was a project for the base,

667
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:03,035
a single person

668
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:04,545
which is most projects

669
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:08,045
and they basically want to be paid to work on the project full time for 12 to 18 months.

670
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:10,545
Fair. But then my question is what happens next,

671
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:14,234
like when the sovereign tech funding ends, what's the plan? And, and

672
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:17,604
we don't really get to ask them these questions, but I'm kind of in my head.

673
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:18,645
I'm like, well, is this

674
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:20,244
better or worse?

675
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:23,405
I mean, that's a perpetual problem of nearly every, like

676
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,290
we'll say, charitable type organization.

677
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,420
You know, like a lot of nonprofits, they don't have a,

678
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,109
a expected funding source forever.

679
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,670
They have to live a year by year that's partially taxes and just the way it works.

680
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,290
But, but I'm also wondering from like the perspective of the software,

681
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,530
so the software kind of gets this, like,

682
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,260
really great boost for 12 months and then goes back to being, being ignored

683
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:44,770
overall.

684
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,569
Well, it was already being ignored. So I think this is better. Right.

685
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,640
We went from being like, our choices were be ignored and stay ignored or be ignored,

686
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,119
be loved for 12 months and then be ignored again.

687
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,530
Well,

688
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,099
-- we're back to being ignored so they
-- assume they

689
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,189
-- will be funded for multiple years.
-- I

690
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:00,729
don't know

691
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,280
how it works.

692
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:02,589
We,

693
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,060
we don't know for sure.

694
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,890
So, the Sovereign tech Fund is doing something so brand

695
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,670
new. There's no, there's no precedent to even look back at, you know,

696
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,030
-- but
-- going back to, well, the end state,

697
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,910
if the end state for both is they're both still being ignored,

698
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,550
but one had a bunch of improvements made.

699
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:20,310
That sounds better to me. That sounds like a net gain.

700
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:23,390
Oh, you're saying, paying for specific improvements.

701
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:23,869
What I'm

702
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,290
saying is we pay the person to work on it for 12 months and

703
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,550
they vastly improve it and then they go back to not working on it.

704
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,410
So the end state for both is funded or unfunded, it's still ignored,

705
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,989
but one has a bunch of improvements,

706
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:35,329
I guess.

707
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,910
Like that's a benefit, right. That

708
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,079
like it's not,

709
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,489
we're not worse off is what I'm saying.

710
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:41,989
Right.

711
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,109
And I, I'm wondering,

712
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,540
I think part of this is just

713
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,589
at this scale and at this,

714
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,229
I don't know what to call it price point at this whole,

715
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,540
free as in not just free as in freedom, but free as in beer.

716
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,469
I think this is just sort of how it works and

717
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,469
most people will totally get away with grabbing

718
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,969
random stuff because they'll probably grab stuff that's not

719
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,290
fine.

720
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,089
But

721
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,050
there are the really

722
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,920
less educated people who, you know, like that, that crypto wallet

723
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:14,130
that grabbed some locking code and it

724
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,579
logged

725
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,430
everything including the private seeds and then that bucket of data logging,

726
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,170
data leaked

727
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,650
and they all got whacked and all their crypto got stolen.

728
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,239
So

729
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,150
there isn't a nonzero chance of something truly measurably

730
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,770
like a whole bunch of money gets stolen,

731
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,530
bad happening.

732
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,160
But the flip side is,

733
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,719
well, what choice do these developers have?

734
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,420
Well, I mean, today we don't and I think this is one of the discussions

735
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,359
that we have to have moving forward and and it's not even that

736
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:45,280
we have to have answers coming out of the the podcast episode.

737
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,469
It's just the fact that

738
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,170
this is a topic that I think is coming up more and more often, right?

739
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,800
It was like literally

740
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,869
the focus of our chat with

741
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,770
Tama a couple of weeks ago, you're seeing

742
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,369
signals from various governments. The Sovereign Tech Fund exists.

743
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,270
I heard France is trying to do something very similar to the sovereign tech fund.

744
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,579
You've got the US government

745
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:06,020
had that whole like

746
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,400
that call, a request for comment about open source usage. So

747
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:11,709
I think

748
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:17,869
we have a number of organizations starting to kind of wake up to this. And I think as,

749
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:21,579
as individuals, while we can't necessarily impact

750
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,900
the like giant machine

751
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,400
that will call open source. What we can do is make sure that

752
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,819
the various organizations we have sway over, be it your government

753
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,300
or maybe some foundation you work with or work for whatever.

754
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,089
Like those are the places we need to

755
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,500
keep giving them little pokes constantly and saying,

756
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,989
what are you doing about this? How are we moving this forward?

757
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,589
And that is how we see progress, right?

758
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,270
We don't see progress by throwing our hands in

759
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,630
the air and saying there's nothing we can do.

760
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,469
Let's just give up.

761
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:53,630
Well, and I'm going to make a prediction that this is going to get much worse.

762
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,310
And that the barrier to entry to open source was historically, always low.

763
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,050
Essentially. If you could program,

764
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,449
let me finish. If historically, if you could program, you could participate

765
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:04,790
and now it's changed,

766
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,390
it's even lower in that you don't actually have to be able to program.

767
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,949
People are churning code out with A I

768
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,550
and the quality is all over the place

769
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,439
depending on how well you prompt them.

770
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:18,500
Like I've noticed, for example, when I prompted for Python scripts,

771
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,709
about 50% of the time it'll handle command line arguments

772
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:24,550
sort of gracefully and half the time it's just like equal

773
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,859
Sisy zero,

774
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,949
I'm like, sure it only takes one argument, fine, whatever.

775
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,920
But then I have a script that takes three arguments and I'm like, oh, come on, like,

776
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,229
let's use some arc parts.

777
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:34,859
And I know to ask for that.

778
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:38,510
I know that that's possible so I can modify my prompt and get that result.

779
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:42,229
But like a true person who's literally just bashing rocks against the

780
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,069
A I and getting code that kind of works out of it.

781
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,630
They're not going to know that. And

782
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,920
so I'm going to pause it,

783
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,849
but

784
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,390
the barrier to entry to open source is going to

785
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,319
continue to get even lower and lower and lower.

786
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,060
And thus these types of problems where

787
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:01,859
it kind of relies on the person not knowing what to look for or not knowing

788
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:05,140
what the signals are, is going to become

789
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:06,989
easier to exploit.

790
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,069
-- Because you've,
-- I mean, this is a problem with A I everywhere, right?

791
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,670
Like you have A I generating

792
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,630
nonsensical text, you have it generating images,

793
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,030
there's misinformation up the wazoo.

794
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,089
-- Well,
-- what? But the difference is

795
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,719
in the past when you had a,

796
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,270
when you had a programmer try to write fizz buzz and

797
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,630
they didn't know how they wrote something that didn't work,

798
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,770
but now they get something that appears to work

799
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,380
and that's fair. And that's the difference. Like you have to

800
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,430
get your columns to line up in Python.

801
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,630
Now you don't, the, the A I will do it for you.

802
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,939
And so I think what's interesting is

803
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,829
we need to not just think about where we are now and where the Attackers are now,

804
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,219
but where we're going because

805
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:50,619
if we are, if we are improving the state of things

806
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:55,170
slower than the Attackers are slower than the industry is changing, then

807
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,859
-- maybe we need to speed up and go a bit faster and
-- that's

808
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,390
easy to do.

809
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,609
But it's hard to do.

810
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,329
I mean,

811
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:01,010
and,

812
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,349
and you could probably make the argument and I think

813
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,930
that that's how we have to end this because there's just

814
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,800
at this point

815
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,479
other than awareness, I don't think there's a lot else we can do.

816
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,699
I think there's some organization starting to

817
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,469
pay attention and that's a good start.

818
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,880
But for the moment,

819
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,319
it's just knowing this is a thing is probably the best we're gonna get.

820
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,199
Yep.

821
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,989
So, yeah, that's that.

822
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,729
I guess

823
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:24,930
I,

824
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,540
I feel like we end all these shows lately. I'm like awful. Like there's nothing

825
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,589
I was thinking about this with like the light bulbs and stuff in my mobile app.

826
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,280
How do I validate that? Like, my mobile app is not gonna spy on me at some point.

827
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,859
-- You don't.
-- I can. It

828
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,390
is spying on you. I'll save you the trouble.

829
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,030
-- Yeah, exactly.
-- I,

830
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,189
I agree. Anyway. All right. Let, let's call it. Thank you, Kurt.
