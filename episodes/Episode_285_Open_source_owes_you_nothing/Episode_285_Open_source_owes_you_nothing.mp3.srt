Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:10,609
and my partner and

2
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,109
closing bugs, I guess, Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:16,840
Yeah. I'm always wondering how you're going to do that little intro because

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,139
I, I have no idea what Kurt is going to make up. And

5
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:23,000
-- sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't
-- true.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,219
But we actually, both of us used to aggressively close bugs when we worked at Red Hat.

7
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:31,299
I love closing bugs. Nothing makes me happier than closing bugs.

8
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,220
-- Yeah.
-- So what triggered?

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,759
This is, uh, the, one of the main emacs developers closed, uh,

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,849
45% of the open emacs bugs

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,639
like good for them.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,610
I mean,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,380
yeah.

14
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,909
And then my favorite thing is the top comment on hacker news.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,240
It actually turns out is the person who filed the bug, but he's like, essentially

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,619
I filed these bugs.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,770
There was a big discussion and then it got closed without being properly resolved.

18
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:52,020
And

19
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,180
from the emacs point of view, it's kind of like, well,

20
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,599
we had this big discussion about these bugs that were more like enhancements

21
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,860
and then we asked you if everything was fixed and you didn't reply for six years.

22
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:01,979
So we closed it

23
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,720
six years.

24
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:05,419
Yeah. Was it 2015? Right.

25
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:06,129
So

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,989
2015,

27
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:09,339
I have

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,379
probably a unique perspective on this.

29
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,750
And I know you do too because we were on the receiving end of a large

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,970
number of bugs for a very long time and to a degree I still am.

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,169
And I think

32
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,449
the thing

33
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,809
that often happens,

34
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,870
especially in open source is people think the

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,339
bug tracker is a support portal and not a

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,510
bug tracker. And so

37
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,269
there's often a lot of confusion and people get

38
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,610
upset when you do something like close their bug.

39
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,730
But at the same time,

40
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,239
maybe, you know, there, there's a million reasons that could happen.

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,519
Anything from it gets fixed.

42
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,040
You didn't provide enough information to,

43
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,949
we tried to have a discussion with you and you never answered, you know, it's,

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,970
it's complicated.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,949
I think it's even more subtle than that because

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,569
effectively if a user encounters a bug by

47
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,690
definition that is a support issue for them.

48
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,029
They

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,279
like it,

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,750
they encountered a bug that is stopping them from doing something especially.

51
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,849
And no, but here we get into survivor bias.

52
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,710
The bug is bad enough for them to actually tell you about it, right?

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,369
Because I encounter small bugs in software all the time and I'm just like,

54
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,350
whatever it doesn't really matter.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,029
Ignore it. I don't bother filing a bug, right?

56
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,470
Like this,

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,039
like just now when we were trying to get the show up

58
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,029
and running and I couldn't join because my camera was disabled.

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,309
Right.

60
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,190
And you're actually going to file a bug.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,630
I personally wouldn't bother filing a bug because I'd just be like, whatever,

62
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,399
I'll work around it.

63
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,130
-- Well,
-- so here, there, there's a couple of aspects to this.

64
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,320
Now, we use a service called Squad Casts to record the podcast

65
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,229
and

66
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,589
I have interacted with them,

67
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,479
we'll say five times or less since I and I,

68
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,419
I pay them money like I'm a legitimate customer of theirs.

69
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,149
But the thing is every time I talk to them,

70
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,289
I give them an enormous amount of information

71
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,630
because as someone who receives lots of bugs,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,300
I give them way more than they need. I mean, I will give them HTTP headers.

73
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,550
I will give them like versions of everything, versions of the operating system,

74
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,990
versions of the kernel, versions of Firefox I'm using,

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,729
I will go and looking at all kinds of wacky Javascript stuff as part of this.

76
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,470
And so when they are interacting with me,

77
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,220
they're getting a fire hose of details, but that's not always how it works.

78
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,690
The problem there is.

79
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,789
I mean that this goes to all sorts of things around expertise and Dunning Kruger.

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,699
But fundamentally,

81
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,729
let me put it this way.

82
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:24,009
If I could actually describe what was wrong with my car,

83
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,559
I'm like 90% of the way there to fixing it. Ok.

84
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,070
Now let's, let's, let's take that from there and, and we're gonna, obviously,

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,889
this is the open source security podcast.

86
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:36,009
We're going to put that spin on it when I go to the mechanic and I have my car, I say

87
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,919
this something is wrong with my car and they'll, sometimes they'll fix it for.

88
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,009
Sometimes they'll say, ok, we'll look at it. They don't charge me anything.

89
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,050
Sometimes they're like, we're gonna charge you 100 bucks to figure this out. Right.

90
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,149
And it depends

91
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,259
and

92
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:53,570
imagine if you drove your car up to like some guys at

93
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,130
a park drinking beer next to their cars and you were like,

94
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:57,699
hey,

95
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
uh something's wrong with my car, help me out.

96
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:03,860
-- They were like, what I mean, that's kind of what open source is like,
-- well,

97
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,139
what the difference being those guys in the park having trying to have a quiet beer.

98
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,720
Their name is on the engine part, that kind of is making a weird noise.

99
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:13,169
I mean, that's potentially fair,

100
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,830
but I don't think that necessarily changes things at all.

101
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,399
Like

102
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,149
they owe you nothing.

103
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,450
That

104
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,399
source owes you nothing.

105
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,730
Well,

106
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,390
and here's the worst thing too is even

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,720
if people politely and respectfully ask for support,

108
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,890
just that alone is a tsunami for a lot of open source developers.

109
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,320
-- It, it can be for sure. Well,
-- I, I got emails asking about the UV I

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,070
uh data and I'm like, go file a bug.

111
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,119
I mean, that is the correct answer and, and we'll do a show about what UV I is. Someday.

112
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,339
-- I'll put a link in the show notes for anyone interested.
-- But

113
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,269
part of the challenge is, is

114
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,600
people forget.

115
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,399
It's kind of like public health. And

116
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,709
you found a bug that's your bug. That's a precious bug.

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,359
That's your pet bug that you're going to keep in a jar and watch

118
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,720
it grow and evolve into a beautiful butterfly that one day will fly away

119
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,480
to the developer. We're dealing with a plague of Locusts, right?

120
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:01,010
And that's the thing.

121
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,480
-- It's the scale issue like
-- a bug bounty is a great example of that where

122
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:09,040
you will have hackers submit a bug to you in the bug bounty

123
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,239
and they'll make it critical. And then when you mark it low,

124
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:17,000
they get very angry that you basically just call their baby ugly. And it's like

125
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,059
it's not a critical bug, please. Here is the explanation.

126
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,589
-- I I
-- remember without getting into details, a large customer filed a bug,

127
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,679
a specific type of security bug that's not

128
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,600
very impactful and there's an easy work around

129
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,899
and they were flipping out and wanted daily updates on the status of the bug.

130
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,880
And I'm like, no. And they got very shall we say touchy about it?

131
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,609
And the way I ended up shutting them up was saying, look,

132
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,730
here is another example of that exact kind of low level like low level security flaw

133
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,200
that's public

134
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,540
like your bug is not that important and even if it were that important there's,

135
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:53,859
there's more of those, like, it was cross site scripting.

136
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:54,690
Right. Like, which

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,739
in a web application is very, relatively easy to avoid

138
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,269
on the blind side. But anyway,

139
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,109
yeah.

140
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,160
Well, but, I mean, anyways it's,

141
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,829
and that got them to back off. But,

142
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:08,450
and that's the thing. Right. They thought they'd found the end of the world bug.

143
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,070
And I'm like,

144
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:10,390
you know,

145
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,480
it's like that scene from, um,

146
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,829
Street Fighter with Bison. You know, for me it was just another Tuesday.

147
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:16,690
Right.

148
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,660
I mean, I remember at Red Hat, I, I, at one point I think if you still search the Red Hat

149
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:21,950
BZ

150
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,140
for my work email address,

151
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:24,869
um,

152
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,470
it's going to take about two minutes to return the query

153
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,609
and you'll have to click that thing at the

154
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,049
bottom that says show more than 1000 results.

155
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,489
-- Right. Right.
-- You know,

156
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:35,429
but I mean,

157
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:40,299
so for me that literally thousands and thousands of bugs was just normal.

158
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:44,049
I mean, yeah, when, when you work in that environment, I mean, so look,

159
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:48,269
here is what I think we should, we should turn this into is

160
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,649
when you hear about the emacs project closing 45% of its bugs, you end up with.

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,579
Some people are aghast

162
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,130
that they're closing bugs that aren't fixed

163
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,170
and statistically, I'm sure many of them aren't right.

164
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,760
You have people like us who are like, yeah, whatever, who cares?

165
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,739
But

166
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,470
we're,

167
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,630
I mean, anyone who's an open source developer, I think is

168
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,070
in a place that is much different from normal people.

169
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,829
And I think normal people will be horrified by the thought of just closing things

170
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,049
-- just
-- because there's a simple thing here though.

171
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:20,769
There's a big difference between how open source

172
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,799
handles bugs and how private companies handle bugs.

173
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:26,670
And the biggest difference being is an open source bug typically is public.

174
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,029
Right? It's, it's all out there in the open on the web indexed in Google.

175
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:35,109
And typically it's actually really, really easy to reopen the bug.

176
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,029
Uh

177
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,320
right, compared to dealing with a private company

178
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,709
where you report a bug and they say no, it's not a bug, go away

179
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,109
and, and you like have to fight them tooth and nail to get them to listen to you.

180
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,609
Open source is different than that typically. Right?

181
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,519
There's, there's a few antisocial open source projects.

182
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,429
Like I remember I found one open source project,

183
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,679
but in an effort to quote unquote reduce bug spam,

184
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,399
you had to go on to an Irc channel and request

185
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,040
like an account in their bug tracker to file a bug

186
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,359
and a bunch of other hoops and steps to jump through.

187
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,119
And

188
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,359
I was like,

189
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,359
I'm not doing that,

190
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,980
but I had to get a B filed because it was a security issue.

191
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,929
And so I ended up just going straight to one of the developers and

192
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,839
full disclosure is for it just send it to the full disclosure mailing list is fine,

193
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,690
-- pretty
-- much so.

194
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:21,839
And,

195
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,470
and that's the thing is like working at scale is

196
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,079
different and working in open source is different because again,

197
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,559
you know,

198
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,640
reopening these bugs and adding more information is, is generally quite trivial. I

199
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:33,270
mean, and

200
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,280
the

201
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,880
doesn't,

202
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,840
they're not deleting it, they're not getting rid of it. It's still there.

203
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,530
You can still find,

204
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,090
you said something just now that I think is hugely important

205
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,650
and often overlooked where you said you can, you can add more information

206
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,809
when you file a bug, especially with an open source project.

207
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,250
The intent should be that the information you give in the initial report

208
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,909
is everything they need to test.

209
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,580
The bug is there and verify,

210
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,130
they fixed it when they fix it and even better is if you can include a patch,

211
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,979
that's the absolute best case because these people are

212
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:09,039
horribly overworked in virtually every instance.

213
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,969
I don't know of a single open source project.

214
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,690
-- That's like, oh, I wish we had more work to do
-- well.

215
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,130
And again, II, I would think that that's the ideal world,

216
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,979
but realistically the majority of users

217
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,679
cannot describe a problem.

218
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,989
Let alone look at the source code and suss out the problem, right?

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,130
-- Because they, they can be quite subtle.
-- I disagree.

220
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,849
I think you can make the argument that not everyone can create

221
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,299
a patch.

222
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,530
I'm perfect that I think everyone will agree with that.

223
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,520
Because there are lots of people who are not developers. But I think

224
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:38,320
you, if you don't have the ability to describe what is going on in a coherent manner,

225
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,299
you have no business filing bugs.

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,049
And I mean, this is similar to like, if you go to a doctor and the doctor's like,

227
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:47,210
what's wrong and you say, I don't know, they're going to be like, get out,

228
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,409
-- you know,
-- but that does happen. People go to psychologists, what's wrong?

229
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:51,690
I don't know. I just feel bad.

230
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,049
Something's not right with my life and then they, you know, do tests and stuff and,

231
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,369
and you know, there's those famous

232
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,760
cases where it turns out to be some weird brain tumor.

233
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,219
I don't think that's comparable in this instance, Kurt,

234
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:04,409
because when you go see a psychologist or,

235
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,770
or some sort of mental health expert discovery is part of that process.

236
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,250
When you're dealing with software bugs, discovery is not part of the process.

237
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,099
I also think a big difference there is those experts are being paid to deal with this.

238
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:20,890
The open source people are not necessarily being paid to deal with this. And yes.

239
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,460
Yeah. And I think that's part of it is the

240
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,869
sort of expectation of

241
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,719
if you actually care about this bug,

242
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,530
like this bug really affects you like this squad casts thing where OK,

243
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,729
I have to like enable my camera in the web browser

244
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,809
and log in and then turn it off and that works.

245
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,640
Ok. Easy work around, whatever I'll live with it.

246
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,969
But if a bug is actually, you know, very

247
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,929
critical to you, like, you can't get your job done or you,

248
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,250
you're somehow relying on it

249
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,489
and especially it's something you're using and not paying for.

250
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,130
Well, yeah, sorry, man.

251
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,289
Like that's, you might have a bad time.

252
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,890
You might have to go hire somebody to help you with this. Like, if you can't,

253
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,429
like there's a ton of open source people out there that actually work as consultants

254
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,049
and contractors, right?

255
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:05,390
And I think that's part of it is this, we've, we've grown up with this expectation of

256
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,190
I will use this software for free. Cool.

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,549
And that's very explicitly what the license like, that's exactly what we want.

258
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:13,429
But

259
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,109
I don't remember there being this expectation of support.

260
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,510
No, there's no expectation and, and one of the things that irks me is I know people who

261
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,020
they will have open source and like the critical

262
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,549
path of their application of the product they're creating

263
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,330
and they're like, oh,

264
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,979
I'm not paying anyone for that and then they

265
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,950
get really angry when it breaks and it's like,

266
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,130
that's not how this works if this is in your critical path

267
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,900
and you're unwilling to pay the developer and you're

268
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,650
unwilling to hire anyone to take care of it.

269
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,849
Like there's no way around this like failure is what's going to happen.

270
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,809
That's that is how the story ends.

271
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,570
Well, yeah, that comes down to risk management and,

272
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,840
you know, it, it, it's weird to me that,

273
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,710
you know, a company would never think of, for example,

274
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,809
renting or buying a commercial space and not insuring

275
00:11:59,369 --> 00:11:59,549
it.

276
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,150
Like, and I think that's actually generally illegal in a lot of jurisdictions.

277
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:04,280
You know,

278
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,400
like my understanding is like, well, for example, if you buy a house,

279
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,890
you have to have house insurance because they, you know, the,

280
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,270
the mortgage holder doesn't want to be left holding

281
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,849
-- a debt on a burnt out pile of rubble.
-- Right. Right. Yes, absolutely.

282
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,200
And that's, but that's literally where some of these, you know,

283
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,770
software firms are when

284
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:25,169
they have a showstopper bug or worse, you know, a security bug that affects them.

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,909
So actually, you know what else this reminds me of is I remember back in the day

286
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:34,710
this was man, this was redhead in like 2005, maybe 2004

287
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,859
where there is a policy of,

288
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:40,369
we will only release an update when there is a security issue

289
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,609
and there would be packages that developers wanted to update

290
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,530
and they,

291
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,739
they, they were told no, because our policy is security updates only.

292
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,739
Otherwise you have to wait for the next like major release or whatever,

293
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,039
then they would go and find a security issue just so they could release their bug fix,

294
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:02,020
which, which that amused me to no end when that would happen.

295
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,390
And, and now now let's,

296
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,859
let's think about this from the security perspective a little bit,

297
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,070
let's say someone reports a security bug to an open source project.

298
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,929
Do you think that they should fix it or, or what if they close it with?

299
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,719
Like, we don't care.

300
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,729
Well, here's the thing

301
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,169
and this is gonna sound really privileged and snarky. But

302
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,369
you have the source code. Fix it your damn self.

303
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,890
-- No, I'm dead damn serious.
-- I don't, I don't disagree with that.

304
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,289
I think

305
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,909
if it's that important to you,

306
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,419
you like a perfect example is Google because I know Google does this.

307
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,229
Google takes a big pile of open source software,

308
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,419
shoves it into their own repo so that they don't have to worry about, you know,

309
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,059
supply chain attacks in future.

310
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,260
They cherry pick the fixes and updates they need

311
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,419
and they have dozens or hundreds of people managing this stuff. Yes, they do.

312
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,260
Ok. Cool. Pretty much.

313
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,690
And it's not just companies building some little

314
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,159
product like an air conditioner or something now,

315
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,380
you know, there's cars and large industrial machinery running on open source,

316
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,659
the world is running out everything, everything is using it

317
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,510
and, and it's stuff that has like a failure scenario of human death, right?

318
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,609
A perfect example being Tesla's autopilot is

319
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,760
being investigated because apparently it has a problem

320
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,320
where it just sort of drives at high speed into the back of emergency vehicles.

321
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,640
Yeah, I saw that I'm still, I still want

322
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,169
the self driving world to work.

323
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,210
But the more I learn about it,

324
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:29,270
the more or I feel my hopes and dreams being crushed under the boot of reality.

325
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,109
What I find bizarre is

326
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,000
if we're this worried about people dying in cars,

327
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,349
why do we still allow cars to drive without the seatbelts being used?

328
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:42,070
Because I, this is my favorite thing. I love looking at seatbelt compliance

329
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,030
and in the US it's an average of about 90% of people wear their seatbelts. That's it.

330
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,190
10% don't.

331
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,969
Yeah. And here's the best part of the statistic and this is from 2000 and

332
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:55,260
the latest data they had, I think it was 2017.

333
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:56,010
Yes.

334
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:59,979
47% of the people who died in motor vehicle accidents were not wearing a seatbelt.

335
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,780
I'm shocked to learn that. So seatbelts work.

336
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,239
And actually, it's funny the other day, I was actually,

337
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,309
for whatever reason I normally get in the car, put on my seatbelt, then start the car.

338
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,179
It was just habit.

339
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,609
And for whatever reason yesterday, I didn't do that.

340
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,969
I started the car started moving it out of the garage and was going,

341
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:14,784
put my seatbelt on.

342
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,325
And I noticed for the first time my car has

343
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,325
like a little warning light and an annoying dinger that,

344
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:21,414
you know, and I'm like, oh, I've never seen that before because I,

345
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:24,434
I've been trained to put my seatbelt on since I was a little kid.

346
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,354
I actually remember when seatbelt laws became a thing in Alberta. Right.

347
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:30,145
Because all of a sudden my dad wouldn't let us play in the back seat anymore.

348
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,065
We had to wear a seat belt.

349
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:32,414
That's right.

350
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,549
Yeah. The good old days, we also didn't wear helmets while skiing or snowboarding.

351
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,150
-- That was great.
-- Whatever, it's fine. I turned out fine. It's

352
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:40,539
ok.

353
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:44,299
-- I just don't remember the number seven very often.
-- It's fine. Seven's a dumb number.

354
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,070
So,

355
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,270
yeah. So

356
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,359
it's interesting to me that humans consistently

357
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,679
will freak out

358
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:55,739
about a new risk, especially if the perception is that,

359
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,349
that new risk is not a risk that they control.

360
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,200
I mean,

361
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,250
and they will happily accept all these horrible

362
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,159
old risks where they absolutely do control it.

363
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,520
Like wearing your seatbelt

364
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:09,640
or getting your vaccine or eating more fruit

365
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,840
and vegetables and getting some exercise in.

366
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,989
I mean, they don't always control. Here's one of my favorite examples.

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,929
What, what I just thought of as you were describing,

368
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,190
this is the whole like closed source versus open source

369
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,719
debate where I still run into people that talk about.

370
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:27,179
Oh, but this my my vendor will support it and it's like

371
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,530
your vendors stuff is full of open source and I promise you,

372
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,140
they have no idea what's in it versus open source where it's like here's all the code,

373
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,260
here's what's going on,

374
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,859
go figure it out if you really want to.

375
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:42,900
But at the same time because people are used to closed source in their mind.

376
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,250
That is safer. Even though I guarantee

377
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,059
that closed source vendor has skeletons on top of skeletons on top of skeletons

378
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,960
in that hole.

379
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:53,460
Well, I mean,

380
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,739
I just remember back in the day you could

381
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,530
run a binary against strings and search for the,

382
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:58,969
you know, BS D license,

383
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,299
right? And it would just spew out

384
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,520
because

385
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,479
uh well, TCP/IP related stuff or, well, anything web server or anything,

386
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:08,900
you know what I mean?

387
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,069
Like?

388
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,199
Yeah.

389
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,098
And, and to be clear,

390
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,819
I would vastly prefer that these companies use

391
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,880
an open source implementation and build their own.

392
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,920
Right.

393
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,500
It's going to be less problematic because the

394
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,829
other thing I'm wondering about is there's this interesting

395
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,118
notion of bugs that kind of matter and bugs that don't.

396
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,579
And one thing I was thinking about prior to this show was,

397
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,040
is there a case

398
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,239
where a bug affects me and makes my life worse?

399
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,770
And I sort of don't

400
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,849
notice in the sense of like, my life is just worse, but I, I can't even pin down

401
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,920
that. It's the fault of something. And

402
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,650
unfortunately, there is one great example and that is in Britain.

403
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
Uh Remember when their UK COVID results,

404
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,229
they realized we're all messed up because they were using

405
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,449
an older version of Excel that had a maximum of,

406
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:53,209
you know, what is it?

407
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,729
Like 65,000 roads.

408
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:56,270
And so

409
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,849
they're like cool cases have stopped rising.

410
00:17:59,489 --> 00:17:59,689
Yeah.

411
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,130
00 no, wait, just the data is missing.

412
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:03,750
Yeah.

413
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,890
Um and so obviously, you know, that's a very subtle thing.

414
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,290
You have an Excel spreadsheet missing a bunch

415
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,709
of data upon which public policy is made and

416
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,589
well. Yeah. Whoops.

417
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,550
Well, now, so here's a funny aspect of that as well is

418
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,510
so from the security perspective, I would argue that is a,

419
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,060
it is a definite threat to human life,

420
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,099
but at the same time,

421
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,180
I don't think anyone would claim that

422
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:32,619
Excel old Excel files only supporting 65,000 rows

423
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,420
is a security vulnerability.

424
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,680
-- There's a solution. Use a newer version.
-- It's not the newer version.

425
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:41,459
The problem was they were using the old Excel file

426
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:45,140
format which has a hard limit on number of rows.

427
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,819
-- Whereas the new format supports up to a million. I think it's more than
-- that.

428
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,560
And so it's not, it wasn't the version of Excel they were using, it was the file type.

429
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,560
-- They were saving ads. That was the problem.
-- Yeah. Oh, you're right.

430
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,089
The new one is to the 20th just over a million. Yeah.

431
00:18:59,329 --> 00:18:59,969
But anyways,

432
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,180
so because uh well, a good example of this,

433
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:08,400
obviously Tesla's autopilot has some problems because it,

434
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,150
there's documented cases of it slamming into high emergency

435
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,839
vehicles with their lights on a high speed.

436
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,079
And there's actually a really terrifying video of a guy

437
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,619
who realizes at the last moment he has to swerve,

438
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:19,750
right? And it's

439
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,069
uh

440
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,160
you know, this is why II I will never buy something that is

441
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,709
not fully autonomous because there's no way

442
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,219
I can safely use a semi-autonomous vehicle

443
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,099
and pay enough attention to know.

444
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,939
Oh, I'm encountering a problem. I need to go deal with it.

445
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,849
You know, because I'm having a

446
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:38,589
high speed for that concrete barrier

447
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,760
autonomous or not. There's literally nothing in the middle

448
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:42,859
and I can

449
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:47,060
-- see there is
-- this silly the difference being with driver assist where,

450
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,699
you know, for example, like it's going to warn me if uh I'm drifting in my lane,

451
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,719
but I'm expected to be in control.

452
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:54,189
It's just gonna,

453
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,959
you know what a perfect example being the rumble

454
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,339
strips they put on the side of highways now,

455
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,540
you know where they get those little divis

456
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,500
because II, I do remember one time I was tired and I drifted onto it and I was like, ok,

457
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,959
I gotta stop and rest.

458
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,109
And so that's probably a simple invention that

459
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,819
saved thousands or tens of thousands of lives.

460
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,260
I keep coming back to this.

461
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,670
You know, how do we determine which bugs matter and which bugs needs to be fixed

462
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,520
offset by the fact in the open source world?

463
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,219
Yeah, I mean, if,

464
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,800
if this piece of software is that important to you and

465
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,160
that critical to you and you really need this bug fixed,

466
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,739
you have options, you can pay the developer to do it,

467
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,930
you can pay a developer to do it on your own copy.

468
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,760
And is there a carry cost for that. Absolutely.

469
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,229
Like we both worked at Red Hat where backwards compatibility was the word of the day.

470
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:36,579
Right.

471
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:41,380
And Red Hat commits to, you know, supporting Red Hat Enterprise links for 13 years.

472
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,339
I know it's so long and, but the thing is people want that, you know,

473
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,699
they have AC NC milling machine

474
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,609
or

475
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,540
water plant.

476
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,719
Um,

477
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,469
you know, I always love it when people are like, oh, these,

478
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,770
these stupid industrial people still use Windows XP.

479
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,790
It's like, yeah, what do you, what do you want them to do?

480
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,469
Rewrite $20 million with software that runs an oil refinery that can't be shut down.

481
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:02,910
Right.

482
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,510
Right.

483
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,969
You know, like a nuclear power plant.

484
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:09,250
Do you, do you understand what maintenance costs on those things are?

485
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,609
No, I don't because I'm not, I'm not, I mean, it's done in Kruger.

486
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,219
I imagine it's an enormous number, but I have no idea.

487
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:18,829
-- Well,
-- and the knock on cost of, oh, sure. We'll just take a couple gigawatts offline

488
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,079
or what if something goes horribly wrong when I

489
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,790
try to shoehorn in a new version of Windows.

490
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,000
Like,

491
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,719
I'm pretty sure the upgrade path from Windows 95 to Windows 10

492
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:31,069
or 11 is not as smooth as we'd like it to be.

493
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,900
-- I bet
-- there's a youtube video about it.

494
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:34,550
Well, there is that person who did D

495
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,859
OS 1.0 upgrade all the way to Windows 10.

496
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,349
That is

497
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:37,560
awesome.

498
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,150
And, and that's, but that's just the U si mean

499
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,829
and shockingly if you do run D OS apps,

500
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,520
they do generally run pretty cleanly on Windows 10 and up.

501
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:45,750
But,

502
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,969
but back to the

503
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,969
point because they're emulating all of that stuff. Now,

504
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,589
back to this. I think that's the beauty of open sources.

505
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,140
If this,

506
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,869
it's a business risk if you are going to build a business

507
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,369
and build a product on something and not properly support it.

508
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,560
Like, I'm always reminded of these companies that use manufactured parts

509
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,969
and then the manufacture of that part stops making them

510
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,189
well, yeah,

511
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:06,609
you know, I,

512
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,849
I remember I once had to replace the back windshield wiper

513
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,609
motor on my Dodge caravan back when I had a Dodge caravan

514
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,859
and I explicitly bought a Dodge Caravan because

515
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,920
there's been over 10 million of them made.

516
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,920
So getting parts for them is actually quite easy. But here's what's interesting

517
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,069
when I went to buy the new motor, uh the new blade motor,

518
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,400
it was like an extra $100 which you got back when you brought back the dead

519
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:30,839
unit because they wanted the casing.

520
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,560
They wanted the casing for it.

521
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,619
They didn't care about the motor, they didn't care about the electronics,

522
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,000
they wanted the physical metal casing back so that if they could

523
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:40,430
reuse it to make a new,

524
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,140
you know, blade motor, like even though I own the darn thing,

525
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,079
I had to like put a deposit down on it and bring it back to get my money back.

526
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:49,689
I, I get that. It's like the same thing with batteries where you buy a battery.

527
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,390
They're like, we're adding 25 bucks on.

528
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,260
-- You bring the old battery and we give you 25 bucks back. Like I get
-- that.

529
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:55,270
I think maybe open

530
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,079
source needs to start doing things like that.

531
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:01,160
-- The challenge being is that people have gotten used to not paying for stuff, kind
-- of,

532
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,640
I, I think there's a couple of pieces to this.

533
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,880
And so I think on one side,

534
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,290
there are businesses that legitimately just had no idea what was going on

535
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:13,890
where they didn't understand the developers were going out to stack overflow.

536
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,270
They were yanking open source and they were

537
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,869
doing all this stuff because that's just what

538
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,640
developers solve problems, right? Solving the problem.

539
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:23,119
If you don't tell them what to do, they're going to solve it whoever they want. Right?

540
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,040
So a lot of organizations suddenly found out, oh, holy crap.

541
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,599
We have open source everywhere, right?

542
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:27,920
And that,

543
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,319
that was kind of the birth of all

544
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,680
these automated scanners that I complain about incessantly.

545
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:33,520
I think

546
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:36,160
these scanners are a good thing because they're,

547
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,540
they're making people start to recognize

548
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,500
this is what you're shipping.

549
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,119
And I mean, this is that whole like s bomb conversation, you know,

550
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,500
we talked to Alan Friedman, what it's been like, I think 10 years now it feels like,

551
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:46,660
but

552
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,239
like same thing actually Alan's uh switching, he, he just moved from,

553
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,099
uh NTI A to Sisa.

554
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,640
So we should actually talk to him soon again just to figure out what sis is up to.

555
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,319
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

556
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,670
So the point is right,

557
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,380
you've got these people now scanning their stuff

558
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,459
and they're starting to understand what's going on.

559
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:05,000
I mean, there's a long road, of course,

560
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,180
to deal with because the scanners all have some

561
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,780
issues they need to work out and stuff.

562
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,469
-- But
-- this is like people who,

563
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,439
it's not that they don't know that they have cracks in their foundation.

564
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,599
They're not even aware there's a basement. I mean,

565
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,880
-- there's just like a mystery door.
-- Exactly. That, exactly. That they have no idea.

566
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:25,300
They have a basement under their house. It's exactly that. Yes.

567
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,119
Now,

568
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:26,880
so you've got

569
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,750
in that aspect, but now let's say you're a company and you're like, holy crap.

570
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,959
I have this open source everywhere. Now. What?

571
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:34,339
Right. And that's where you can start looking at some of these things.

572
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,250
Like github has the ability to

573
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,739
throw some money at

574
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:38,589
maintainers.

575
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,560
You've got companies like Tide Lift that give you the ability to pay maintainers.

576
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:43,079
And so

577
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,119
I think there's a business model in the works here.

578
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,729
I don't know what it's going to look like.

579
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:48,650
I, I know,

580
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,819
I feel like it's a big pot of ingredients and

581
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,489
no one quite knows what the soup will be yet.

582
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:52,810
But

583
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,369
I think we are approaching a place

584
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,449
where companies are recognizing the value

585
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,170
in

586
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,510
investing in this stuff versus the holy crap.

587
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,540
Look at all this free stuff I can use for free and it's like, it's free,

588
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,770
like a puppy guys.

589
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,609
Yeah, I'm going to be a bit of a pessimist and I,

590
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:12,689
I think we're going to encounter a lot of the same problems that, for example,

591
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,510
the media encounters with trying to get people to pay for content

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,290
in that.

593
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,290
There's this sort of tragedy of the commons aspect

594
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,729
where I think a lot of companies will,

595
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,969
well, you know, if we wait long enough,

596
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,180
somebody else might find this bug and pay for it to be fixed.

597
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,290
I mean, maybe. And then

598
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,880
the same conversation we had when we talked about the

599
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,630
eu bug bounties where a lot of these companies just,

600
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,359
they can't go pay some random due.

601
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,770
-- Well, no,
-- no, and they won't. That's why you're going to have to work with github

602
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,339
or Tide Lift or someone like that.

603
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,219
Now, here's the thing I would say about your whole, oh, let's wait for someone else.

604
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,339
I think the place we're going to see the pressure really come from is

605
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,609
lots of customers are scanning the software they get from vendors now.

606
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,380
And so like for example,

607
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,560
I this is basically all I do now for

608
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:58,410
my job where customers take the products elastic makes

609
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:03,255
scans them and then says, here's a phone book of results, please fix all of these.

610
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:06,035
And of course, the, the problem is they don't actually know what they're doing.

611
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:07,765
So, there's a lot of education I have to do.

612
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,755
I have to explain, like, here's what this scan means.

613
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:13,655
Here's what's going on here is why your scan will never come back clean.

614
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,334
Now, one of the things that scares me

615
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,339
is

616
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:19,949
just due to the current kind of lack of understanding of what's going on.

617
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,739
I'm terrified that you're going to see organizations that

618
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,219
start focusing on tricking scanners instead of fixing problems.

619
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,699
Well, absolutely. It's easier.

620
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:31,699
Well, unfortunately, because like, for example, you'll have a customer say,

621
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,599
uh this has a critical finding.

622
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,630
It's like, no, no, that finding isn't critical,

623
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,569
uh NVD rated it wrong or it's not critical the way we're using it.

624
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,709
There's a million things, right? And they're like, I don't care.

625
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,670
It says critical, you have to fix it. It's like,

626
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,989
no, I'm not doing that.

627
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,729
And there's days it's like, I totally know how to trick the scanner.

628
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,479
Like I could totally do it.

629
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,670
The problem is part of it is you're being asked

630
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,650
to effectively prove a negative which is very difficult.

631
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,560
-- No,
-- no. This, I, I can prove this. This isn't like prove a negative territory.

632
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,910
-- This is I can, well,
-- but you have to prove it in a,

633
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:03,064
that they'll believe.

634
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:04,405
And that's the problem.

635
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:08,425
There's nothing I can say, Kurt, the problem is, there's nothing I can say fix it.

636
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,704
Or screw you is their attitude and that's not helpful.

637
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,734
And then of course, once I talk to them and educate them a bit, I ju

638
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:19,025
I have yet to have anyone come back with. A, no, you absolutely have to fix this.

639
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:21,714
Generally when you explain what's going on to them in a way,

640
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,704
they understand it solves the problem.

641
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:26,305
But that's, that's not scalable either. Right.

642
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:30,625
I feel like we are on the precipice of all of this getting better.

643
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:31,785
But there's

644
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,709
an enormous knowledge gap. There is a knowledge gap, the size of a huge canyon

645
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,449
that we have to overcome.

646
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,670
Well, going back to incentives,

647
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,719
part of the challenge is there's a huge incentive for these

648
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,510
scanning companies to produce a phone book of scary looking results.

649
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:44,640
Well,

650
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,130
yeah,

651
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,849
I paid you for results,

652
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,650
you know,

653
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,439
and I

654
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,660
pay

655
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,390
you for an MD

656
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:49,839
for art.

657
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,209
The reality is again back to this whole sort of Dunning Kruger car mechanic thing.

658
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:56,790
If the customer is smart enough to actually

659
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,689
look at those results and truly understand them,

660
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:01,400
they would be probably mature enough from an information security

661
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,319
point of view to really not need the scanner,

662
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,739
not necessarily there's value in it.

663
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,300
-- I think
-- part of the challenge though is this goes back to that Dunning Kruger car

664
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,550
mechanic thing is if you're mature enough to

665
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,260
properly understand these scanning report findings and everything,

666
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:18,170
you're you're at a very mature place,

667
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,640
information security wise where these reports are

668
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,229
just not going to be that important.

669
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:22,489
You know,

670
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,510
what my comparison would be actually is I remember the first house I ever bought,

671
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,339
this was like 100 years ago.

672
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,329
You get your home inspection done.

673
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:33,280
They, they gave me the report and I mean,

674
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,510
it was a pretty good size report as these things tend to be.

675
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,130
I looked over it and I'm like, yeah, this is fine

676
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,640
and the realtor was like, what I'm like, yeah, I don't care this,

677
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,540
none of this matters.

678
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,699
And she was like, well, you don't want to, you don't want to get him to fix anything.

679
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,819
I'm like, no, I don't care about any of this stuff and like,

680
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:50,089
-- it blew their mind
-- because they're gonna fix it as cheaply and as badly as possible.

681
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,300
-- And,
-- well, right. Exactly. But then I remember when I sold the house,

682
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:55,589
they, they took the phone book report and the, the,

683
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,510
the people trying to buy my house came back with,

684
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,390
please fix everything in this report.

685
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,520
And I was like,

686
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:01,099
nope,

687
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:01,902
I'm done.

688
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:04,792
And I remember this is actually really funny because my realtor flipped out

689
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:07,123
is, I was like, no, uh, we're gonna

690
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:07,932
basically,

691
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:09,983
the way the contract was written is they're supposed to

692
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,703
be back and forth and if I do nothing,

693
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,343
the contract is null and void, I'm like,

694
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:15,642
let it go null and void. I don't care. I'm done.

695
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:18,682
These people are either idiots or they're trying to bamboozle me.

696
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:19,723
I don't care either way.

697
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,512
And then funny enough they, like,

698
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:25,105
did expire, they resent the contract with the, ok, everything's fine.

699
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:28,036
Let's just, let's put all the pieces back together and pretend nothing happened.

700
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,215
I'm, like, see I told you,

701
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:30,645
like,

702
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:34,095
yeah, now that I've, I've bought two houses and had,

703
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,456
or three houses and had to do a lot of fixing and stuff.

704
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:38,576
I know what kind of matters and doesn't matter.

705
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:41,845
Yeah. Right. Exactly. You know. Exactly. And it's like

706
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,680
where that's like when I bought the current house I have,

707
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:46,839
that needed the foundation replaced the realtor was like,

708
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:47,819
do you want an inspection?

709
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,310
I was like,

710
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,819
no, I

711
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,770
don't need one.

712
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,619
I don't even want to see what they're going to come back

713
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,099
-- with
-- and this goes back to that sort of scale argument of.

714
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,569
Most people don't buy enough houses to get good at this

715
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,719
or most people buy a house and they don't really want to

716
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,719
do the handyman stuff.

717
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:03,660
And, I mean,

718
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:07,729
disclosure, I come from a family of construction workers.

719
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,770
So there are a few things I cannot do myself

720
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,530
on.

721
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,130
I mean, like, we built houses like that.

722
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,819
I did that in the summertime. Like

723
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:19,089
you have a lot of domain specific knowledge, right?

724
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,540
I, I know many, many things that most people would.

725
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,329
I mean, same thing with, like, the scanner stuff. Right?

726
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:25,050
I kind of feel like the same thing just because

727
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,869
the history, like,

728
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,630
I have from working at Red Hat for a decade

729
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
and then coming to Elastic and doing similar things.

730
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,540
Like, I know things about how open source works.

731
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,180
I know things about how software is packaged and built

732
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,089
that a lot of people running these scanners don't know.

733
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,410
-- Well,
-- here's the dirty secret. Right.

734
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,780
How many people globally have worked doing open

735
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,750
source security for more than one project.

736
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,969
-- Like on scale?
-- It's pretty small.

737
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,760
There's, there's Thomas and Marcus.

738
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:55,209
We pretty much all know each other, I think. And it's a pretty small group for sure.

739
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,150
-- Right.
-- It's a couple 100 global

740
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,199
if that, if that, you know. Ok.

741
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:01,290
Anyway, we need, we need to bring this one home, man.

742
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,689
I guess at the end of the day,

743
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:06,005
here's the advice I would give is if you are an open source project,

744
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,676
do not feel bad closing bugs.

745
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:11,036
If you will yell at you and say, oh, you shouldn't enclose my bug, then you just say,

746
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:13,036
please reopen it and add the details.

747
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:13,505
I need.

748
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:16,605
If you're filing bugs for an open source project, please, please,

749
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:18,916
please make it a game of,

750
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:22,026
you're going to file a bug and they're not going to have

751
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:26,436
to ask you any questions because you've given them so much detail.

752
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:27,316
-- Yeah,
-- I mean,

753
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:29,302
the difference between having too much information

754
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:30,702
and going down a false rabbit hole versus

755
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:33,312
not having enough information and not being able to figure it out at all.

756
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,062
I would much rather have rabbit hole,

757
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:40,182
-- rabbit holes to chase
-- if I'm a developer and I read your bugger part and it's good.

758
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:42,062
You've made my day.

759
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:42,452
Yes.

760
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,781
