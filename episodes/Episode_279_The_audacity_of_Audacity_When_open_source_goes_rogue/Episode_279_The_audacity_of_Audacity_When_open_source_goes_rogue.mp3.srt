Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,460
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,659
All right, I'm going to put a link in the show notes that I want everyone to go see.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,079
But yet last night,

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,299
I witnessed one of the most epic examples of hacking I have seen in a long time

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,329
and I'll explain this a little bit first and then we'll get to the,

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,760
the real topic we're going to talk about today.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,969
But this is too cool not to at least explain.

8
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:34,759
So summer games done quick is going on right now, which is a speed running event.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,889
I absolutely love. And by the time this podcast goes out it is going to be over.

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,569
So you have missed it, go watch

11
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,970
all the, the speed runs are on youtube and they're amazing.

12
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,970
But there's one specifically I want to call out. So there was

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,500
a speed run for a game called Paper Mario, which is a Nintendo 64 game. OK.

14
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,099
This speed run they did.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,229
It's also on the Wii actually, they've got all, all different,

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,169
all different consoles,

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,169
but specifically the Nintendo 64 matters in this

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,910
instance because what happens is the speed runners.

19
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:09,300
Basically, they set up the memory of the Nintendo 64

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,489
and then they

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,940
execute some commands that jumps program execution into their,

22
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,330
you know, machine written code

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,970
that then jumps to the end credits. OK.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,709
Here's the bananas part about this

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,190
is in order to see the memory correctly in the way they need it.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,800
You have to have a Nintendo 64 with what's called the expansion

27
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,739
pack in which doubles a ram from four megs to eight megs.

28
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,459
Then

29
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:39,330
you have to play the legend of Zelda Ocarina of time

30
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,930
to write the machine code into the expansion memory.

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,129
Oh, so it doesn't white memory before it uses it.

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,660
-- That's right.
-- Well, some games do, some games don't.

33
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:51,669
Well, I mean, back in the day that actually mattered for performance. Right. Right.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,500
Like that. And it's, it's bananas

35
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:55,983
given that we're talking about a system with four meg of ra M right here.

36
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,763
Like, yeah, people took shortcuts.

37
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:02,742
Right. Right. And it's, it's completely insane because they play ocarina of time.

38
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:03,833
They set everything up.

39
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:06,383
Ocarina of time crashes and it brings up the equivalent

40
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,102
of the blue screen of death where it shows,

41
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:09,863
you know, a bunch of registers and,

42
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:12,382
and scary other information and that's how they know

43
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:16,503
that they wrote everything correctly. Then they quickly switch cartridges,

44
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:20,705
they play paper Mario up to a point where they can basically

45
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:24,546
make the program jump to another place now in Paper Mario,

46
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:25,716
they have no way to write

47
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,985
the machine instructions they need into memory,

48
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:30,985
but they're already there from the legend of Zelda.

49
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:35,266
And then all of a sudden the game ends and credits start and it's just,

50
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,656
it is absolutely amazing.

51
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,055
-- It is so cool.
-- I'm just always amazed that

52
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:43,145
people have the spare time to do this.

53
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:47,250
Right. No, because this is a nontrivial amount of work and effort.

54
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,660
It's completely nuts and there's, I'll, I'll put another link,

55
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,860
there's an explanation of how this was done and it is

56
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:57,490
an incredible amount of knowledge and effort that these people did.

57
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,990
And it is, I think

58
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,149
endearing

59
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,990
that there are people who care so much about speed

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,389
running and these games that they're willing to invest,

61
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,809
you know, I mean, I mean, essentially think of it like a hobby, right?

62
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,210
Like, some people will play golf every day of the week.

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,199
These people are understanding the inner workings of

64
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,190
video games and the consoles they run on.

65
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,649
It's fantastic.

66
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,000
Well,

67
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,199
what always kills me is that they have such a

68
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,710
deep understanding of this platform and how to abuse it

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,910
and we somehow pretend like security flaws are hard to find

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,270
like this.

71
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,690
Like, what they're doing is objectively as hard,

72
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,610
if not harder than most security flaws.

73
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,759
-- Right.
-- Absolutely.

74
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,990
-- 100%. And they're doing it for fun and
-- they have no source code.

75
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:38,729
Yeah.

76
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,139
And those like consoles are actually as

77
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:45,779
Well, there's, you know, the thing where, like, if you want a game and just game,

78
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,910
you get a console because it doesn't crash and do stupid stuff like a PC.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,949
Like my PC.

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,550
Literally, I finally made it stop crashing and I made Google chrome stop crashing.

81
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,809
And it was memory speed. It, my, my four sticks of ra M

82
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,789
they're all identical, you know, same brand, same everything.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,149
So they're hopefully the same, but

84
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,470
they will not run it through 600 megahertz

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,639
reliably. I, I suspect one of the sticks is, you know, just not quite right because

86
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,240
running at 3400 megahertz and it's rock solid

87
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,410
and it took me like a week and a half of pain to finally go.

88
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,399
Oh, maybe if I turn down my memory speeds,

89
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,559
my computer will stop. You know,

90
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,940
like if I, if you asked me to break into a windows system versus like a nez

91
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,959
I would pick the windows machine every time

92
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,859
anyway. Anyway,

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,130
it made me smile as I watched this happen.

94
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,600
And it's,

95
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:37,260
it's funny too because one of the things that I think sometimes we take

96
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:41,239
for granted is a lot of people in the security and hacking space,

97
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,880
we understand a lot of this stuff.

98
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,600
So when you talk about arbitrary code execution, that makes sense.

99
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:49,140
-- Well, even jumping, what is a jump in code? Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

100
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,859
And so they're trying to explain to an audience that

101
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,679
has no idea what any of this stuff is,

102
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:53,920
and

103
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,940
I won't say they did a great job,

104
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,600
but I think they did a pretty good job of all things considered.

105
00:04:58,609 --> 00:04:59,859
And it, it was just,

106
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,260
it is amazing. It is absolutely amazing.

107
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,859
And I love the fact that this guy played two different games and swapped him

108
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:12,309
and, and executed his, his instructions. It's, ah,

109
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,089
I love it. It was so cool. All right.

110
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,339
Anyway, anyway, we have an actual topic to discuss today.

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,019
-- Why don't you tell us what it is?
-- So, typically open source software

112
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,429
is one of two things.

113
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,350
It's either, you know,

114
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,540
a person or a project that's kind of just a

115
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,290
bunch of people hacking away and working on it.

116
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:33,339
No real corporate backing or anything or the other model that's quite common is,

117
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,859
but there's, there's like a company wrapped around it,

118
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,359
you know. So a perfect example being like Red Hat Linux or

119
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,609
Ubuntu or Elastic or, you know, Google Chrome, right?

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,320
I, I,

121
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:50,820
they simply put, there's a company that has a need either directly for the product,

122
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,989
like we want to sell this thing and support it or sort of an indirect need.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,540
Like we need,

124
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,380
we need people to have web browsers that don't suck and it protects our ad revenue.

125
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,140
So we need a good web browser out there.

126
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,779
You know, like back in the day when Java V eight,

127
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,554
you know, Chrome came along and just beat Firefox like a rented mule. It was ugly,

128
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,915
how much faster chrome was than Firefox.

129
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:10,524
And, you know,

130
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:13,885
because Google needed java or a javascript based

131
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:17,885
apps to not be so terrible anyways sometimes.

132
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:20,605
And this is sort of the, this to me is the really interesting one is when

133
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:25,420
something is sort of small project or single person open source

134
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,390
and then it gets acquired by a company

135
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:28,890
and I think a

136
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,600
big problem here is, is most and it's probably Survivor bias by definition,

137
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,739
a company that starts doing open source probably kind of understands open source.

138
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,010
But a company that goes into open source by Quasi, I want to say,

139
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,119
I don't want to say buying a project, but it's,

140
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,059
I don't know what other word to use. Acquiring, that's the word, acquiring a project

141
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,049
typically, like, screws it up horrifically, like, uh, well,

142
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,690
look in the show notes for maybe a link to the free note debacle.

143
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,760
Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Exactly.

144
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:55,320
And we even,

145
00:06:55,329 --> 00:07:00,519
we did a show about this and it got even worse after we recorded the episode.

146
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:05,459
-- Oh, exactly. And it keeps getting worse. Right. So,
-- it's true. It's not done yet.

147
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,480
-- But wait, there's more.
-- Exactly.

148
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:11,755
And well, blunt, why do you think audacity is going to be any? Not as terrible?

149
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,714
Audacity has a slightly different,

150
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:16,654
we'll say set of circumstances

151
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:20,744
and for anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, we're going to talk about audacity.

152
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:24,195
Yeah. So Audacity's new parent company, Muse Group. Is pretty new itself, having

153
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:30,114
only opened its doors last week on April 26th, 2021. This Muse Group owns some brands

154
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:37,315
related to music software. How do I put it nicely? It looks like they wanted a good

155
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,475
music editor,

156
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,649
which is fair. Right.

157
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,799
Like I writing something like garage band or audacity is, uh,

158
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,260
I believe the word nontrivial would be an understatement.

159
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,010
Yeah, I mean, you're talking multi

160
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,559
years of effort to decades. I mean,

161
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,480
-- maybe whatever, a long time, decades
-- of hidden sound engineering knowledge,

162
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:57,910
you know, anyways,

163
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,470
they've done some things that are stupid sounding but sort of make sense.

164
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,850
Like

165
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,369
they have app analytics now to improve the app and, and in fairness,

166
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,489
like Linux has done this kind of stuff with S

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,739
OS report for jeez a while one or two decades.

168
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,350
-- I
-- mean, Fedora does this actually where when, if you're running Fedora and I,

169
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,704
I assume I, I, my, my guess is

170
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,855
ubuntu and some other distributions,

171
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,234
-- it's,
-- it's on, I've seen it on ubuntu.

172
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,674
-- It's, it's installed by default on a lot of stuff.
-- Right.

173
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:29,734
Where if your program crashes, it brings up a crash reporter.

174
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,414
Now it doesn't do this automatically. It brings up a crash reporter.

175
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:35,804
You know, you can fill in some details and then submit it to Bugzilla.

176
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:37,933
And I remember back in the day,

177
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,690
there were a handful of,

178
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,969
we'll say personal information filled bugs where there was stuff in crash reports

179
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,400
actually. Debian kind of does this too.

180
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,020
I know they have a, they call a popularity contest,

181
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,820
I think where basically your machine phones home all

182
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,450
the packages you have installed on a regular basis,

183
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,159
which would make it pretty trivial to fingerprint a machine if

184
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,599
you know anybody's done any tweaking to their packages at all.

185
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:07,520
-- Right.
-- And now mind you, this is all opt in, right. None of this is disabled by default

186
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,940
or enabled by whatever words are hard.

187
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,299
Well, we might as well hit that one while we're here.

188
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,880
Yes, if this is opt in

189
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,729
that is a totally different thing than an opt out system,

190
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,219
which is what audacity is doing.

191
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,349
Right. And it's actually not even clear to me that

192
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,520
audacity will allow you to opt out.

193
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,330
I don't know, I haven't looked.

194
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,650
But what's interesting is they've done a couple of things in the license.

195
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:33,369
Well, it's not the license, it's the desktop privacy notice.

196
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,390
So it's not the license but,

197
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,700
and they talk about here for legal enforcement data necessary for law enforce

198
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:40,775
litigation and authorities requests if any.

199
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:44,244
Pretty sure none of my open source software is,

200
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:48,164
has a direct compliance with law enforcement clause.

201
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,405
What it really looks like here is a bunch of lawyers got involved

202
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:54,184
and just did some really bad stuff that essentially has poisoned this.

203
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,364
-- I think it's
-- stupid. I don't, I wouldn't say bad, I think stupid and bad.

204
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,965
-- Well,
-- things like you're not allowed to use the app if you're under 13,

205
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,969
which is hilarious because actually the GP L forbids a restriction such as that.

206
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,750
So by saying you can't use this, if you're under 13,

207
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,880
they're violating the GP L which the Audacity code base is licensed under the GP L.

208
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,580
Exactly.

209
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,400
Well, but again,

210
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,150
it's interesting because it's a privacy notice and they say the app

211
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,309
we provide is not intended for individuals below the age of 13.

212
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,590
If you are under 13 years old, please do not use the app.

213
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,950
So they're sort of asking they're not

214
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,030
telling.

215
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:28,750
Well,

216
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,169
so the issue with that and the reason they do this

217
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,440
for anyone who doesn't know is in the United States,

218
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,630
there's some idiotic think of the Children on

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,929
-- the internet law copa
-- Child Online Protection Act.

220
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,289
Yeah.

221
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,669
And it basically says anyone under 13, you have to treat different than

222
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,989
in kids over 13. And so

223
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:53,380
if audacity is collecting metrics and information from a person under the age of 13,

224
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,890
the rules are vastly different than if they were

225
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,190
collecting information from like the general pop population.

226
00:10:59,450 --> 00:10:59,739
Well,

227
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,229
and it gets worse because they say things like we may disclose the personal

228
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,909
data listed above your hashed IP address

229
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,229
to the following categories of recipients.

230
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,599
I'm sorry, hashing an IP address just doesn't work anymore.

231
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:08,869
There's only 4 billion IP S

232
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,549
right.

233
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,270
Like,

234
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,440
yeah,

235
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,200
you know,

236
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,840
and what's interesting is they talk about the usual stuff like staff members. Sure.

237
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,049
Competent law enforcement body. Ok.

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,690
You know, our auditors, advisors, legal representatives and similar agents. Ok.

239
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,359
To a potential buyer, huh?

240
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,330
Wait, what now?

241
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:32,809
-- Yeah, we all know what that really is. They want to sell our info.
-- Exactly.

242
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:33,789
The thing

243
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,250
-- I think that they forget is very few people download audacity and install it.
-- I

244
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:39,969
disagree.

245
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:42,070
Well, no, no, no, in the sense of on the,

246
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,650
in the windows and Mac Os world people download it and install it.

247
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,510
But in the Linux world, the system

248
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,750
takes care of that.

249
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,070
So, so they're going to lose the Linux market by probably next Tuesday.

250
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,190
They're gonna, they've already lost everyone.

251
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,760
And what's gonna happen is there will still be

252
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,010
people who Google audacity download and end up at

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,359
the audacity

254
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,520
download site

255
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,450
at some point.

256
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,280
Somebody's going to get, you know, somebody's got a friend is going to tell them,

257
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:08,250
hey, you're using audacity.

258
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,239
Did you hear about X? And they're gonna go? Whoa, that's messed up. Oh, but it's ok.

259
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,969
You go over here to get the one that doesn't do all this crazy stuff. Oh, ok. Done.

260
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,739
And they'll switch and that's it.

261
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,669
-- And,
-- and for anyone listening,

262
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,710
I will put a link in the show notes but there is a fork in the works already which I mean,

263
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,650
should shock nobody.

264
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,919
And it's funny because they're actually, they're trying to pick a new name for it

265
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,979
and like it there, they had a vote and it,

266
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,349
the voting link made it to four chan

267
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:36,000
and

268
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,549
yeah, they deleted that

269
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,219
-- github
-- issue

270
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:38,969
boat.

271
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,080
No, no, they had anyway.

272
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,880
It doesn't matter.

273
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,770
But yes, it,

274
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,070
it's everything you can imagine the issue's been

275
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,659
deleted and they're trying to do it again.

276
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,140
Which, I mean, it's part of the hilarity of open source, I think.

277
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,960
But

278
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,359
anyway, Audacity is being forked. So, like, for example,

279
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,289
I do all of the podcast editing and audacity. I spend

280
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,690
many hours a week using this tool and I was super annoyed. Now there's a fork.

281
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm like, whatever I don't care anymore.

282
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,520
And, and honestly,

283
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,539
I'm going to do whatever I can to help the fork along just

284
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,460
because like this is a big deal and this is important to me.

285
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:14,320
And

286
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,469
it's one of those situations of like I was lazy before and now I recognize

287
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,640
the importance of being involved in caring more well.

288
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,280
-- And
-- what's interesting is looking at the audacity github.

289
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,400
It's actually a lot more active than I would have guessed.

290
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:29,960
There's over 100 contributors, which is a pretty good, healthy sign.

291
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,859
But when you actually go look at the contributors data, the graphs,

292
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:37,049
there's the top person with 4800 commits.

293
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,710
The next one is 1700 then it's 203 100

294
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,770
288 5550. And it just, it's a long tail.

295
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,070
These top four or five people are like 99.9% of the code in the last couple of years.

296
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,630
And it's not clear to me

297
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,270
that they have any legal obligation to stick with the audacity.

298
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,809
And it's a classic case, if you lose, you lose literally one or two key devs

299
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,109
like this top dev is half the work. The next Dev is like a quarter of the work,

300
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,799
right? Like you lose one or two of those people. Well, yeah, you own audacity good.

301
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,820
-- Have fun with that. Right.
-- Right. I mean, this is kind of what happened

302
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,929
when open office in Liber

303
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,150
office split is basically all the developers

304
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,909
who were doing the work, went to Liber office and open office just languished. Yeah.

305
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,880
Well, yeah, I remember that and the whole arguments with the

306
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,853
licensing, the whole blah blah blah and I'm just like I want to open word documents.

307
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:31,732
-- I
-- mean, honestly,

308
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:37,293
the the open office debacle is very similar to this and how it went down now.

309
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,882
Now, why are we talking about this on a security podcast?

310
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:46,333
Well, I think this has a security implication if to put it bluntly, OK.

311
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,973
Getting a little bit worrisome.

312
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,825
Anybody who runs software on your system that you regularly update,

313
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:54,695
especially if you pull updates sort of directly, you know,

314
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:57,526
from them and not say through a vendor.

315
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:01,015
Well, they basically can execute arbitrary code in your system real trivially.

316
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,616
And something like audacity is, I, I forget how big it is, but it's, you know,

317
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,366
it's over 100 megabytes binary

318
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:08,075
for

319
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:08,606
sure.

320
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,205
Like there's a lot of stuff to it.

321
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,205
And

322
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,520
what's interesting to me is we've, is, we've said traditionally, OK,

323
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,539
you found a buffer overflow.

324
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,219
Great. You get a, you know, vulnerability identifier and we should fix it,

325
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:20,020
but

326
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,049
it's less clear.

327
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,080
Oh, we, you know, we've identified a, a malicious software developer.

328
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,150
Well, OK, he's, you know,

329
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,380
they're putting back doors in the code, they need to stop that, you know, OK,

330
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,570
but when a company acquires something,

331
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,179
especially when a company has no track record of being well behaved.

332
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,609
I mean, that it's literally was a week old when it acquired this thing,

333
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:42,000
right?

334
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:47,020
That's, that's worrisome to me, that's like a very material change to the software

335
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,520
that brings a lot of risk and uncertainty and unknowns.

336
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,460
I mean, a simplistic example would be, you know, some product says, hey,

337
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,440
we're going to write our own home built web server and use that instead of, you know,

338
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,900
engine X

339
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,130
hatch.

340
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,729
Well,

341
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,109
that right there to me screams security vulnerabilities because

342
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,210
it's just hard.

343
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:08,320
So I think we need to be more aware of these material changes to projects

344
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,260
that bring a lot of risk with them

345
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,099
because the reality is a security vulnerability doesn't

346
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,340
necessarily get exploited, right?

347
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:19,789
There's tons of people running old software with security vulnerabilities,

348
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,710
they're doing just fine.

349
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,469
It really is that simple.

350
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,669
I mean, there's how many out of date Android phones on the planet.

351
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,080
Well,

352
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,559
basically,

353
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,750
so I think as the security community,

354
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,330
we need to start paying a bit more attention to

355
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,710
stuff like this because like the free note example,

356
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,869
with the IRC acquisition thing,

357
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:39,099
they

358
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,900
went evil and malicious, like they,

359
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,820
they took over support channels and channels that project

360
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,940
to coordinate security work, for example.

361
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,099
Yeah, that's a, that's a problem.

362
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,059
I mean, I think there's another side to this and I, I mean,

363
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,479
I hadn't even really put consideration into

364
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,130
what you're talking about with the vulnerabilities.

365
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,059
But I think just the fact that this,

366
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,989
this is a huge just bait and switch essentially where you have

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,699
some sort of project that spends years building this goodwill in community.

368
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:13,719
And then all of a sudden

369
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,180
somehow an organization appears acquires it

370
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,189
and then basically decides we can do whatever we want.

371
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,910
Look at the power of this brand.

372
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,430
And I mean,

373
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,989
we've seen this even in the private

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,868
sector where you have some trusted organization,

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,359
it gets bought by a big company and the

376
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,979
big company just runs it into the freaking ground.

377
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,500
Well, and some of that,

378
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,810
that's the thing. Remember with these companies acquiring, there's a

379
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,189
lot of people as a technical person, I was guilty of this back in the day where

380
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,099
like, oh you acquired this company, this great technology.

381
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,189
Obviously, you want to roll that technology into your products. No,

382
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,790
they might want to acquire that company as an acquire, right?

383
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,239
We we don't care about what they do.

384
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,069
We just, hey, we can hire 100 competent engineers in one week.

385
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,689
Remember, Google Wave. Exactly.

386
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,349
Uh Number two is a client acquisition.

387
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,510
I've seen this a lot in certain niche.

388
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,939
Well, not even niche industry in the skater industry. Honeywell, for example.

389
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,430
And all the other big players,

390
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,900
the only way to significantly grow their customer base is to

391
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,180
go buy other skated companies and basically buy their customers.

392
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,329
You know, because stuff like Ska

393
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,839
is on such a long lead time, like five or 10 years for these projects that

394
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,819
you can't just sell it to somebody, right? It's a whole long painful process.

395
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,780
And I assume those systems stay in operation for like

396
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,939
-- decades once they're deployed
-- the life of the plant.

397
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,380
So there's acquire, acquiring clients,

398
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,560
then there's actually maybe acquiring technology patents in IP

399
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,819
there's acquiring brand and goodwill,

400
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,790
right?

401
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,349
There's, and then finally we have the,

402
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,930
they actually bought the company because that company is

403
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,089
a good fit and they're missing that piece,

404
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:43,439
right? And then,

405
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,579
and I love, we're not going to link to it.

406
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,250
But the economist years ago did an article about like,

407
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,839
where's the synergy where they basically pointed out

408
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:51,959
that all these deals that like list,

409
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:52,280
you know,

410
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,560
A plus B equals better than both?

411
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:55,979
Like never happens.

412
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,479
Yeah, I believe that.

413
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,280
And well,

414
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,959
there's even been instances recently where I

415
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,760
think Facebook just did this where they,

416
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,900
they acquired some companies just to murder

417
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,040
them because they didn't want the competition.

418
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,369
So, yeah, the acquisition to kill it,

419
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:13,079
uh, is, you know, that's another ugly truth of,

420
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,670
uh, we have a product that's doing quite well.

421
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,280
Uh, this thing might come up and eat our lunch.

422
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,770
Yeah, let's, let's make sure that doesn't happen.

423
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:22,849
Right.

424
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,140
You, you, you basically terminate it before it becomes a big thing.

425
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,739
And the real sad part there is,

426
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,640
I always wonder like how many cool technologies are missing because

427
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,390
of that or how many technologies got delayed or public transit.

428
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,829
Right.

429
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,890
Car companies bought all the public transit companies, they couldn't kill them

430
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,069
to sell more cars. Exactly.

431
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,140
So,

432
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,339
yeah, in this case,

433
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,800
it looks like the company owns a bunch of software for doing music related stuff,

434
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,130
making musical scores.

435
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,199
They kind of want to flesh out their portfolio and,

436
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:57,349
and have like a complete portfolio but the way they've done it is uh

437
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,640
awkward.

438
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,800
They, they've really annoyed the community.

439
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,140
Yeah. Well, the community obviously is, is striking back and

440
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:06,459
I, I

441
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,819
would be shocked

442
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:11,170
-- if this fork doesn't catch on quickly.
-- I suspect

443
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,619
what will happen is the fork will catch up, catch on and grow, especially with the,

444
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,709
the people that package the stuff and ship it because do

445
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,219
you want to package and ship something from this unknown,

446
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:23,219
possibly evil entity that has a bunch of weird legales

447
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,339
or do you just want to deal with the open source version?

448
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,199
That's right. Right. That's that's a no brainer. I mean. Right. Exactly.

449
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,660
And the company will

450
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,089
bundle up and sell off a bit,

451
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,500
a package of software that people like and

452
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,079
use who kind of want something that just works

453
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:43,819
and, and the reality is it's conceivable. This company doesn't even care

454
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,380
because they're like, yeah, whatever we got what we want, go away nerds.

455
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,099
And,

456
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,050
I mean, that's part of what makes, I think

457
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,959
this whole situation so confusing.

458
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:58,400
It's like no one knows what's actually going on and we're all assuming the worst.

459
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,069
And I mean, maybe it is, maybe it isn't,

460
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,819
I don't really care because we have a solution.

461
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:03,739
But, you know, it's,

462
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:04,510
it's mind

463
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,040
boggling.

464
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,040
Well, and I think it's sort of safe to assume the worst because if we have we ever had

465
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:13,040
a company acquire a project like this, that's new.

466
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,359
You know,

467
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,800
it's one thing when a company like Red Hat or Ubuntu or

468
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,520
Souza acquires an open source company because it's kind of like,

469
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,949
you know,

470
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,390
like they have a track record of decades of behavior in the

471
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,750
open source world and they're just going to keep doing that.

472
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,359
Whereas this company that's only existed for a week.

473
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,619
I, but like I said, I think these, these kind of material changes to the project

474
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,339
need to be taken into account with risk because

475
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,175
what if they decide to do something crazy? Like start

476
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,425
injecting ads into the thing,

477
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:44,025
did it that happened with was it N PM packages. Remember a couple of years back,

478
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:44,805
someone

479
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,464
put ads in their N PM packages.

480
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,724
I think we did a show on that where we talked, you know, how do these people make money?

481
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:52,025
And this is one way to make money.

482
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,280
Uh Now N PM has a thing where they basically

483
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,430
show you which projects would like sponsorship and kind of,

484
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,339
you can go and actually click a link and just

485
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,089
plug in your credit card number and sponsor them.

486
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,790
It's, it's actually pretty slick and I think it's way less offensive and annoying

487
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:09,089
now, I guess there's a funny other side to this

488
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,010
that

489
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:10,790
I

490
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:12,770
don't think anyone's really talking about.

491
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,630
But it is true is, I think even a couple of years ago,

492
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,729
this would have been unthinkable where the concept

493
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,790
of like using open source in this way,

494
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,020
it just didn't exist.

495
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,839
But I think if you want proof that open source is one like this is it.

496
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:31,189
But what terrifies me is, I think we're at the beginning

497
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,130
of this

498
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:36,550
journey, I think we're going to see more and more instances of this happening where,

499
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:36,819
I mean,

500
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:40,790
if you have an open source project that's controlled by one or a couple of people

501
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,410
and someone shows up with a bag of money and it's like give us your project,

502
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,130
a lot of people are going to take that payout and I,

503
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,099
I honestly would not blame them one bit for doing it.

504
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,339
Well, and what's fascinating to me is there's,

505
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:55,010
there's a lot of historical projects with a lot of

506
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,520
IP and a lot of knowledge locked up in them,

507
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,160
well, not locked up, but you know what I mean? Embedded in them.

508
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,380
So like Engine X or Apache.

509
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,310
But they, they all kind of have a parent entity like a,

510
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,099
literally a company or a foundation.

511
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:11,140
And then there's things like audacity which have huge

512
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,099
amounts of engineering knowledge and talent baked into them,

513
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,280
but they don't have that protective mechanism,

514
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:18,739
right? There's, there's no larger entity.

515
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,640
And now, so you bring up an interesting example, Apache and Engine

516
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,050
X. So like these are good examples, you've got Engine

517
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,359
X which is a company which actually F five just acquired

518
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,319
and you have Apache which is a foundation, right? When you have a foundation,

519
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,640
I don't think you can acquire a foundation.

520
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,824
I mean, I don't know exactly how that all works,

521
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,994
but I have a strong suspicion it's not going to happen.

522
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:40,185
Well,

523
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:43,824
there are foundations that spin off their stuff and sell it off to other entities.

524
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,785
So that's a possibility and you can acquire a foundation in the sense of

525
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,344
you can hijack control of it by getting control of the board or whatever.

526
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:50,665
That's probably true too.

527
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,824
But it's, you know, it's generally kind of a pain.

528
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,805
Whereas audacity is I'm guessing a handful of

529
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,704
people because looking at this contributor list,

530
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,685
it's clear that, you know, if you take out those top two or three people.

531
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:03,204
Audacity languishes.

532
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:04,104
Right. Right.

533
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,880
Exactly.

534
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,900
Um, so

535
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:12,410
-- I guess now,
-- but, ok, so here's my point though, of all this is if you look at,

536
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,170
I would say the vast majority of open source and this is especially

537
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,640
true in like the N PM world where there's lots of smaller things.

538
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,239
These aren't foundations that hold this stuff,

539
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,560
these aren't companies that hold this stuff, these are

540
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,770
people on github,

541
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,400
but they're also, I think there's a fundamental difference.

542
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,072
Audacity is a big honking desktop app for which there is really no easy replacement.

543
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,072
I mean, literally, if somebody says I can't use audacity, what can I use?

544
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,213
And I'd be like, I guess garageband.

545
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,072
Well, you don't know because you don't work with it.

546
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,753
There's a ton of stuff you could use,

547
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:47,432
but fundamentally audacity is probably the best open

548
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,633
source audio editor on the planet today.

549
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:52,353
Yes. And it's in your face and you have to learn it.

550
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:57,593
But whereas an N PM package typically is I'm not going to say, always easy to replace,

551
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:00,105
but I'm going to say it's probably easy to replace them.

552
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:03,406
-- Something like audacity.
-- No, not at all. It, I mean, it depends.

553
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:03,916
Some are,

554
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:07,546
some aren't like I'll give you a great example is there's a package called low dash.

555
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:11,946
Low dash is used by I bet 80 plus percent

556
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:13,836
of N PM packages,

557
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:16,895
-- low dash is irreplaceable.
-- Well, I don't mean irre

558
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,985
like, I don't mean it's hard to replace in this.

559
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:19,696
Basically,

560
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,235
what I'm trying to get at is it's really easy to fork an N PM

561
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:25,546
and have something equivalent that will keep working for you for a long time.

562
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,786
Whereas a desktop app

563
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,500
typically, you know, you can see,

564
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,349
I think there's a bit of a fundamental difference in the way

565
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,260
desktop apps are used and sort of those back end libraries.

566
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,420
I would argue

567
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:42,500
that it is less work to fork audacity than it would be to fork low dash.

568
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,619
And I'm pretty sure I'm right

569
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,859
because if you needed to replace low dash,

570
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:52,920
you're talking about like 10 layers of dependencies scattered all over

571
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,390
your N PM

572
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,459
modules.

573
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:57,849
It would be disastrous.

574
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:02,359
Well, I guess the fundamental thing though is there's no path to monetizing low dash

575
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,040
now without doing something basically evil. Whereas audacity, it is self evident.

576
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:12,089
It, you know, ads, it's a desktop app collecting data upselling people stuff.

577
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,160
I can't imagine trying to like, sell somebody something through grip or set or a

578
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:19,369
right. Well, in like low dash is another example.

579
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,609
I, I, because of what you said, I suspect no one's going to buy it because

580
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:29,780
like, how would you even monetize that? And other than maybe like for injecting ads?

581
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:34,290
-- I mean, I don't know, it would be a disaster for sure,
-- but I suspect there's,

582
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,050
this is the one thing that always,

583
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,650
I find interesting is this idea of sort of money filters.

584
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,290
Right. Where you have these sieves that collect money

585
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,170
in the software world, especially,

586
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,760
you know, you have the classic cases like Oracle where it's, or sales force.

587
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,959
Why, why do we use sales force? Because we have to.

588
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,339
Right, because they, they're sales force. Right. Exactly.

589
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,530
Everybody out there who deals with sales force is groaning. But

590
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,780
these companies that are looking for these sort of,

591
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,280
you know, fat

592
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:07,420
juicy, ripe software applications that they can then acquire probably cheaply.

593
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,579
Like I'm guessing this was not a million dollar deal. Probably not,

594
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,219
you know.

595
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,000
And so I,

596
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,939
I worry that there's going to be more of this because if you only

597
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:21,020
like for a lot of companies to spend a couple of $100,000 acquiring something,

598
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,250
there are a lot of ways you can very easily make more than that back.

599
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,989
And it might be something as simple as like we acquired

600
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:30,719
open source project X and our stock price went up and our

601
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,459
-- CEO sold a bunch of shares and made money
-- and look,

602
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:33,699
I, I

603
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,739
guarantee you this is the beginning.

604
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:36,939
I

605
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,069
-- mean, if I was gonna, it's
-- like ransomware, we know it works now.

606
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,390
It Right.

607
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,449
Yes, I agree completely.

608
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,469
And I think we are going to see more examples

609
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,880
of weird things like this happening in the open source

610
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,589
world because like open source is one open source is

611
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,260
normalized and there's going to be companies that view this as

612
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,349
an easy button to get ahead.

613
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,760
-- Well,
-- there's a pile of value sitting there that I can acquire for a couple 100 grand.

614
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:03,000
Duh.

615
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,579
Yeah. Right. Right. I mean, what would it cost to actually write an audio editor for

616
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,219
-- millions? Millions of dollars?
-- Tens,

617
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,150
-- probably a good one. At least.
-- How would you even hire?

618
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,280
So, where would you even find the programmers?

619
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,689
I don't know

620
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,709
if anyone knows where to find programmers. Like, let me know, I'm

621
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,400
looking

622
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,540
you and everybody else.

623
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,719
-- I
-- know, man, it's horrible. Anyway, anyway, we're,

624
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,079
I, I feel like this has been a marvelously wandering conversation but I,

625
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:33,630
I guess at the end of the day,

626
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,010
the my, my big takeaway from all of this is just that

627
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,680
this is, this is not going to be a singular event. I think this is the beginning

628
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,099
of something we're going. If we don't pay attention to as an open source universe,

629
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,020
I think

630
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,869
it is going to end very badly and a lot of people are going to get burnt.

631
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,630
-- I
-- think the real ugly truth is there's all these

632
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,119
piles of magical value sitting around but

633
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,810
the people working on them have not been able to monetize

634
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:05,540
or even remotely make back what they've put into it.

635
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,020
You know, I, I always love these people when they're like, I quit doing this project.

636
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,479
And, you know,

637
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:15,660
and by the way I had, uh you know, a sponsor link and it made me like $87 in like a decade.

638
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:22,209
Yeah. Yes, that, that's how this works. Nobody will pony up a nickel, let alone $10.

639
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,930
I mean, well, not today. I'm, I'm hopeful that some of these things like github

640
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,089
has sponsors, NP MS sponsors. You got Tide Lift doing work. I'm hopeful it catches on

641
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,310
because I think the work these people do

642
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,869
is virtually invaluable to the world and it is

643
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,979
terrible that there are so many organizations just like

644
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:41,969
strip mining the crap out of their work.

645
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:44,650
-- Perfect
-- wording because I was about to say

646
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,040
the real thing I worry about is the externalities of

647
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,569
when they poop all over these projects and destroy them,

648
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:52,449
like strip mining a mountain and you know,

649
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,449
-- the watershed is contaminated from and I'm going
-- to leave because it's over.

650
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:58,839
It's not my problem anymore. And it's, yeah, it's, it's terrible.

651
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:00,459
I don't

652
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:06,310
it, man, it's so funny because I mean, I just, I remember a couple of decades ago

653
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,030
it was like, oh, I don't know about this open source thing. Is it gonna work?

654
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,800
Is it not gonna work? And now

655
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,310
like, look at what's happening. This is wild.

656
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,709
So anyway, anyway, I'll give you the last word on this one. Take it home.

657
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,839
Don't pollute the environment, be it software environment or the real environment

658
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:22,704
because

659
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:25,984
I love it. No, it's, it's, you make like,

660
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,984
II I hate it when these companies make life objectively worse for everybody.

661
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:33,145
You know, like setting the ocean on fire,

662
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,895
right? Which definitely isn't happening right now.

663
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,199
Uh

664
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,719
Anyway.

665
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,520
All right.

666
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,040
All right.
