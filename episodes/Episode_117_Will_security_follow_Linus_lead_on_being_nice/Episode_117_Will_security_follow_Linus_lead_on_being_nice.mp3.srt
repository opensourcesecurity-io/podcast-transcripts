Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 117 with myself,

1
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,800
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,520
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,319
-- man.
-- You still don't sound very good.

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,200
Kurt. This is how it works for me though.

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,799
Is I get sick and the, the how sick I look and sound

6
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:24,680
is about 24 to 48 hours delayed behind how sick I actually am.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,989
So my throat feels a little sore but like, you know,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,959
I slept for like nine hours last night and

9
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:31,969
I, I feel great.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,330
Ok, compared to like 24 hours ago,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,729
I'll take your word for that.

12
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:38,700
Sweet.

13
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,130
All right, man. So, so I guess other than sick, what else is new?

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,349
Uh, well, I mean, I'm not even sure, kind of how to frame this, but, you know,

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,919
Linus Torvalds,

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,419
I guess you could say finally came out of the closet.

17
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:53,479
Maybe

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:53,720
I,

19
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:56,750
I feel like this is going to be sort of the,

20
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:59,900
I don't want to say scandal because it's not a scandal, but it's kind of the,

21
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:03,790
it's the big unspoken mess of

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,230
it in general. Let's face it,

23
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:06,949
you know.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,779
Um, especially a lot of the open source world where it's kind of more exposed.

25
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,010
I,

26
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,440
I do agree and I guess for the sake of

27
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:18,610
posterity and anyone who maybe doesn't read the news.

28
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,779
So historically speaking,

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,680
the Linux kernel community and especially Linus has been, we'll say abrasive and,

30
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,989
and I use the word abrasive in quotes.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,800
I was just about to say that it's funny because that's the word that we keep using.

32
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:36,809
And I feel like it's almost turned into one of those

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,650
terms of,

34
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,639
you know,

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
that's not what it really means though, folks, like,

36
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,099
it's quite a bit worse than that.

37
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,150
Let's face it. Linus is a dick.

38
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,139
I'm just saying

39
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:52,769
well, and, and, and more to the point though, it's not just Linus, it's,

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,129
this is an endemic

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,260
problem.

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,129
Yes, I agree. I agree.

43
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:57,319
So,

44
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,510
let's frame the Linus conversation first and

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,419
then we'll bring it elsewhere because I,

46
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,389
I'm totally guilty of this as well.

47
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,860
-- And
-- literally, and I'm not trying to

48
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:09,220
hijack that. Hashtag I just, I don't know. Me too. Like, literally,

49
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:11,509
I, I also have been a dick.

50
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:12,078
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,500
Right. OK. So anyway,

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,419
uh Linus has been a terrible person and he

53
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,009
basically finally sends an email that says I'm,

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,410
we just, we slow to,

55
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,210
I wouldn't say he's been a terrible person.

56
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,059
I would say he's a person who has had some terrible behavior.

57
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,619
Ok. That's fair. He's probably quite nice.

58
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,339
-- And in fact, that's, well, that's
-- something that,

59
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,649
that's another thing that's come up is, is a lot of these people,

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,520
one on one in person are actually quite reasonable human beings.

61
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:36,940
It's just

62
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,139
right.

63
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,529
Yes. I, I remember saying that a lot is, oh, I hung out with.

64
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,179
So, and so they're very nice in person.

65
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,580
I've now come to realize that's not OK.

66
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:51,429
-- It's just online professionally. They're a dick.
-- Right. Right. So, anyway, Linus.

67
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,100
Linus was quite mean

68
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,589
to the Linux kernel community and, and there's

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:56,770
a

70
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:59,414
and to be clear, this wasn't just a one time thing. This has been

71
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,014
like two decades

72
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,875
basically since Linux started.

73
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,645
And so anyway, he, he apparently due to a variety of reasons,

74
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:11,884
had a bit of a come to Jesus moment where he's realized

75
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:16,604
he's not acting very nicely and has decided to seek help.

76
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,014
And

77
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,600
I, I will say I'm slightly jealous of the fact that

78
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,440
this guy has the resources that when he decides he needs some help in this regard, he,

79
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,440
he can get it

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,559
right, because many of many of us can't.

81
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,300
Actually.

82
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:34,490
No, I, so the way I, I had similar issues were to be honest, I was a dick,

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,119
especially back in the, like we're talking 20 years ago

84
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,160
on Irc, you know, I was a dick.

85
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,000
I was mean to people, I was rude, you know, tough love and all that.

86
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,990
Luckily though I

87
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,880
had enough self awareness to realize I was being a dick and

88
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,759
it was also not a very fun thing to be a dick.

89
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,399
Like to, to basically just,

90
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,449
it's like being an asshole driver intentionally, like,

91
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,690
nobody actually wants to do that really?

92
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,289
Unless they're kind of crazy.

93
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,690
Uh Fortunately, I'm not super crazy.

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,759
And so for me, it was a combination of two things.

95
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,690
One, I backed away from the sort of environments in the places where that

96
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,139
behavior where I did that behavior a lot. So,

97
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,449
you know, to put it bluntly, it's like I stopped going to the bar

98
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,660
and then the second part was

99
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,580
is I, I actually

100
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,399
went out of my way to yeah, to learn some empathy.

101
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,420
Um

102
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,649
And when you say people lack the resources to it.

103
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,179
Uh There's a lot of places where you can go

104
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,559
learn about empathy for, for free or for very cheap.

105
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,179
And for example, one thing would be um

106
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,339
if you have any local Buddhist groups, right? Buddhism is huge about

107
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,700
suffering, right?

108
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:37,260
Life is about suffering and, and a major component of suffering is having empathy

109
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,359
and understanding that suffering and then

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,410
working to alleviate it, right?

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,420
So I, so I just, I mean, it, yeah,

112
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:46,279
it would be nice to be able to afford one on one therapy and you know,

113
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,670
uh behavioral talk therapy and whatnot.

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,160
Uh Yeah, and the reality is, most of us don't have like 200 bucks an hour to spare for

115
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,600
dozens of hours. But

116
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,329
uh there are a lot of because a lot of problems

117
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,470
and a lot of situations boil down to step one.

118
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,000
Empathy,

119
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,209
step two, understand empathy, having, helping you understand

120
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,450
the other parties in this. You know, I, I go through this with my ex-wife.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,049
We don't get along,

122
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,070
but I try very hard to have empathy for her even when she drives me nuts

123
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,220
and, and

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,040
that's fair. It's,

125
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,769
it, it, let's, let's back up even a little more first

126
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,929
and, and

127
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,529
focus on Linus

128
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,649
and then, and then go from there.

129
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,209
And so he's, he's getting some help and then we're going to see where we go next. And

130
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,809
I have seen reactions to this

131
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,890
every which way you can imagine.

132
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,769
I actually haven't read any reactions.

133
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:39,700
I

134
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,320
saw quite a few and I,

135
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,440
I didn't even, I didn't look for them either. It was a lot of it showed up on Twitter.

136
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,010
Yeah, I don't read my Twitter feed.

137
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,660
That's one of the things I realize is just

138
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,040
I, I'm very selective about it.

139
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:57,670
I've created some lists that I use specifically for, for infosec stuff

140
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,109
which,

141
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,000
which I enjoy. But anyway, it showed up on there a lot and, and there was

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,470
a number, a lot of people were praising Linus and saying this is great. I'm also in a

143
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,589
similar situation or they might have said I've gone through this

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,709
before or I agree this is a problem and that's fair.

145
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,220
But then,

146
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:16,359
so here's,

147
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:20,209
here's the thing I struggle with and I don't know if I agree with this or not.

148
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,279
I also saw a number of people basically say

149
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,220
you can't say you didn't know you were being a

150
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,519
jerk because everyone should have some base level of manners.

151
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,730
And, and this is where I, I

152
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,279
remember being in situations like this and it's like,

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,720
I don't think you're wrong, but I think it's more complicated than that.

154
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,640
It's actually vastly more complicated than that because let's start with,

155
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,170
are you neuron

156
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:43,549
nom

157
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,359
or not?

158
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,950
Because there's a lot of neurotypical people, for example,

159
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,420
on the autism scale or on the Asperger's scale

160
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,070
where? Yeah. No, they don't know that they're being an asshole.

161
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,350
They, they just don't,

162
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,730
their brain isn't wired to know that. It's like

163
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,279
I have a son who's high functioning autistic and

164
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,029
there are certain things that his brain is just

165
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,549
not wired up to understand or know or to comprehend in the same way that we do.

166
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,109
And it's, he's not trying to be a jerk. It's just

167
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,910
um he, for example, doesn't really, he doesn't understand personal space.

168
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:14,709
All right.

169
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,619
And he's also a twin.

170
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,579
So he's, he's grew up in his entire life with this person where he,

171
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,200
you know, him and his twin brother, ha don't his twin brother who's neuron

172
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,269
nom of also has problems with personal space

173
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,130
in the sense of he's not used to it,

174
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,619
right? Because he's used to this person who literally,

175
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,549
you know, they share food like they share drinks, they

176
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,559
they

177
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,369
dog pile each other and it's just no big deal, you know.

178
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,029
Um So that, that would be my first question is, is, you know, what is the

179
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,489
sort of, what's the underlying

180
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,010
basis or what's the underlying stuff around this behavior? Right?

181
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,480
It may be that the person is

182
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,170
not neurotypical

183
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:51,239
and they,

184
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,609
if they have asperger's or autism in some cases,

185
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:56,649
they lack those filters or they lack those capabilities to,

186
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,369
to process like, oh, is that person smiling or like making an angry face at me?

187
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,299
Like there's people on the autism spectrum who literally

188
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,980
learned that by like

189
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,410
having flash cards

190
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,890
interesting

191
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,589
and like memorizing.

192
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,440
OK, smile is corners up, frown is corners down.

193
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,149
-- That's
-- no iii I think that's really fair.

194
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,320
And actually you saying this, it, it, I I'm getting flashbacks too. I remember

195
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,760
I was, I was doing a group project one time a really long time ago

196
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,519
and I, I keep

197
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,839
now, I guess just

198
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,019
to start, I'm,

199
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,440
I've never been diagnosed with like Asperger's or autism or anything.

200
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,679
It would not shock me

201
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,510
if, if I went in,

202
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:37,530
I was,

203
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,219
but

204
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,799
I remember dealing with,

205
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:42,479
with groups at one point where I would say things and they're like,

206
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,890
how can you say something like that?

207
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,349
And I was thinking, what, what's wrong with that?

208
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,960
And I remember that the one that always sticks with me is there was someone

209
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,849
who was working at the company I was at

210
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,400
that had like one eye that always pointed off in the wrong direction.

211
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,950
And someone said, well, well, who's so, and so I said, oh, he's the guy with the,

212
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,869
the goofy eye that points off in the corner.

213
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,729
-- Yeah, Josh, you can't say
-- that. And that's the thing.

214
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,099
I'm like, what's wrong with that? That's like that, that's who he is.

215
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,669
-- It's factually
-- correct.

216
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,830
It's totally factually correct.

217
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,530
-- This is where
-- I have a problem I acknowledge because part of me is like, well, yeah,

218
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,190
but that is factually correct and quick and efficient.

219
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,219
What more do you want?

220
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:19,909
Like to this day

221
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:25,030
in my brain, I don't see a problem describing someone like that, but I know I can't

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,830
because I've, I've learned through, through many years of,

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,429
of interacting and reading books and getting yelled at that.

224
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,070
There are certain things you don't use to describe a person even if they are true.

225
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,140
And you know, part of that is, is

226
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,520
for some of these people on the,

227
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,479
that are not neurotypical or even for people that are neurotypical,

228
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,780
sometimes it boils down to

229
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,719
fake it till you make it and you may never make it. You may just be faking it. Like

230
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,580
I literally had a boss at one point who was definitely on the on a spectrum, you know,

231
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:59,219
and he literally once was like,

232
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,320
so this is the part of the conversation where

233
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm supposed to ask you how you're doing.

234
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,080
Although I don't really care and I'm like,

235
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,929
I appreciate your honesty and I appreciate that you actually are

236
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,460
going through the motions of asking about how I am and,

237
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:11,609
you know,

238
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:14,210
and I, I understand that for you this, yeah, you,

239
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,659
you really fundamentally don't care,

240
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,590
you know, it's like a, it's like cat levels of antipathy towards people, you know.

241
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,880
But yeah, so back to Linus and so

242
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,179
I, I, you know, it's like any problem, step one, recognizing you have a problem.

243
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,330
I agree.

244
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,919
And, and I think ignoring the, the,

245
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,710
the past behavior he should have known and I'm not going to argue whether he should

246
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,719
or shouldn't have or did or didn't or any of that because it doesn't matter.

247
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:38,830
And, and I think

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,909
that's the most important point.

249
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,140
People sometimes don't realize when you're in a situation like this

250
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,049
is,

251
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,119
you can't keep digging up the past, the past,

252
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,880
doesn't matter what you need to focus on is the future.

253
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,500
And he said, I want to get better.

254
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,640
So that's the conversation and that's the thing we need to focus on. Like, for real.

255
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah.

256
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,859
Well, the challenge is a lot of people are very hurt potentially from these actions.

257
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:03,190
And,

258
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,669
you know, I mean, I've dealt well and I've, I've,

259
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,619
I'm dealing with, you know, professional organizations where

260
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,909
in some cases,

261
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,559
some members of these professional organizations have behaved so badly

262
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,030
that, um,

263
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,549
we voted them off the island.

264
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,549
Uh, and this is after things like other companies saying

265
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,179
these people are no longer allowed to talk to our

266
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,830
people if they need to talk to our people.

267
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,059
Here's our point of contact in our legal department,

268
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,229
right?

269
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:31,020
And,

270
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,429
and this isn't like

271
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,630
about legal stuff. This is about just this.

272
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,150
These people being so fantastically rude and abusive.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,789
That's wild man. Iii I get it.

274
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,409
I have a filter for open BS d.org I don't accept email from them after the second time.

275
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,830
They were so abusive to me that my

276
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,869
twice in my career uh and this is like 15 years apart.

277
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,750
I've dealt with the Open BS d.org.

278
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,130
People tried to be helpful towards them and they've been

279
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,330
so abusive that even my manager stepped in and said,

280
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,309
Kurt, you don't have to talk to them.

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,289
They can talk to me.

282
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:01,869
I was like, you know what? No, it'll be fine.

283
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,650
But yeah, this,

284
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,859
there's a couple of key members in the open BS D org community that are,

285
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,929
are infamously known for being abusive

286
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:10,440
and

287
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,419
I suspect that's actually one of the reasons open BS D I mean,

288
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:14,809
it's still plugging along but

289
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,140
fundamentally like,

290
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,049
yeah, it's not that healthy anymore.

291
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,900
II, I agree with you.

292
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,869
I mean, I,

293
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,070
I remember interacting with a handful of them a

294
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,349
really long time ago and it was just like,

295
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,469
I, I don't like this, this isn't cool.

296
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,020
They were

297
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,799
because I remember it was Irc and stuff and people were just,

298
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,919
they weren't nice and helpful and that's

299
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,940
because I remember I got into Linux

300
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,729
and then I started learning about, you know,

301
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,729
everything going on in free software and open BS D.

302
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,239
I thought, wow, this is awesome. Like this is something I really want to do.

303
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,969
And I remember I bought CD si,

304
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,909
remember when you bought C DS

305
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:47,960
and they did,

306
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,849
they came with cool stickers and they had a cool logo for every version like, yeah,

307
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,789
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get into Open BS D and

308
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:57,450
after a couple of months I gave up because I said this is not a place I want to be.

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,530
Yeah, I think it was around version

310
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,760
2.12 0.2. I just went never again.

311
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,919
And even though I really like Open BS D had some really amazing capabilities,

312
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,219
I was using that, Linux still doesn't really have

313
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,260
anything comparable to like the firewall fail over stuff.

314
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,700
You know. Open BS D has been doing that for like a decade now trivially.

315
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,700
And I was like, no, I'm literally,

316
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,940
this is what made me really quite sad. Open BS D is quite a good set of software tools

317
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,440
but the community I found so painful to deal with

318
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,320
it made it not worth it.

319
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,349
Yeah, totally.

320
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:36,049
And, and this is one of the other things I'm wondering is if Linus starts being nice

321
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,400
-- is the Linux community going to explode?
-- Linus doesn't even have to be nice.

322
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,010
He just has to be not mean,

323
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,940
nice would be great. But,

324
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,599
like, frankly, no, I mean, like a lot of these communities,

325
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,739
they don't have to be nice. They just have to not be mean and nasty.

326
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,979
Just be neutral.

327
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,859
-- Professional. Literally just be professional,
-- really low bar.

328
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,770
Yeah. And yet here we are

329
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:08,270
and, and I feel like the security community is totally guilty of this as well.

330
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,400
I mean, I, I remember back in the day

331
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,270
when people would make a security mistake and it's like it was on, I mean,

332
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
we were terrible to them,

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,760
you know, well, like Troy Hunt, for example, just wrote an article about, you know,

334
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,549
the value of publicly shaming companies.

335
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,750
And

336
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,659
it's interesting to me because

337
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,309
specifically he's talking about

338
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,109
companies, not people, but companies and see and, and that's one of those sort of,

339
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,510
to me, one of those dividing lines, right?

340
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,789
Like

341
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,719
I think it's fine to,

342
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,000
you know, when, for example, when Linna says, like

343
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,229
you and Vidian holds up his finger, I I would say, uh as directed towards a company

344
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,750
that was quite fair actually,

345
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,929
but had he directed that towards actual specific NVIDIA developers or anything,

346
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,320
then I would have said, no, not cool.

347
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,380
And that's one distinction to make is, is

348
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,890
again, we're not talking about, you know,

349
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,330
everybody being super polite and nice all the time to everything and everybody.

350
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,789
No, but we're, we're talking about like a basic level of professionalism, you know,

351
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,359
no more ad hominid attacks.

352
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,400
Let me ask this then is Linus

353
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:05,359
calling all security people masturbating monkeys acceptable,

354
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:07,559
whether it's true or not.

355
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:08,000
I

356
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:13,059
don't think it's acceptable. And I also, I was about to say, I also don't think he's,

357
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,330
I don't think he's actually that far from wrong on that one.

358
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,080
I think part of the problem is, and this goes to the empathy piece.

359
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,320
For example, if you ask me about my thoughts on that comment, I would say,

360
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,080
I think Linus is correct and I also think the security people are correct.

361
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,919
And I also think Linus is wrong and I also think the security people are wrong

362
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,159
because it's a complicated question

363
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,140
with multiple viewpoints and multiple own versions of reality

364
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,150
that are correct for those people, but maybe not correct for other people.

365
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,520
You know, a security person might be willing to make the trade off of, oh,

366
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,890
I don't mind a crash once in a while as

367
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,849
long as nobody gets into our back end account system

368
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,090
and cleans out our bank.

369
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,010
Linus's viewpoint is Linus's

370
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,080
Linux rather is running on everything at this point.

371
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,940
And even if we only break one in a million devices, that's like a

372
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:54,859
kajillions light bulbs.

373
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,409
So Linus really has this thing about stability and safety and

374
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,119
not breaking stuff, which I totally get that, that's a very valid worldview.

375
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,200
Um

376
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:08,530
You know, and

377
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,599
for example, maybe he needs to have a bit more empathy with the security people

378
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:16,150
and not necessarily do what they want but maybe understand

379
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,830
what and why it is that they want these things

380
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,919
and maybe together they can find a better solution

381
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,380
or maybe they can't, I don't know because honestly some of these problems are so hard

382
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,700
that there is no

383
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:30,940
quote unquote good solution. There's just like the least worst set of trade offs.

384
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,260
Right.

385
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,630
Well, and I think historically,

386
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,960
security people have been really bad at accepting

387
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,440
tradeoffs because we love perfect or nothing.

388
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,429
Nothing always wins

389
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,330
pretty much. Yeah, here we are.

390
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,929
So, you know, and,

391
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,799
and I think that's a basic part of empathy is not just empathizing with the, the human

392
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,530
but trying, you know,

393
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,169
one thing I would love to see from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

394
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,179
is the point of perspective or was it point of view gun?

395
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,890
Right?

396
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,710
Remember that gun and it, it forced your enemy to see things from your perspective.

397
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,729
And I thought

398
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,060
that's actually a really clever weapon

399
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,489
because everyone's the good guy

400
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,489
-- in their own personal narrative.
-- Exactly.

401
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,390
So, yeah, I know, I think empathy is stage one, you know,

402
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,040
not only for seeing these humans as humans and maybe

403
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,880
treating them a little less terribly and more professionally,

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
but then also to understand, you know,

405
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:20,719
well,

406
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,199
why, you know, why are they saying these crazy things? Why,

407
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,430
you know, there's a lot of people who engage with

408
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,188
communities that a lot of us find

409
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,129
not very pleasant or in some, in some cases, very despicable,

410
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:37,389
you know, like the far right neo Nazi movement, I'm like,

411
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,359
didn't we establish in like the 19 forties that this is not a good ideology?

412
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,280
I thought we covered this, you know,

413
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,630
and yet here we are today,

414
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,530
right? OK.

415
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,660
So you have a really good point that I was actually just

416
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,030
about to ask you about is so let's say Linus stops being terrible

417
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,390
to people in email,

418
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,109
but you have to draw a line somewhere because let's face it if,

419
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,020
if somebody shows up and is like, I want to talk to you about, you know,

420
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,729
pushing a far right agenda in the Linux kernel.

421
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,729
He's not going to say, oh, let me sit down with you and understand what you want.

422
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:07,640
He's going to be like,

423
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,489
no,

424
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,050
right.

425
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,650
And I think that's OK.

426
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,420
Well, there's, I'm of two minds of that on the one hand, yeah, it's like I,

427
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,670
this is the reason I just stopped all contact

428
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,020
with the open BS D community because it's like,

429
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,609
I don't want to deal with these buggers

430
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,390
on the flip side though is unless we engage with these people and, you know,

431
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,819
to court Jordan B Peterson for which I'm going to be probably labeled far, right?

432
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,119
But to quote Jordan B Peterson,

433
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,510
unless we tell these people a better story and pull their heads out of their butts,

434
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,359
you know, I'm paraphrasing his quote.

435
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:36,050
But basically, unless we help educate these people and, and

436
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,829
convince them of

437
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,270
what is better in some cases, like, objectively better,

438
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,829
how, how are we going to bring them out of the craziness that they're in?

439
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:48,250
I, and, and on the flip side I totally get,

440
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,050
I don't want to be that person because Holy Keck, I do not get paid for that.

441
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,400
Right. Right. I think,

442
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,829
I, I guess this might be the next challenge now. Right.

443
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,400
Is, so, I think the days of being terrible to everybody are,

444
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,859
are probably coming to an end.

445
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,199
I won't say they're over,

446
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,979
but I think they're coming to an end.

447
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:10,890
And I also think this is going to be a rough patch for

448
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,150
security folks because we are notorious for being difficult in this regard.

449
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,750
But I guess here's, here's the thing I wonder then is

450
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,739
so if we're not mean to people and let's face it.

451
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,579
Part of being mean, drives large groups away and, and you, of course,

452
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:29,550
get many reasonable people in with the crazy people and let's face it.

453
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,579
If you've ever been involved in open source,

454
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,380
you've run across crazy people who want to do

455
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,160
bizarre things for like, literally no good reason.

456
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,910
And, and it's like, I don't want to deal with you anymore. I mean, I,

457
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,819
and I remember dealing with some people back in the day that, like, thought

458
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:49,219
CV E was a government plot and, and they were, and it's,

459
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,579
oh, my goodness, just go away.

460
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,750
I've been accused of having CV E powers and using them for evil and I'm like,

461
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,619
I have powers and I can use them for evil.

462
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,920
How can I monetize this? Right. Yeah.

463
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah, that was my second question.

464
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,719
But anyway, so, so here's, here's the question is, let's face it,

465
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,800
the bad attitude drove away many people

466
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,930
and, and if we, if we don't have no note, I'm not justified bad attitude,

467
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,890
most of

468
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,099
them

469
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,550
permanently Because you know what? Even if

470
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,670
-- they're
-- never coming back,

471
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,494
even if we were handing out free hugs and cupcakes, they'd be like, yeah, no,

472
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:27,194
you're probably going to shove that cupcake in my notes.

473
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,535
And I think this is going to be Linus's

474
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,614
challenge now is convincing people that he's actually changed.

475
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,055
Well, first of all, he has to actually change, which I'm not,

476
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,574
I'm not convinced that's going to happen.

477
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:39,285
-- It's bigger
-- than that though. It's not just no offense.

478
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,295
The Linus, the Linux community is not just Linux,

479
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,645
-- totally,
-- he definitely

480
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:46,935
to some degree can set the tone

481
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,704
and what is and is not generally acceptable.

482
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:51,875
But

483
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:53,204
uh

484
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:53,895
you know,

485
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,900
these people following him, they also have free will and they can also choose

486
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,099
a variety of different behaviors.

487
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,699
And so I think it's great that Linus, hopefully from the, from the sort of

488
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,859
the, the helm of the ship is steering it a bit,

489
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,520
but fundamentally, you know, hopefully everybody else gets on board with this too

490
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,439
and they have a code of conduct

491
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,609
-- that they're implementing and, and that should help
-- clarify

492
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:18,699
the

493
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:19,329
one.

494
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,599
I don't know which one it is.

495
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,760
I don't know if I haven't looked to see if it matches anything else but, but whatever,

496
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,119
here's, here's my point though

497
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,189
is

498
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,400
if we're going to be nice professionals,

499
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:35,160
how do we deal with people who are coming in

500
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,689
and being unreasonable? Not, not on purpose necessarily,

501
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:44,109
but like if, if somebody wants something and it's in the past,

502
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,959
Linus would have told him to f off.

503
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,290
But now what do you do? Right. How do you tell someone in a nice way?

504
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,000
Like go away, you're an idiot.

505
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:56,060
So part of it would be, is to have them state their case

506
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:59,459
professionally and clearly and if they can't, they can go away.

507
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,800
Right? So I think we should do X

508
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,400
OK. Why state of business case? State what's,

509
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,530
you know, we're making changes in the CV world and,

510
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,569
and a lot of these changes also boil down to, well,

511
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,709
why do we need this? What do we need this for?

512
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:17,130
Is there actually a reasonable business case, you know, a need for this?

513
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:21,160
Can you state it clearly and if they're not willing to do that work, then I,

514
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,680
I would say you probably aren't really required to,

515
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:24,780
to listen to them.

516
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,920
So a part of it boils down to is, is meeting these people halfway.

517
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,859
That means they also have to come halfway.

518
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,079
So if we're going to behave professionally and politely and nicely.

519
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,290
I would, I would expect that standard from them.

520
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,300
And for example, if they,

521
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,079
you know, are just incredibly rude and abrasive and abusive, I would,

522
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:42,930
I would ask them

523
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,959
to not be,

524
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,140
I would say, you know, we're, we're trying to be a professional community.

525
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,229
Here's our code of conduct.

526
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:51,250
If you actually want to get involved, a, you have to sign off on this

527
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,329
and I'm actually look like I'm pushing right now on some CV, working groups

528
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:59,209
to make that a requirement. You know, we'll have our contributor code of conduct,

529
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,630
uh you know, www dot contributor

530
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,790
hyphen covenant.org.

531
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,569
If you're not willing to kind of sign off on that, then, well, thank you. But goodbye.

532
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,089
You know, if you can't and,

533
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,329
and we're not talking like this is not a very high bar to set this thing.

534
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,890
And then secondly,

535
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,250
assuming they're willing to behave like a somewhat rational human being,

536
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,880
you know, have them state their case, maybe they have a case,

537
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,930
maybe they don't have a case.

538
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,599
Uh part of it too would be, you know,

539
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,449
is this something that's been asked and refused multiple times in the past?

540
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:26,579
Maybe for a good reason,

541
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:27,560
you know,

542
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,880
and maybe they're being somewhat unreasonable or maybe

543
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,239
the circumstances have changed and now it is

544
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:35,849
less unreasonable or maybe it is entirely reasonable.

545
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,869
Ok. I, I,

546
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:38,900
like what you said,

547
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,699
I think that that makes perfect sense and I guess here's the other half of it is.

548
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:47,099
I'm, I'm thinking back to when we talked to Steve Mazak about selling security.

549
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,939
If you have a pushy sales person

550
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,300
that doesn't want to leave you alone, like all you owe them is a,

551
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm not interested. Thank you.

552
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,489
And then you never have to reply to another male of theirs again.

553
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,170
And I guess that's the way open source is going to

554
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,349
need to be is if somebody shows up and says,

555
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,199
oh, I want to, you know, I want to do this crazy thing.

556
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:03,859
You can say

557
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,310
no, thank you.

558
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:08,630
-- And like that's literally all you
-- forgot. Option B, you forgot.

559
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,000
Option B which is great. You go do that.

560
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,099
They have the source code, they can fork it. I mean,

561
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:14,869
no, I'm serious.

562
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,510
I'm just saying that there is,

563
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,010
there is a rather significant option B where we can be like

564
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,479
to put it bluntly,

565
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:22,540
there's a lot of cases where I've

566
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,739
seen somebody propose something crazy and everybody proposes

567
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,989
it and then they go and do it and show it and then we're like,

568
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,819
oh, we were really wrong.

569
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:29,750
That is a cool feature

570
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,030
and that's fair.

571
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,250
But I don't even think that's option B I think if you're the one told to go home,

572
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,099
that's your

573
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,589
-- not
-- the
-- project.

574
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,550
I'm just saying when we tell people to go away,

575
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,329
we're not actually fully excluding them like other

576
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:43,619
situations, right?

577
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,060
Open source is a unique situation in which we can tell you,

578
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,209
we don't want to play with you,

579
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,859
but we're not going to actually exclude you. Here's the source code. Go nuts with it.

580
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,089
Is true. Right. You can go do your own thing.

581
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,349
Um, and this has happened, you know, Oracle, but son,

582
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,520
uh, what was it called before it became Fork Jenkins. Travis. Travis C I.

583
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,699
Right.

584
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:06,040
And the community generally didn't agree with Son and oracle and Son and oracle,

585
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,589
I guess, didn't agree with the community.

586
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,979
So that begat Jenkins and Jenkins one,

587
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:12,479
you know,

588
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,520
and so that, to me is sort of one of those safety valves of

589
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,109
just because we told these people to go away doesn't

590
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,979
mean if they actually turn out to have like a

591
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:22,310
really good idea and be correct and we're all wrong

592
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,050
because we have some weird old view of the world.

593
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,930
You know, we don't run that risk of completely losing it. Right.

594
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,599
Yeah, that's fair. And there's, I know there's a handful of examples like that too.

595
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:32,109
Yeah,

596
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,199
because one of the,

597
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,020
one of the challenges with these kind of group

598
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,189
politics and dynamics is when you start excluding people.

599
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,599
Well, hey, yeah, we,

600
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,040
there's a lot of stuff in the world with histories of

601
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,400
excluding people and we all know where that has ended,

602
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,140
ended up,

603
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:46,719
you know,

604
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,619
to put it bluntly, it is

605
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:51,630
like, what 90% white males

606
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,520
in

607
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,319
-- America?
-- It's, it is really bad.

608
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:57,479
I, I agree with that. And that's

609
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,760
diversity is like a whole another topic.

610
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,239
But I do think this is going to be part of that conversation because

611
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:05,719
we, we scare people away

612
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:06,530
and, and

613
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,109
I think,

614
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:08,719
I, I don't,

615
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,719
I'd like to say, I don't think anyone does it on purpose but I think most people don't.

616
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,890
So, at the Cloud Security Alliance we've actually had to,

617
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,030
um,

618
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,609
how do I say this politically and without getting in trouble,

619
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,130
um, there are some cases now where we have female staff

620
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:29,829
who, when they send out email announcements don't do it from their person, like,

621
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,130
from their accounts that are labeled as such,

622
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,640
-- uh, because of the abuse problems we've had,
-- I've,

623
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,530
I've heard of things like that or I heard there was

624
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:37,660
a,

625
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:41,589
it was, I don't remember it was job interviews or VC or what it was,

626
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,199
but there's a woman who, like,

627
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:46,969
had her own email address and she created a fake mail account

628
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,550
and the male one got, like,

629
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,520
three times as many responses than the female one did.

630
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,560
-- And it's like, ah, man,
-- well, they did the thing with the chat bot,

631
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,579
the, the support chat bot on a website. We'll have to find a link to that. But

632
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,030
they, I think they tried with a female male and, like, a neutral avatar or something.

633
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,890
And like, yeah, no, the female one got a horrendous amount

634
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,770
and it's not just that they get abused but it's the type of abuse they get,

635
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,689
they get stuff that,

636
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:15,109
-- uh, if somebody said that to my face, I would call the police.
-- It's, it's horrible.

637
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,800
I agree. And I,

638
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,800
man,

639
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,050
people suck.

640
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,170
That's, well, the problem is only, you know, if, even if it's only like,

641
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,349
0.01% of the community,

642
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:31,020
but if 0.01% of humanities decides to start spitting on your shoes

643
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:33,079
or on everybody's shoes, you know, that's,

644
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:34,930
-- that's going to be a really unpleasant world to live in
-- it.

645
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:38,140
It is true. And this is, I'm, I'm hopeful.

646
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,180
The,

647
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:44,329
the current wave of change I'm seeing continues because I think

648
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,140
it will be for the best at the end of the day

649
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:51,849
versus some of the things that have happened in the past. And now,

650
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:52,719
uh what was it?

651
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:57,599
John Oliver has a show and he, he actually, he talked to Anita Hill who was,

652
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,869
uh it's a long story but it's related to current events essentially.

653
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:06,349
And basically we thought in the nineties things were going to get better

654
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:07,400
and they didn't.

655
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:11,119
And we're there again and it's like, I hope it sticks this time.

656
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,959
-- They
-- got a little bit less worse.

657
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:15,560
-- It kind of, I
-- mean,

658
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,439
people with alternative, well, quote unquote, I don't,

659
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:19,430
I don't know what the term to use.

660
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,880
The LGBT Q community,

661
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:23,780
people who are alternative to the mainstream are no longer

662
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,060
us downtrodden.

663
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,040
That's,

664
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:32,599
I mean, there's a long way to go and I guess this is ok this is how we're going to end it.

665
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:36,300
And, and I think you've just hit on a very important point that,

666
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,160
that especially as white males in society,

667
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,209
we, we get stuck on is,

668
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,760
it's better than it used to be, is what we say. Right. But this is,

669
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,060
-- that is not how you measure
-- progress.

670
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:48,589
It's

671
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:49,329
worse

672
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:49,729
and

673
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,280
it's even, right. Less worse. Right. It's like, what is it?

674
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,680
JWZ has the famous quote of suck less is in progress

675
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,510
and sucks less is where we're at.

676
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,900
Right. It sucks less, but it still sucks. And I think that's the thing

677
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,290
we need to be very,

678
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,380
uh, uh aware of

679
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,579
and we need to make a point of making sure we

680
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,530
don't become complacent just because it sucks less for other people.

681
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,969
Doesn't mean it's getting better the way it needs to get better.

682
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,939
And I think it is sometimes easy to fall in the trap of saying,

683
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,869
well, it sucks less. That's good enough. I'm, I'm good now. Right.

684
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,449
It's, it, that is not the way it is. Do not think

685
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:31,290
you're doing the right thing

686
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:32,250
ever.

687
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:35,050
Always strive to be better. Right.

688
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,329
Yeah. Well, and ultimately, yes, strive to be better. Strive to do better.

689
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,660
Agreed.

690
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,510
-- There
-- we go.

691
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,689
And, and I guess I will commend Linus for striving to be better and I truly,

692
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,579
truly hope it sticks

693
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:50,780
well, not just for him but for everybody,

694
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:51,469
you know,

695
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:51,910
you can

696
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:52,270
inspire

697
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:52,479
some

698
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,469
-- people that
-- too. That's that's a good point.

699
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:59,810
Let's hope, let's hope many others take his example and, and they run with it. So

700
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,900
awesome, man. This has been,

701
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,520
well, probably a little different than most of our conversations,

702
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,969
but I do think it's a super important topic and I'm glad we talked about it

703
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,619
so.

704
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,459
Well, that's a big part of it. Right.

705
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:15,380
There's so many things that just used to not be talked about at all and still, I mean,

706
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,020
things like the words like neurotypical and neuro, you know, non neurotypical.

707
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,439
-- Those are new words for a lot of people. I know they were for me,
-- right?

708
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,459
They, they're new to me. I'm not going to pretend they aren't.

709
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,500
It's, it's not something I've dealt with in the past. So

710
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,209
thank you for educating me.

711
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,880
Thank you.

712
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,979
I will say thank you everyone for listening.

713
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,219

717
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,680
Isn't our version of progress? Thanks, Kurt.
