Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:12,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner and wondering about why things are the way they are.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,960
-- Josh Bresser.
-- I mean, I'm wondering what the heck

3
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:20,030
the topic really is today because Kurt sent me two seemingly unrelated links.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,670
And I'm like, I don't, I don't get it

5
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,079
-- so.
-- Well, they're related to my brain.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,479
-- So
-- obviously,

7
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,280
which is maybe not helpful.

8
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:32,040
So, here's a, here's an actual question for you. So, Linux District,

9
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,056
there's hundreds of thousands of them,

10
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:37,457
they take packages upstream software

11
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:40,907
and sometimes make quite significant modifications to them.

12
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:43,556
That's right. Why? Because they can.

13
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,716
Ok. So I, I'm gonna go on a rant here because I can.

14
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:49,236
So

15
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,617
-- that's the beauty of doing your own sound engineering. Yeah,
-- that's right.

16
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:55,826
I mean, there's a lot of reasons for this, right. When we were at Red Hat,

17
00:00:55,946 --> 00:01:01,754
you would have customer requests you would have making a certain change would

18
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,914
improve the way the

19
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:06,683
-- software work.
-- Let's ignore back porting. Sure.

20
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,414
Ok. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:08,713
But, but from,

22
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:11,124
let's assume that they're not doing this because they're back reporting.

23
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,484
Let's assume that they're keeping up to date.

24
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:16,594
-- Why would they modify up to date software?
-- Right? I wanna pick on Debian though.

25
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,073
Perfect Debian is where my soapbox exists in this space.

26
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,933
Because Debian, historically, the Debian packagers

27
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,024
have often

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,511
and

29
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,310
just use the settings they like

30
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:30,481
for the things they package.

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,971
And my single biggest complaint about this is Vim, Vim and Debbie.

32
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,380
And by default like interprets mouse clicks

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,121
is like clicks on the screen for something

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,901
instead of the usual like I'm just going to highlight text and copy it.

35
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,740
So clicking on a terminal window

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,291
with the Vim in de

37
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,060
and by default isn't like you can't just copy

38
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,430
and paste text because it's doing like Vim crap.

39
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:50,750
And it,

40
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,511
it,

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,819
it grates at my mind every time and it's like, why is it like this?

42
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,680
And basically if you read a bunch of issues and stuff,

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,529
it just comes down to the developers like I like this feature and it's like, no,

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,050
that is

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,900
well and because they're well, when you say the developer, you mean the packager?

46
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,269
-- Yeah,
-- the pr,

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,919
right? Well, in Debian's world, they call their packager, Debian developers.

48
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,970
I just for the purposes of this podcast.

49
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,759
Let's put developers as upstream and packager as the Linux distro.

50
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,699
Sure, why not, right?

51
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,309
-- Because I think that will make it a bit clear
-- anyway, that's all I'm done now.

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,809
So and a perfect example is I ran into this with Pie Curl where I'm using pie curl,

53
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,880
you know, so I can use Python

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,050
to grab a bunch of stuff and I get certificate errors.

55
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,800
And I'm like, huh.

56
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,899
And the problem is pie curl is built on.

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,600
I want to say something like alpine Linux or whatever.

58
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,949
And it's basically, it's expecting the,

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,449
the intermediate certificate packages and the root certificate packages

60
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,520
in a different space in slash UTC than where it is on a lot of other distro.

61
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,830
And so I actually left a trail of breadcrumbs for future

62
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,679
people. But basically I curl has a built in like search this path.

63
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,679
It's like seven or eight common locations for the certificates.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,789
And I basically rele

65
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,190
that in Python in like 10 lines of code. The problem is like you said,

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,199
the packager of the Python,

67
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,229
I want to say the wheel, is that what it's called?

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,350
A wheel is a type of package.

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,490
-- I think
-- it's the wheelchair

70
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,350
anyways.

71
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,100
Does it on alpine Linux. So that's how it works.

72
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,880
And if you want it to be otherwise you'd have to,

73
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,279
well, you'd have to

74
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,660
do it yourself. But the problem is then you,

75
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,759
but you wouldn't have own the name space,

76
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,820
right? So if you do an import pie curl, you'd still get there.

77
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,720
-- And that's just how it is.
-- And this is the same sort of problem.

78
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,880
-- I think we talked about this a couple of weeks ago where the curl on apple,
-- yes,

79
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,240
is not curl.

80
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,759
No, the curl on windows is not.

81
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,610
There's curl on windows, which is totally not curl and there's curl on Apple,

82
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,559
which is different defaults.

83
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,199
That's right.

84
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,929
And the Apple packagers have basically told the

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,119
curl upstream like we like it this way

86
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,910
as much as sometimes we don't like this.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,809
I think there are enough legitimate reasons for this

88
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,570
for it to be a relatively common practice. Now, here's my second question.

89
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,929
Then that leads off this.

90
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:02,039
Why can't we get upstream to, to do some of these things or fix some of these things or

91
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,410
essentially why can't we get upstream

92
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,289
to do stuff so that we don't have to do all this kind of hacking around.

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,669
So I think there's a lot of history in that answer because just historically,

94
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,889
this is the way you did it,

95
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,339
right? You, you, if I was a Debian developer,

96
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,809
I would often be involved with the upstream project. That's not uncommon at all.

97
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,690
I mean, that's true of a lot of the packagers.

98
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,260
Well, they're the ones submitting the good buck reports, right.

99
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,690
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,829
And sometimes you could ask an upstream say like, hey,

101
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,690
I think the new default in the config file should be this and they might say, no,

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,575
we don't think so or they might just never go upstream because they

103
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:43,864
don't think it's important enough to ask or it could be a situation where

104
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:47,225
depending upon the libraries you're building against

105
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:51,325
drastically changes what's happening and upstream is just

106
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,545
going to support all of the possibilities.

107
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,214
You know, there's, there's like, I don't think there's a reason for that question.

108
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:01,174
Well, and that's, and that's actually kind of the answer I was looking for is

109
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:06,450
like any ecosystem problem. There is no one answer or solution or problem even.

110
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:06,760
It's,

111
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,190
it's thousands and thousands of

112
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,959
different problems and challenges. Often. There's more than one

113
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,299
and so, yeah. So there's this rich pastiche

114
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:17,399
of, it's just, it's all a giant mess.

115
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:21,070
Big wily wobbly mess pretty much because one thing I've seen

116
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,160
is I've seen a bunch of people speak out against,

117
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,839
uh, like on,

118
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,660
on hacker news saying basically packagers should not

119
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,779
modify software and it's kind of like you,

120
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:33,225
-- it's not going to work. They,
-- they, by definition are like

121
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:38,605
the, the, the whole process of building and packaging software is modification.

122
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:39,954
Well, and a stupid question.

123
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,105
But could you even remotely get a system

124
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:46,385
working by packaging upstream software without any modifications?

125
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,454
-- Yeah,
-- probably.

126
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:48,255
I bet you could.

127
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:48,505
Yeah.

128
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:51,135
Well, I mean, I imagine theoretically it's possible,

129
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,855
but is it practically possible?

130
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:53,575
No,

131
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,855
no, it's not.

132
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,290
I think

133
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,220
when you're talking about a system like a Debian

134
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,250
or a Fedora or ubuntu or these larger distributions,

135
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,209
you need to carry around weird build patches and you've got

136
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,220
to fit into their ecosystem in whatever strange way it is.

137
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,209
I mean, if you look at some of the more minimalist things,

138
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,880
sometimes they're a little more upstream adjacent, we'll say,

139
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,989
but I think generally speaking, once you start getting larger and larger

140
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:26,600
the potential needs and problems just get weirder and weirder and, and,

141
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,640
and sometimes, I mean, I remember too where, for example,

142
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:32,149
tu show up to an upstream and be like, hey,

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,690
you should take this patch and they'd be like, we don't like you.

144
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,470
So, no.

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,670
Yeah, there is politics at play too.

146
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,989
And I think that's something a lot of people forget is that open sources, people,

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,369
-- people do politics and relationships,
-- very opinionated people.

148
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,059
Yeah.

149
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,739
Just ask,

150
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,089
just ask any system in about system D I'm sure

151
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,299
they just really almost have no opinion at all.

152
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:54,200
So there is a,

153
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,250
uh, an ubuntu conference coming to town in, I think July or June.

154
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,579
I forget exactly when I should get as much Fedora swag as I can

155
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,700
just go hang out

156
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,619
just

157
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,540
because the thing I'm looking at is,

158
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,470
is similar to and so the way this ties in is so

159
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,869
we've seen a lot of work from home during COVID and obviously

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,859
you and I are biased because I've been working from full time

161
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,309
since 98 and you've been working from home since the early aughts,

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,790
right?

163
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,190
2004.

164
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,470
And again, the work from home thing is not just about, you know,

165
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,040
commercial real estate prices or managers control.

166
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,869
There's, there's many, many, many reasons,

167
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,320
uh, there's even the companies that have realized, hey,

168
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:34,040
we can use this to do a soft layoff like,

169
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:38,019
we can just basically get rid of a bunch of people by requiring this or you know,

170
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,500
them, we,

171
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:42,470
we can't legally make them more a funny hat to work to get them to quit. So

172
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,130
we'll just make them come into the office and

173
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,630
sit in a chair in a horrible environment.

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,910
And obviously,

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,609
what a lot of places are now discovering is

176
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,630
that their best and brightest talent have left.

177
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,230
Right,

178
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,109
because part of part of it would obviously be is

179
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,790
those are the people that have the most opportunity to,

180
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,269
well, to get a different job.

181
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,829
And the article

182
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,399
you, you sent me the article and I found a, you sent me a pay old one,

183
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,790
but I found a non pay old one from ours, Technica.

184
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,940
And the title is literally Apple spacex

185
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,380
Microsoft return to office mandates, drove senior talent away.

186
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,489
And I think what's really fascinating to me is

187
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,609
there's this double edged sword of by definition,

188
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,600
these people are working from home,

189
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,119
they want to continue to work from home and they'll probably

190
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,829
find some place that will let them work from home.

191
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,100
And like we see this with the CS A where if, if we

192
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,559
only hired local talent, well, for one thing,

193
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,019
I wouldn't work for them because I'm in a different country,

194
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,739
right? So I just, and saying that I just realized, I, I have no idea.

195
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,690
Nor have I even thought to ask where's

196
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,500
Acor based?

197
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,739
So our corporate headquarters is actually in Santa Barbara, California.

198
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,739
-- Is that like a mailing po box or an actual building?
-- No, no, we have an office,

199
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:45,270
we have a

200
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,010
building. Like,

201
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,580
I mean, it's

202
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,025
small now because like,

203
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,414
it was a bit larger at one point because they had a

204
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:53,265
-- lot more people working in the office
-- and then everybody went home,

205
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:53,835
that

206
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:54,494
COVID happened.

207
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,005
Even the people who live in Santa Barbara

208
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,224
generally don't come into the office anymore.

209
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:01,955
But it Santa Barbara is literally the worst place to go

210
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,265
to work in an office

211
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,070
because it's basically like Disneyland but real,

212
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:12,840
it's a super touristy city and every, it's, it smells like waffle cones, you know,

213
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,869
like that smell you get in an ice cream shop, like I'm completely serious,

214
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,780
-- like everywhere you
-- go

215
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,750
-- that like burnt, that burnt sugary smell.
-- Yeah. Right. Right.

216
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,659
And I'm working and no one else is. And it's like, this sucks.

217
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,710
Like I want to be in that shop across the street eating ice cream with those people.

218
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,390
Not in this conference room, watching

219
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:33,062
people across the street eating ice cream.

220
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:35,421
But it, it is a very nice place.

221
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,661
But yeah, that's where our,

222
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,632
-- our corporate headquarters is
-- because the thing I'm I'm

223
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:40,812
realizing is more and more the number one thing

224
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:43,932
historically that people have demanded for job satisfaction is

225
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:48,312
autonomy and looking at especially the high talent,

226
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,682
people, they have to have autonomy to do

227
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:52,361
what

228
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,642
they do right to do.

229
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,781
That weird stuff because, and I think, oh,

230
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,361
I was gonna send you another article but I couldn't find it,

231
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,044
like, essentially talking about, you know, like,

232
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:01,414
so what's the difference between, like, a local restaurant, you know,

233
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,213
with a chef who cares at a mcdonald's?

234
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,883
Right. They're, they're totally different products.

235
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:10,254
Like, they're both food but, you know, the one is a chef who goes to market and is like,

236
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:10,924
oh, they got mangoes?

237
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:13,193
Oh, they got fish. Hey, we're having mango fish burgers today.

238
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,364
Whereas the mcdonald's gets, you know,

239
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:17,133
a shipment of frozen foods and they make it exactly the same way

240
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,494
that everybody else does. And so the thing I'm coming to

241
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:24,323
wonder about is I think there's a space for the software that's

242
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:26,976
sort of mass produced and stamped out

243
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,505
and there's a space for this, you know,

244
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,065
very unique bespoke artisanal weird software.

245
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,205
But what I'm seeing is everybody seems to think it's

246
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,986
one or the other that they can't sort of coexist,

247
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,825
kind of like mcdonald's and a nice restaurant can't coexist.

248
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,445
-- And yet while they somehow do,
-- I,

249
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:45,065
I don't think your comparison makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways.

250
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:45,325
So I,

251
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:46,945
I'm going to put a link in the show notes

252
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:50,685
to there's a talk which it's one of those animated

253
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:51,306
Deos

254
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,398
where he talks about like, why do people do what they do?

255
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:57,997
And he focuses, there's a lot of open source in it and basically saying like,

256
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,598
why are all these incredibly smart, incredibly well paid, talented people, like,

257
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,038
basically building software for free on the side.

258
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,237
And I think the autonomy is a part of that,

259
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:08,937
that story, right? Where

260
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,447
I want to do what I want to do the way I want to do it.

261
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,947
And so doing, you know, hobbies are this story where if there's a hobby someone has,

262
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,278
where they want to make a thing,

263
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,239
they're gonna do it their way. Right.

264
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,109
And of course, my favorite is if you know,

265
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:28,039
anyone will say deep into a hobby and if you get two people together that are,

266
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,750
will say of similar skill levels,

267
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,719
it's amusing to listen to them how their way is better

268
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,440
and the other person is doing something wrong when the reality is, like,

269
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,164
it really doesn't make it difference at the end of the day.

270
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:43,244
But whatever, it, it's highly opinionated people.

271
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:47,375
But I, I think this is that, that story, like, like the whole work from home,

272
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:50,664
work from home, whatever it's people crave autonomy.

273
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:51,344
And,

274
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,895
I mean, part of, of capitalism

275
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:58,385
is making people do what they need to do. Right. It's, it's,

276
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:02,780
there are things a company must do to survive.

277
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,270
And I think there's often this, this specter for management of, like,

278
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,179
I have to be able to see you do the thing I need you to do.

279
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,260
Yeah. Well, and I mean, it, it also ties into the whole, like, for example,

280
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,250
you and I both remember a time where there were like seven Linux distributions.

281
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:18,429
Uh,

282
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,020
yeah,

283
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,570
they came on floppy disks.

284
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,039
-- I
-- was
-- gonna say they came on physical media and you bought them in a store.

285
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,190
Like there was, well, I mean, eventually there was like,

286
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,119
things like the Walnut Creek software archive,

287
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:33,469
I think.

288
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,330
And I, you know, like, I'm reminded of beer here in Canada.

289
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,650
We basically used to have three beer companies.

290
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,890
And now we have this rich, like locally,

291
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:43,059
I

292
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:46,369
-- don't even know how many beer brewing companies we have locally. It's a
-- lot. Yeah.

293
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,940
Anywhere you go now. So I have a funny story about that. So

294
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,369
when we worked at Red Hat, long ago,

295
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,280
we

296
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,929
hired a lot of people in the Czech Republic

297
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,224
and the Czech Republic is, well, you know,

298
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:02,575
that whole region of Europe is well known for enjoying and making very nice beer.

299
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:03,515
It's not a surprise.

300
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,075
So we have all these Czech Republic employees and I

301
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,844
go for dinner with some of them one day.

302
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:08,604
And

303
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,244
they basically said to me, they said,

304
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:14,445
why does everyone claim American beer is terrible?

305
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:18,155
And we were at some micro brew, you know, drinking, who knows what?

306
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,635
And I think we're in Boston at the time and this was,

307
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,669
I would say the start of the like micro brewery, just

308
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,590
everything that's happened.

309
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,869
So anyway, we're there and they say that and I'm thinking for a few minutes, like,

310
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,330
why would you ask me this question.

311
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,830
And then, yeah, I realized like when I was a kid,

312
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,609
your options for beer were Miller and Bud.

313
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:40,830
That was it.

314
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,510
And, but then,

315
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,590
you know, some 20 plus years later

316
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:48,880
now you've got like literally hundreds of beers you have, I mean,

317
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,080
I remember

318
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
that you would, there, there were bars that would make a big deal.

319
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,239
But like, oh, we have 200 beers on the menu and things like that, you know,

320
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,500
which was unthinkable 20 years before that.

321
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:57,900
Well, I mean,

322
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,020
I'm even lucky enough there's local hard liquor distillers that make a,

323
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,799
just amazingly wonderful and weird and strange things.

324
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,119
Yes, there's, I have a, a favorite distillery in Madison wis

325
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,788
that uses AAA grain called Sorghum,

326
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:14,348
which is a midwestern grassy grain thing.

327
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:14,768
Sorghum

328
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:15,668
wheat. It's a wheat.

329
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,098
Yeah, it's like a type of wheat.

330
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:19,627
Do they use like dwarf sorghum or just regular?

331
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,268
-- I
-- don't
-- know. They just say it's sorghum whiskey.

332
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:23,278
Really good.

333
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:28,478
I have no idea where they get it from. I don't ask. It's just good whiskey. I buy it.

334
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:31,067
I drink it, it, it, it reminds me of a good Scotch.

335
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,168
Honestly, it's very smooth but don't tell it.

336
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:36,995
Scotland. I said that anyway. Anyway. All right. All right. Autonomy.

337
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:40,056
-- Well,
-- and I think that's part of it is, I have a suspicion

338
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,616
that people that have real talent

339
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:46,835
must have autonomy because otherwise they can't express that talent.

340
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,585
They can't do it. It'd be like putting

341
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:49,955
Gordon Ramsay at a

342
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,346
-- mcdonald's.
-- That

343
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:54,245
would be epic. He wouldn't be allowed to be Gordon Ramsay.

344
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,935
-- I mean, but they don't want Gordon Ramsay either.
-- No.

345
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,895
Well, let's ignore that for a moment.

346
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:02,004
But I think this is what I'm increasingly beginning to,

347
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:08,184
to think is that for people to both create and develop this weird rich,

348
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,083
unique talent,

349
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,004
they have to be able to experiment, they have to be able to do different things,

350
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:12,364
right?

351
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:15,883
But then, and once they achieve it though, they can't do it without having it.

352
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:18,823
And if you constrain them or put them in a jail, basically

353
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:22,244
they'll, they'll be miserable and quit and go somewhere that they can do it.

354
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:25,104
And, and we see that like you said to the point of there's these brilliant people

355
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,132
who kind of have boring day jobs and then by night they're, you know,

356
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,512
this amazing open source developer who develops a piece

357
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,591
of software that essentially the world runs on.

358
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,151
I, I want to tie this into

359
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,341
the world of application security

360
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:42,231
because I've had a conversation recently that I

361
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,711
think is very related to some of this.

362
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,731
When you talk to a lot of appet

363
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:47,502
people,

364
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:50,932
they want to tell developers what, how they should be doing their job,

365
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,520
right? I

366
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,919
mean, this is just you laugh, but

367
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,369
they're saying, you know, you, you have to use open source in this way,

368
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,099
you have to be coding in this way.

369
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:02,179
-- You have to do your reviews in this way. You have to
-- pin your dependencies.

370
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,859
No, you have to unpin them. You have to use the latest

371
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,940
or both. I don't even know what the popular opinion is right now.

372
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,590
Like Schrodinger's dependencies.

373
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,859
-- That's actually,
-- you know what Ashley until you look,

374
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,380
you don't know what's going on.

375
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,969
Right.

376
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,419
When you do look, you wish you didn't.

377
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,679
-- There's just a box with an angry cat.
-- That's the thing. It doesn't matter.

378
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:22,159
It doesn't matter which way it is.

379
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,609
Like if they're pinned, it's bad and if they're unpinned, it's also bad. There's

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,260
anyway.

381
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,349
Oh man. But, but

382
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:32,320
ok,

383
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,000
so on that note as well, I I'm also going to throw a link in the show, not Camy Katy.

384
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,080
He's a good friend and, and he, he works with um the Air Force on platform one.

385
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,799
He sent me a link to a prosal

386
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,880
article

387
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:46,719
where they were talking about their replacement to pseudo,

388
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:50,760
which is appropriate given we talked about it, I think last week where they, the,

389
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,229
the rust rewrite in pseudo is doing their

390
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,640
very best to not use dependencies because they,

391
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:57,643
it sees as a potential security threat.

392
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,283
And it's like in that particular aspect, it's very interesting.

393
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,713
Well, and it's also something they don't control.

394
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,203
Again. This kind of goes back to being weird and unique and interesting is that

395
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,473
putting artificial constraints on a problem

396
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:14,083
-- can result in more interesting solutions. It
-- can sure for sure, for sure.

397
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,252
OK, I want to go back to my story. Right. So we're talking to abs

398
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,521
people telling developers what to do and, and all of this

399
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:25,025
stuff and it is an interesting dilemma I think because

400
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:30,295
on one side you can't tell people exactly what to do because obviously, first of all,

401
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,885
they don't want to be told what to do,

402
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:32,805
you know, and,

403
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:37,805
and I don't think people generally accept telling them how to do something.

404
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:40,084
-- But now in the I
-- I would disagree because a lot of

405
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:44,114
people work at jobs where they have to do things specifically.

406
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:47,084
I mean,

407
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,300
and, and look, sometimes that happens.

408
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,219
I, I get it like my father worked in a paper mill for his whole life.

409
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:56,890
He literally had no autonomy like you make paper, right?

410
00:17:56,949 --> 00:18:00,160
Make sure the paper comes off the machine and make sure it works correctly.

411
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,520
Like yes, there are these problems to solve along the way, but generally speaking,

412
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,939
you did what you were told right now on the other side,

413
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,140
there's also something to be said about.

414
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,479
You can't just let developers like wander around

415
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,920
and do whatever crazy thing they want,

416
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,099
right?

417
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:18,680
There has to be some degree of like consistent understanding

418
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,349
and working together in Cooper

419
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,619
-- and also not doing like crazy, stupid, dangerous things
-- can I suggest?

420
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,839
So one thing there

421
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,890
is that if you have a culture where people

422
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,540
understand what the goals and the rules of engagement are

423
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,949
you don't have to necessarily,

424
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,989
that have all these rules and sort of day to day minutiae

425
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,390
for sure, for sure. Right.

426
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,609
But, and, but having said that that is very rare, like, I'm like,

427
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,270
like not to suit my own home, but, like, working for the cloud security,

428
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,880
that is the biggest thing that Jim puts forth is having a

429
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,839
healthy team culture because if we have that then everything else will be fine.

430
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:56,390
There are millions of management books that have

431
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,640
been written about this very topic and yet somehow

432
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,939
we tend to screw it up.

433
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,520
Well, you know,

434
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,880
it always reminds me of uh there are many things where we know the good ways to do them,

435
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,630
but people just don't.

436
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:10,949
Right, because they want to find some local maximum of, for example,

437
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,150
I'm a manager and I want to see people in seats and I want to see

438
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,760
what they're doing and I want to be able to micromanage and talk to them,

439
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,589
which means no work from home.

440
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,699
And, and I saw a funny comic.

441
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,530
I doubt I could find it again to put it in the show notes or anything.

442
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,189
But it was uh like a fishing test where it

443
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:27,680
showed a person sitting at the desk and they're like,

444
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,209
oh, II, I think this is a phishing email.

445
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:34,500
You know, I wonder what happens if I click this link in the, in the next frame.

446
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,069
It's like

447
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,239
I don't care about this company. So I'm gonna click the link and see.

448
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:40,140
It's like, oh, that one

449
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,359
that cuts a little deep sometimes. Like, it's true though. Right.

450
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:43,959
Like you,

451
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:45,859
you will have if you're a security person

452
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:48,160
and you're managing a large number of people,

453
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,204
there are a lot of people that it's an externalized cost to them functionally.

454
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,334
So they don't, they don't care

455
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:54,775
-- or
-- they hate working there.

456
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,925
Well, sure. Right. Either way.

457
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:01,135
But I'm just looking at this and I'm, I'm kind of wondering because part of it is,

458
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:05,295
is I definitely prefer sort of that small, weird local unique store.

459
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,454
But at the same time,

460
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,805
there are people that just want to eat at Subway,

461
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,339
which I find tragic because their food is expensive

462
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,479
and not good compared to other sandwich shops.

463
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:14,579
But for whatever reason,

464
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,819
especially if you go to a small town Alberta,

465
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,640
that's what your options are at like, you know, four in the afternoon to get food.

466
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,380
Well, no, the reason is because Subway has the lowest franchise start up cost

467
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,520
of any restaurant.

468
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,760
It's like 100 grand. It's super cheap.

469
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:28,339
Ok.

470
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,969
But here's, here's what I think I find interesting about this whole conversation.

471
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,939
When we look at something like open source,

472
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:40,849
I feel like all of open source in its own way is like this weird bespoke universe,

473
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,569
right?

474
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,569
And I mean, this is one of the challenges when you hear people talk about security,

475
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:45,045
open

476
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:47,484
source and creating like the open SSF scorecard and all this,

477
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:51,694
like every open source project is functionally its own special snowflake.

478
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:53,194
I do love that. We talk about open

479
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,474
source the same way we use the word humanity.

480
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:57,535
Yeah. Yeah. You know, like

481
00:20:58,005 --> 00:20:59,155
there's 8 billion of us.

482
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,645
I'm pretty sure there's not a single pair

483
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:03,435
of people on the planet that would agree about

484
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,275
more than 80% of what they think.

485
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:08,155
-- Yeah,
-- for sure. Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

486
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,569
And so anyway, it, it amuses me though, that we take this bespoke thing,

487
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,270
this one off snowflake that are,

488
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,170
every single one of them is different in its own weird way.

489
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,739
And then we're assembling them

490
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,250
in these, like giant corporate environments

491
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,449
into, you know, bland, boring corporate things. And it's,

492
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,849
it's kind of funny.

493
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,650
-- Well, solutions, people want solutions. Right.
-- Right.

494
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:35,250
Right.

495
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,199
And, and it's very reusable. Right. There's a reason

496
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,180
that

497
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,670
most of our automobiles look and act the same way because like,

498
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,250
you need some level of consistency in that space.

499
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,270
-- Right.
-- There's also survivor bias in the sense of uh cars are a great example.

500
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,170
Two wheels is a motorcycle and tips over very easily.

501
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,459
And you can't put four, you can't put a family in there with their dog,

502
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,150
three wheels again.

503
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,189
Very tippy.

504
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,790
Yeah,

505
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,229
four wheels. Very, not tippy, very easy to engineer, very easy to make steering

506
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,130
and it's just, you know, like

507
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,650
same thing in the animal kingdom. We see parallel evolution of

508
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,760
like these animals over here and these animals over

509
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,410
there arrive at the same solution of like sharp teeth

510
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,189
that

511
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,579
just work.

512
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:17,310
That's

513
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:17,579
right.

514
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,250
And I,

515
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,020
I can hope but also wonder if part of what really

516
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,260
makes a mess of the open source world is the,

517
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,199
there's so much survivor bias,

518
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,229
which we don't admit because there's how many people have tried to write open source

519
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:34,349
and do a project to have it fail compared to the ones that succeeded.

520
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,380
-- I mean,
-- OK. No, no, I think this is what makes it special. There's

521
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,050
in many ways you could look at something like curl

522
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,219
or the Linux kernel and no one would say those are unsuccessful projects, right?

523
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:46,500
Because they're widely used.

524
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,459
But I have countless projects I work on

525
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,099
that are basically my thing and I consider them a success

526
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,400
because they do exactly what I need them to do.

527
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,959
They aren't used by any. In fact, most of them couldn't even be run by anyone.

528
00:22:58,969 --> 00:22:59,619
But me, I would,

529
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,459
the thing I use to

530
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:01,810
like,

531
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:05,530
download the ecosystems data and then make all those wacky open source graphs.

532
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,030
I make,

533
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,560
I would be shocked if anyone else could get any of

534
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:12,449
that stuff to run at all just because it is poorly documented

535
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:16,069
and it is highly dependent on the computer in my basement

536
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,079
-- running in a very certain way.
-- What you're saying is you should containerize.

537
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:20,175
I

538
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:22,584
mean, I did at one point but I got lazy because I'm like,

539
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:24,255
I'm the only person using this, I don't care.

540
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:25,295
But anyway. Right?

541
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,895
And so I, I think this is one of the other unique aspects of this is like,

542
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,415
how do we define success?

543
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:33,734
And in the open source world, there is no definition of success.

544
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:36,864
Success is what I wanted to be as an open source developer.

545
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:39,324
I would argue there's no such thing as failure

546
00:23:39,574 --> 00:23:40,375
because

547
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:44,560
like what does that even mean? Right. If I stop working on something, is it a failure?

548
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,410
Maybe, maybe not, maybe I just got bored and went on to the next thing.

549
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,949
Maybe I don't need it anymore.

550
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,930
And maybe here's where we in the show. But

551
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,900
to put it bluntly,

552
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,930
some people's definition of success is other

553
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:56,119
people's definition of failure and vice versa.

554
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,589
-- I mean,
-- for sure, for sure. And, and OK,

555
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,550
so I want to tie this all the way back around to the beginning now because

556
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,890
you were talking about work from home and this top talent going to somewhere else.

557
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:07,880
And

558
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,650
I I there's

559
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,550
there is an angle to this that I think often doesn't get discussed

560
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,550
is

561
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,430
sometimes these big companies,

562
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,250
they don't want like a AAA creative

563
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,949
like lone wolf type, right? They want someone who works in the machine.

564
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,229
And, and I've got, I have a really good example of this, right?

565
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:31,670
So I remember when I worked at Elastic Elastic had an

566
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,640
amazing corporate culture and this was at the time of like,

567
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,869
everyone talked about like 10 X engineers and you had to hire rock stars and you need,

568
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,869
and it was like,

569
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,150
the environments were incredibly toxic.

570
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,500
I mean, I remember we had people, like,

571
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,456
we worked with that Red Hat that were just like,

572
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:50,536
they probably had a negative draw on the company because like, yes,

573
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:53,196
they were amazing programmers, but they were just like a

574
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:58,056
nonfunctional human beings on so many levels. right? And when I went to Elastic,

575
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:02,046
they were all about like we like you're not here, like you're not a rock star,

576
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:03,245
you're not here to be a rock star,

577
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:07,056
you're here to be a decent person and you're gonna work with everyone else.

578
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,215
And so by,

579
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:13,066
by encouraging basically everyone to work at a functional level to cooper,

580
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:17,442
we got way more done than you would have seen.

581
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:21,251
If you had like one crazy good programmer, we'll say the 10 X, you know,

582
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,572
a hole and then a bunch of people just trying to

583
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,432
mop up whatever garbage they dumped on top of them.

584
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,881
And, and so it's,

585
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,682
there's some weird angles to this and there isn't one easy explanation.

586
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:32,682
I know

587
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,281
in many instances these big companies are looking to cut

588
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,982
costs and so that's what their actual desire is.

589
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,761
But at the same time, there is something to be said about sometimes having

590
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,630
a small functional,

591
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,930
less experienced team is better than having a

592
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,069
couple of really good people on that team.

593
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,660
Well, and I think, you know, history shows us that even the quote unquote,

594
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,949
lone geniuses,

595
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,250
they had people behind them, they had assistants.

596
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,270
I mean, that was,

597
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,550
was it Isaac Newton said that right where I,

598
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,189
the only reason I can see so far is I

599
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,140
stood on the shoulders of Giants or something like that.

600
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,989
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And,

601
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,030
and I'd say he did all right.

602
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,829
Anyway, I don't know, man, it's been,

603
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,589
it's been a pretty wild couple of years since

604
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,949
the pandemic and work from home and just everything.

605
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:15,819
I

606
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,680
have a suspicion it's here to stay because so many people

607
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,010
I've seen realize that they can just get their laundry done,

608
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,040
you know, minor chores,

609
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:23,829
especially,

610
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:24,910
well,

611
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,520
especially anybody that has Children or other adults or other people

612
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,140
in their life that they have to help take care of.

613
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,829
-- I mean,
-- but now, now I also want to, I want to close it out on,

614
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,099
on kind of a parting thought here is,

615
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,469
it's very easy for us to say work from home

616
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,074
is the best and everyone should work from home.

617
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:38,484
But, like,

618
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:43,364
I'm really glad the doctor I go see at the hospital isn't working from home.

619
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,364
Right. Like,

620
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:48,885
-- that's good. My dentist probably can't work from home.
-- It's funny you say that.

621
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:53,244
But like, that's a, it's quite common in Germany, for example, for them to, you know,

622
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:57,204
for actually a friend of a friend, his family owned a building

623
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,295
and the basement, like or not the basement, sorry,

624
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:02,125
the ground floor was their shop and then the two floors

625
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:04,885
above it were where the family lived and the grandparents lived.

626
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:05,444
Ok.

627
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,920
So their,

628
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,959
-- their business was their home. And
-- that does happen for lots of people. That's true.

629
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:15,359
-- That is very true.
-- But yeah, there are obviously people like firemen or fire people.

630
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,380
What, what do we call them now? Firefighters, firefighters, there you go.

631
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,689
And like posties to use a gender neutral term for male carriers. Oh, posties.

632
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,560
That's good. Yeah, we call them posties here in Canada.

633
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,599
I still call them the mailman even though my male person is not a man.

634
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,500
-- So,
-- you know, I get that not everybody can work from home,

635
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,479
but I feel like a lot more people can work from home

636
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,770
than currently do.

637
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,319
I also feel like a lot of managers could be

638
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,839
a lot better because, well, I mean, I mean,

639
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:43,839
that's always been a problem.

640
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,890
I've had some bad managers so obviously they could be better for sure.

641
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,040
And, and I think the other amusing angle to this is you often hear

642
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,439
arguments about, oh,

643
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:55,500
you have less creativity and you get less done and all this

644
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,920
and like open source is running the world and I would say

645
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,000
probably 99.9% of open source is functionally developed remotely.

646
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,280
-- Like,
-- well, it has to, when you, I, I,

647
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,680
I'm pretty sure Daniel can't afford a building to hold 1200 co developers

648
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,729
seeing that his budget for it would be like whatever's in his pockets.

649
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:20,010
And here's the thing where are the Kel developers located? No idea.

650
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,540
Don't even care a little bit.

651
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:22,449
Like

652
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:24,130
actually, now that I think about it,

653
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,760
how big of a building would you need to hold

654
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,930
-- the Lenox kernel developers a
-- very large building and,

655
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:29,290
and

656
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,239
you would need probably medical staff on site for all the stabbings they want to go.

657
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:37,439
Oh man.

658
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,459
Anyway.

659
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,339
OK. OK. So it amuses me.

660
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:45,619
The, the other link you sent me that you didn't even bring up then was the

661
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:46,939
the Debian

662
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:48,819
uh open SSL bug?

663
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,660
-- Oh Well,
-- that was just an example of autonomy going a bit sideways but like it's,

664
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:56,449
but at the same time, well, just again, you know, they, they uh

665
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:00,300
law of unintended consequences, you know, I fixed a bug. And

666
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,489
um one thing, one thing that always gets me is there,

667
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:07,385
there's a lot of behavior that doesn't show up until you do it at volume.

668
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:08,145
Like,

669
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,704
like I was just telling you before the show. So I've discovered I,

670
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,334
I'm doing a lot of work with A I and I put Jason in and I

671
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,625
get Jason out because it's kind of the

672
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,814
easiest way to then programmatically deal with it.

673
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,114
And it's also a good way to structure the data.

674
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,285
Jason for structuring data who could have guessed

675
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,939
and I have a consistent prompt, for example,

676
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:28,910
that I used to uh evaluate a bunch of exam questions over 1000 of them and it puts out

677
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,660
JSON 100% reliably. Well, no, literally 0.1% of the time.

678
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,069
So for about it was like just around 10 entries out of over 1000 it would put

679
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,609
a single smart quote instead of a regular quote at the end of a string in this giant

680
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:42,589
JSON file, which of course, then would like cause all sorts of Puca

681
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,229
and confusion to Python.

682
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:45,719
And

683
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:51,449
there's a lot of this where until you let people do kind of weird things and do it a lot.

684
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:53,489
The, the, the bugs and the edge

685
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:58,010
cases don't show up. And I think that's part of the other reason that these distro

686
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,479
well, to put it bluntly, most people don't use open source directly.

687
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,439
They consume it through something else like

688
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,180
through,

689
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:05,739
through it, well, through a,

690
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,510
through a distribution or,

691
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,030
you know, through a web

692
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:12,910
thing, intermediary or whatever, right? They're building a package

693
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,410
and maybe that's part of the secret is that most of

694
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,060
us couldn't even use Openness cell directly if we wanted to.

695
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,390
And most of us don't want to.

696
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,430
-- The
-- API is terrible.

697
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,859
Yeah.

698
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,729
You know, we just

699
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,550
like to, well, it was in the curl.

700
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,420
Uh he sent out that link to that survey and one of the things was how to use curl.

701
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:31,150
Like do you use it kind of directly? Do you build it directly and,

702
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,390
and I literally read the question like, oh man, I hope nobody really does that,

703
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
you know, I hope they use a nicely packaged.

704
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,089
Most people probably do,

705
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,859
you know,

706
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,859
rather than reinventing the wheel poorly themselves.

707
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,010
And maybe that's part of what this is all about is

708
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,199
getting people

709
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,479
to be ok with,

710
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,359
you know,

711
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,260
it's not consumed directly.

712
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,560
That's, we have to put a b we have these intermediaries, we have these sort of,

713
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:00,390
I don't know what to call them market makers.

714
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,719
Like in a way,

715
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:04,359
it's almost a market maker because openness of cell on its own is kind of useless.

716
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,180
But openness cell is part of distribution

717
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,130
with curl

718
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,449
-- and W get and other tools is really useful.
-- All right.

719
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,400
So I'm going to end this conversation

720
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,510
because you're on to something really interesting,

721
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:14,939
I think.

722
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:15,339
And this,

723
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:17,979
this harkens back to some of the other conversations we've

724
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:21,560
had where there is an enormous amount of open source

725
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,239
that is like hidden away.

726
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,619
It's like the more locks of open source that it's these,

727
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,640
these utilities that let other things work.

728
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,560
But at the same time, it's often

729
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,839
they're misunderstood or missed

730
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,439
because I mean XZ was a perfect example, right?

731
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:38,520
Where like it's in the bowels of the system

732
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,300
and most people didn't give it two thoughts,

733
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,160
but the attacker sure did like they saw the opportunity.

734
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,030
So anyway. All right, I'm calling this one. Thank you, Kurt.
