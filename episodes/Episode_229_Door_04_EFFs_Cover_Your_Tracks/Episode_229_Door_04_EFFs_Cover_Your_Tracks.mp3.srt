00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,380
Was it today? Well, we don't know. No, it's, it's December 4th.

1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,789
We can't say it came out today.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,250
All right.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,130
-- Anyway,
-- hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,170
Seri and my partner thought crime draws brush shows.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,569
Why

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:13,699
do you do a proper

7
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:14,920
or not?

8
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,159
It doesn't matter. It's all staying in. I'm going to do like no editing on this.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,600
It's going to be a train wreck. It's lovely.

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,149
All right. Hiding from internet trackers door

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,889
-- before or are we hiding behind the door?
-- Yeah.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,100
So this is part of the efs pen Optum

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,170
thing. So I clicked test your browser.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,348
So the eff came up with a thing that essentially

15
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,200
there's like a ton of information your browser leaks that is specific to you.

16
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,470
And one of them that I loved was like, how much memory the system has.

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,409
And according to the eff cover your tracks,

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I have eight gigs of ra M and like rest assured people I

19
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,930
have much more than eight gigs of ra M in my desktop.

20
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,049
Do, do you?

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,650
I do, I have 30 yeah,

22
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,529
I have 32 gigs because right now I'm sitting at chrome sitting at like 15 gigs of ra M.

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,250
Is that how much free ra M you have? Because Chrome has used all the other ra M or

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,610
uh

25
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,509
jeez. Chrome 100 and 30 no, actually, no, it's not too bad.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,709
Chrome's only using 5.4 gigs of memory right now. Only

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,440
like I just don't care anymore. Like

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,089
all my systems are

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,629
at a minimum.

30
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,580
Internet tracking so well.

31
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,319
Well, not internet tracking. No, no fingerprinting.

32
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,519
It's the same thing.

33
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,760
Well, no, it's slightly different because tracking implies cookies and stuff.

34
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:27,199
And tracking is like, what's your screen resolution? What's your screen?

35
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,699
You know your color depth? How much memory do you have?

36
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,480
Which uh browser extensions do you have?

37
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:36,136
-- And the answer is between all of that, we know exactly who you are
-- right.

38
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:42,115
And, and so the point being that as you traverse the internet, you are leaving behind

39
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:47,206
digital fingerprints all over the place and there are companies

40
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:52,005
that are paid quite a lot of money for identifying the visitors to.

41
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:57,106
I mean, this is why when you do a search for like actually funny enough.

42
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:59,622
So, so my, my Children don't know this.

43
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,501
They're getting a VR headset for Christmas and I I

44
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:03,912
an Oculus Rift.

45
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,222
I set it up just to make sure it works.

46
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:12,231
And then now and, and I set this up on a Windows computer now on my phone,

47
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:16,022
I am getting Oculus ads all over the freaking place.

48
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:20,022
-- Oh, dude,
-- I did some searches, like, at various times I was like, researching,

49
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,272
you know, buying X for my house or whatever.

50
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:28,850
-- And then, yeah, blam just tons of ads for X.
-- They, they, that, this is how they do that.

51
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,029
And the best part is

52
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,300
I already bought X like, I'm, I'm never gonna buy X.

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,589
-- Sorry guys. Like, I can only buy so many, like, garage heaters.
-- I agree.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,990
That drives me nuts when I buy something. And then

55
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,669
Amazon's like, oh,

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,710
I see you like refrigerators.

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,925
Here's my favorite Google has that thing where you can click the X in the end.

58
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,945
It's like this ad is inappropriate. This ad is spam.

59
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:54,425
This ad is deceitful or I'm not interested in this ad, but I, I wish there was like,

60
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:58,625
I already bought this. Don't advertise this to me because I already own one.

61
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:02,565
-- Yeah.
-- Well, that's like I, I have an Oculus now. I don't need another one.

62
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:03,945
Yes, you do.

63
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,550
I might, I'm gonna probably have fights.

64
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,520
But uh but yeah, looking through this,

65
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:11,669
we'll put a link in the show notes to cover your tracks.eff.org.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,240
But it's, it's fascinating.

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,220
Like there's browser plugins, there's like time zone offset.

68
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,220
I'm like, oh, you know what time zone offset. Yeah, that narrows you

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,009
down

70
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:20,149
a

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,589
bunch. There is loads of information we leave behind.

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,110
-- We don't even realize
-- screen size and color depths system fonts

73
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,410
like there's, there's a whole pile of stuff and part of it is

74
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,315
you can't really

75
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:37,524
-- obfuscate it or, you know, really hide it.
-- Well. No, you can though.

76
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:39,964
This is the whole point of the EF F's tool.

77
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,434
-- But
-- by blocking it,

78
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:45,054
that adds to your fingerprint because the number of people that block, for example,

79
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,324
their screen resolution in depth is very small.

80
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:50,274
One person on the, uh, the hacker news thread pointed out.

81
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:56,395
Macs are good for this because Macs hardware, like all Macbook airs 2013, whatever,

82
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,565
they're all the same hardware,

83
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:58,664
that's it.

84
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,490
So I don't know that the solution is to go buy an

85
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:03,770
Apple hardware.

86
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:04,410
But

87
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:08,800
-- OK,
-- no, here's, here's the solution and here is how we're going to take this one out.

88
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:12,800
The eff link we're going to put in the show notes is for cover your tracks.

89
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,488
It's called and the eff has real actionable things you can do

90
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,029
and step one is education.

91
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,369
Right. That's what they do.

92
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,970
That this happens. Right. Right.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,739
And that's obviously we're doing this and we're linking to the eff.

94
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,549
So go learn and then they have some, some actual things you can do

95
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,769
to make this problem better for yourself

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,450
and, and granted nothing is going to be 100%.

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,109
But

98
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,470
at the very least, I think awareness is the, the single biggest thing we can do.

99
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:39,709
You know,

100
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,220
I'm gonna say is the thing I've consistently seen is you

101
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,500
show people browsing the web without ads and they're like,

102
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,339
oh my God, that is so much better because

103
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,359
it is

104
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,739
so all I'm gonna, I'm gonna end this episode by saying

105
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,200
friends install ad blockers on friends computers.

106
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,339
And number two

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,739
-- give somebody to the eff they do good work.
-- Absolutely.

108
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,739
We will see you on December 5th.
