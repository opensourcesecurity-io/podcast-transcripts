0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,430
December 15th. We made it, we're almost there 10 days to go.

1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,000
I was,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,889
yeah, I was about to say halfway but I, yeah, the same

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,069
on the 25th, not the end of the month. Math is hard. Well done.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,270
My experience of time this year has been very, very

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:12,920
non

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,270
standard. I hear you man.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,479
I

8
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:14,680
hear

9
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,979
you.

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,139
So this is annex A 0.15 0.1 of is

11
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:18,360
0

12
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,709
2007 001.

13
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:20,319
So iso

14
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,670
2007 001 is basically, it's a security standard. That's all you need to know.

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,940
It's like the security standard pretty much. Yeah. And annex A

16
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,165
15.1 is supplier relationships and I like that the security standards

17
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:36,115
are getting better about acknowledging how the world actually works,

18
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:36,314
right?

19
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:40,095
Because let's face it. There's a lot of security standards from the nineties and the

20
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:41,854
what do we call that decade? The odds,

21
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,755
the two thousands. I don't know

22
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,534
the, the decade between

23
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,490
and I'm gonna say this and I'm,

24
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm just 2000 to 2009 and I know that's not how decades work, but shut up everybody.

25
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,069
It's fine.

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,029
Just

27
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:55,419
number beginning with

28
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:56,080
care.

29
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,700
Nobody cares.

30
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,009
And it's interesting how many of these standards were a combination

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,340
I think of here's how we want things to be,

32
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:04,559
which I'm ok with that.

33
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,209
Right. I'm ok with security standards that,

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,279
you know, say basically like stuff's on fire, here's where we want to go.

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,319
But they had that combined with then

36
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,250
ignoring how the world actually is in the sense of OK,

37
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,980
but how are we going to get from point A to point B?

38
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,319
Right? And so they would just set objectives that were not

39
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,750
achievable. You know, it's like me saying, I'm going to get in shape this year.

40
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,110
I've seen this as a problem in organizations

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,089
where the security teams will show up with

42
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,690
an iso control and say you have to do this and the admins are like,

43
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:33,209
we have no idea what this means.

44
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,697
And the security people say you just read it and

45
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,858
they're like we did and it doesn't make sense like,

46
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:40,258
well read it again then and they're like, you don't know what it means either.

47
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:40,837
Do you?

48
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:41,428
-- Well,
-- and

49
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,468
I love, for example, when I start talking to people, I'm like,

50
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,328
you know, let's talk about the security of backups.

51
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:46,968
And I'm like, oh yeah, we have to have backups, blah, blah, blah.

52
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:50,038
And I'm like, well, yeah, you probably do. But how are you security the backups?

53
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:53,237
Right? Because if somebody grabs the backups, like they don't have to

54
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,517
attack your production system, if they can just grab the backups

55
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,438
if information disclosure is their thing.

56
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:02,157
And it's clear to me that quite a few of them have,

57
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,265
I haven't really thought this through.

58
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,096
So anyway, what's the topic we're talking about?

59
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,386
Well, I think basically it boils down to.

60
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,085
I like that these security standards

61
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,255
are acknowledging how the world actually works

62
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,156
and they're

63
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:16,195
willing to be a bit more compromising rather than,

64
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:21,016
-- you know, you must meet this perfection,
-- explain this particular annex

65
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,026
to the ISO standard.

66
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:28,666
So it talks about essentially your supplier, your technology supply chain,

67
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,016
monitoring them, review

68
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,714
them and managing changes to them.

69
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,973
And one thing I keep coming across that this doesn't really address,

70
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:39,113
but that is becoming more common is the simple fact that

71
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:43,194
people have suppliers who will not change or do anything.

72
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:47,173
So a great example of this is like Amazon or Microsoft Microsoft ships Windows,

73
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,294
they're not going to modify it for you, right?

74
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:53,494
Amazon has Amazon web services, they're not going to tweak it for you

75
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:57,893
full stop. And that's ok. Previous attempts at this would say things such,

76
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,162
oh, you need to talk to the supplier and bully them into being secure.

77
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:01,572
Well,

78
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,302
-- you can't bully Microsoft or Amazon and
-- anyone

79
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,151
you can bully you should be highly suspect of

80
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,102
because I mean,

81
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,302
so I've read more than one thing where these really

82
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:14,141
small start ups will just say yes to whatever you

83
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,162
ask and they know they're never going to do it

84
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,882
but they need the money so they don't care.

85
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:18,442
Well,

86
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:23,272
and that's the difference between being a software shop and being a consulting shop

87
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,582
and they are desperate to bring any money in.

88
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,809
They will do the consulting side of things and not hold the line sort of,

89
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,529
or they'll tell you they're doing it and they're not.

90
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:36,179
I mean, so this is, this reminds me, I mean, we talked to Alan Friedman about S

91
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:40,270
bomb, what it feels like seven years ago, but I think it might have been last year.

92
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:40,559
Yeah.

93
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,149
And I love S bomb.

94
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,955
But the thing I keep coming back to over and over and over again is

95
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:49,365
no one's going to do this unless you make them somehow.

96
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,604
And I think putting some of these questions

97
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:56,934
and ideas into a standard that organizations are following

98
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,014
is the first step.

99
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,574
Well, making them achievable

100
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,039
that too. Absolutely.

101
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,729
Because I see so much security advice that applies to

102
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,320
large fortune 100 companies because they have a security team,

103
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,770
but you just cannot do that.

104
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,429
Not just a security team.

105
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,200
Most of the banks on Wall Street have a security team bigger than most companies.

106
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,850
-- I mean,
-- a

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,850
classic example being how do you do separation

108
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,799
of duties when you have five employees?

109
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,790
You don't.

110
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:27,390
Yeah,

111
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,179
because you know what you're worried about,

112
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,339
you're worried about keeping the lights on.

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,970
Exactly.

114
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,600
That is one of the other hilarious things there.

115
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,299
So many of these standards where you,

116
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,329
I, I, I've been part of small organizations where someone shows up is like, oh,

117
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,890
you know, show me your

118
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:47,769
iso 27,001 report. We're like, we're like six people. We don't have one of those.

119
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,540
-- You
-- know,

120
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,079
you know, here's a question.

121
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,320
What is the smallest organization or company that has achieved sale?

122
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,459
Talk to certification.

123
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:54,829
I mean,

124
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,660
there must be somebody out there that just is a one

125
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,049
man company that did it on a because they had to,

126
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,190
for some contract.

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,459
I'm sure it's possible.

128
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,149
But anyway, we're out of time so we're not going to answer that.

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,220
But if you listener happen to know the answer, let us know.

130
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,750
We'd love to hear on to December 16th.
