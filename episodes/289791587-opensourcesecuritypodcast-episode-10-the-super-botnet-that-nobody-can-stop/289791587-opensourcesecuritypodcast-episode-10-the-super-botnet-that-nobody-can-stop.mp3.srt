Hello and welcome to the XTH episode of

1
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:10,199
the Open Source Security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:10,960
Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,949
and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,020
Kurt, why did you call it the XTH?

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,500
Which I don't even think is a word Roman numerals, Roman numerals,

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,340
which means for those of us who are Roman numeral, we'll say um hindered.

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,620
-- This is now the 10th episode of the Open Source Security podcast. That's crazy,
-- man.

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,740
10 episodes I, I remember we started, actually,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,259
I told myself that if we can make it to 10,

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,860
I'll feel like this is not a completely failed venture.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,419
And

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,279
yeah, we, we made it success, right?

13
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:42,369
All

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,840
downhill from here.

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,799
Which big news do we lead with

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:46,650
coin

17
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,259
flip

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,750
last week? With,

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,889
let's lead with, with Dirty Cow because I think that subject is

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,450
smaller and more reasonable

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,049
than the other minor event that took place last week.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,169
Yeah.

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,669
So dirty cow was a dirty copy on, right? Hence the acronym cow cow

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,800
in the Linux kernel

25
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,470
uh that had been there for,

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,849
what was it? Nine years,

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,589
I think nine

28
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,970
-- years,
-- more than nine.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,970
But, but a long time.

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,010
Yeah. And somebody finally noticed it

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,790
and we fixed it

32
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,120
and as far as I'm concerned, really, that's all there is to talk about.

33
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,849
Um, as far as I know,

34
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:32,860
I mean,

35
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:38,199
yeah, pretty much, I mean, this attack apparently had been used a bit and there's,

36
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,949
you know, the proof of concept code and all that, but

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,389
I was talking with some people last night and as I pointed out, um,

38
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,339
this is not the last one,

39
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,629
-- you know, this is not the last,
-- have you seen the graph from Case Cook?

40
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,959
That was quite beautiful. Actually, that was a really good data visual.

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,690
He's, he's, I don't know, I haven't seen the updated one yet,

42
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,650
but basically case has shown that

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,610
the average Linux

44
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:08,529
privilege escalation flaw has a lifespan of five years before we find it,

45
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,770
which means

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,750
there's

47
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,889
at least

48
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,970
one more

49
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,449
that we probably won't find for five years.

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,350
Well, and you know,

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,750
and this is what I was talking about last night

52
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,330
was I'm I'm more curious about what is the scale,

53
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:26,339
you know, is there 10 of these left 100 1000 a million?

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,860
Like,

55
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,449
you know, we, we have literally

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,110
no strong idea, you know, as far as I know nobody's ever done.

57
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,729
Like here's what I would love to see.

58
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,149
For example, if somebody pick a portion of the Linux kernel, say like

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,149
100,000 lines worth of code

60
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,889
and just audit it like crazy.

61
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,229
-- But,
-- but even then man, you could have the smartest person, you know,

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,669
audit it for a month

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,679
and a

64
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,729
Uber could show up the next day and find a bug they missed. So

65
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:57,720
let's do this. Hold on, hold on. I want to discuss what this issue is first because

66
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,210
in my dealings with the nonsecurity folks,

67
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:04,410
this is not a simple issue to understand.

68
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,919
And so let's start there and then we'll get

69
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:11,220
into the esoteric nature of finding flaws in software

70
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:14,970
that is incredibly difficult, if not impossible,

71
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,149
right? So first of all, it's called dirty cow.

72
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,350
What is cow?

73
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:20,589
Uh So

74
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,580
c stands for copy

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,880
and right, and this is one of those class of security flaws.

76
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:25,960
No, no, no, not security for

77
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,110
what is copy.

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,649
And right,

79
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,330
in a modern computing system,

80
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,809
there's a concept of using the same bits of data

81
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,729
in places that need to share it,

82
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,449
right?

83
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,860
And so

84
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,309
in memory, you have what's called a memory page, which is kind of the,

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,029
the

86
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,350
how do I even describe it? It, it, it, it's like,

87
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,789
I mean, this is one of the problems I'm, I'm always,

88
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,949
I always go back to that Feynman video where

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,770
he has to describe like what is magnetism and,

90
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:58,699
and he's like, I cannot explain it to you because I, I just can't keep backing up.

91
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,229
So anyway,

92
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,360
in a modern computing system, there's what called, it's a page of memory.

93
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,029
It's just like a logical way to split the

94
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,759
memory in two sections that the computer can use,

95
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,410
-- right, like
-- a literal page of paper with lines.

96
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,669
That's exactly fair. Right. Right.

97
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:19,399
And so what happens is if two things need to use, what is fundamentally the same page,

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,690
it will

99
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,299
basically hand them both a reference to the same page.

100
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,540
And then it tells itself the kernel tells itself

101
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,100
that this is a copy on write page,

102
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:33,510
which means if one of these things wants to write to it,

103
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,320
I want you to make a copy of it and then let them write to it.

104
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,160
OK?

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,970
And obviously, as you can imagine,

106
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,010
there could be certain security considerations with

107
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,160
this kind of set up where you have

108
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,820
to make sure the copy happens before you let the other thing do the writing

109
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,209
right

110
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,010
now.

111
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,950
What happens when you need to,

112
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,809
when when the kernel decides it's time to make the copy, it marks the page as dirty,

113
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,220
right? And that, that's literally what we call it.

114
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,570
That's not like some euphemism for something

115
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:07,029
for something terrible like it's literally called, it is now a dirty page.

116
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Dirty page means you make the copy and then neither page is dirty at that point.

117
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,529
And so this problem was basically an issue with the way you mark the page dirty

118
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,769
and then

119
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,089
you make the copy.

120
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,570
And then

121
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,339
basically before the copy is made,

122
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,130
you, there's a race condition in the kernel that lets you write to the original

123
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,290
dirty page.

124
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,130
And obviously, in the case of the exploits we've seen,

125
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,880
they're basically me mapping a file and disk that you

126
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,089
shouldn't be able to write to marking the page,

127
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,809
dirty, triggering the race condition and writing data into that file.

128
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,630
And of course,

129
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,450
the easiest example I've seen is just to edit Etsy password to make root do horrible,

130
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:47,230
scary things.

131
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,269
Yeah. No, this is

132
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,179
the whole concept of these uh duplicate memory pages. I understand why we did it.

133
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,410
Right. It's a heck of a performance bonus,

134
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,290
you know, especially on a server where you have say,

135
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,910
you know, 100 users all running http D right?

136
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,089
Because it's all basically identical and you have, you know, one

137
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,609
copy and memory doing, you know, running for 100 people,

138
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,459
which is a massive massive memory savings. But yeah, I mean, there's,

139
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,329
it introduces all these security considerations that's assuming it's not broken,

140
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,549
-- right? Like it was in this case, it's
-- not even just that

141
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:25,420
there's when you execute an application you do, it's called a fork

142
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:25,950
exec.

143
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,079
And the way this works is rather than

144
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,630
basically creating a whole new process,

145
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,750
filling all the memory with what you need to do

146
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,470
in making copies of everything.

147
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:38,049
It just essentially marks all of the memory pages,

148
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,320
copy and write and then starts the new process.

149
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:44,640
So you can imagine in that context that makes things very, very fast as well.

150
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,470
So there's, there's a million reasons to do this and it is it is accepted

151
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,630
that it's a great idea and it is, don't get me wrong. It's just, it, it's also,

152
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,470
it's difficult to do clever things correctly.

153
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:58,769
Yeah.

154
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,309
No. So, in this case, I mean, race conditions are,

155
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,140
in my opinion, one of the sort of the worst class of computer security flaws because

156
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,269
they are typically not super easy to find. You know, if you look at a buffer overflow,

157
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,630
you can see it in the code, right. But race conditions typically

158
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:21,130
you have to trigger them to figure out whether or not they actually trigger.

159
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,790
That's a good point.

160
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:25,459
Well, and so that you just brought up a really interesting aspect of this is

161
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,299
the reason we knew about this problem nine years ago and didn't fix it is

162
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,209
because the memory subsystem in the Linux kernel

163
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,489
wasn't as predictable as it is today.

164
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,200
So it was thought that this race condition cannot be triggered

165
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,170
so we can live with this bug for the moment.

166
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,890
Yeah. And then like all software bugs that are ignored,

167
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,380
it got ignored.

168
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,109
Well, and we fix the memory subsystem to make it predictable.

169
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,149
And all of a sudden a race condition, we didn't think we could trigger.

170
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,269
We can now trigger.

171
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,269
Yeah.

172
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,950
Yeah. This reminds me a lot of things like row hammer where, you know,

173
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,809
if you had told me five years ago that you could physically flip bits

174
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,260
in memory that you do not control. I would have been like, that's impossible.

175
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,589
It just can't be done,

176
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:13,459
you know, turns out it is possible, you know, all these attacks that like,

177
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,190
literally,

178
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,100
yeah, we, we thought were physically impossible or just like

179
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,279
the software does not do that. You, it just doesn't work that way. I'm sorry?

180
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,619
Well, yeah, I mean, so like

181
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,230
when I think about the Linux kernel nine years ago versus today, I mean,

182
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,559
it is like a totally different beast, you know,

183
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,640
the amount of improvements and changes,

184
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,299
you know, or like I remember back in the, you know,

185
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:39,890
the Linux 0.99 patch level to infinity days, you know, 20 years ago and it was,

186
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,549
you know, this is nothing like what it is today and,

187
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:46,409
and part of my concern there is, you know, yeah, what other bugs

188
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,320
have been ignored because they weren't really bugs

189
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,900
back then but have now grown into nice,

190
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,390
you know, healthy security flaws.

191
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,849
They're all grown up.

192
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,530
Yeah.

193
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,169
And, and, you know,

194
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,419
that's one of the reasons I would love to see a code audit of

195
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:01,809
a chunk of code is so we could at least maybe start to get,

196
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,169
you know,

197
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:05,030
say 100,000 lines of device drivers in the Linux kernel

198
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,700
versus 100,000 lines of sort of more co core code.

199
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,570
How many flaws are we talking here?

200
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,669
Like if we really spent some effort auditing it so we

201
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,849
can get a sense of the scale for the whole thing,

202
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:15,760
you know, ideally

203
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,809
I have a feeling it's climb under the desk and cry numbers if I had to guess.

204
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,630
Well, and more to the point here's the ugly truth. Right. We don't have the,

205
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,409
like, even if we had the money to pay people to do this,

206
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,520
we don't have enough people trained in the Linux kernel

207
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,580
core security fundamentals.

208
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,849
I mean, this stuff is horribly complicated.

209
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,020
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

210
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,119
Well, that, I mean, this is,

211
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,289
this is one of the arguments I always go back to

212
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,460
over and over again when I talk about this stuff is

213
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,500
the Linux kernel has some of the smartest developers in the

214
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,270
world working on it if they can't get it right?

215
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,030
What hope does an average developer have of getting it? Right?

216
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,900
And the answer is they don't have any.

217
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,619
Yeah. And at least the good news is with the Linux kernel.

218
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,469
That means, you know, people aren't reinventing the Linux kernel, right?

219
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:05,169
Nobody goes out and writes an operating system kernel nowadays pretty much.

220
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,049
I mean, it happens, it's rare,

221
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,530
you know,

222
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:13,330
the majority of these people just use a Linux kernel and a and a GNU user space,

223
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,809
right? And then just move on with their life.

224
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,530
Don't tell the BS D guys that.

225
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,799
Yeah.

226
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,109
Well, and you know, BS D two,

227
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,919
like I actually have a couple of BS D based devices here at home,

228
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,039
you know, and I quite like them.

229
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,169
Um part of it is I want a

230
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,580
somewhat diverse ecosystem, right? I actually have two firewalls.

231
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,200
One Linux, one bs D, you know,

232
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,799
the, the hope being that if there is some, like,

233
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,190
I don't know if you remember the ping of death back in the day,

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,729
you'd send a ping request with a, with an oversized uh request.

235
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,340
And then when the system tried to create this, like larger than 64 kilobyte packet,

236
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,159
it would just die

237
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:48,729
a

238
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,619
significant number of,

239
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:51,900
didn't it?

240
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,880
I remember because Linux got patched within a day or two. And so you logged into IRC,

241
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,880
you know,

242
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,520
and people would just enter the channel and then just ping flood the whole channel

243
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,440
and everybody on Windows would drop.

244
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,539
I do remember that and it took, it took Microsoft, I mean,

245
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,780
this is back before they kind of took security seriously as they do now,

246
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,659
but it took them a long time to fix it.

247
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,559
It was a couple of months.

248
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,359
It was embarrassingly long and I don't,

249
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,020
did they have automatic patching back then or did you have to do?

250
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,700
I think you might have had to download it

251
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,780
on your own

252
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,020
-- to install the patch. Why?
-- Honestly? Yeah, that was so long ago.

253
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,200
Well, this is Windows NT 4.0 days.

254
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,679
So I don't think it had like

255
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:31,799
software updates. Like

256
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,179
because

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,599
it was, I think I had Windows 95. I was, I was testing that

258
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:39,150
because I remember I would dual boot between Windows 95 and Linux

259
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,080
back in the day

260
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,340
and

261
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,169
man, dual boating. Thank goodness, that's not a thing.

262
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,859
Well, it probably is for a lot of people but I, I no longer do that.

263
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:48,729
Yeah.

264
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:49,669
Well, this,

265
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,869
I think this discussion of the Linux kernel and

266
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,390
user space and the way people use the software

267
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,059
leads nicely into the, uh, the second big event of last week

268
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,090
where I believe you need to apologize to us for something.

269
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,219
-- You said,
-- I'm not going to apologize.

270
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm gonna say when I thought, why would someone burn a botnet on Krebs?

271
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,960
I think what I should have said was holy crap. Wait for the next month

272
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,919
because it's clear the botnet wasn't burnt.

273
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,359
It's much bigger

274
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,640
and in fact, it's still there.

275
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,729
The, the, the huge deal

276
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:22,989
is

277
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:23,289
actually

278
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,960
worse. I was talking with some people and

279
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,109
the Marai Bonnet is not a single bonnet,

280
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:33,630
it's actually multiple bonnets and they've actually seen cases

281
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,349
of one of the Marai botnets attacking like de

282
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:42,070
dossing the command and control infrastructure of a different Marai Botnet

283
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,059
in an effort to essentially bring that part of the botnet down.

284
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:46,650
So, yeah,

285
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,500
it's gotten so bad now that there are actually

286
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,789
multiple botnets fighting each other and occasionally then,

287
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,849
you know, being pointed at

288
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,179
places

289
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,789
like

290
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,039
d

291
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:54,309
in essence.

292
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,539
So

293
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,229
here's the question, will the botnets

294
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,840
have mutual assured destruction of one another or one of them emerge

295
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,119
after this uh selection

296
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,679
of, of the fittest

297
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,000
and, and be the the super botnet that nobody can stop.

298
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,880
I suspect we won't have,

299
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,700
I, I suspect we'll have a lot of different bonnets forever because

300
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:17,869
the reality is

301
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,549
nobody's going to fix these things.

302
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:21,429
All right, before we get into that,

303
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,830
let's for those who don't know which there's probably a couple of people is, is,

304
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,260
let's explain exactly what happened. There's this thing called the Mariah Botnet.

305
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,049
And now a couple of shows ago we talked about Brian

306
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,380
Krebs site having a giant distributed denial of service attack happening

307
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,070
where IOT devices were primarily the sources of traffic.

308
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,750
After that happened,

309
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:45,440
Krebs,

310
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:51,429
not just primarily IOT devices, specifically digital video recorders,

311
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,130
primarily from one Chinese manufacturer.

312
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,729
OK. Right. Right.

313
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,289
And so Krebs, his site comes down,

314
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:04,049
he moves it over to Google who are graciously hosting it. Now, given

315
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,909
this is,

316
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,669
I mean, this is one of those things like who wants to host that. Right.

317
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,090
It's,

318
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,500
it's constantly under attack because this is someone who

319
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,929
points out the seedy underbelly of the internet.

320
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,090
And so obviously,

321
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,419
there are people with,

322
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:20,830
we'll say questionable morals who would love to

323
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,650
do nothing more than to take Krebs down.

324
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,099
So obviously hosting his site is significant risk now.

325
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,679
So Krebs site D OS comes back up, the guys who own the botnet

326
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:35,109
that did it, published the source code to the botnet on github,

327
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,250
which again, I mean github is like the center of the universe now,

328
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,940
which is kind of hilarious you know, good guys and bad guys, everyone likes it.

329
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,549
It's uh

330
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:43,669
so the

331
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:43,890
source

332
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,090
code distribution platform,

333
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:46,409
it really is.

334
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,789
So, so the source code is published

335
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,469
and now anybody can build their own

336
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,919
botnet, right? It'll be, it'll be great when you have like instead of meta,

337
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,969
you have like botnet

338
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:59,130
spit, right? You just click a couple of boxes and now you have a bot

339
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:02,729
-- those products already exist. You just have to pay for them, but they're
-- not free.

340
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,210
Right?

341
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,020
The equivalent of me,

342
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,640
it used to be very expensive.

343
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,770
So give it time.

344
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,179
So, anyway, now what happens is essentially there's all these new botnets

345
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,739
and one of them or we, we don't know how many really

346
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,250
starts attacking

347
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:28,650
the, the dying company, DYN and they do DNS for a large number of organizations

348
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,070
and so their DNS servers get attacked, which means

349
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,289
you can't resolve domain names,

350
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:37,210
which means essentially a significant portion of the

351
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:40,369
internet for certain people now appears to be gone

352
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,049
because DNS is kind of the,

353
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,330
it's like the,

354
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,169
the circulatory system of the phone book. Yeah, that's fair. Right. Well,

355
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,820
what's a phone book? Right. It's a,

356
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:53,510
it's a thing they set on my porch once a year that I throw away. Right.

357
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:54,849
I

358
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:58,140
find it useful for starting fires like at the cabin. Not,

359
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,409
you know, let me just qualify that statement.

360
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,750
Oh, my goodness.

361
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,150
Anyway,

362
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,599
so, so fundamentally

363
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,179
we know there's all these IOT devices

364
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,979
they have default user credentials.

365
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,530
They are

366
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,270
worse than that.

367
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,599
Uh A lot of these, for example,

368
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,119
the 11 of the ones primarily using this is from a company,

369
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,669
there's this Chinese company called and I'm going to butcher this name.

370
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,809
HSU like X

371
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,159
Mai, I think,

372
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:29,150
and they're, they don't actually sell the devices. They're essentially

373
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:34,119
like an upstream provider who builds the boards with, you know, all the hardware

374
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,010
and

375
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,239
preloaded Linux

376
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,559
like a preloaded Linux firmware that you can easily customize, you know,

377
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,760
with your branding, your name, your logo, whatever.

378
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,760
Uh And so they then sell these to Chinese manufacturers.

379
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,320
I think there's about 40 or 50 of them

380
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,039
who then like stick it physically in a box and put like a sticker on it and like,

381
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:51,859
you know,

382
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,159
use the developer kit to modify the firmware a little bit

383
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,950
to put their logo on it and their name on it

384
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,130
and then, you know, sell it

385
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:58,729
on ebay or

386
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
uh whatever.

387
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,919
And the problem is the there is a default telnet

388
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,839
account for root with password. Uh What is it? XC 3511 as the password

389
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,598
and it's hard coded into in it dot D slash R CS.

390
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,880
Like you, you cannot remove this account without

391
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:20,058
uh I guess you could patch the binary if you were clever enough.

392
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,218
But like, let's face it, right? People buying

393
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,509
cheap Chinese digital vi

394
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,729
uh digital video uh recording systems, you know,

395
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:31,899
for surveillance systems probably aren't the kind of people, you know,

396
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:34,379
into a binary patching,

397
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:40,019
-- right?
-- It will, if I recall correctly, the source code to Maria has

398
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,019
like 90 or 60

399
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,589
credentials that it essentially checks.

400
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:44,719
Yeah,

401
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,660
there's, there's a couple of lists and yeah, there's,

402
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,829
there's a lot of these devices with these,

403
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,560
these hard coded, you know, root level accounts.

404
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,560
So this the the logical place this discussion is going

405
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,510
to end up with us talking about is the fact that

406
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,859
so there's all these IOT devices

407
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,449
they are currently unable.

408
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:12,859
And so now you have a device that cannot be repaired, that is being used to cause harm

409
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,530
to another organization

410
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,459
who's responsible. Is it the owner of the device? Is it the manufacturer?

411
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:23,819
Is it the ISP hosting the device?

412
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,689
It is,

413
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,670
this is not obvious and like we don't have laws to define this,

414
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,020
but also most importantly is the fact that

415
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,229
without economic incentives, nobody cares,

416
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,109
right? If something isn't gonna cost me time or money,

417
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:41,930
I don't care about

418
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:42,119
it.

419
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,020
Well, and one thing to remember too is it's not just the end devices, you know,

420
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,089
generating the traffic that are part of the problem.

421
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,020
There's a lot of uh so in the case of a of this distributed attack against D DNS,

422
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,869
um they attacked DN DNS using well the DNS

423
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,140
services that they provide, right?

424
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:03,810
And DNS typically uses uh a network protocol called UDP user

425
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,140
dataram protocol,

426
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,349
which literally it's like sending a postcard in the mail, right?

427
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,160
You just scribble a bit of information down

428
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,770
and send it off and hopefully the remote end gets it. Maybe they don't,

429
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,930
you know, there's no assured delivery like there is with TCP/IP.

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,050
And so because of that, you can easily spoof UDP packets.

431
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:25,500
So in the case of this attack against D DNS, there may have been only

432
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,609
only

433
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,079
100,000 or so devices attacking D DNS.

434
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,660
But because a lot of these devices are on I

435
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,099
SPS that don't do proper network filtering to prevent spoofing,

436
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,560
they were able to spoof IP addresses in

437
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,209
the amounts of apparently tens of millions of spoofed IP addresses,

438
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,670
which makes tracking down the device even harder because the problem is

439
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,160
you have to then like old time, I don't know if you've ever seen those old films.

440
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,910
You know, it's like why we're tracing the call and you know,

441
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,680
when they get to like each node of the network and

442
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,280
of the,

443
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,079
the phone system and trace them to like Canada and then to like the US and Mexico.

444
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,680
Well, that's what you have to do when people are spoofing this traffic.

445
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,180
You can't just look at the traffic and be like, oh, it's coming from over here,

446
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:07,089
you have to go up each link and be like, oh,

447
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,579
it's coming from level three and then you got to go talk to level three and be like,

448
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:09,920
hey,

449
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,160
this huge honking data flow with these characteristics where is it coming from?

450
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,579
And they'll be like, oh, it's coming from this, you know, peering provider.

451
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,040
You go to that peering provider and it's three in the morning there.

452
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,949
So good luck with that,

453
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,109
-- you know, and eventually we
-- find

454
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,790
-- the data is coming from inside the house.
-- Exactly.

455
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,130
And so even if you can trace these devices down, you know,

456
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:34,030
if I gave you a list of 100,000 IP addresses, what would you do with it?

457
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:34,660
You know,

458
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,479
even if I gave you a list of 100,000 phone numbers and

459
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:42,369
names of the people that actually own and control these devices,

460
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,640
you know, you're gonna phone them up and they're gonna think you're crazy.

461
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:49,560
They're not going to know what I'm talking about in most instances.

462
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,359
Yeah.

463
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,729
You know, so that's, that's the brutal truth is,

464
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,760
is this really reminds me of the whole air pollution.

465
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,089
Uh you know, you've got this

466
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,969
situation where I have a device that benefits me, you know,

467
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,609
in the form of it's my security system, my digital video recorder, whatever,

468
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,589
you know, much like uh for example, I have a car that drives me around

469
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:08,969
or that I drive around

470
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,170
and it creates

471
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,219
some pollution.

472
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,229
Oh, I know, I can't wait for it.

473
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,569
But so you know, these, these, this device has the potential

474
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:23,369
to create what we call a negative externality, right? So it's something negative

475
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,089
that is not my problem,

476
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,790
right? Like in the car in the case of my car pollution.

477
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,449
Unless I, like, sit in the garage with the door closed, running my car,

478
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,319
I'm not going to notice the pollution my car creates

479
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,739
by and large.

480
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,819
Well, same thing with, you know, if I have a device on my network, let's say,

481
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,619
sending out a megabit stream of traffic.

482
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,589
I'm actually probably

483
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,199
not really going to notice if I'm a normal user. Right.

484
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:48,250
Like the internet might feel a little bit slower, but really who's, you know,

485
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:50,209
they're not gonna run some traffic analysis on

486
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:51,719
their network to figure out what's going on?

487
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,469
I think this is a very apt analogy of pollution because you're right.

488
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,709
Everyone pollutes a little bit and, and nobody really cares.

489
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,430
And, you know, I, I even think of this in the context of

490
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,020
going to like a national park

491
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,650
and they say things like, you know, leave only footprints,

492
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,290
take only pictures and people are like, oh, I'm gonna pick up this rock and if like,

493
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,829
every 10 million people decide I'm gonna pick up one rock,

494
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
that's a lot of rocks

495
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,130
-- and,
-- well, that's the really ugly part of this.

496
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,130
You know, it's, it's death by 1000 million teeny, tiny little paper cuts.

497
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:26,030
But, you know, eventually you're bleeding out and everything's tipped over.

498
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,209
So let's follow the pollution analogy because I do like it.

499
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,660
So in this case, the other problem with po, well,

500
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,819
quite often pollution breaks down like,

501
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:35,229
uh, the,

502
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,099
the analogy breaks down a bit because

503
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:39,130
part of the problem with pollution is typically

504
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,229
pollution doesn't just flat out kill you.

505
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,569
It, but it takes like two or three years off your life.

506
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,109
Right.

507
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,550
And proving that can be very difficult because there's so many other situations.

508
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,290
And so it,

509
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,650
it kind of reminds me very similar to spam in

510
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,500
that we have to spend all this money spam blocking.

511
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,030
Otherwise email would be unusable.

512
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,949
Well, you know, Din D and now have to spend whatever amount

513
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:00,150
of money they have to spend,

514
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,849
you know, hardening their network, buying excess capacity.

515
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,949
You know, when I was reading some of these comments online, they're like,

516
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:08,089
why doesn't D DNS just have enough capacity to soak up the attack?

517
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:08,500
Because,

518
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,619
well, that costs a lot of money

519
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,839
and 99% of the time they don't need it.

520
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,060
You know, that's the real ugly truth.

521
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:15,859
Yes,

522
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,979
that's,

523
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,349
that's fair. And, and not only that,

524
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,619
even if they just doubled their bandwidth,

525
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,369
the bad guys would double the attack.

526
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,140
I suspect that the botnets will be able to grow faster,

527
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:36,400
then essentially most rational insane companies can afford to deal with them

528
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,530
for the simple fact that if you go to like your local home hardware store,

529
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,349
like Home Depot or Lowe's or Eagle or I don't know what they have in Europe,

530
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,880
they sell a lot of stuff. Now. That has an IP address.

531
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:48,640
Yeah. Yeah,

532
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,520
there's tons of it. Definitely.

533
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:51,160
You know,

534
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:55,000
and, and that I've, I've actually really noticed in the last six months

535
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:58,780
has become a thing, you know, back a year ago they had, I think it was just the nest, uh,

536
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,239
smoke alarms and thermostats.

537
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,640
That was it.

538
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,109
And now there's, I think about four or five brands.

539
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,349
There's like Honeywell, there's, uh, the nest stuff. There's

540
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,069
like

541
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,569
a whole pile of different manufacturers, you know,

542
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,979
some reasonably reputable and some I've never heard of, you know, Nest,

543
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,270
for example, does

544
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,359
remote automated updates.

545
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,030
You know, my smoke alarm, for example, there was a problem. Apparently.

546
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,760
So previously, you could wave your hand at the smoke alarm and it would like turn off

547
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:28,430
and apparently that sort of same sensor thing could be triggered during a real fire,

548
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,219
which obviously is bad.

549
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:30,229
You don't want a real fire

550
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,550
burning and then

551
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,550
accidentally turning the smoke alarm off because the

552
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,079
smoke alarm thinks you're waving your hand at

553
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,750
it. And so they did an over the air upgrade, right.

554
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,000
So, like these things are, you know,

555
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,709
connected to the internet and they go talk to a mother,

556
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,619
mother ship and unless you like firewall, it,

557
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,770
it's going to get updates end of story and you're not going to firewall because,

558
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:51,150
you know, for it to alert your phone and stuff, it has to go talk to the mothership.

559
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,030
Now,

560
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:59,000
Nest, we can all agree is doing this right. And Google owns Nest, right.

561
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,010
So

562
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,180
they're doing it right. But now next to the nest thermostat

563
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:09,689
is something made, who knows where by, who knows who

564
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,890
and it doesn't get any updates,

565
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,239
but fundamentally appears to do the same thing and it's half the price.

566
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,920
What are you going to do as a consumer?

567
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:19,880
Well, you know,

568
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,989
I've been thinking about this and one thing I would like to see is ideally, you know,

569
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,069
like how we have nutritional labels on food that says

570
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,790
how much fat and protein and carbs and you know,

571
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,119
whatever stuff is in there.

572
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,500
One thing I would love to see is some

573
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,800
mandatory labeling for network capable devices that says,

574
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,640
for example, does this device work without a connection to the internet?

575
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:40,949
Right.

576
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,290
Uh Nest being a great example, Nest,

577
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,150
you know,

578
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,030
there was that situation where it would lose connectivity or something to the

579
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,729
internet and just stop making your house hot which in winter in,

580
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,329
you know, Canada is a problem, right?

581
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:57,329
This is one of the reasons I won't upgrade to a nest thermostat.

582
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,109
I need to have heat in my house or I will die.

583
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:02,260
And so for example, I would love to see, you know,

584
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,489
uh what has the manufacturer committed to for updates?

585
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,380
You know, three years, 10 years, 20 years.

586
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:11,339
Uh are these updates free or do they cost money?

587
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,979
You know, is there a $5 a month to get updates?

588
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:15,939
You know, and for free? I get nothing

589
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:20,349
and just, you know, some, some data around that so I can make an informed choice. And

590
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,589
-- so,
-- you know, you your analogy here is quite AMT

591
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,859
because the nutritional labeling on food,

592
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:30,290
nobody reads or understands what any of that means.

593
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,369
And what you're suggesting is even more complicated than what they were trying to

594
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,579
simplified.

595
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,709
I think it would have to basically boil down to honestly,

596
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,290
the two main things I want to see are

597
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:44,640
what does this device do when it loses its network connection? And you know,

598
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,719
some of it will be somewhat obvious. For example, it maybe can't

599
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,420
uh send alerts to your phone, right? Because it can't connect to the network.

600
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,640
But some of it, you know, some of these devices might just,

601
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,569
-- you know, throw up in a corner and die.
-- If internet

602
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,329
activity is lost, it will murder your family, right?

603
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,020
But here's the thing man. So here's the thing

604
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,489
you can say this.

605
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,969
But what is, first of all, why, why is anybody going to care?

606
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:13,250
Because again, we come back to the fact that without

607
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,569
a real economic incentive here,

608
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:22,920
what is going to compel the industry or the consumer to even care a little bit?

609
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:24,099
I

610
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,040
think part of it is it might have to get bad enough

611
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,010
that somebody like the uh what is it in the US,

612
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,859
the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission,

613
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,780
you know, maybe bans the import of some of these devices until they,

614
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:38,099
you know, meet some sort of standard that they come up with

615
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:40,890
II, I don't know, like I,

616
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,540
I honestly think regulation and standards are the answer because,

617
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,390
you know, from a private perspective, I mean,

618
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,589
it's not like I SPS are going to shut these people down.

619
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:50,380
You know,

620
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,790
they've, especially in Canada, for example,

621
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,050
you've paid for your bandwidth and you have a data cap so they don't

622
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,229
care how you use your bandwidth because once you use your bandwidth up,

623
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,300
you start paying for it.

624
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,729
And I kind of,

625
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:02,410
I tend to agree

626
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:06,650
that for an ISP, they should fundamentally just hand you

627
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,250
the end of a wire

628
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,989
and then it's not their problem.

629
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,270
Right.

630
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,189
That's a sustainable model

631
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:14,339
long term.

632
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:14,579
And, you know,

633
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:16,510
that's one of my concerns because I really don't want to

634
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,709
see a world where my ISP controls what I see.

635
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:21,719
No, no, no, they shouldn't, they shouldn't. Right. They should hand you a wire

636
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,390
and

637
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,829
they don't care what's on that wire one way or the other. Right.

638
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,660
That's, that's kind of my view of that. And I,

639
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,989
if, if we want to think of the internet as a public utility,

640
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,709
that makes sense. Right?

641
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:37,069
Because there isn't like there isn't Comcast brand electricity

642
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,969
that comes into your like it is all electricity,

643
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,550
right?

644
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,520
See one thing that uh so I have a couple,

645
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,880
I have two network connections at home because I work from home

646
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,089
and the one of them is a DS L link and by default, the DS L modem it came with

647
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:56,800
does not. And so the DS L modem itself has an IP address of 1 92.1 68 dot

648
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,079
I think like 1.2 or something.

649
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,040
And then it obviously has a like real IP address on the internet.

650
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,119
But basically by default, if you, you know,

651
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,079
plug your network and stuff into this DS L modem, you're connected to the internet,

652
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,599
but you're not directly on the internet, you're, you know,

653
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,390
behind a network uh firewall essentially.

654
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,645
And I think quite,

655
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:22,744
and, and here's the nice thing is the device can be

656
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:27,484
uh configured to essentially act as like pass through and give

657
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,125
you the real IP address and not be the firewall.

658
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,395
So if you know what you're doing, you can then get your real IP address internally,

659
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,474
so you can run a server or whatever, right?

660
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,775
But by default, if you don't know what you're doing it, basically,

661
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:40,234
here's this device you plug it in and you anything you

662
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,885
plug into it to get internet access is protected by it.

663
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:47,510
And I think that sort of model is maybe, you know, we need to make it safe by default.

664
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:48,310
You know, like

665
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,709
the uh for example, like the airbag in the passenger seat is

666
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,890
uh well, it's a little complicated now.

667
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,750
They have like weight sensors and stuff, but fundamentally the, the,

668
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,040
the the airbag for the passenger seat and the

669
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,760
driver side is on unless you explicitly disable it.

670
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,150
Right. And you might want to, you know,

671
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,170
for whatever reason,

672
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:11,579
-- you know, you're like a very small person or something.
-- So you're not wrong.

673
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,619
Ok.

674
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,150
But this is,

675
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:15,099
oh,

676
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,459
this is such a weird and terrible problem because now

677
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:22,199
what you've described puts the onus on the device owners

678
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,000
or I'm sorry, the device creators.

679
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,290
But here's the second part of that.

680
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,790
So let's say we get rid of default passwords and we make sure it's not net or,

681
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,430
or whatever other thing

682
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,099
we decide is important

683
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,079
that takes care of part of the problem.

684
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,959
But there's still going to be terrible security

685
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,890
flaws in this stuff and it needs updates.

686
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,380
So now we have the situation and this is actually I,

687
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,640
I wrote a blog post about this over the weekend

688
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,890
of the law of truly large numbers is gonna start to kick

689
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,359
in because when we're talking about millions to billions of IOT devices,

690
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,819
every crazy thing you can imagine happens. So if you need to update,

691
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,780
say 2 million IOT devices,

692
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,329
which is not an unreasonable number by any sense of the word

693
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,390
2 million devices.

694
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,810
And I think it's safe to say there's gonna be a,

695
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:16,670
a number of them that just won't install the update for some reason,

696
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,050
which means you're gonna be talking about probably tens to

697
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:25,109
hundreds of thousands of unable or un updated devices.

698
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:25,650
Well,

699
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,369
and the really ugly thing to remember too

700
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,469
is a lot of these manufacturers are actually

701
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:30,675
have very

702
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,484
strong incentives and reasons to not provide updates because here's the thing,

703
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:36,885
you sell them 2 million devices in the field

704
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,594
and you do a software update that even bricks say one in 1000

705
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:44,005
you're gonna have 2000 very angry customers because you know,

706
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:47,925
this isn't like a PC where you can just simply stick a USB key in and reload easily.

707
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:48,444
You know,

708
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:50,324
um I have

709
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:54,405
network devices like my nest smoke alarm and my, my uh bathroom scale.

710
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,859
I don't know that they even have like AJ TE port.

711
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:00,109
So if I was sufficiently motivated, I could like get into it with a whole bunch of,

712
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,510
you know,

713
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,739
hardware and tooling.

714
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:02,739
And

715
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,020
of

716
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,390
course, no,

717
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,150
-- no reasonable human being is going to ever do that
-- if part of,

718
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,130
if you're expecting customers to own J tag equipment,

719
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,540
no,

720
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,020
you just failed and product design,

721
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,760
you know, and, and so part of my thinking is, you know, should we maybe

722
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,270
have SD cards on these things.

723
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,530
So, you know, you can at least swap out the SD card, put a new one in.

724
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,270
But, you know, again that introduces say 50 cents of cost, which, you know,

725
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,550
when you're making 2 million devices, adding 50 cents to the device cost,

726
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,719
that's literally a million dollars in profit. You've just burned.

727
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,910
Well, and not only that, most of these devices are so cheap

728
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,170
that 50 cents is actually

729
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,030
that's a real percent of the margin

730
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:45,810
and, and I think

731
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,729
you bring up a good point. There is, these devices are so cheap. I think

732
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:52,449
it's inevitable that we see the situation where we will have

733
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,770
sort of, you know, it's companies like Foxconn, right?

734
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,219
Nobody's ever really heard of Foxconn until the whole Apple thing.

735
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,660
And, and they do over, what is it? The last number I heard was over $50 billion a year

736
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,290
in hardware essentially

737
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:08,180
like they are just massive and you know,

738
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:12,170
like this Chinese company that makes these digital video recorders like at scale

739
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,099
and then sells them on to 40 or 50 companies in bulk.

740
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,430
You know, I'm assuming they're minimum orders.

741
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,770
Like how many shipping containers worth do you want?

742
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:20,630
And um

743
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:21,719
you know,

744
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,650
and, and so the problem is we,

745
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,209
we kind of get the situation where you have one device maker that, you know,

746
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:32,560
accidentally puts asbestos in all the devices and it costs us, you know,

747
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,209
billions of dollars to clean up.

748
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,530
Yeah, that's,

749
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,829
that's a good point. But, but additionally, so today,

750
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:42,390
I mean, let's even, let's even go as ridiculous as saying,

751
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,449
let's say someone is shipping an IOT device today that literally has asbestos in it,

752
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,869
which of course is, is ridiculous and

753
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,819
probably

754
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,420
that

755
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,239
famous last word.

756
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:55,300
But let's assume that's happening,

757
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,270
let's say that's happening

758
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,069
and, and let's say people find out

759
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,829
what would they even do next?

760
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,369
You know, I don't know,

761
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,520
-- I
-- don't, I can't think of it. I don't know.

762
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,239
I mean, you can, there could be some level of product recalls and whatnot,

763
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,379
but when you're dealing with

764
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,989
something that costs,

765
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,310
right. The Nexus seven things that keep catching fire.

766
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,120
And

767
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,790
that's the Samsung Galaxy

768
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,020
s

769
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:22,270
which are the Sung

770
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,389
and illegal to bring on an airplane.

771
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,239
You know?

772
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:28,918
How do you do that?

773
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:31,217
You know, like, because a lot of people are going to be like, whatever,

774
00:34:31,228 --> 00:34:33,029
I'll just turn it off and stick it in my luggage,

775
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,330
right? Because there's

776
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,800
no federal offense.

777
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,168
Yeah. Well, and you know, so is there's,

778
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,239
there's a lot of things that are a federal offense that people do all the time.

779
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,350
But anyway, so

780
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,639
the problem is too,

781
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,159
is getting people to take this seriously when chances are realistically,

782
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,510
they're not going to

783
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,030
see their device causing the harm. You know, like

784
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,530
the D DNS thing is a great example because actually in taking down D DNS, like

785
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,669
a lot of sites and things fell over.

786
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,310
Like, what was really fascinating to me was to see Twitter degrade,

787
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,989
you know, I was, I keep Twitter open in a web page

788
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,850
and then at one point suddenly all the images disappeared.

789
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,459
That gleefully Twitter worked perfectly fine for me all day.

790
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,810
I couldn't have been happier.

791
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:13,870
Yeah.

792
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:17,280
So it Twitter started degrading. It didn't fail, but it degraded.

793
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,070
And then for example,

794
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,969
github, you know, just failed because their DNS went walk about and,

795
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,209
you know, I was trying to check in some code and it

796
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,699
couldn't find it.

797
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,649
Um But what was interesting to me is I actually had

798
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,330
to send out an email to some other people saying,

799
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:29,909
you know, there's,

800
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,350
and the email literally said there's a massive

801
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,620
denial of service attack against Din DNS D

802
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,370
DNS is a DNS provider for a whole bunch of stuff.

803
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,409
So basically, if you're seeing wonky network stuff and things are failing,

804
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,290
don't worry, it'll probably start working later

805
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,429
and,

806
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:47,139
and, and,

807
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:49,844
and, you know, and literally, like the one lady came back to me, he was like, oh, yeah,

808
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:51,975
our, our accounting is down, right?

809
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:55,844
They use an external, like a cloud based accounting system for, you know,

810
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:59,145
expense reports and stuff these people I deal with and, and it's like, yeah,

811
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:01,754
it's down and I'm like, ok, well, you know, hopefully it'll be back up

812
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,165
because that's all I have to offer. Right. I can't fix this,

813
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:06,304
you know, like I,

814
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,250
-- what am I supposed to do?
-- Right.

815
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,360
You know what terrifies me about that as well though?

816
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,139
Is, is you can say things like maybe it'll come back sometime today, but also,

817
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:14,830
like this botnet

818
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:15,959
is still out there.

819
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,419
Thet didn't get shut down, it just stopped beating up. Din.

820
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:21,500
Horrifying.

821
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,189
Yeah.

822
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:23,219
No, it's,

823
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,340
you know, and

824
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:27,590
what really gets me is imagine if they do something actually, you know,

825
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,219
nasty with it, like, say,

826
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,199
like, like

827
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:30,879
there's

828
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:35,419
some sort of major election coming up, for example,

829
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:41,340
or, or, or a holiday season where, where consumers spend vast quantities of money,

830
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,949
maybe even on one day,

831
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,330
a Friday,

832
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,600
for example.

833
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:46,350
Yeah.

834
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:46,959
Yeah.

835
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:48,189
Yeah.

836
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:52,560
No, it's, I mean, this is what really gets me about this whole cyber war thing is we,

837
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,320
we literally have

838
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,300
no strong idea of who did this and even if we had conclusive proof of who did this.

839
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,199
I mean, what are we going to do?

840
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,949
Well, the source code is on github,

841
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:05,090
like we can spin up a botnet by the end of the day.

842
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,719
-- So,
-- yeah.

843
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:11,479
No, this is, uh, it's, I mean, the good news is fundamentally with a lot of d do

844
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,899
stuff. It's actually not super easy to monetize.

845
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,530
Um, typically from what I've seen,

846
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,409
the best bets are like gambling sites and things like that, you know, where they,

847
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,020
you know,

848
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,919
will take you down an hour before the Super Bowl

849
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:25,739
and you're going to lose $10 million in betting.

850
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,139
So pay us, you know, $100,000 to go away. Kind of like the ransomware situation.

851
00:37:30,149 --> 00:37:33,780
You know, we just, we'll make it way cheaper to, to not deal with us,

852
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,620
you know, the D DNS attack.

853
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,340
Yeah, it was horrendously inconvenient but fundamentally, you know,

854
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,020
nobody I don't think died

855
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,239
as far as I know.

856
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,530
Uh, I bet. Well, you got to think like github

857
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,580
is the center of a lot of organizations source code.

858
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,620
Now, I bet a lot of money was lost in productivity

859
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,620
because of the, the down day.

860
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,409
-- No, I mean, yeah, probably a lot of people around the world lost a few
-- hours.

862
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,280
Conversely because Rne and Twitter were down.

863
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,580
I bet productivity was significantly up for another group of people.

864
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:05,780
-- Yeah.
-- So,

865
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,409
yeah, I mean, it's, and it's back to that death by 1000 million little paper cuts.

866
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:10,979
You know, it's like

867
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,300
if everybody gets one or two spams a day, it's annoying but we can all live with it.

868
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:15,659
But, you know,

869
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,360
you are stealing a few seconds from everybody globally and that

870
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,500
adds up to thousands of man years every day being,

871
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,860
you know, taken away

872
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,209
by this garbage.

873
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:25,669
Well,

874
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,939
so here's the other thing I keep coming back to when I think about this and I,

875
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,260
I don't have an answer

876
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,090
is

877
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,189
the way we do things today

878
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,149
is

879
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:39,590
essentially flawn to the point that we don't even

880
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,510
know where to start to ask the right questions

881
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:47,229
because this stuff, these things happening, like we, we make up analogies,

882
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,709
pollution cars, whatever,

883
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,570
but none of it really fits.

884
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,719
There's aspects of it that fit but the rules are changing. So fundamentally,

885
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,580
we don't know how to understand this problem even, which is just like my,

886
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,699
my head explodes.

887
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,169
I think we can learn a lot from food safety and

888
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:07,500
drug safety because they have similar sort of senses of scale,

889
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,620
right?

890
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:09,409
You have like a company making a drug

891
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,800
that a million or 10 million people use.

892
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,340
Here's the thing and you're not wrong.

893
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,899
And again, we, we come back to flawed analogies, but here's the thing

894
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,310
and this is true of safety and, and all of that is,

895
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,939
do you know how we got those regulations and those rules? We killed a ton of people.

896
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:28,229
And so

897
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,310
the thing that horrifies me is

898
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:36,110
it is quite possible we will not take this seriously until a ton of people die

899
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,439
because of this stuff, which is just,

900
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,969
-- I, I can't,
-- I think that's

901
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,209
human nature. Like, look at air safety,

902
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,500
you know, uh, what was that? The canyon craft

903
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:45,235
where

904
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:46,155
a

905
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:49,475
passenger jet was flying near the Grand Canyon?

906
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:50,554
I think it was

907
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:52,314
and it hit another plane,

908
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:54,125
right. They were both. It used to be

909
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:56,665
-- looking at the canyon.
-- Well, exactly.

910
00:39:56,675 --> 00:39:58,574
It used to be common if you're flying by the Grand Canyon,

911
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,324
apparently for your pilot to be like, hey, let's go.

912
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,735
You know, I'm going to give you the scenic tour

913
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:05,955
and that led to, I believe it was, you know, the positive control where,

914
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:09,925
like everybody flying in the air has to be like talking to, you know,

915
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:11,014
traffic control.

916
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,834
So we know where the heck you are and what you're doing.

917
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,475
So you don't fly into each other

918
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,110
and it, you know,

919
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,739
there's been numerous air disasters from which

920
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,850
we've then investigated and learned things.

921
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,229
But,

922
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,060
ok, ok, let's,

923
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,699
let's go with that. Right.

924
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,030
We just had

925
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,350
a major disaster on the internet.

926
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,510
Right.

927
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:31,320
I don't know that it was a big enough disaster

928
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,030
-- for people to take notice and
-- that's the thing.

929
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,510
Nobody's learned anything that I can tell.

930
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,750
I mean,

931
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,379
there've been a whole bunch of clever tweets and

932
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,340
maybe a handful of articles and even some,

933
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,729
some lame podcasters may be talking about it.

934
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,000
But

935
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:49,310
outside of that I've yet to see any change of any sort to anything because of it,

936
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,110
they make some infrastructure things.

937
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,830
But other than those guys who's made any sort of change to what they do.

938
00:40:58,449 --> 00:40:58,870
Yeah,

939
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,949
I mean, one thing that would help is if every single ISP on the planet blocked,

940
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,229
you know, spoofed packets.

941
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:04,709
So

942
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,870
when you do an attack, it could at least be traced back

943
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,679
to the actual device doing the attacking quickly,

944
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,080
you know, things like that.

945
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,709
-- But
-- it's not even that simple with UDP though Kurt, because

946
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,229
UDP

947
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:20,629
has the ability to send legitimate packets

948
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,010
that can then be used for amplification attacks.

949
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,560
But at least in this case, we could track more to the point,

950
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,689
you could track them down and block them, right.

951
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,729
You know, if theoretically speaking,

952
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,600
if every single internet service provider endpoint

953
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:34,909
blocked spoofing,

954
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,989
you could at least then as D DNS block stuff more upstream,

955
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:40,580
you know, you could block these attacks.

956
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,419
Whereas if it's being spoofed from 10 million IP S,

957
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:45,379
you can't really block 10 million IP addresses easily,

958
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,850
especially when they're spoofing stuff from legitimate users.

959
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,469
-- Right.
-- Well, and, and the funny thing there actually is, is somebody this morning

960
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:57,899
asked me, hey, is there a list of all the IP S used in the botnet that I could block?

961
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:01,340
There were 10 million IP S you can't

962
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,780
like no firewall on the planet can actually handle

963
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,699
that large of a blacklist.

964
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:10,699
And in fact, so this guy pulled up his blacklist, which is extensive.

965
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,479
It took two minutes

966
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,459
to figure out he has 5000 IP S on a blacklist.

967
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,659
You think about that,

968
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,389
once we hit 10 million,

969
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,919
it would probably take hours to construct that list and load it into memory.

970
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,360
Yeah. The only, yeah, I mean, again, back to your large numbers.

971
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,350
Right. Right. Exactly.

972
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,790
You know, there's a big difference between 1000 rules and a million rules.

973
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,429
You know, I look at,

974
00:42:36,149 --> 00:42:39,270
uh, like I'm, you know, we're, we're talking about, um,

975
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,100
on another part of my job, you know, about automation around the CV process because

976
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,040
right now the industry sort of officially

977
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,969
handles around 10,000 vulnerabilities a year.

978
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:53,239
You know, it's roughly ballpark, about 10,000 issues. Get a CV.

979
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,570
It's actually a bit less than that, but it's about that,

980
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,580
you know,

981
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,100
what happens when we officially start recognizing the fact that we have one or

982
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:03,820
2 million vulnerabilities here that we probably should deal with to some degree.

983
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,139
And it's probably worth saying that at 10,000. We're basically at capacity today.

984
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,889
I mean, I don't know any infosec people that are like, boy,

985
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:12,489
I sure wish I had more work to do.

986
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,540
There is boring over here.

987
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:17,530
Yeah. No, no. Uh, nobody in infosec

988
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,850
is unemployed. Really.

989
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,149
You know, you're not, you're not allowed to be.

990
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,689
Right. It's crazy, man.

991
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,909
So, yeah, I, this, this law of large numbers,

992
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:31,000
I suspect we're going to see situations sort of analogous

993
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,149
to the bad drugs and the bad food situation where

994
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,770
hopefully nobody gets killed

995
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:39,709
because that is a really, that is a real possibility, you know.

996
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,939
Um and hopefully we do see attacks that are

997
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,590
highly inconvenient but not, you know, fatal.

998
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,030
And, but even if we have like, let's say, for example, tomorrow

999
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,229
uh the US as an example, the Republicans and Democrats, the Senate, the Congress,

1000
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,629
the president, the executive branch, the judicial branch all

1001
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,310
stand up and say, you know what, this is a huge problem. We are going to fix it,

1002
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,810
do

1003
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:05,399
they

1004
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,350
sign of the end time?

1005
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,040
-- So
-- even if we had the political will and cooper

1006
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:11,709
to like

1007
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:14,270
pass whatever legislation is needed,

1008
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,780
you know, what would we actually pass?

1009
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,379
Well, I mean,

1010
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,479
that's a great point actually and I've asked people this question before and I mean,

1011
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:21,449
this is something for,

1012
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:22,399
for you and,

1013
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,129
and everyone else listening to really ponder is if I

1014
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:27,879
gave you a billion dollars right now and said,

1015
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:29,520
Kurt, go fix security,

1016
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:34,909
what would you do with it. And my guess is you probably couldn't do anything useful.

1017
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,520
Granted you could, I'm certain you could spend a billion dollars. Right.

1018
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,659
Like, actually making a difference.

1019
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:42,860
I'm skeptical anything significant could be done with that.

1020
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:46,669
I think one of the few approaches that might work

1021
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,120
would be to build some tools and frameworks that are,

1022
00:44:50,129 --> 00:44:52,449
they would not only have to be secure obviously,

1023
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,870
but they would have to be free and so completely awesome

1024
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,659
that people would choose to spend the time and effort switching from what

1025
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:03,250
they have to using these new frameworks and tools to write secure applications

1026
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,830
and you just fell into the trap. I see everyone fall into all the time of.

1027
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,070
There is no easy answer to. This

1028
00:45:10,939 --> 00:45:11,320
was the

1029
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:11,629
only

1030
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,000
thing that

1031
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:12,750
mixed it.

1032
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,780
Yeah, I, and I'm not saying this would fix it,

1033
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,659
but it might make it a little bit better and at least give us a chance.

1034
00:45:17,669 --> 00:45:18,020
But

1035
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,510
realistically even that I don't think you would get more than, I don't know,

1036
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,610
five or 10% at a,

1037
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,250
I mean,

1038
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,030
we already have languages that are much safer.

1039
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,110
You know, we already have techniques and tools that are much safer

1040
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:30,840
and by and large

1041
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,000
people don't use them.

1042
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:33,270
Yeah,

1043
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:34,899
it's,

1044
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,030
it's crazy man.

1045
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,639
There's the, the II I hate saying there's no hope but like there's no hope,

1046
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:41,790
you know,

1047
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:42,189
we,

1048
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,030
we still live in a world where the majority

1049
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,810
of people don't have a backup of their data.

1050
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,840
You don't even need security situations to result in data loss. Right?

1051
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,739
People drop their laptops or

1052
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,429
apparently people, like

1053
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,979
people forget them in airports and taxis,

1054
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:57,419
you know,

1055
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,620
which is unclear to me how you would do that because it shouldn't be in the bag.

1056
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:03,770
-- I don't know, you know, people put their phones through the wash
-- actually don't let,

1057
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:05,469
I was at an airport the other day.

1058
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,800
This was, this was actually, was, it was New Orleans.

1059
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,989
I was at the New Orleans Airport and I walk in

1060
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,030
and literally there's a phone plugged in on the floor

1061
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,340
like to charge and there is nobody anywhere near it.

1062
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,469
And the guy walks out of the bathroom and picks up his phone.

1063
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,620
I'm like, what the heck is wrong? Like

1064
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:20,879
I couldn't.

1065
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,699
That's true.

1066
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:25,429
I, I don't, I didn't say anything but I'm like, my, my brain couldn't accept this,

1067
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:27,510
that a human being would like plug in their phone,

1068
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,810
lay it on the ground and then walk away into a place you can't even

1069
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,385
see it for some unknown period of time and come back and take it.

1070
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:34,854
-- And I was like,
-- the

1071
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:36,985
-- reality is
-- the majority of people are pretty honest.

1072
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,895
You know, if you leave your bag, well,

1073
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,965
don't leave your bag unattended in an airport anymore.

1074
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:41,745
That's a bad idea.

1075
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:44,614
But, you know, by and large you can, you know,

1076
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:44,864
I,

1077
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,985
I remember one time I went out in the morning

1078
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:49,375
to my garage and I'd left my garage door open overnight

1079
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:51,445
and everything was still there.

1080
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:51,745
You know,

1081
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:56,504
-- we live in a remarkably honest society in most
-- you don't know what's in your garage.

1082
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,209
I bet someone could steal up to 10% of the crap in there. And you'd have no idea.

1083
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:01,840
You'd

1084
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,620
have a hard time getting it out.

1085
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,000
Throw it over the pile of stuff. Right.

1086
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:08,689
But

1087
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,419
you're not

1088
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:09,649
wrong,

1089
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,360
you're not wrong. There's a lot of honest people, but on the internet

1090
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,879
it doesn't matter how many honest people there are because it's so global,

1091
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:19,570
it's like I could be dishonest

1092
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,760
and I cannot affect your garage in Edmonton, Canada. Right?

1093
00:47:24,129 --> 00:47:26,250
But on the internet I can.

1094
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:27,239
Yeah,

1095
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,600
and that's the difference.

1096
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,040
Yeah,

1097
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,639
I don't know what it's going to take. But realistically, I think,

1098
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:39,020
you know, even if for example, we got the mandate uh for I SPS to filter uh you know,

1099
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,659
the the

1100
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:43,530
is there even enough networking equipment available to fulfill that demand?

1101
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,979
-- No
-- or even the know how man, it's,

1102
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:50,439
this is, this is a tough problem and there isn't an easy solution.

1103
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:53,280
And if you think, you know the answer, you are certainly wrong.

1104
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:55,239
-- I think
-- to some degree

1105
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:56,860
it's going to take a complete shift.

1106
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,820
Like, like looking at, for example, uh car accidents, right?

1107
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,280
Car accident or car sorry, not accidents, collisions kill, what is it?

1108
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,189
30,000 people a year in the USA million

1109
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,840
I think is it a million in India. It's some ridiculous number in India

1110
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:13,159
and China, right? Like just hundreds of thousands. Um

1111
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,120
And quite honestly, the solution to this is not driver training,

1112
00:48:17,129 --> 00:48:20,060
it's not making safer cars, it's just take the humans out of the loop.

1113
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,739
End of story.

1114
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:21,739
I

1115
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,310
tend to

1116
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:22,899
you

1117
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,459
and that's where I often come back to is that automation

1118
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,820
and things like artificial intelligence

1119
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:29,459
and

1120
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:35,939
rather than go on and on for the next hour about how automation will save us all,

1121
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,239
why don't we just say thank you everyone for listening.

1122
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,969
If you have thoughts or ideas on any of this by all means,

1123
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:45,310
let us know because this is a really interesting topic and unfortunately,

1124
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,229
I don't think it's the last time

1125
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:48,909
this problem is going to come up.

1126
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:51,669
I'm actually curious to see when they'll use their botnet next.

1127
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,149
I mean, and for what, because it obviously works.

1128
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:59,030
It, it certainly does. I'm, I don't, I don't even want to think about it.

1129
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,889
So I guess until next time everybody,

1130
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,169
uh, just keep huddling under your desk, weeping softly and

1131
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:07,120
we'll see what kind of fun happens this week. Right.

1132
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:07,500
Yeah,

1133
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,399
I look

1134
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:08,969
forward to it.

1135
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:10,199
All right. Have a good one, Kurt.

1136
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,729
-- You
-- too. Bye bye

1137
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:12,360
bye.
