Hello and welcome to episode 52 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,850
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,219
You know, Kurt, when we started doing a podcast, I didn't expect

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,459
for the internet to be on fire for so many episodes.

4
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,180
It's,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,229
it seems

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:21,430
like

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,489
I'm, I'm starting to suspect it is that,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
that occasionally someone puts it out for a little while and then it flares back up.

9
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:31,319
Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I mean,

10
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,578
we've been doing this now for 20 years. Well, the internet's been around for about 25

11
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:39,019
sixties. I

12
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,298
-- mean,
-- no, no, no. But I mean, with like normal people, not just a bunch of like time

13
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:43,298
frame and like,

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,938
probably 30 years.

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,078
Yeah, I would say late nineties

16
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,569
really is when you, like your mom got on it

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,040
-- and I don't mean that
-- in a

18
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:55,750
-- derogatory sense, just normal people.
-- Let's give credit where it's due.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,650
Wallace broke

20
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:57,590
the internet.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,549
Well done. Qac.

22
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,259
Yeah,

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,389
they, yeah. No, they did some, I mean,

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,959
that was literally one of the top 10 security

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,699
advisories when they said it to us initially.

26
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:13,050
Like it just the level of detail and the quality of the research was amazing.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,599
-- I mean,
-- this is an amazing invite.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,129
So, all right, let's, let's first clarify something. Is

29
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,449
you work for Red Hat and were involved

30
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,290
in working on this

31
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:25,080
for, for several weeks. Is my understanding

32
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,849
so. Well, just a real dirty quick timeline. Basically Q

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
found a bunch of stuff.

34
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,800
I don't know exactly when they found it internally,

35
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,769
but they found it and they came to the distro list,

36
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,750
you know, pretty much right away. And we're like,

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,319
we basically found this huge problem.

38
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,940
We obviously need to coordinate with you guys to fix it, you know,

39
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,180
how do we want to handle this?

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,339
Um

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,050
And so initially, Red Hat and Sousa,

42
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:48,720
uh

43
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:53,360
the security teams got uh sort of a little bit of early access for a few days to the

44
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,209
report and essentially just to, you know, first of all, like call

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,319
comes to us and says, like, literally, we have this thing that like,

46
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,040
we'll burn your house down if you look at it funny

47
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:03,120
and we're like, uh can you be a little more specific, you know, because

48
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,800
this sadly happens a lot.

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,000
Um And it's kind of one of those things, you know,

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,270
is this a kook off the street or did they actually, like figure out who killed JFK?

51
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,410
-- Uh So anyways,
-- in

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,600
fact, these guys are the ones who did it. I think.

53
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,869
So, us

54
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,130
and

55
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,970
Zzo, you know, we, we looked at the report for a few days and kind of went.

56
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,789
Yeah. No, this is all correct.

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,059
And, um, actually it's worse than that because the solution you've proposed,

58
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,429
uh, won't work very well.

59
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,830
So it's actually much worse than you thought it was. And calls kind of went.

60
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,259
Oh, thanks. That's great.

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,610
Um, what are we going to do about this?

62
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,820
And so essentially we, you know, we coordinate, um,

63
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,929
with the community via the distro list,

64
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,220
um, with initially like a two week embargo.

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,660
Uh and then that got extended because quite frankly, um we,

66
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,660
we just couldn't fix this in two weeks, right?

67
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,779
It's just, it's, I mean, this is memory management within the Colonel Angie Lipsey

68
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,479
on Linux and then

69
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,399
the reciprocal on all the B sds, right? So this isn't even just a bad Linux problem.

70
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,320
This is a bad Linux

71
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,009
and BS D problem.

72
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,080
Um

73
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,830
So, you know, it's pretty complicated and to quote one of the

74
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:08,919
Gipsy developers, you know,

75
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:11,320
I don't want to push out a security update that's gonna break everything,

76
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,580
right? Because when you start fiddling with memory management,

77
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,169
you know, you have the potential to break everything. Uh So

78
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:22,389
initially, it was thought, hey, we'll just increase the size of the stack card page,

79
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:22,619
right?

80
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,729
From four kilobytes to say one megabyte,

81
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:29,779
right? That'll work. Uh And the answer is no, no, it, it won't work on its own.

82
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,429
It, it will definitely make things safer and harder to exploit,

83
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,589
but there's enough user space

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,630
uh programs like say pseudo and

85
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:37,070
exim

86
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:42,279
that can be manipulated to allow you to bypass even a one meg stack guard page.

87
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:46,119
Um And obviously we can't go any bigger than about a one megabyte snack card page.

88
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,889
Because if you think about like a threaded application, say with 1000 threads,

89
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,770
that's now a gigabyte of allocated memory,

90
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:57,460
which on a 64 gigabyte uh 64 bit system is no big deal, right?

91
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,419
You got lots of address space,

92
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,309
but on a 32 bit system,

93
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,520
that's a quarter of your address space.

94
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,600
Right. Right.

95
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:05,639
You know,

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,000
so we, we just, yeah, I mean, even on 32 bit systems,

97
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,649
this one megabyte guard page is pushing it, you know.

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Um although realistically anybody now should be able to upgrade to a 64 bit.

99
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,640
Hey, I don't know if I'd go that far, but yeah, I get what you're saying

100
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,029
one could hope.

101
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,829
But uh so anyway, so what was found?

102
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,480
Um especially once we roped in some of the smart guys like Florian uh Vimar

103
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,769
who does uh g lipsy security

104
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,579
is that we also needed to make changes to g lipsy

105
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,559
to really, you know, as he put it belt and suspenders, you know,

106
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,380
fix this for pretty much all of it.

107
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,399
And, you know, you don't

108
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,279
patch and ship a fix and

109
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,519
Gypsy in a few days,

110
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,799
like especially when you're monkeying with the core memory management

111
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,100
because if you do that you will break the internet for real,

112
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,279
you know,

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
nothing will boot anymore.

114
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,519
If you have a broken g lipsy, you're going to have a bad time. So

115
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,920
we asked for and got about a 2.5 week extension to the embargo, which, you know,

116
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:04,559
so we're not talking about an embargo lasting months or years.

117
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,480
We're talking about an embargo that in total

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,950
-- was about 4.5, 5 weeks.
-- That's solid, man.

119
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,519
I mean, this is a lot of work for, for four weeks.

120
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,730
Well, and, and also considering that, you know, like I said, it was,

121
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,190
it's all the Linux,

122
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,709
it's all the B sds like,

123
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,299
which is kind of impressive too because I can't think of too

124
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:27,269
many exploits that are kind of at this fundamental level that affect Linux

125
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,600
-- and BS D
-- at

126
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,429
-- the same
-- time,

127
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,010
there has been some TCP stuff back in

128
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,089
the day because everybody made the same assumptions

129
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,459
and uh,

130
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,790
-- well, things like, you know, user based stuff like DNS where
-- everybody

131
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:39,880
is

132
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:40,820
different.

133
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,109
I mean, I get that.

134
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,790
But yeah, as far as this goes, yeah, I mean, it's

135
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,390
generally speaking, yeah,

136
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,459
the systems have slightly different assumptions or the code has been, you know,

137
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,769
around for 30 years and modified enough that they're,

138
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,220
they've diverged enough that, you know, we just don't have the same problem.

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,589
It's kind of

140
00:05:57,049 --> 00:06:02,510
a flaw in the general architecture of X 86 as well just because of how they work.

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,390
Yeah, I mean, if you want to get,

142
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,350
I guess technical it would be what the Von Neumann architecture and I forget

143
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,070
if that's the one with the data and code separated or with the mixed,

144
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,339
-- you have a comp sci degree, you should know this.
-- I, I don't know, you know, I

145
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,489
anyways, yeah. So the

146
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,519
one of the classic ideas of computing was to split executable and

147
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,970
like data data, right?

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,269
And, and the stack and the heap and all of that sort of kind of does that.

149
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,880
But the problem is, you know,

150
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,799
well, you can write past your stack and jump over the guard pages effectively,

151
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,750
you know, and get into, well, you know,

152
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,670
the the into the bits of memory that you shouldn't be able to change.

153
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,079
And that,

154
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:43,850
you know,

155
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,220
we're running the program on the assumption that these parts of memory

156
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,239
are not going to change and that they're safe to just,

157
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,839
you know, execute as is well.

158
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,739
OK. So why don't we back this up for a little bit?

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,549
Is

160
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,100
a long time ago,

161
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,470
there was an attack called a stack smash,

162
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:00,980
right? Which is a

163
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,540
one and Frack was at 43 I think

164
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,579
is the one who

165
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,160
it does. And it was very clever

166
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,399
and essentially you could

167
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:11,869
do some things.

168
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,769
And because the stack grows down when you overflow, a buffer,

169
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,059
you're writing into stack metadata essentially which

170
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,209
is located above the the variables,

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,489
right?

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,079
Just because that's how it's growing.

173
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,750
And so we, we got rid of that using something called stack protector,

174
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,730
which essentially puts a canary on the stack checks, the canary make sure nothing

175
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,079
did weird things to

176
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,049
the metadata on the stack, right?

177
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,670
And then

178
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,070
that's all good.

179
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,140
And then we end up in a situation where people found out you

180
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,779
could just grow the stack in the heap which grow towards each other

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,070
and you could grow them in such a way that they, they basically

182
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,109
collide.

183
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,390
And so now you have the stack writing into

184
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,589
heap data and the heap writing into stack data,

185
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,260
right?

186
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,619
And that was bad.

187
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,130
And so the solution to that was we created what was called a guard page,

188
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,579
which is basically a page of memory.

189
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,859
A page of memory is four K

190
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,670
page of memory just sitting kind of somewhere

191
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,779
that says

192
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,019
the stack cannot cross this,

193
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:11,820
right?

194
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,890
And, and the heap is a little different because of the way the heap works.

195
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,059
It's a little less dicey as to because,

196
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,420
but anyway, stat can't cross this right?

197
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,869
-- Too long
-- didn't read memory management is quite tricky as it turns out.

198
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,350
Well,

199
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,230
look,

200
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,410
no,

201
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,029
no,

202
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,390
no, I'm gonna say no.

203
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,909
The problem is the X 86 architecture is like 90 years of cobbled together nonsense.

204
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,390
That's the problem. Although funny enough, I I, after reading the Callis Advisory,

205
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,650
I then thought,

206
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,159
I wonder if this affects arm because I don't know off the top of my head.

207
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,729
How arm does stack management?

208
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:46,969
Yeah, it's basically the same. So, like, good job guys, you could have done it.

209
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,020
Right. But you didn't.

210
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,609
So, anyway, although even the arm

211
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,690
architecture is old. So, anyway, anyway, the idea is you have your stack guard

212
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,869
or page, right? Your guard page for the stack.

213
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,210
And now if

214
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,580
it's more of a, it's more of a trip wire than anything else. It's

215
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,260
only if something touches that

216
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:04,669
page

217
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:06,929
and that's the problem.

218
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,619
And you can,

219
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,780
right when the spy sees the trip wire,

220
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,030
he just steps over the trip wire and then everything's cool again.

221
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,570
And so, I mean, that's basically what this Q

222
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,929
thing does is it,

223
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
it jumps over the guard page.

224
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,599
But the beauty of it is that they

225
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,590
found so many ways to exploit this.

226
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,219
It's not even funny,

227
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,559
-- which is just crazy
-- and some of them are really fundamental like the Q

228
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,349
sort issue

229
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:31,340
like that

230
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,150
right? In

231
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,270
so many things on BS D oh man,

232
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,150
it's I give these guys so much credit because I have

233
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,429
not seen an advisory this thorough in a long time.

234
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,159
But the other thing that's really awesome and,

235
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,750
and this is something to touch on in a little bit is

236
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,479
they talk about probabilities a lot

237
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,719
because back in the day of like smashing the stack,

238
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:54,109
you knew where everything was, right?

239
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,729
Everything was always loaded in the same

240
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,919
memory address every time you executed a binary

241
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,039
and things don't work like that anymore.

242
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,719
We have all these randomization technologies built in

243
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:07,619
that are designed to make attacks like this harder.

244
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:08,809
But obviously Qis

245
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,380
has kind of, I

246
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,739
guess they cracked the lottery, right.

247
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,239
They, they kind of figured out how this all works and now they can tell you, you know,

248
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,840
one in 28 runs of this will gain your root,

249
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,039
which is

250
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,419
good for them. I mean,

251
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,799
that's fantastic.

252
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:27,690
So, yeah, so the the original idea was, yeah,

253
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,059
let's increase the size of the guard page and you know,

254
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,729
chances are people will hit it, right?

255
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,880
Make a bigger trip wire.

256
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:36,840
Um The, the problem we found was to make it truly effective,

257
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,179
the guard page would have to be something like 1.6 gigs

258
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,450
which, you know, would basically break everything horribly,

259
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:43,409
right?

260
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,859
Uh Especially on 32 bit systems where you'd run out

261
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,200
of memory space once you have about three threads,

262
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,799
a minor detail.

263
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,070
Yeah, so obviously that's not going to fly.

264
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,179
So the good news is there were some changes made to

265
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,630
Gipsy and, and what was really surprising to me is

266
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,659
they're actually not that big, like for the number of lines of code,

267
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,320
like I was kind of working on the assumption that, you know,

268
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,239
Florian and the related g lipsy guys would, you know, be submitting like, you know,

269
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,859
thousands of lines of changes, you know, to,

270
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,119
to rewrite this whole thing and they actually did it with like

271
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,460
it's like a couple 100 lines of code at most.

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,250
It's

273
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,849
Yeah. No. Well, these guys are pretty crazy smart.

274
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:20,320
It is true.

275
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,409
You know, I mean, this is

276
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,570
Gipsy, this is, this is Rocket science,

277
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
you know, based on like 30 year old show

278
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,659
and it works. So like, wow,

279
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,090
that's, that's good.

280
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,450
So, you know, the good news is with the kernel and the

281
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,409
Gypsy changes, you're mostly safe And then with some additional um

282
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,599
essentially removing attack vectors, for example, with pseudo and

283
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,239
exim

284
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,969
you know, these programs are set U id.

285
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:47,580
So if you get arbitrary code execution within this program, you, you know,

286
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,419
you're now root.

287
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,739
Um

288
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,210
And, and that's a problem.

289
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,500
So with some changes to pseudo

290
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,989
examine some other programs, um you know, like everything on BS TQ sort,

291
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,039
you're effectively closing off all the avenues of the Attackers.

292
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,890
And I'm making air quotes here easily manipulating the heap and stack memory

293
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,059
in order to exploit this flaw.

294
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,559
And uh so honestly, between those three sets of changes.

295
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,020
Yeah, I mean, that's the problem is pretty much uh dealt with

296
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,229
and what's even better, of course is, you know, the,

297
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,909
the G Lipsy guys looked into this a bit more and you know,

298
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,590
have made some additional changes.

299
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,510
Um So

300
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,880
Gipsy, for example, only had one CV assigned to this,

301
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,270
they sort of only had one actual flaw.

302
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:32,739
Um But they actually made a bunch of changes that hardened

303
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,299
Gipsy and Harden how memory is handled

304
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,070
and we make this kind of thing in the future. Uh Quite a bit more difficult.

305
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:39,619
Nice.

306
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,150
That's awesome.

307
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,599
I'm also working on the assumption too that, you know,

308
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,020
now that people know about this,

309
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,250
there's going to be renewed interest in research into this, right?

310
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,530
Because

311
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,330
the dirty secret is like, uh this is based on research from,

312
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,440
-- I want to say 2004 was some of the first stuff.
-- It's pretty old.

313
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,969
I remember some of the first attacks where you had the heap and the stack overlap

314
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:00,030
and,

315
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,070
and I remember the guard page was created and we even

316
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,229
talked about it at the time that this isn't 100%.

317
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,489
This is, I mean, yeah, it stops the current known attacks,

318
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,359
but we know this is a problem and of course,

319
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,950
we never revisited it.

320
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:11,969
So I give KAC

321
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,750
a lot of credit for, for actually going back to something that

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,700
we kind of knew was a problem but, but nobody really put the effort in to prove it.

323
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,140
Yeah. And I, I always wonder about that, right?

324
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,929
Because you hear about, you know, the NSA and all these guys with their, you know,

325
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,809
secret efforts to find flaws and stuff.

326
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,969
And I, I kind of wonder, you know, didn't,

327
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,599
did some attacker or group of Attackers discover this at

328
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,250
some point say in the last 10 years and,

329
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,929
and, you know,

330
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,539
were they silently using it?

331
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,609
You know, whenever they gained local access to a system to get root.

332
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:41,650
Um,

333
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,409
and I, the answer is obviously, we don't know.

334
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,309
I suspect the answer is no, actually because, you know, at some point,

335
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,450
somebody would have noticed on some forensics and been like, oh,

336
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,320
look at what I found.

337
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,349
So it is kind of crazy to think that, yeah,

338
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:57,609
Wallace essentially looked at some papers from, I think, yeah, 2004, 2006 and,

339
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,760
and literally asked the question of like, well, you know,

340
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,979
what happens when the heap and the stack meet?

341
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,809
And as it turns out, you know, really bad things happen, that's

342
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,669
really bad things happen.

343
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:08,340
So,

344
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:13,030
yeah, the good news is pretty much all the major Linuxes are shipping patches today,

345
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,650
uh mostly around the kernel and G Lipsy and then um

346
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,200
same for the B sds.

347
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,200
Uh It doesn't look like anybody else is really affected.

348
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,820
Uh I know that Microsoft was informed because they

349
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,909
now have a Linux compatibility layer and I,

350
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,859
I have no idea how it works or allocates memory or what it's doing.

351
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:31,250
Well,

352
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,789
fundamentally though, I mean,

353
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:38,070
Os X and well, Os X is based off the BS D. So we kind of know how that works.

354
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,969
But but windows, regardless of what they do, like the way the heap and the stack work,

355
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,750
this is part of the architecture.

356
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,820
This isn't like some decision the Linux guys made up one day.

357
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,609
So my suspicion is

358
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,770
Microsoft probably has a degree of this unless they

359
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,969
have a massive guard page in the middle,

360
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,890
which they might, I, I honestly don't know.

361
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,210
Yeah.

362
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:02,049
Well, and they also have a very different permissions model as well with, you know,

363
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:03,929
respect to set U ID and that kind of stuff.

364
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,539
So it's quite a bit different.

365
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,530
Um, I mean,

366
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,450
that, see that, that was one of the big challenges here, right? Is, it's

367
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:14,020
not only did qualify that basically there's a whole pile of set U ID

368
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,820
applications you can use to exploit this,

369
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,919
but like one of them is pseudo

370
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,130
and like pseudo is

371
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,950
as far as I know it's installed by default

372
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,130
everywhere

373
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:25,890
since

374
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,159
I don't think there's a distribution on the planet that doesn't come with pseudo.

375
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,219
Yeah,

376
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:35,119
maybe some IOT devices hopefully don't have it because they're never going to get

377
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:35,500
paid

378
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:36,130
-- for it.
-- All right.

379
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,609
You just, you just said IOT which we have to give the, we'll say token nod to IOT here.

380
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,210
Uh It should please everyone to know that basically

381
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:47,989
every IOT device on the planet now has a nice

382
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,559
way to get from a regular user to root

383
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,679
just in case it wasn't already running its route,

384
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,859
which most of them do.

385
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,340
But uh given the, we'll say history of IOT updates,

386
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,960
we know that, that these will be running forever with this

387
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,320
local to root exploit, right?

388
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,119
Yeah. No, it's um and it's a reliable one too.

389
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,989
You know, that's, that's the thing, right.

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,830
I've, I've seen some exploits where it's like it, they are crazy,

391
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,159
difficult to exploit, like race conditions in the kernel.

392
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,760
This is not that this is, you know, Qac

393
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:19,640
found.

394
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,349
Yeah,

395
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,109
they found this was a gold nugget, like a giant gold nugget.

396
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,099
Oh,

397
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,109
it's the hope diamond, isn't it?

398
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,590
Pretty much? Yeah, I mean,

399
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,380
but like I said,

400
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,969
the good news is hopefully people will do some more research into this and, you know,

401
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,900
between g lipsy hardening and more people doing research,

402
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,450
you know, we might actually squash a whole pile of bugs in the next year or so.

403
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,429
-- I
-- certainly

404
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,109
-- can generally make things better.
-- I certainly hope so. This is,

405
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,919
yeah, I, I don't have a lot to say.

406
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,400
-- I mean,
-- just

407
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:53,859
-- memory
-- management isn't something you can, like, abstract away. Like,

408
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,919
for example, with this law, if you

409
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:59,169
virtual machine, everything and containerized everything

410
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:00,289
and

411
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
managed to get rid of Moet

412
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,359
U I Ds, like you,

413
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,709
you'd still be affected,

414
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,180
you know, that's just the reality of it. Right.

415
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,689
Um,

416
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:10,550
it's just, it's,

417
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,290
it's not something that you can sort of like stick a firewall in front of.

418
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,030
It's just that fundamental to the system. Right.

419
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,469
And that's the other piece of good news here is, it's

420
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,050
from what we can tell there's nothing,

421
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,680
this is all local so far and it

422
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,510
doesn't look like there's anything really remotely exp

423
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,170
I would not say that I think this will

424
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,040
be the area that the researchers investigate is there,

425
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,349
there's no reason

426
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,410
this doesn't affect demons listening on the network. It's just Qac

427
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,280
didn't find any. And my suspicion

428
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,219
is

429
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,290
they might have some hints for things they think they could look at.

430
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,439
But when you're generally exploiting things like a network facing demon,

431
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,030
you can't exploit it as fast,

432
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,609
which means what might take four minutes on a

433
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,729
local system might take four days once you're,

434
00:17:56,739 --> 00:18:00,390
you're dealing with network and, and tear up and shut down and, and, you know,

435
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,770
standing up network connections and all that kind of stuff.

436
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,290
Well, there's one bit of good news here is that in general,

437
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,280
any network Damon that will sort of

438
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,530
allocate that much memory

439
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,050
would already be experiencing a denial of service typically, right?

440
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,329
Like if you can basically get say Apache

441
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,550
to allocate one or two or four gigs of ra M,

442
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,300
that's true.

443
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:20,510
You know, generally speaking,

444
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,770
these network demons are going to get killed or run out of memory.

445
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,760
Um

446
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,180
So in general, like I said, you know,

447
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,140
there's a good chance that the avenue of attack for this

448
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,300
flaw

449
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:37,329
has been found enclosed in a lot of network programs as a denial of service, you know,

450
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,729
over the last decade or two, right?

451
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,900
Um The cases where, you know, you can send a small

452
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,790
uh the great example, always being FTP servers with, you know,

453
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,359
regular expression globbing on the command line, right?

454
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,959
You feed it like star slash star slash star slash star, like 50 of those and then,

455
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:53,369
like,

456
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,469
the poor little FTP server, you know,

457
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,239
allocates all the memory and tips over like

458
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:58,770
a, a

459
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,579
top heavy whatever

460
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,839
and

461
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:03,900
whatever.

462
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:04,459
I

463
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,060
couldn't think of anything politically correct to say.

464
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,930
Um, well, I'm sad because I found out cow tipping is an urban myth.

465
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,050
It's not a real thing.

466
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm

467
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,599
-- so sad.
-- It is an urban myth. Cows don't tell.

468
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,589
Yeah, I was watching youtube videos of people trying to do cow tipping.

469
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,890
And those are actually really funny.

470
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,520
It's like when they, the Boston dynamics video and they kick that robot,

471
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:24,869
it,

472
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,900
-- it's basically that
-- right.

473
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,060
So, so anyways, the good news is it doesn't, I mean,

474
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,410
basically any network Damon that is vulnerable to this is already has

475
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,680
a lot of other problems anyways that need to be fixed regardless.

476
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,739
You're probably right.

477
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,780
And I guess that's a good point is because having read this advisory,

478
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:42,969
it's really, it's,

479
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,729
it's at start up when they just kind of poison

480
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,770
the environment to make the staff do crazy things is,

481
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,140
is where it's all at.

482
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,890
And obviously in a network demon,

483
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,489
if you can do things to the environment,

484
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,050
like you've got way bigger problems than me connecting to your demon, you know.

485
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:02,109
Well, yes and no, because there are now

486
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:05,670
other service providers that do run code

487
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,790
within sandbox or a constrained environment,

488
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:11,729
but do allow you the user to pass things to it, like, say,

489
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,939
user names and passwords for the database connections.

490
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

491
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,449
But look,

492
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,869
if you're running a service like that and I'm not in

493
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,709
my own little sandbox and you know what I mean?

494
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,849
You're doing it wrong

495
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,500
if I can escape in any way, even if I was route.

496
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,670
Yeah,

497
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,670
I agree. But the reality is, you know,

498
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,540
we've had a lot of people build a lot of technology using old stuff, you know,

499
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,030
containers really weren't available five years ago.

500
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,880
I mean, they kind of were, but not really.

501
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,439
That's true. And they've matured a lot since then.

502
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:39,599
So.

503
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,390
Yeah.

504
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,920
Um, but yeah, so, I mean, basically, yeah. No, Qac

505
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,680
hit a home run. Um,

506
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,199
and like I said, the good news is, you know, with about a 4.5, 5 week embargo,

507
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,520
we basically got everybody patched, you know, every

508
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,839
in the next few hours, pretty much all the vendors have got all their

509
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,819
Gipsy kernel updates out and

510
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,140
for everybody that does apply these patches and reboot.

511
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:01,829
Good, great.

512
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,869
You can go home tonight.

513
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:08,119
Yeah. II, I high fives. Right.

514
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,930
I mean, I guess it sounds like everything worked the way it should have worked.

515
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,209
And that's amazing.

516
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,969
And, and,

517
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,949
yeah, I love it.

518
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,859
I guess that's one of the other ironic things

519
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,530
is the named vulnerabilities that really get the attention

520
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,689
are when something goes horribly wrong. Right.

521
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,310
And in this instance it has a name but it's like

522
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,459
good job guys, you know, pat on the back. I

523
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:27,619
love it. Pretty

524
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,390
fantastic. Well done. Kurt, well done everybody involved.

525
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,589
And I have to say the community did a great job here.

526
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,079
All I did was CV S and they were pretty easy by and large.

527
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,349
Although in fairness,

528
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,819
writing CV descriptions was tricky for this one because trying to compress

529
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,650
some of these things down into one or two sentences was nontrivial.

530
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,770
Yeah, I can see that.

531
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:52,430
I can see that. Well, and it should also be said that DWF assigned all of the I DS,

532
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,890
which is super cool too.

533
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:54,930
Yeah.

534
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:55,739
Yeah.

535
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,729
So, yeah, if you haven't been using, uh,

536
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,839
or if you haven't gotten ready for those longer I DS.

537
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:00,969
Uh, well, sorry,

538
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,589
whatever, man.

539
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:08,079
If you're not ready, you live in like 1997. I'm sorry, you just,

540
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,439
whatever. I, I don't feel bad for those people.

541
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:14,959
So I guess, uh, do we want to move on to some, uh, some bad news?

542
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,020
Yes.

543
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,160
Yes, we shall, we shall talk about the,

544
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,699
the terrible tragedy in London of the Grenfell

545
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:22,439
Tower,

546
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,239
which, which will, I guess we'll do the PS A up front of, I'm sure we'll,

547
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,560
we'll make some silly jokes and, and have some bizarre comparisons, but

548
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:35,540
we recognize the, the terrible tragedy, such a thing is to,

549
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,849
to the world for that matter and, and what makes it even worse is that it

550
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,479
is the fault of people,

551
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,959
right? This wasn't an accident like people did this. Which, which is terrible.

552
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,479
Yeah. No, it's, it's much, I,

553
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,040
well, from everything I've been reading, it's

554
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,890
what frustrates me is, it's not just a criminal

555
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,349
action at a small level. It's, it's, anyways, it's,

556
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,359
it's much worse than even, you know,

557
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,189
we thought it was 24 hours ago with some of the stuff that's come out.

558
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:00,699
Now.

559
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,869
Why don't, why don't you give us the, I guess, brief description of what's going on.

560
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,390
And then

561
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:06,969
the,

562
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:09,530
the fundamental comparison we're going to end up with

563
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,000
is this is a failure of risk management,

564
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,359
right.

565
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,489
Yeah. Um So, uh Grenfell Tower is this apartment block

566
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,530
in London that's owned by a council

567
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:23,109
and uh it was refurbished uh the exterior,

568
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:28,209
uh and they use these panels, uh that as it turns out are quite flammable.

569
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,359
And so there was a fire in the tower, I think,

570
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,229
I believe they think it started on the fourth floor and the fire

571
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,359
um

572
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:37,760
went to the exterior of the tower.

573
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,209
And so the exterior of the tower caught fire and the whole thing,

574
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,170
fuck it. It's horrible.

575
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,119
Um

576
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:46,770
Yeah, anyways,

577
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:51,849
a lot of people died. I think they're talking about 58 or so. Now.

578
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,520
I, and that's the other thing is that the

579
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,300
death toll has been rising.

580
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:00,869
Um And yeah, just, I mean, at its simplest, the horrific

581
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:02,199
fact is that

582
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,430
they could have used uh flame retardant panels

583
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,489
and it would have cost about 5000 pounds,

584
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,089
sterling more.

585
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,680
-- That's about, what, 8000 $10,000 us more,
-- give or take.

586
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,719
-- And that would have prevented this.
-- That's free

587
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,109
-- when you're talking about a project like this.
-- Right.

588
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:17,709
Yeah.

589
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,160
And, and what's even worse? I mean,

590
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,599
what really gets me is,

591
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,239
oh, so many levels.

592
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,119
Uh, number one, you know,

593
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,800
who signed off on this because apparently these panels are illegal

594
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,089
to use in structures over a certain height. I think it's like 10 m.

595
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,689
So that's what about three stories.

596
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:38,050
Um, because quite frankly, this is a, this is an obvious failure mode.

597
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,439
You know, when you have a cladding

598
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,439
on something that is flammable and it catches fire and there's a lot of it,

599
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,770
you know, you're gonna have uh what's called chimney effect where the air draws in

600
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,640
and it gets worse, you know, the fire grows.

601
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:56,719
Uh And what's even worse is these are panels with, uh, so there's an aluminum skin.

602
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,239
Um,

603
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:59,050
there's a, uh polyethylene

604
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,540
like core

605
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,760
and then another panel.

606
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:07,599
So you can't get water onto the fire because it's burning between these panels,

607
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:07,859
right?

608
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:08,979
So you, you,

609
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:09,579
yeah,

610
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,119
so you've basically essentially made like

611
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,160
something super flammable and then glued it

612
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,540
to the side or bolted it to the side of a building,

613
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:17,569
you know. Ok.

614
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,079
So let's, let's try to, to lighten this up a bit and, and point out the fact that

615
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,839
a significant amount of it

616
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:25,959
works like this

617
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:27,670
where we are adding

618
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:32,280
what is essentially flammable material to products and services

619
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,530
because it,

620
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,939
-- let's face it, it
-- solves

621
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,180
problem. Right. Yeah,

622
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,109
seriously.

623
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:38,680
-- But it's
-- a

624
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,209
problem

625
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,119
and then people don't,

626
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,829
don't take it into account and you think the building industry

627
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,989
is heavily regulated and obviously it didn't work in this instance.

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,079
But you look at,

629
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,349
you know, information, security, cybersecurity, whatever you want to call it,

630
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,760
-- there's basically no regulation, there,
-- there's no meaningful regulation.

631
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,390
I mean, based on the fact that we keep having these huge data breaches

632
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,400
or, you know, people,

633
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:05,109
uh yeah, uh keep getting compromised.

634
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:06,140
Um

635
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,589
And what's, and what's worse is apparently there's

636
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,959
hundreds or even thousands of buildings in,

637
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,969
in the United Kingdom with this cladding on the exterior.

638
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:15,800
And that again goes back to that in.

639
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,599
It's kind of the classic problem of if you build something and you build it wrong,

640
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:24,219
it's going to cost, you know, 10 to 1000 times more to remediate it,

641
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,260
you know, and that's where we are with a lot of these technical systems

642
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,540
where, you know,

643
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,119
people have a mainframe that they've come to rely upon and to replace that thing.

644
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,469
Now,

645
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,130
um, you know, great example, being like the airline reservation industry,

646
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,130
you know, um

647
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:42,989
that whole thing is based on a piece of software called Saber from,

648
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,329
I want to say the seventies,

649
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,680
it's pretty,

650
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:47,859
I know that

651
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,780
and it's,

652
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,109
you know,

653
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,599
we're at the point where replacing it would cost I

654
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,709
would have to guess in the tens of billions of dollars

655
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,630
and, and it would most likely fail

656
00:26:57,209 --> 00:27:00,680
-- because it's just too complex of a project.
-- They build it on. No Js.

657
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:02,270
Yeah.

658
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,150
You know, like that FBI case management system that they ran, what,

659
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,750
one or $2 billion and it just never worked.

660
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,349
Right.

661
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,260
Right. Learning experience.

662
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,569
But, I mean, so, so here's the thing and you,

663
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:16,329
and you bring up some of these other it systems is

664
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:17,189
so

665
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,989
they know buildings in the UK have this,

666
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,069
there,

667
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,520
there is going to be

668
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:26,500
kind of, this was a forcing function to get rid of it everywhere else, right?

669
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,060
They're gonna make a huge deal about this

670
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:28,500
going

671
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,959
get dealt with and you know,

672
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,729
there's probably going to be legislation that comes out of this.

673
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,979
The last big breach,

674
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,979
nothing happened,

675
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,380
right? And, and

676
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,140
this is something that terrifies me is

677
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,739
I think until computers start killing people,

678
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,060
we're never going to see anything change.

679
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:46,489
I mean,

680
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,739
because like this is an example of where people have

681
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,180
to literally die before anyone cares about a problem.

682
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:52,790
Like people knew this was a problem.

683
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,140
They just didn't care.

684
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,619
Yeah. Well, and, and the other thing that's, that's really sad.

685
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,439
I find about just, and this is just one of the fundamentals of human beings is

686
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,560
unless a whole bunch of people die at once, we generally don't care, right? Um Like

687
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,530
I was looking at traffic deaths

688
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,339
and you know,

689
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,300
traffic kills far more people than most anything else really.

690
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,660
And, you know,

691
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,760
-- we just live
-- with

692
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,540
-- it,
-- whatever. I know. I know. And

693
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,780
that's something I always think of that. Every time I get on an airplane,

694
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,150
the odds of me dying on the ride to the airport were

695
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,469
magnitudes higher than the odds of me dying on an airplane.

696
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,630
But nobody's afraid of the ride to the airport,

697
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:30,239
you know.

698
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,719
Yeah,

699
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:31,560
man.

700
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:33,650
every time and I think we've reached a point

701
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,310
now where more humans have died from automobiles.

702
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,439
I think malaria is the only thing that has killed more people. Right.

703
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,780
Obesity.

704
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,439
Yeah.

705
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:44,489
Has it?

706
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:45,280
I mean,

707
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,140
-- uh,
-- yeah, obesity is now the leading cause of death, I believe in

708
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,270
the leading

709
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:50,530
cause of death.

710
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,530
But has it killed more people than traffic

711
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,250
accidents has over the course of human history?

712
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,150
I would suspect.

713
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,469
Well, if it hasn't, it

714
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:02,520
has really only been a problem for the last, what, 2030 years, I mean,

715
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,219
yeah. So, anyway, anyway, whatever. Ok. So malaria, maybe obesity

716
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,349
and nothing else but yet because it's a slow burn,

717
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:13,709
we let it go.

718
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:14,510
Right.

719
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,030
Yeah, I mean, hands up who here has not

720
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,670
been almost run over in a crosswalk

721
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,390
every day, man, like every day.

722
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,030
So, yeah. No, it's so I'm hoping, I mean,

723
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,760
this is what gets me is, is from what I understand is this

724
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:32,479
Grenfell Tower,

725
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,560
the cladding should not have been used and yet it was you know, and so I'm wondering,

726
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:36,839
like,

727
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,589
you know, who signed off on this product, who signed off on the inspection? You know,

728
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,359
I,

729
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:45,349
I imagine all the engineers involved with that building ever at this point are like,

730
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,239
you know, phoning their lawyers and trying to find the paperwork.

731
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,959
Right. And somebody

732
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,599
probably made a malicious decision at some point. And now that, that is

733
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,109
-- one of the things,
-- I don't think it probably was malicious.

734
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,150
I, I would have to bet that it was just simply cost savings

735
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,339
which,

736
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,290
and that they

737
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:03,790
were,

738
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,660
they weren't supposed to do it. Right.

739
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,760
Let's just say that we won't, we won't go so far to say malicious.

740
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,819
But I guess that's one of the things is even with regulation,

741
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:15,849
you can't stop purposeful intent with regulation, right?

742
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:18,020
Regulation can maybe stop stupid mistakes.

743
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,359
But if somebody is bound and determined to save those 5000 pounds,

744
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,979
you can, you will not stop them. They will get around that.

745
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,160
Well, that's, that's one thing I got like, uh,

746
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,410
so I had to do some uh get some wiring done in my house

747
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:33,439
and I actually bought a copy of the uh Alberta electrical code and read it.

748
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:36,349
And it was really interesting from an information security point of view because

749
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,349
you could literally see where every regulation,

750
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,459
like there's a story behind that and why that regulation exists now.

751
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,459
And the other thing is they were, they were layering security, right?

752
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:44,640
You know,

753
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,589
you ground stuff and then you have like

754
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,119
ground fault interrupt circuit breakers and then you,

755
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,780
you know, you do,

756
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:53,319
you have hopefully multiple stages of failure so that, you know,

757
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,689
when some poor schmuck drives a nail into the wall, he doesn't get killed.

758
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:57,530
You know.

759
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,900
And, um, and that's what gets me about these kinds of regulations is, you know,

760
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,040
they're, they're typically,

761
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,520
there's a whole bunch of stuff that,

762
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,439
you know, was intended to

763
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:09,599
save lives or help people or whatever

764
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,949
part of the problem, I think sometimes, um,

765
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,390
is that some of this stuff kind of needs to be expired?

766
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,589
Right.

767
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:15,770
Like,

768
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,349
there's certain building materials we don't use anymore or

769
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,310
certain methods of construction we don't use anymore.

770
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Yes, exactly. You know, hey, that stuff

771
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,280
and that stuff is fire retardant. So, you know,

772
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:26,489
super

773
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:27,020
awesome.

774
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,219
Yeah.

775
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:28,969
Um,

776
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,750
and, you know, part of the problem I've seen is too, is I've seen people who

777
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,349
they don't agree with or like the regulation. So they, like, ignore it.

778
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,420
Well, yeah, we knew Asbestos was bad for like, 30 years and we kept

779
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:44,180
in 19 thirties.

780
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:47,359
Germany people who worked with Asbestos were given a stipend from

781
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:50,390
the government because they knew statistically these people died earlier.

782
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,349
-- Did they know why though? Or did they?
-- Well, they

783
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:53,609
didn't,

784
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,290
but they knew they had the correlation, they had the statistics to back

785
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:57,430
it

786
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:57,670
up.

787
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,380
Right. Right.

788
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,609
So we, yeah, we've known for a

789
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,270
long time. Asbestos is not good for you.

790
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,089
I think they used asbestos into the eighties, at least in the United States.

791
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,810
We were the last country to outlaw it on the planet.

792
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:10,400
Uh,

793
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,670
funny story.

794
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,000
I

795
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,449
think

796
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:16,010
we stopped exporting it about five or 10 years ago

797
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,079
and I'm sure.

798
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:19,489
And Russia still has asbestos minds.

799
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,369
Oh, good.

800
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:20,979
Because we,

801
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,520
well, and here's the frustrating thing again. Asbestos isn't, I mean,

802
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,010
it's not, you know, if it gets powdered and you breathe it in.

803
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,579
Yeah, that's bad for you. But this is also true of like uranium or, you know,

804
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:32,489
flu.

805
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,449
Your house doesn't have any U

806
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,660
in

807
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,550
it.

808
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,680
Well, I got rid of it.

809
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:41,079
I actually got rid of an original smoke alarm that had a stick around it saying,

810
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,939
uh essentially to call atomic energy of Canada,

811
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,560
-- uh this number to dispose of this unit.
-- Did

812
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:47,119
you call him?

813
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,189
No, I mean, it, it was like

814
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,609
that in a podcast.

815
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,689
I mean, this was smoke alarm was actually made in Canada. That's how old it was.

816
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,430
So,

817
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,180
but see, this is the thing, right?

818
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:03,819
It's, it's not that like asbestos, asbestos is a dangerous

819
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,560
material.

820
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:08,069
But, you know, we regularly have trucks full of gasoline coming down, you know,

821
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,869
residential streets, going to gas stations.

822
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,339
The trick is, you know,

823
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:15,050
to use the thing appropriately and to take the safety precautions around it,

824
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,260
you know. So hopefully people don't get hurt and die.

825
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,160
I mean, uh, yeah, fuel tankers being a great example. Right. They generally,

826
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,619
it, uh, don't

827
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,709
cause problems, you know,

828
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,729
except for that one that caught fire and burned

829
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,459
down a bit of interstate a few months ago.

830
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:33,359
Um, it was Atlanta, I think.

831
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,959
Yeah, because it was just after they had that other one,

832
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,380
they fix their road yet.

833
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,219
I haven't looked into that.

834
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:38,339
I,

835
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,380
I haven't been to Atlanta in a long time and honestly

836
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,119
I'm afraid to go because they haven't fixed the road.

837
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,939
The traffic got to be terrible.

838
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,150
But so back to this, I mean, we, these panels are not inherently bad.

839
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,819
It's just, they can't,

840
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,219
you know, they're not appropriate or safe for use in, say,

841
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:57,979
applications of like higher than 10 m or,

842
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:02,459
you know, maybe in a large, uh, residential thing, you know, maybe in a commercial.

843
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:05,619
Well, and part of the problem too is this building had no fire sprinkler system.

844
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:07,209
It only had one.

845
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,649
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So dirty secret.

846
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,320
Uh, apparently fire sprinklers are not required by code in the UK because

847
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,159
they essentially didn't want to pass that because they

848
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,000
didn't want to discourage people from building housing.

849
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,350
And, and that goes, I mean, there's a great example of a trade off to make,

850
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,750
we need housing for people.

851
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:24,408
But the country is

852
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,467
obsessed with telling people how to live their

853
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,608
lives and they don't put freaking fire spring.

854
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:31,349
I mean, they have, they have cameras watching everything you do in the city

855
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:31,509
of

856
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:31,728
London

857
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,559
Well, it's one of those tradeoffs they decided to make and,

858
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:37,398
and then what made it apparently much worse is that the official

859
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,239
policy for this building for fire alarms was shelter in place.

860
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,128
Which no offense if you have a sprinkler system, sort of makes sense.

861
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:44,589
But if you don't have a sprinkler system,

862
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:48,039
-- but the problem is again, they only had the one stairwell.
-- Oh, man,

863
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:50,069
this is like every bad

864
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:51,958
it is.

865
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,090
It is literally like you want to build a building

866
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,120
that will ultimately kill a whole bunch of people.

867
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,500
Yeah, this is what you build

868
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,540
and what you tell them to do.

869
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:01,290
You know.

870
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,030
That's,

871
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:03,780
yeah.

872
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,489
And I mean, and the worst thing is though, this was, you know,

873
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,219
all done by experts who had the best interests of people in mind.

874
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:14,719
And, you know, unfortunately they came up with a plan that had a very

875
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,639
-- bad, you know, very catastrophic failure scenario. Oh my
-- goodness,

876
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,239
this is, this is madness.

877
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,780
Well, like I said, I mean, anybody who's ever been involved with this building,

878
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,310
I mean,

879
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,350
yeah,

880
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,860
you know,

881
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:32,080
this is literally terrible. Now, what I'm hoping is, you know, from this,

882
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,540
the problem is though,

883
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,600
like if you have a building like this retrofitting a sprinkler system costs,

884
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,219
you know, several $100,000

885
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,310
going to pay

886
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,939
for it to almost just build a new building in some instances

887
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:45,679
or things like adding an extra stairwell,

888
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,199
right?

889
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:49,820
You know, that's a very nontrivial Right. You know, thing,

890
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:52,090
um, at a minimum, I hope, you know,

891
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,159
I know by code in North America stairwells have to have

892
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,159
uh positive pressure so that smoke doesn't get into them

893
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:01,229
because there's no point going down the stairwell if it's full of smoke.

894
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,979
Right, you're going to die.

895
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:08,870
Here's what you just made me think of with, with this line of conversation is

896
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,290
this is what we do in it

897
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,989
almost all the time. And even this qual

898
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,629
thing

899
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,669
is, is comparable of,

900
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,379
we basically figured out how to fix it without really fixing it.

901
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,750
And so

902
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:23,550
it's still

903
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,080
a

904
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,989
really fix it without rewriting everything.

905
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,379
And, and sometimes you got to tear down the building because it's that bad.

906
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,969
And, and I'm not gonna say that with that, Linux is that bad.

907
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:39,169
But I think this is something that

908
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,649
we're reaching a point with a lot of this technology.

909
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,810
We've been kicking the can down the road for so long

910
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,600
that

911
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,649
it, it might be time to burn some of these buildings down.

912
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,219
-- I mean,
-- well, in a, in a way it's happened, um,

913
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:54,469
like a lot of newer languages like Python and go, well, Python's not new.

914
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,409
But anyways, there's a lot of languages now that essentially, you know,

915
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:58,530
take the tact of,

916
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:00,090
we're not going to let you me,

917
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,510
we're just not going to let you manage memory, we're going to do it for you.

918
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,600
I don't think that's far enough. I think

919
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,290
I

920
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:06,659
agree.

921
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah.

922
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:12,320
But I mean, we, we're getting to that point like so go for example,

923
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,909
I looked at the temporary file creation function and you,

924
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,679
you're not allowed to do it insecurely,

925
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,280
you're just not

926
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:19,110
end of story.

927
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,350
No, the way it does it is it, you know, it does the randomized name,

928
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,969
it does the o exclusion open,

929
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,850
it does all the things that you should be doing

930
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,459
to create a temporary file safely and that's the default.

931
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:32,570
And as far as I know there's, I don't think there's any overrides for it.

932
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,250
And that's a great example of like, well, that,

933
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,850
that class of vulnerability is now gone.

934
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:39,449
Although,

935
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:40,250
sadly,

936
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,290
I've seen one or two go programs that shelled out

937
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,810
to bash to create temporary files and have floss,

938
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:46,409
which

939
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,919
I don't know that

940
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,129
I know exactly.

941
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,090
Well, and this is a, you know, like the, like, like this

942
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,540
tower block that, you know, if they spent an extra,

943
00:37:56,229 --> 00:37:59,639
like, what, eight or $10,000 us on, on the cladding.

944
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,909
Yeah, this wouldn't have been nearly as much of a problem.

945
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,030
Uh,

946
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,100
you know.

947
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:10,290
Yes. And, and so here's where I want to tie it back to though.

948
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,760
You mentioned automobile accidents

949
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,969
and we know they're terrible and we know it's a slow burn.

950
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,550
What's gonna be the solution to automobile accidents?

951
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,060
Is it gonna be adding safety features into cars?

952
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:26,840
Well, I think that's part of it.

953
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:27,260
Oh,

954
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:28,979
yeah. And

955
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:30,250
I'll get there in a second.

956
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,250
Well, and

957
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,570
yes, self driving cars, but also, um,

958
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,810
there's a lot of cars now that also have pedestrian safety features

959
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,429
so that when they hit a pedestrian, they don't, you know,

960
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,010
destroy the pedestrian.

961
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:45,679
Um, but for example, I know Jaguar, uh, to get the profile of the car for their look.

962
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,100
Right,

963
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,469
the hood is actually,

964
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:49,899
uh, basically it's too low.

965
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,840
Like if you hit a pedestrian, it's gonna just, you're gonna knock the person flying.

966
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,629
So the hood actually pops up

967
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,870
to give a crumple zone for the pedestrian.

968
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,149
Like it pops up, I think, four or five inches

969
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:03,649
because otherwise it's basically right on the engine. Right.

970
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,639
So if you hit the hood, you're basically hitting the engine.

971
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:09,649
I don't view that as a feature because you still hit the person

972
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,300
and

973
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,449
-- you know what, just don't hit him. That's the right answer.
-- Yes. Oh, I agree.

974
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:17,649
But the problem is until we take humans out of the equation.

975
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,659
Yeah. And, you know, machines won't be infallible.

976
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:23,669
But, uh, for example, yesterday, at a marked crosswalk with my kids,

977
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:24,449
the,

978
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:24,929
you know,

979
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:26,139
and we were having some trouble getting

980
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:28,159
everybody collected and organized across the street.

981
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:28,449
You know,

982
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:31,810
the car will wait and not just get impatient and

983
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,929
drive when my one son steps into the road,

984
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,149
right.

985
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,550
You know, with his arm out and he's wearing orange. So,

986
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,820
yeah, anyways,

987
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,000
no, the, the, the simple answer is to take humans out of the equation.

988
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,129
I mean, the number of people texting and driving now is responsible for, I think,

989
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:47,540
what was it?

990
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,590
Two thirds of all accidents or some ridiculous amount.

991
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,110
Oh, man, I have no doubt of that. II,

992
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I see that so often

993
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,260
where, where the vast majority of people who almost hit me,

994
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,179
I ride my bike a lot so I almost get hit a lot.

995
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,149
And

996
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,229
I more often,

997
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,850
I bet in 80% of the instances I,

998
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,370
I can see they're on their cell phone or they're screwing around with it.

999
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:13,129
Right. And of course, then they yell at me because it was my fault.

1000
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:14,429
But it's,

1001
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:17,830
oh man, it's so, so here's the question though, is

1002
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:21,669
can we take people out of writing software?

1003
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:26,030
And I'm sure there are a bunch of people that just threw their shoe at their computer.

1004
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,250
And y

1005
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:26,489
no.

1006
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,550
Well, and, and the answer is there sort of is um I think one of the things we,

1007
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,409
we as an industry need to push is more use of frameworks.

1008
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:38,739
You know, there's a lot of really good web frameworks, for example,

1009
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,060
that just don't have like cross site request

1010
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,810
forgery issues because the framework authenticates every request.

1011
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,629
You know what? Yes, I agree with you.

1012
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,570
And I used to think that way, but I've come to realize, I mean,

1013
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,909
Google can't get rid of the cross site scripting

1014
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,629
and I'm sure they are framework to death.

1015
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:56,520
There is

1016
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,610
that is a good start.

1017
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,239
But again, I think that's the hood flipping up.

1018
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,209
So now we decapitate the pedestrian instead of just flipping them over the car.

1019
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:05,719
Right.

1020
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:06,620
Yeah.

1021
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,870
Well, I, I don't think we can fully take humans out of the equation.

1022
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:14,459
Um, because part of it too is, you know, you've got like, things like logical bugs or

1023
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,860
behaviors that we defined that we thought were safe and as it turns out whoops.

1024
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,340
No, that was a bad assumption.

1025
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:21,850
Like email.

1026
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:26,110
Yeah. Actually, no, that's a great example because, um,

1027
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:28,889
I deal with one organization and they constantly get

1028
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:31,320
phishing attempts and they're not even very sophisticated.

1029
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,020
They're like, you know, the CEO name at gmail.com, you know,

1030
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,780
go pay this invoice to this Russian bank account right now.

1031
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,129
I'm,

1032
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,860
I'm unavailable for the next 12 hours. So, just do it

1033
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,260
right. And,

1034
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,239
you know,

1035
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,899
the reality is if people

1036
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,110
read email and then follow the instructions blindly. Well, yeah.

1037
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,320
Yep. Yep.

1038
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,750
That's all I got. I don't have a solution.

1039
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,860
People, people that are the problem.

1040
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,000
Kurt, in nearly everything we look at the fundamental problem comes down to people.

1041
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:02,760
Right.

1042
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,760
Well, and the worst thing is it's people who are well meaning and trying to help. I,

1043
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:09,620
most people are well meaning

1044
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:12,199
and, and that's what makes it even more sad

1045
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,050
is these aren't bad or evil people.

1046
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,439
Generally speaking, these are just people who make silly mistakes.

1047
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,290
Oh, man.

1048
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,429
Uh, yeah. Anyway,

1049
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,239
you know, in, in, so here's something else to think about actually is, is

1050
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,169
kind of tying together

1051
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,790
Wallace's stack clash with this Grenfell Tower is

1052
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,669
Wallace did all this research and nobody really got hurt. Right.

1053
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,250
That, that we know of

1054
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:42,790
-- not so far as we know.
-- Right.

1055
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,899
Whereas in the vast majority of real world kind of tragedies it,

1056
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:51,070
we find out about it because something terrible

1057
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,449
happens and lots of people get hurt and

1058
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,159
it's kind of crazy to think about is

1059
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,290
more often than not. I don't think this is like nice quiet research.

1060
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,810
It's usually something crazy, literally lit on fire or exploded. And now we know,

1061
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,979
well, I mean,

1062
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,439
recently the city removed something like 30 or 40

1063
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:11,169
slides from playgrounds because they're made out of metal,

1064
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,159
they're welded, the welds can crack.

1065
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:14,060
Uh,

1066
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,580
and these two pieces of metal are joined at 90 degrees and

1067
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,629
you can get your fingers in there and get them amputated.

1068
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,000
And that's apparently happened to two kids, not in this city, but in other places.

1069
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,500
Uh So there's a nationwide recall on these slides.

1070
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:26,699
These

1071
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,709
two little kids lost their fingers.

1072
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,570
Uh They've been around for a few years.

1073
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,770
It's basically three pieces of metal welded at 90 degrees. So you've got

1074
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:34,139
a

1075
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:34,850
slide.

1076
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:36,510
-- I
-- remember when I was a kid,

1077
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,169
like all the slides were metal because like there weren't plastic slides.

1078
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,459
And so, yeah, no, two kids ended up with, you know,

1079
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:47,889
losing bits of their fingers before we had a nationwide recall on these slides and,

1080
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:49,110
right. And

1081
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,409
not like that.

1082
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,409
If it's only a couple of kids, you're never even gonna hear about it because it,

1083
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:54,959
it's just not, it's not big enough.

1084
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,239
-- Right?
-- I mean, in this

1085
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,020
case, it's how the

1086
00:43:57,129 --> 00:43:57,310
news is.

1087
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,830
But, well, in this case, the system has worked, right,

1088
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,520
because they identified the problem clearly, you know, one kid,

1089
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,659
maybe it's a weird accent.

1090
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:07,229
Two kids. Ok. Now it's a pattern

1091
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:09,219
and, you know, I mean,

1092
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,379
I've always wondered about these slides because they didn't weld the entire scene,

1093
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:13,790
just spot welded the scene.

1094
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,620
-- Basically,
-- it seems bonkers. I mean, come on, you've got to know that's a problem.

1095
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,449
Well, yeah, with like kids jumping up and down on the slide,

1096
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,409
I always kind of looked at them a little bit, you know.

1097
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:23,780
Right.

1098
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,850
So, anyway, so, you know, they, what's interesting is the city was like, yeah,

1099
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,290
a whole bunch of people have called and been really angry until they find out why.

1100
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:33,830
Right.

1101
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,159
So, and I think that's one of the things with Infosec is,

1102
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:40,709
you know, sometimes, well, like today, you know, it's like, yeah,

1103
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,439
we had this embargo extended because otherwise we would have

1104
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,629
gone public with something and not had a solution.

1105
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:46,879
Well, no,

1106
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:50,429
even more dangerous though is when you don't have a solution and

1107
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:53,889
you don't have cool heads looking at something you can make foolish mistakes

1108
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,780
and, and I'll point to shell shock is one of the greatest examples. There is

1109
00:44:58,169 --> 00:44:59,909
the shell shock story and,

1110
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,560
and a lot of people don't know this story and

1111
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,729
I do love telling it is so shell shock gets announced

1112
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,129
and there was a very, I was, I don't even know if there was an embargo.

1113
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:08,929
I think there was a very

1114
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:09,860
embargo.

1115
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,260
-- It was like a one week embargo.
-- And I remember

1116
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,510
we were involved in a

1117
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:16,909
Florian Verner who you mentioned earlier who works on GLC.

1118
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:20,429
He helped with shell shock and basically, he said your fix isn't complete.

1119
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:21,419
We should do it this way,

1120
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,979
but it would have broken some backwards compatibility in bash.

1121
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:26,919
And so the bash guy said, no, we're not gonna fix it the right way.

1122
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:30,540
We're just gonna fix literally this one instance of the problem.

1123
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,389
And everybody knew there were more of these

1124
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:35,830
bugs right under the surface and we're like,

1125
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,830
ok, I guess we'll do it your way.

1126
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,989
Right. And then

1127
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,030
it gets released and like, two hours later,

1128
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,310
I think it was Tavis Ormandy finds more bugs.

1129
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,870
Exactly the same problem for the most part. And we're like, oh, crap.

1130
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,469
And that's when I know like Fedora and Friends and Red Hat said

1131
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:58,350
we're just gonna do what Florian said we should do because that seems better

1132
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,870
and, and they technically broke backwards compatibility

1133
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,389
upstream. Fix the one bug Tavis found.

1134
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,199
And then I think it was, uh, Matthew

1135
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,239
Zalewski with his one, a FL American fuzzle

1136
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:09,919
laps fuzz.

1137
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,090
He

1138
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:17,139
he started fuzzing it and he's like, I found more than 50 bugs exactly like this.

1139
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,030
Right. What are we gonna do?

1140
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,350
And then the bash guys were like, I guess we'll fix it the right way

1141
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:22,139
and like,

1142
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,000
and see part of me doesn't disagree because on the one hand,

1143
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,489
you have this theoretical security, potentially terrible thing.

1144
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,870
On the other hand, you definitely have breaking backwards compatibility,

1145
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,379
which definitely will break.

1146
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,270
I'm gonna say no. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna stand.

1147
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:37,629
I'm not

1148
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:37,959
agreeing

1149
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:42,290
-- with them. I'm saying I just see their point of view.
-- We have committed too many sins

1150
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,489
in the history of computing

1151
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,250
in the name of backwards compatibility

1152
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:48,530
and

1153
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,250
a, a nontrivial number of problems have resulted due to that fact.

1154
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,979
Instead of saying we need to throw this away and start over,

1155
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,310
we've tried to keep this broken down, train on fire on the tracks and that,

1156
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,770
that is not OK.

1157
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:07,669
I, I have become a huge opponent of backwards compatibility.

1158
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,679
What do we do with all the in-house corporate software that's been written,

1159
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,179
look, but here's the thing. OK. So let's use IE six as an example. IE six is end of life.

1160
00:47:17,189 --> 00:47:20,760
You need IE six. Great. Get a virtual machine and run IE six.

1161
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,520
You know what firewall to death,

1162
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,080
you know, the risk you're taking

1163
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:27,159
instead of limping this crap along forever.

1164
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,120
And, and you're, I, I understand the argument you're making,

1165
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,280
but I think the counter argument which is the only right

1166
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,350
way to go is to say if you need this,

1167
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:38,899
like, you need to take extraordinary measures to make it work,

1168
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:42,000
not expect the world to support your poor decisions.

1169
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,270
Well, yeah, no, no more. My point is that

1170
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:44,850
I,

1171
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,149
yeah, if it was up to me, I,

1172
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,040
I am much happier with breaking backwards compatibility

1173
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,489
because I live in the open source world.

1174
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,020
So quite frankly, if something breaks,

1175
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,270
we have the source code and generally enough smart people to

1176
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,570
fix it and then we recompile it and life goes on.

1177
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,090
But that's not true of most of the world, right?

1178
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,689
They, they may not have the source code or they don't have the expertise to fix it.

1179
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,110
So I can understand why these programmers.

1180
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,350
For example, the bash guys would want to say, you know,

1181
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,989
we want to make a minimally invasive change

1182
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,020
so that we, you know, break as little stuff as possible.

1183
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,479
And I think that's a laudable goal, but the problem is, as you pointed out

1184
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,580
-- quite often, those changes are insufficient,
-- right?

1185
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,979
Well, not only that, let's face it,

1186
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:25,580
the people who actually need the backwards compatibility

1187
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,489
probably are never going to upgrade and I'm sure they're running

1188
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,979
a version of bash from 20 years ago as it is.

1189
00:48:31,629 --> 00:48:33,409
Well, and see, that's one of my concerns is,

1190
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:36,080
and that's one of my fundamental concerns with this whole industry.

1191
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,290
We have no data.

1192
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,729
We literally like,

1193
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:42,879
I don't know what what is the patching curve?

1194
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,850
You know, for a given organization?

1195
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,860
Like, do they patch 10% of systems within an hour, within 10 hours, within 10 days?

1196
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,600
10 years?

1197
00:48:50,189 --> 00:48:51,989
You know, what's, what's the, you know,

1198
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,209
it's like when I think Trump came out and said, oh my God.

1199
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:56,290
You know, the, I forget which government department has, like,

1200
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,659
this 40 year old it system.

1201
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:58,300
And I'm like,

1202
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:01,580
no, they don't, they have like, 50 of those. Are you kidding me? Like,

1203
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,340
like, I, you know, every, like,

1204
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,459
uh, I'm trying to think of what my oldest it system at home is,

1205
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,239
but it's probably 10 or 20

1206
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:10,649
years old if I had to guess,

1207
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:13,959
just because I'm a pessimist and there's probably something I've forgotten about,

1208
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,959
like, literally, you know.

1209
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:18,379
Oh, yeah.

1210
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:20,570
No, my wireless routers, they haven't had ad DW,

1211
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,830
they're old enough that I can't get DDW RT updates for them in the last two,

1212
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,370
three years.

1213
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,550
My wireless routers cook themselves about every two years.

1214
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,669
Yeah, it's, it's about time for an upgrade.

1215
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,610
Plus I can, it doesn't seem to reach the basement very well anymore.

1216
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:33,540
There you go.

1217
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,110
Um,

1218
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,750
but, yeah, so, I mean, you know, even myself, I, I've still got it.

1219
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,989
Well, I have out of date it systems because I have to go spend 2,

1220
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,330
300 bucks on new hardware that essentially only gets me up to date software.

1221
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:47,070
Not really much

1222
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,550
-- advantages or features that I don't already have
-- Right.

1223
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:54,030
-- Right. You should probably check those things for, uh, CIA Malware.
-- Now,

1224
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:55,199
that's

1225
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,479
not the worst idea. I was

1226
00:49:57,939 --> 00:49:58,100
with the

1227
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:58,409
idea of

1228
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:02,510
-- using raspberry pies with external antennas.
-- I've thought about that before.

1229
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,110
It's, I don't know, every now and then I get tempted and then I'm like, ah,

1230
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,110
these things are 100 bucks.

1231
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,070
They're so cheap now and they work really well.

1232
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,310
Well, I've been looking at some of the higher end wireless routers

1233
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,879
to get better coverage in. This

1234
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:17,379
might be why yours is 20 years old.

1235
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:21,780
And mine only last two years because I buy the, I buy the $90 router

1236
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,169
at the same time. Like it works. Right. It basically works.

1237
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,419
And the beauty though, too of replacing them every two years is every two years.

1238
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:31,419
There's something new and exciting in the world of wireless I get.

1239
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,580
So I do see an advantage to that

1240
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,070
anyway.

1241
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,709
I think, I think it's time to clean this one up. It's

1242
00:50:38,939 --> 00:50:40,229
thank, thank you, everybody.

1243
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,909
It's been kind of a, a wild conversation to say the least, uh, good luck patching

1244
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:49,030
for, for Stat Clash. And if you haven't read the qual, this advisory

1245
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,469
do it, it's insanely long, but it is marvelous.

1246
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,790
-- Was beautiful.
-- It is, it is a work of art.

1247
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,310
Yeah. When they send it to me, I was like, oh,

1248
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,959
yeah. Ok. I guess that answers all my questions.

1249
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:02,189
Like, normally when somebody, you know,

1250
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,870
find something bad and they send in an advisory.

1251
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:06,530
You're like, OK, I need clarification on like these seven things.

1252
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,550
-- But in this case, it was like, oh no, that's, it's like,
-- wow,

1253
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,070
this thing deserves a literature award

1254
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,270
for writing. It is, it is well done and it has uh quotes from Clash

1255
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:18,090
the

1256
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,110
the Band, the Clash in it. So

1257
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,389
you got to love that. Right.

1258
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:24,399
So I guess anyway, if anyone wants to see the,

1259
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:28,090

1263
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,989
advisory which is very long. I recommend you read them both.

And I guess for everybody out there, you know, if you see something, say something

1273
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:01,939
and don't just, oh, and literally don't, you know,

1274
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,219
sometimes people will try and fob you off and be like, oh, no, it's not a big deal.

1275
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:06,760
No, it, it could be a big deal.

1276
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,659
-- So make sure somebody knows, you know, tell an adult as it were.
-- Indeed. Indeed.

1277
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,090
All right. Have a good one, everybody. Thanks. Bye bye.
