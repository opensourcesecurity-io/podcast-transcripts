00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,910
December 16th. We're getting close. The kids are getting excited.

1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,590
Santa Claus is coming. So 1616 bit computing.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,829
So, one of my favorite things in it is this constant theme

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,010
where

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,620
a large number of people hate

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,549
change.

6
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,229
Even when that change is very obviously

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,229
for the better.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,389
-- That's humans in general. It's not it
-- people,

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:29,350
but people who choose to work in it and hate change.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,000
I imagine that that is very stressful.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,599
It's, you know, it's like hating cats and working at an animal shelter with cats.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,319
I mean, I guess

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,630
that's fair and it's interesting to me that you and I both

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,439
went through the switch from 32 bit to 64 bit computing.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
You know, we remember,

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,770
I remember my 1st 64 bit system, you know, the, the deck alpha stuff.

17
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,365
Uh I had access to it, didn't own one.

18
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:55,645
And then when AMD came out with affordable 64 bit computing, it was fantastic.

19
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:58,915
Yeah, it was amazing for sure. So, actually I have a fun fact,

20
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,834
one of a company I worked for long ago was called Progeny Linux systems.

21
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,194
And there were a bunch of Debian people who

22
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:07,894
worked there And I think it was Hewlett Packard,

23
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:13,194
maybe paid progeny to make Debbie and run on the itanium systems.

24
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:16,669
-- Yes, I remember those days
-- the big challenge,

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,550
there was the 32 to 64 bit switch over and getting

26
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,269
everything to build and work correctly in a 64 bit world.

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,180
So it was,

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,330
and it was awesome because back then, I mean, this obviously was a million years ago,

29
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:32,230
but we had these two gigantic itanium machines in the

30
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,169
server room and they were super fun to play with.

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,519
-- Oh,
-- did you actually have those, whatever? They looked like sun 10,000 servers?

32
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:39,559
Like they were fridge sized monsters.

33
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,665
They were smaller than a fridge, I would say was this,

34
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:46,355
these looked more like maybe a very long filing cabinet.

35
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,904
I would describe them as they were strangely shaped.

36
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,904
-- So
-- they were those top of the line hp monstrosities.

37
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:53,864
They were beautiful computers

38
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:58,404
and then the itanium, no one, no one even knows what it is anymore.

39
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:03,044
Well, it just didn't work and it didn't really offer any benefits.

40
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:03,864
It was

41
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,175
no, ok.

42
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:06,815
It should have offered benefit.

43
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:10,264
The problem was it was too complicated for basically anyone

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,139
properly utilize that is what it came down to.

45
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,350
-- And so it failed.
-- And I love

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,750
AMD 64 bit was essentially, we took 32 bits and kind of just

47
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:25,020
-- smashed it into 64 bits. We
-- stapled 32 more bits onto the side.

48
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,419
We glued two together.

49
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,580
-- And you know what? It worked beautifully.
-- It did work cause Intel ended up.

50
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:35,389
And in fact, even today, if you look in the Debian world, their 64 bit architecture,

51
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,160
they still call

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,369
AMD 64.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,455
Because back in day it was Intel was pushing

54
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:40,994
it.

55
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:45,054
I always try in my brain, I always say Itanic, which is obviously a plan,

56
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,634
Itanium and Titanic.

57
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:47,684
But

58
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,695
Intel was pushing the Itanium and AM D was like, oh screw it.

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,005
We're just going to add more bits and

60
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:58,875
AMD one and it worked. It did, it did work. So anyway, anyway, I agree though.

61
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:02,164
-- I remember the 32 bit to 64 bit changeover
-- or

62
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,875
remember the change to Elf Binaries from A dot out.

63
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,725
I was,

64
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,979
I don't remember that mattering

65
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,500
and I don't know why because I remember that world,

66
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,580
but I don't remember it being a problem, but I feel like I think I started running.

67
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,580
I made the jump from Munich to Red Hat and I think Red Hat was already on Elf by then.

68
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,520
And so I just never really noticed it.

69
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,779
I just remember,

70
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:28,300
I think a lot of what this boils down to is there's a lot of code that's poorly written.

71
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:32,339
But the minute you take it off of its sort of home environment, it breaks

72
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,199
and then the developer gets angry because they have to fix it. But it's also kind of

73
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:40,259
implied strongly because it's true that their code quality is kind of garbage.

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,630
-- I mean
-- that's one of the I so for what it's worth like.

75
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,419
So Apple is making a jump right now from

76
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:47,639
Intel chips,

77
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,910
custom arm chips. And

78
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,669
you can imagine certain things are looking like it's going to be slow to be ported.

79
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:58,809
And what that really means is any application that doesn't basically

80
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,710
move over quickly has is probably not written particularly well.

81
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:06,710
-- Yeah, Photoshop being one example
-- like this is one of the things actually that,

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,539
that gave Linux a superpower

83
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,160
is Linux has existed on many, many architectures for a very, very, very long time.

84
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,738
And so like when you add a new architecture like arm,

85
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,010
it probably took a couple of months and it was all working,

86
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,230
-- you know what it
-- always reminds me of is scaling, scaling from 1 to 2

87
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,040
is not that bad, but scaling from 2 to 3 is 90% of your work and once you scale to three,

88
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:29,809
you're you're fine

89
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,690
and, and right, and most open source

90
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,470
works on all of the platforms.

91
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,910
And so it automatically gets a free pass in a lot of these cases.

92
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,980
Well, they already dealt with the weirdness, the difference,

93
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,829
they already dealt with that technical debt.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,700
Right. Right.

95
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:44,989
Yeah,

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,029
like my guess is getting something like Homebrew working correctly on

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,670
the new Max is probably not going to be that heavy of

98
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,480
a lift because most of this stuff already builds on on arm

99
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:56,869
architecture because it's all running on Linux and BS D and,

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,029
and whatever else.

101
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,309
So, anyway, anyway, all right, we're out of time. We will see you

102
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,049
on December 17th.
