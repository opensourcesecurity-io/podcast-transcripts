Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,350
-- and my partner in getting it done. Right. Josh Pressers.
-- Well, we really f ked up.

2
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,119
-- Episode 300 didn't we?
-- Yeah.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, in fairness though, all the,

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,600
the few articles we found that mentioned sort of the strategy was

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,559
they mentioned copyright,

6
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:25,850
but I went back to the original Apple Press release and

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,430
it does not mention C FAA or copyright or anything.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,510
It's funny you say that because

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,580
I got an email early in the morning from someone named DJ. Hi DJ.

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,950
And it was basically like, where did you find this?

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,259
And I went to look and it was all gone

12
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:42,270
and my first thought was, oh, I just have to look harder.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,189
And then it occurred to me

14
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:44,950
that

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,220
we screwed this up and the more looking I did, the more it was screwed up.

16
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,139
And at first I think the very human reaction is

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,209
I'm going to double down and find

18
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,060
the stories and the information we based our conversation off of.

19
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,409
And then I realized after like five minutes of like furiously searching,

20
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,010
like we just screwed this up.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,889
Well, even if I find

22
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,290
-- the original articles it's still wrong.
-- Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:11,089
And what am I gonna do?

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,129
And in fairness there, there's a whole pile of tweets around this in copyright.

25
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:18,404
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. No, it was definitely in some of the articles.

26
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:21,815
But like I said, well, I would say the biggest mistake we made is I,

27
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:24,985
I honestly did not go to the original Apple press release and read it.

28
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:26,714
I did

29
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,595
and there was nothing in there about what the suit was and whatever here's,

30
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,114
I guess here's the lesson I'm taking away from all of this.

31
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,754
All right. So first of all,

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,620
I think it's a very human reaction to try to defend a bad decision.

33
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,769
And this is actually ties nicely into what we're going

34
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,419
to talk about in a moment for the show.

35
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,180
But it's a very human reaction. And I think at the same time

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,709
by not trying to defend our mistakes and just being like, well,

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,410
you screwed this one up like

38
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,029
that's it. The story's done.

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,029
-- Well,
-- there's a difference between defending and going like, oh,

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,139
did I get that wrong?

41
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,290
Right? Because

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,129
no, like right, you should double check. Like did I actually get that wrong?

43
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,430
The answer is yes, yes, we did.

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,669
We totally screwed this one up and actually I'll put a link in the show notes.

45
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,419
Uh I think in Law Fair did a podcast I listened to about this

46
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:15,660
and they do a marvelous job dissecting what Apple is trying to do.

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,740
Who knew a lawyer's podcast is better than us at law

48
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,475
or, or just in general? I mean,

49
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:24,934
yeah, why don't you

50
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:29,074
-- go listen to a better podcast
-- and no, no, don't be sending people off.

51
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:32,485
We, we need the likes and subscribes. Oh, no, it's not coming out.

52
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,154
-- We know
-- those internet points for

53
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:35,255
-- reasons.
-- That's

54
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:35,574
right.

55
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,255
We'll tell you later what they're for.

56
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:38,725
There's a plan, right.

57
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,619
Anyway. All right. All right. What are we talking about today?

58
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,100
So you're holding it wrong.

59
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,570
And I don't mean just iphones. That would be too easy. But bananas and

60
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,490
Tetris,

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,339
I hate that banana story.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,970
-- It's true though because
-- I, I did not learn how to peel a banana properly until I was

63
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,539
in my late thirties

64
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,660
-- and I saw that video of a monkey at the zoo.
-- No. Look,

65
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,899
if you are holding a banana

66
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,979
and when you are done

67
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,240
the, the inside of the banana is

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,820
in you and the heel is in your hand. You have not failed at eating a banana.

69
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,339
-- But
-- there's such an easier way.

70
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,539
I mean, so you open it backwards. Who cares? I don't care.

71
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:20,539
It's,

72
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,220
I think this is a very, so, so here's where we're gonna start.

73
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:26,630
There is

74
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,259
a story from, it's kind of old now. It's from like April or something.

75
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,479
But basically

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,460
the,

77
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,669
there are people who play Tetris

78
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,910
and, and I hesitate, I competitively, I think it's a fair description.

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,440
And basically these people get these bonkers

80
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,800
scores and they're ridiculously good at it.

81
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:44,270
Well, and

82
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,429
the one caveat

83
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,309
they play Tetris

84
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,800
using the original Nes controllers.

85
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,110
It's

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,029
kind of a

87
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:50,589
-- big part
-- of it.

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,800
I would compare it to like, if you watched Kurt and I play hockey,

89
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:54,940
no one would be impressed.

90
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,350
But when you

91
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,850
s,

92
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,899
-- there's no end of Tetris, Kurt, there's no end of
-- Tetris there is in the game, boy,

93
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:03,229
-- you
-- played whatever, what you played.

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,199
The, the B mode where you just have to complete it.

95
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,710
These people play endless for Paul.

96
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,119
This is,

97
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:09,630
this is

98
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:10,729
matter.

99
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,760
It's amazing to watch. It's like watching the speed runners play their games.

100
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,140
They have a talent.

101
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,019
I do not possess the interesting thing. So, so

102
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,130
in the Tetris world,

103
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,440
there's kind of these two ways to hold the controllers and now

104
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,119
there's a third and the third way is destroying the first two.

105
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,609
And I think this really became interesting

106
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,549
when Kurt and I were discussing it because

107
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,970
if you look at the world of just tech in general, but especially security,

108
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:43,130
there's always new ways to do something and sometimes they're better,

109
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,459
sometimes they're not, but it's

110
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,230
as humans, it can be difficult to give up that old familiar way

111
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,029
when we see a fire superior way.

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,540
Well, you know, it reminds me it's like CS go on,

113
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:58,290
on console with controller versus on PC with a computer and mouse.

114
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,690
There's no comparison Yeah.

115
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,190
Yeah, you,

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,890
you literally cannot have those two groups

117
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,109
compete because there is no competition,

118
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,510
they kind of can so they cheat a little bit. There's a story I will try to find.

119
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,929
But back in the, I think it might have been the original Xbox days,

120
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,489
Microsoft envisioned the concept of crossplay where you have

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,609
PC players playing console players. And I think this was for Halo

122
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,149
and they found that basically even the crappiest players on PC

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,549
because they have a mouse were destroying the console players.

124
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,720
And what they do now is a console kind of cheats where it has like an aim assist.

125
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,470
I think they call it.

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,239
So if you're, if you're close to someone, it kind of jerks over to him. Right.

127
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,989
Basically an aim bot. Yes. But you need that because

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,750
-- playing any of these games on a console is very hard.
-- My favorite. Uh

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,130
there's a video somebody tried to play Starcraft like a,

130
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,829
I think it was a high level cast or like maybe pig or something.

131
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,290
Um or no, no, no, it was Maximus Black, I think playing Starcraft with a,

132
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,630
with a controller.

133
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,109
That, that sounds

134
00:05:59,209 --> 00:05:59,820
like when you,

135
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,000
when you hear those people beating like Super

136
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,459
Mario brothers with the dance pad or something.

137
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,220
Exactly. Those are really fun to watch too. But anyway, anyway,

138
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,059
the topic, the actual topic is

139
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,619
kind of discussing that very human aspect of.

140
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,779
There are sometimes new and better ways and it can be very difficult for us.

141
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,329
You, you have to, the problem is people define a problem

142
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,940
and they define that problem within a context and

143
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,089
then they often get locked into that context.

144
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,410
So

145
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,760
the problem with Tetris is you need to and I'm gonna say this

146
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,489
the way most people say you need to tap the button quickly,

147
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,024
right? Like 10 to 20 times a second

148
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:41,165
to get the piece to move fast enough. So that,

149
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,774
right? But what I'm saying is

150
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,945
well, but what I'm saying is

151
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,524
inherently in that statement,

152
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,744
I've now locked this into the context of interacting with the button.

153
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,785
And the trick is you don't actually

154
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,575
you need the button to interact with the controller.

155
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:55,345
So

156
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:58,345
essentially you can move the button or,

157
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,984
and this is kind of the clever part where they figured out some things

158
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,279
you hold the button but move the controller.

159
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,440
-- Uh
-- Basically, yes,

160
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,570
-- that is what's happening
-- because the controller is

161
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,709
much bigger and it's got more surface area.

162
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,630
And so like you basically drum on like you kind of drum it with your fingers

163
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,190
to get. Well, they were in the video was like 16 or 20 Hertz.

164
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,820
So like 16 or 20 button presses a second, which is, it's a lot. Yeah,

165
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,660
like again, Starcraft, you know, those pro players with 600 A PM actions per minute

166
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,670
and

167
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,010
II

168
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,369
I pop out at like 90.

169
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,619
I don't know how fast I can press a button.

170
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,019
It's,

171
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:37,440
but there's the difference also between pressing a button really fast and

172
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,100
actually pressing multiple buttons very quickly to accomplish an actual thing.

173
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:42,440
Right.

174
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,480
So, anyway, I don't want to talk about Tetris anymore.

175
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:48,279
We're going to, we're going to slide this conversation into.

176
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,399
I like that. Oh, I didn't even do that on purpose. How funny.

177
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,779
But I, I think as security people and I'll, I'll, I'll throw some examples out there.

178
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,380
If we look at the adoption of cloud.

179
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,019
I think it mimics a lot of this where cloud comes out

180
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:06,540
and there were tons of people who were like, oh, it's somebody else's computer.

181
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:10,940
You can't trust what's going on in cloud. And the reality is it was so much better.

182
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,660
You had no choice. Right.

183
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,390
Well, you have a choice but you're hobbling yourself.

184
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,480
It's like, oh, these new cars, they're,

185
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,890
they're just somebody else's internal combustion engine.

186
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,489
Like, no, no, they're better than horses.

187
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,869
And that's the thing with cloud, right? Is

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,369
there's just, yes, you like, I buy my power from the city. I give up a lot of control.

189
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,730
Um,

190
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:33,210
I live in an area now with underground lines but with overground lines,

191
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,989
the rule of thumb was, you know, one outage per summer per squirrel.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,369
Right.

193
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,609
And

194
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,289
that's just the thing, you know, the squirrel chooses

195
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,599
-- to not live anymore and you lose power for a few minutes or an
-- hour or days.

196
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,130
Not a lot.

197
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:48,000
So, I,

198
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,799
so, so I, I had a house. It was the first house I ever owned way back long, long ago.

199
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,409
Imagine there's like a weird little

200
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,440
island

201
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:03,250
and, and basically we had this strange shaped block

202
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,049
that was a, a kidney bean shaped and all of the houses on that,

203
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:13,210
we had one line connecting maybe like 10 houses on this strangely shaped block.

204
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,770
And any time we lost power because it only affected a small number of houses.

205
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,409
It took them forever to come, help us. It was

206
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:22,176
nuts

207
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:25,046
and it was so frustrating. I I detested that

208
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,606
but uh no, that's cloud, I mean,

209
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:33,085
and and in the beginning, especially with the lower tier cloud players, it was

210
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:36,315
kind of basically a poorly managed colo,

211
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:39,205
I mean, sure and and clouds just one example, right?

212
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:42,406
There's there's so many other examples other than cloud. And I think

213
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:48,231
we as security people exist in this weird space. And I think like especially now

214
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,622
there's so much disruption happening.

215
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:55,242
And I would say the biggest focus we're seeing today is like around tooling

216
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,171
where there's all this new tooling around logging and

217
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,831
event monitoring and performance monitoring in some cases.

218
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:06,481
And like all the supply chain, everything we're talking about now and

219
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,400
the focus of a lot of this has become tools

220
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,669
and I think this is so comparable to that Tetris story because

221
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,510
when you if you have a better tool,

222
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,989
it's easy to be like ah whatever that's not as good as what I do,

223
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,549
but sometimes it's

224
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:24,869
way better.

225
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,530
Well, it's funny because this kind of, I'm going to go off on this tangent.

226
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,809
Simon Wardley Worldly Mapping. Look it up. It's awesome.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,150
But one of the things is that

228
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:35,150
when it's immature, it's bespoke or custom made.

229
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:35,940
And

230
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,070
I think part of the challenge there is people who

231
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,530
make custom things get very emotionally attached to that.

232
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,289
And so when you,

233
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:44,950
for example,

234
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:48,520
almost any mechanical watch that costs less than a car

235
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,159
is probably not going to keep time as reliably as a $5 digital quartz watch.

236
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,330
Hilariously. Yes.

237
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,599
Right. That's just so if your, if your requirement is timekeeping,

238
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,229
then go buy a $5

239
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:01,530
cassio does

240
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,909
-- Cassio still exist? I don't know,
-- they do.

241
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,590
I don't know if they still make watches, but I know they,

242
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,950
because actually I just bought a Cassio piano for my daughter for Christmas.

243
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,099
They, it was funny because

244
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:18,250
we, I told her I'm like, we, she wanted like a portable keyboard

245
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,159
and she, she plays like real piano. She's quite good.

246
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,919
And

247
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,030
so I, what I was on Saturday, I think of before we were recording this.

248
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,630
I told her I'm like, get in the car regarding the music store and we get there,

249
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,460
I'm like, pick out a keyboard

250
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,950
and she goes what I'm like, it's gonna be your Christmas present. Pick it out.

251
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,190
She's like, what do you mean? I'm like, look, I don't know how to buy this thing.

252
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,789
I need you to not hate it.

253
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,719
And you're gonna act surprised on Christmas Day. Ok.

254
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:44,599
See, this is the thing, like this is the thing. Never buy,

255
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
don't buy people something for their hobby because

256
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,729
chances are you're going to buy the wrong thing

257
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,280
or they already have it or they already have a better one.

258
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,260
Like, never buy Kurt or Josh, a computer related thing. Dude.

259
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,760
Just give us an Amazon gift card.

260
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,090
You know, I mean, it depends, I I won't say no

261
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,169
no but like memory of CPU

262
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:03,390
you know,

263
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,750
whatever anyways point back to this.

264
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,130
So I think part of the challenge is people get really

265
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,229
emotionally invested in the things that they built and they like,

266
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:12,229
for example,

267
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,919
I built a really slick mailman list server with two front end post

268
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,500
fix and two back end post fix servers like a crank out email,

269
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,010
like just super fast.

270
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,229
And I was so happy to export that list of users and dump it into mailchimp.

271
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:28,030
You know, whereas I know people that would have fought that tooth and nail.

272
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,679
I mean, there was a time

273
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:33,190
I remember fighting many things, tooth and nail.

274
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,460
I mean, so one of my favorite examples I I use of this is

275
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:43,289
back when Kurt and I were working at Red Hat on vulnerabilities and open source.

276
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,489
It was completely bespoke.

277
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:46,250
It was,

278
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,690
it was humans looking at lists of vulnerabilities, looking at code.

279
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,469
There was nowhere to even keep our notes publicly or to share.

280
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:57,530
Yeah, it was, it was really hard. I mean, and it was very, very manual and

281
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:01,070
-- it was one of those things. Like, I remember being really proud of
-- that.

282
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,049
I have some bad news for you. It still is.

283
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,260
I mean, a lot of it is, I know we're working on it

284
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,409
but like, I mean, I remember

285
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,989
talking to a bunch of Microsoft people one day and I'm like, oh yes,

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,969
we fixed 400 vulnerabilities

287
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:16,594
last year in, in this, in, in, I think it was Fedora or something.

288
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:20,085
And they looked at me like I was a freak and in hindsight,

289
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,645
I kind of was

290
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,994
but you know, like we thought that was amazing and it was amazing given the tooling.

291
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,104
But in hindsight

292
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,090
like that was not the end all be all of dealing with this stuff.

293
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,239
Like you need tooling, you need automation.

294
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,520
Humans need not apply. There are better ways to do this.

295
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,359
Yeah. No, it's, I mean, that's what

296
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,380
like I see all the the current dev

297
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:41,539
se

298
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,130
ops uh

299
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,200
crowd of and I use the term kids, not, not in a negative way,

300
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,919
but literally these people are young and

301
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:51,869
they have to be because the old people just won't change their ways,

302
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,780
generally speaking,

303
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,150
right? But so these dev se

304
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:55,320
people kids

305
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,320
are,

306
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,469
they don't really need to care about security

307
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:00,299
that much because they're pushing out updates like

308
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,469
one or more times a week and they're using things like bundle

309
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,419
audit where it just magically is like, oh, you got some CV S there in your code.

310
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,219
Hey, uh, you wanna, you wanna fix that?

311
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,140
Yeah. Yeah, you do. Ok, click

312
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:13,640
I, I take, I take issue with your statement about,

313
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,229
they don't have to care about security, they have to care,

314
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,710
but it's different.

315
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,719
The problem they're dealing with is very different

316
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,820
than what we think of as security.

317
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:24,099
Well, what I mean,

318
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:27,885
they don't have to care is they don't have to do all this hand tooling, tracking,

319
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:29,414
reading, bug track reading, oss

320
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:29,655
se

321
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:30,674
it's,

322
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:34,125
it's in their tool chain now and it literally every time they do a build,

323
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:38,275
they get a warning on any outstanding cvs which they can override or just be like,

324
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,984
yeah, let's update that and see if it breaks anything.

325
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:42,565
It didn't break anything. Cool that CV is now squished

326
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,940
and they don't have to track it because it's in the tooling,

327
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,109
it's tracked in the tooling if they have a regression or something, it's

328
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,830
just, it's gonna magically pop out.

329
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,359
And that's what I mean is like, I hate to say this, but at Red Hat, we had to,

330
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,950
is this patch still included in this R PM?

331
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,200
I

332
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,200
-- remember that. Right?
-- Because if, and, and sometimes things would progress.

333
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,330
It somehow happened every now and then

334
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,200
it's because you'd upgrade. I mean, so the reason it would happen is

335
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,400
there would be a security vulnerability,

336
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,940
we would apply the patch to an R PM doing the red hat back port thing.

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,099
And then for whatever reason,

338
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,500
upstream might have applied the patch and then reverted it

339
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,309
or something happened that the patch didn't go upstream.

340
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,659
Then red hat upgrades the package to the next version.

341
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,489
They don't carry the patch over.

342
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,710
Because when you upgrade versions,

343
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:29,260
the intent is all of the patches in the old version are in the new upstream version.

344
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,440
So you don't need those patch files except

345
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,500
sometimes it got reverted and it wasn't there.

346
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,299
And I mean, it, it was pretty rare. I I'm not going to pretend that happened a lot.

347
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,609
But anyway, I mean, so like on the topic of the tooling,

348
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,429
we're talking about here where developers run a tool and it'll tell you like,

349
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,750
what's wrong with all your stuff.

350
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,229
I remember back in maybe 10 years ago,

351
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,030
we mocked these kind of tools because we were like, oh these tools,

352
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,590
they make so many mistakes, they're not, they were terrible

353
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,630
but they got better.

354
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,710
We didn't,

355
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,270
but we didn't get better

356
00:15:59,239 --> 00:15:59,900
humans.

357
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,270
The thing is generally speaking, humans,

358
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,289
how do I put this? Humans

359
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,880
have topped out at whatever their level of ability is either for

360
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,679
the simple reason is that is the maximum level of ability,

361
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,770
like an Olympic athlete

362
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,679
or

363
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,400
like on a statistical level.

364
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,960
For example, drivers of cars globally, I'm going to say this is as good as it gets.

365
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,200
Like people are not going to go take remedial

366
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,450
driving lessons and learn how to parallel park properly.

367
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:26,330
No,

368
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,200
right now now, actually, I, I have an anecdote to add to that comment.

369
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,909
I cannot parallel park.

370
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,789
When I took my driving test in the United States,

371
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,030
you, they make you parallel park.

372
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,890
That's the only thing I lost points on because I, I never could do it.

373
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,429
But now my car has cameras like, all over it and I can see everything.

374
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,150
I can totally parallel park now.

375
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:52,469
But it's because I have a tool that basically does all the real work for me.

376
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:52,729
I

377
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,020
say

378
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,570
if you have a, a modern enough car, you, you just have a button for that.

379
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,030
Yeah, mine doesn't do that yet.

380
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,000
I, I, that's like the dream though.

381
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,979
Having a car that will park itself is one of my dreams

382
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,118
because I'm, I can't even pull into a parking space straight.

383
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,319
-- Like it's embarrassing. I'm so bad. Is it
-- like a spatial thing

384
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:09,579
or?

385
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,209
I don't know, I'm a bag of meat that sucks at driving.

386
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:15,979
-- That's what it is I think
-- because I definitely get that some people, you know,

387
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,618
lack spatial awareness of where their car is.

388
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:19,628
You know,

389
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,239
you see them driving on one side or the other of the lane instead of in the middle.

390
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,409
I don't have problems with that.

391
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,458
It's just literally pulling in straight to a parking

392
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:29,409
space for whatever reason I am incapable of doing.

393
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,599
Yeah. I don't know. I can't explain it but like a

394
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:32,030
gene

395
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,010
for that I acknowledge

396
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,290
as a human.

397
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:38,130
I am a bad driver. If you ask me if I love it. What is it?

398
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,930
80% of people say they're above average drivers. Like, no, not me.

399
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,609
I, well, I probably am because I'm willing to admit I'm not, you know what I,

400
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,540
that's what I always think of because I watch some people drive and it's like, oh,

401
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,290
my goodness.

402
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,050
Well, and that's, I think, and that's again,

403
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm going to pop up Simon World here because stuff starts in Genesis,

404
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,209
then it moves to custom made and it's,

405
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,640
it's not reproducible, it's fragile, it's not very great,

406
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,920
but it's better than nothing.

407
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,719
And then you get to the product stage

408
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:04,439
where,

409
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,119
ok, things are starting to move along here and then eventually,

410
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,109
hopefully you maybe get to the or not, hopefully,

411
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,270
but you get to the utility stage where it's just a thing that exists and works and,

412
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,630
you know,

413
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,459
it's just

414
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:16,800
you, but the thing is once it gets to everything

415
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,939
as it matures, allows a higher order system to be built upon it.

416
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,619
But at a lower level. So for example, if you have a utility system like electricity,

417
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,750
well, now you can just plug stuff into the wall without worrying about

418
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,439
whether or not the power will,

419
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,479
you know, surge and fry it or something,

420
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,410
which is a real concern in a lot of countries in the world.

421
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,270
And so with cloud, for example,

422
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,119
with Amazon Elastic compute EC2,

423
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,589
it, I remember 10 years ago, man, like it,

424
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,329
uh I would notice the server was degrading and then

425
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,160
two days later I'd get an email from Amazon saying,

426
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,619
hey, the server you're on is degrading

427
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,319
and you know, constant problems like that at least every couple of months and now

428
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,640
those problems went away.

429
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,020
Yeah.

430
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,439
You know,

431
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,930
or you get a warning well, in advance that it's going to fail. And so

432
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:02,349
when EC2 was not reliable, I had to do things like,

433
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,989
have a load bounce or have multiple servers have all the shenanigans.

434
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:10,050
But once it became sort of more utility, more, excuse me, more reliable,

435
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,619
I could ignore that stuff and I could build higher level stuff and just

436
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,859
like electricity

437
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:15,650
just,

438
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,719
I could,

439
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,099
well, like the yesterday's Amazon outage.

440
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,349
Yes, there will be outages once in a while, like about once a year it seems.

441
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,770
And, well, that's ok. Just eat the cost of it. Right. It's

442
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,250
not really that bad.

443
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,770
Whereas if I try to build a super 99.6 nines or four nines reliable system myself,

444
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,810
that's going to cost so much money

445
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,030
and be so much hassle and more to the point

446
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,270
that the, the time and effort I'm gonna spend

447
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,709
building these things and like building these tools,

448
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,380
doing it myself manually compared to even using

449
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,099
a not a great tool,

450
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,510
right? There's, there's no comparison, right? Tools.

451
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,709
And the other thing is once you start using tools,

452
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,530
even if you're doing it bad,

453
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,369
you're doing it consistently bad and you can fix consistently bad,

454
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,060
you cannot fix inconsistent,

455
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,569
-- but we're talking about doing it wrong
-- well.

456
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,290
And even, but the thing is even if you're doing it wrong,

457
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,410
but you're doing it wrong consistently,

458
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,760
you can then fix that process and do it right consistently.

459
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,250
You can make it

460
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,135
-- necessarily.
-- I mean, look, if we put back in the context of Tetris,

461
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,324
if you're holding the controller the old way,

462
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:19,765
you will not beat the people doing the new,

463
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:20,814
the new ways.

464
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,844
But I mean, I think that's the thing is people embracing tools when they're new.

465
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:25,645
Yeah, they're,

466
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,064
they're probably going to be like I can build a

467
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,564
better hamburger than I can buy at mcdonald's maybe,

468
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:32,324
I don't know, I've never had your hamburgers.

469
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,275
Uh They're pretty sweet. But um

470
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:35,795
that's the thing like

471
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,780
in using somebody else's tool.

472
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,400
It's kind of like why open source took a long time to

473
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,369
catch on is using open source at 1st 20 years ago.

474
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,069
A lot of it was maybe not as good as what you could have built,

475
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:47,989
but

476
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,109
that chip has now sailed. The open source is matured, it's been improved.

477
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,069
It's gone to this utility space of,

478
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,160
I mean, like image parsing libraries or web servers. Like if you think you can build

479
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,310
a web client,

480
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:01,949
go talk to, you know, Mr Curl,

481
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,650
-- you, no, you cannot build as good a web client as curl
-- well and, and look,

482
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,369
I think open source is another good example where when you

483
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,750
and I were getting to the world of open source,

484
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,060
it was not

485
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,650
the obvious winner. It is today.

486
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,400
I remember people telling me that I was throwing

487
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,859
my career away by getting involved in open source.

488
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:26,239
And of course, being a young person with all my altruistic ideals, I was like, no, no,

489
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,020
this is, this is the right way.

490
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,709
This is the future. Everything will be this.

491
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,560
And of course, from my perspective, I thought it was the

492
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,064
altruistic right thing. And that's why it would succeed.

493
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:39,275
It actually turns out that businesses love lots of free software,

494
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,064
but that's kind of another story.

495
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:42,515
But you know what I mean? I I think

496
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:47,875
that's another example of once everyone started using open source, it became

497
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:49,555
something you couldn't ignore

498
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,464
because your competitors are doing it better.

499
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:53,755
If you don't,

500
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:58,199
-- you just fail, you cannot beat them by definition,
-- pace of innovation,

501
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,609
change like the change rate of innovation, right?

502
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,260
You look at those graphs of like how fast

503
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,670
were TV S radio versus electricity versus whatever adopted,

504
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,109
right?

505
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,949
And every single technology adoption curve keeps getting steeper and steeper.

506
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:11,109
And

507
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:15,520
what gets me is the one of the biggest problems is

508
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,930
time is a finite resource.

509
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:21,140
So if you are spending time and especially effort and money

510
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:24,069
and other less finite resources like money.

511
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,270
You know,

512
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,589
some companies have a lot of money and they

513
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,430
can just throw money at problems and burn it.

514
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:27,910
It's fine.

515
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,979
But time is not like we all have 24 hours in a day and,

516
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,869
you know, you can do something to buy time, like get a cleaner.

517
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,290
But fundamentally if you're doing it yourself and you're,

518
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,619
if you're giving up time by building stuff,

519
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,410
you're gonna lose on the pace of innovation

520
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,880
and somebody else is going out innovate you,

521
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,079
right?

522
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,859
Like what always gets me is Amazon's

523
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,790
constant fire hose of new

524
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:49,869
services

525
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,579
for Aws.

526
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:55,939
And what gets me is like, I remember, I think it was this year

527
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,660
2021 Digital Ocean announced managed databases like

528
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,219
Amazon R DS relational database service.

529
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:02,829
And I'm like,

530
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,339
wait, you, you just got that now in 2020 or 2021.

531
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,619
Like, are you kidding me?

532
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,449
Yeah. But I bet Amazon's

533
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,670
probably their,

534
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,020
their security team is three or four times the size of Digital Ocean's workforce.

535
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,079
I

536
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,910
know, but the problem is like Digital Ocean,

537
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,939
they're innovating at like one or two new services a month.

538
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,689
Whereas Amazon's doing 10 or 20

539
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,859
Amazon's also building stuff that then lets them build on top of that, right? So,

540
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,109
like if you are internal at Amazon and

541
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,709
you build a service that requires data storage.

542
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,069
Cool. You just use S3

543
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,869
or

544
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:38,050
elastic block store or whatever.

545
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,449
Like, you don't have to build that part as evidenced by yesterday's outage where,

546
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,369
you know, one thing failed and it took out a huge pile of

547
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:45,520
Amazon stuff

548
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,010
and then that in turn took out like Disney and Netflix and Amazon's delivery and,

549
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,959
you know, all that stuff.

550
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,760
But that's a great example, this hacker news thread.

551
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,959
It's like, oh, why didn't the Amazon Flex app, you know,

552
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,819
that they use for their delivery drivers have

553
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,290
like fail over and redundancy and blah,

554
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,839
blah, blah.

555
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:02,209
And they're like, because you have like one outage a year,

556
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:05,290
just eat the loss and don't spend time.

557
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:05,729
Like

558
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,260
if my Devs said, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna start,

559
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,199
we're gonna spend a couple of sprints engineering for reliability in case Hiroko

560
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,630
fails. I'd be like, no, you're not

561
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,869
like, no, don't do that. That's a waste of time.

562
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,449
-- I
-- mean, in most instances, I would agree now, I,

563
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,329
I think there's something really important.

564
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:23,689
We need to be mindful of it.

565
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:26,250
It's easy to talk about how Amazon is

566
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,729
currently outpacing a great number of their competitors.

567
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,930
But at the same time,

568
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:35,719
just because they're, they're big and they can move pretty quickly,

569
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,479
doesn't mean they can't be disrupted because you also have to admit

570
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:43,030
that a lot of Amazon services are kind of crappy and stupid.

571
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,239
Amazon themselves disrupted everything 20 years ago.

572
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,219
-- I mean,
-- they did,

573
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,930
they were like a weird little online bookstore

574
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,619
and well, here we are

575
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,209
and, and that's the thing, somebody,

576
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,930
somebody will come up with.

577
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,449
So we've already agreed that, you know,

578
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,209
serverless and function as a service is probably the way to go along.

579
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:00,719
Like that's the next generation. But kind of what comes after that.

580
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:01,930
And the answer is, well, I don't know,

581
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,250
but some people are going to figure stuff out, try stuff and

582
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,050
one of them is gonna work probably a lot better than what we have.

583
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,050
So something else to think about here

584
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,696
is it's possible nothing comes next.

585
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:17,735
Look at electricity like there's interesting

586
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:20,156
things happening where you generate electricity.

587
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:21,255
There's interesting

588
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,316
things happening how you consume electricity. Like I now plug my car into the wall.

589
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:29,036
That's interesting. That's not something I would have imagined 20 or 30 years ago.

590
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,796
But the point is like

591
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,125
the utility of the grid is relative

592
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,462
relatively static.

593
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:38,371
I mean, I know there's smart grid and a lot of work going on. But you know what I mean?

594
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:38,671
Like

595
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,901
it's not the place you're seeing the innovation,

596
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:42,531
you're seeing the innovation on the ends.

597
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,631
And I think when you think of utility computing,

598
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:49,222
it's kind of a similar thing where the utility computing is becoming the power grid.

599
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:52,741
It's what you're building on either side of that, that I think becomes interesting.

600
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,702
Those utility systems allow higher order behavior.

601
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:59,582
Right. Right. Because I now have a utility

602
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,459
compute grid. Like if I don't like Amazon, I can go use Azure or Google or

603
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,280
Tencent Baidu or whatever.

604
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,880
Like, I just,

605
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,800
I was just like 20 years ago. What would you do if you had to build a web server?

606
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,839
Well, the answer is you had to hire at least one competent admin.

607
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:21,739
Go by about 20 to 40 units of rack mount gear. Find a colo, get it all up and running.

608
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,400
Good luck.

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,650
-- And
-- now that's like the old way of playing Tetris.

610
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,020
And now if you just hold the controller a little different, but now there's,

611
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,709
I guess there's one other piece of this that we should kind of,

612
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,569
we'll bring ourselves home on is

613
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,800
just knowing how to hold the controller

614
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,000
isn't enough.

615
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,079
Because if I handed you a controller and told you this new way, they,

616
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,219
they call it rolling

617
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,319
to play Tetris,

618
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,579
you couldn't do it.

619
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,060
You probably have to practice for hundreds and hundreds of hours.

620
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,569
And I think this is another thing that becomes intimidating

621
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,670
when you're someone who already knows a certain way.

622
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,609
Like if all of my knowledge is focused on

623
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:57,780
servers

624
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:02,819
in data centers that you have to ssh into or whatever right there,

625
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,589
when you look at Cloud, it is terrifyingly complex and different.

626
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,420
And so do you also have to have to accept and acknowledge that

627
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,939
there's a certain amount of learning

628
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,880
and difficulty in failing that's gonna come with that.

629
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,130
Well, and, and even more I think,

630
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,339
difficult and this goes back to our show on being an expert is you also have to take

631
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,959
your existing knowledge and separate out which of your

632
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:27,589
existing knowledge can still be used but applied differently.

633
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,520
So, like I know a ton about email delivery

634
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,260
and I apply that to cloud services.

635
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,829
Now, I will never ever hand to, you know, a Bible, ever run a mail server.

636
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,619
Again, it's just not gonna happen. I will always use like an API or something.

637
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,300
Um And secondly,

638
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,199
if that information is still useful and can be applied great,

639
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,619
but you'll have a bunch of information that is not useful and cannot be applied like

640
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:49,900
um

641
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:53,180
oh, I know how to basically recover like a crashed hard drive.

642
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:55,349
Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore. Back blaze.

643
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,209
Like I have stuff in the cloud or I have back blaze.

644
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,180
And so like I realized when I, when I reinstalled,

645
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,670
I installed Windows 11 clean on my son's computer

646
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,599
and I realized there's nothing to worry about.

647
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,910
Like he's like, oh, I need my chrome to work and I'm like, yeah, you just log in,

648
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,660
it'll be fine,

649
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,410
right? There's like steam. Ok? Steam will just all his games will be there.

650
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,189
Like everything

651
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,689
-- will just magically work.
-- I have a great,

652
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:18,250
I have a great example of this is so

653
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:24,329
my son built his own computer, right? And he was using one of mine

654
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,569
as his like gaming PC. And he's like, I want to build my own.

655
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,989
And so he buys all the parts and he built it and that's like,

656
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,050
you know, and of course, because they all, all the kids watch Linus Tech tips.

657
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,410
Now they want to like, it's all pristine on the inside.

658
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,930
It's nothing like the rat's nest. Everything's got RG BS and whatever.

659
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,869
And then I told him, I said, hey,

660
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
do you want me to yank the hard drive on

661
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,119
this old computer so you can copy your data over?

662
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,500
And he looks at me, he's like, why would I do that?

663
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,420
I was like, oh

664
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,599
right,

665
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,130
all in the cloud.

666
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,140
And then

667
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:58,390
he spent a couple of days red downloading his games and like that was it. Yeah.

668
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:01,939
-- No, it's, it's, yeah, it's a brave new world.
-- It's so different. I love it.

669
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:03,290
And, and that's the thing is

670
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,119
not only do you have to use this new tool and, and

671
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,140
practice with it and get better at it to get to where

672
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,699
you were assuming you're like a proficient carpenter or infosec professional.

673
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,520
And see that's the secret.

674
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,469
Most people are not a good carpenter and

675
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,439
most people are not a good infosec professional.

676
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:21,130
Most developers are developers, not

677
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,040
infosec people.

678
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:26,010
And so even a not great, like I have a Swiss army cyber knife,

679
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,739
which I love my mom gave it to me.

680
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,199
Oh God, probably two decades ago.

681
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:33,300
-- And it's got really great torque bits on it, which
-- it's called a Cyberknife.

682
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,160
It's called the Cyberknife because it had like,

683
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,189
it's got like the perfect actual little screwdriver with

684
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:40,640
the four bits for actually taking laptops apart.

685
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,550
Like it is,

686
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,550
it's magical. It's not the one with the USB Cyberknife.

687
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:46,180
I think it was called the Cyberknife.

688
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:49,030
Or maybe I'm thinking of the one with the USB drive built into it.

689
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:49,800
Right.

690
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,150
But anyways, the point is,

691
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,750
um, even like I, I use, like,

692
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,849
it sits on my desk and I use it probably once a week to

693
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,410
take a screw out of something or put a screw back into something.

694
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:03,030
And is it as good as, like, I actually have a set of real screwdrivers and everything?

695
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,709
No, it's not as good as those, but it's on my desk and it's handy

696
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:10,310
and it's infinitely better than trying to use a butter knife to get a, you know,

697
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,729
a flathead screw out of a electrical socket, you know,

698
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:15,280
to change the wall plate or whatever.

699
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,810
So that's the thing. Right? Most people even given, not a great tool

700
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,410
are gonna be so, like, ok,

701
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:24,540
me with my chop saw, like my arm saw versus a,

702
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,650
like a really skilled person with a handsaw.

703
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,910
Will I be as perfect as in him or her?

704
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,750
No, but will I probably get a lot more wood cut a lot faster? That's close enough?

705
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,280
-- Well, I, I would, ok. And
-- once I practice

706
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,640
with it I'll get really good with it.

707
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:42,030
-- I,
-- I think this is a good example but I don't think you have the right

708
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:42,949
outcome.

709
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,979
I think if you compare a professional with a handsaw,

710
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:49,459
they could say cut a very straight cut.

711
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,479
But they've also been doing it for like 20 years.

712
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,300
I, you can take,

713
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,400
you know, a fancy power saw

714
00:30:55,709 --> 00:31:00,040
and you could make a straight cut with like three minutes of understanding.

715
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,280
And I think that's the difference and that's actually

716
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,839
a marvelous example that I will end on is

717
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,000
this tooling

718
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,869
in the right context?

719
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,310
Can,

720
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,989
can take someone who maybe doesn't have 20 years

721
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,989
of knowledge and make them proficient right away.

722
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,160
And more importantly,

723
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,390
I don't have 20 years to become proficient. I want to be productive now.

724
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,469
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Imagine, I mean, imagine any of us in the computing world.

725
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:25,834
Two years of knowledge is

726
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:30,555
ridiculous to think about at the, at the rate we move. Absolutely. I'm calling it
