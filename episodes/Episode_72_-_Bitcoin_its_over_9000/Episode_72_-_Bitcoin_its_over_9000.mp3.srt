Hello and welcome to episode 72 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,510
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,310
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,989
I saw the greatest thing today while I was walking my dog and it, it both

4
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,149
made me smile and it made me realize

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,110
how much the world has changed.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,000
So it's obviously fall in the northern hemisphere,

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,919
which means it's cold. But also the, the leaves are falling off the trees, right?

8
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,540
Where do you live? Maybe that's true. It's technically winter.

9
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,090
There's still a lot of leaves on the trees here though, for,

10
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,150
for a strange reason that I won't get into right now.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,479
But

12
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,130
so anyway, I'm walking

13
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:47,430
and I'm under this big old tree

14
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,250
and I happened to look up for some reason.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:55,119
I, I heard a noise assuming it was a squirrel or something and, and lo and behold

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,209
in the tree

17
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,389
is a drone stuck in the tree.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,569
And I'm thinking, I'm thinking

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,888
this is the new kite in the tree, right?

20
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,720
Or whatever, man, you can buy it for like 20 bucks.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,709
Now, this was not a very expensive drone,

22
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,809
but that's all I could think of was

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,370
when I was a kid, we got kite stuck in trees.

24
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,830
Now, kids are going to be like, man, I got my drone stuck in a tree.

25
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,150
-- So
-- now I'm thinking, how do you get it out without damaging it?

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,879
Do you get a bigger drone with all

27
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,089
the,

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,010
I

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,610
-- get stuck in a tree. What do you do?
-- So, actually this one wasn't that high.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,480
I think if you had one of those pole saws, you probably could have clipped the branch.

31
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,040
But regardless, I just, it,

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,879
it made my day thinking I haven't seen a kite stuck in a tree in a long time,

33
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,809
but I bet I'm going to see a lot of drones stuck in trees now.

34
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,800
Yeah. No, that's,

35
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,480
and, and that's actually a really good

36
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,459
use case for automated visual, like, recognition of like, oh tree. Don't go into it.

37
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,839
No, like, seriously. Right. Like

38
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,839
that would be like automatic tree avoidance. Like,

39
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,199
actually I'm just

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,120
ok.

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Well,

42
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,470
it also depends on the drone though because my assumption is this drone

43
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,470
was probably not very smart and probably flown by a very inexperienced pilot.

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,309
Right.

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,190
I

46
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,520
think

47
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,360
pilots.

48
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,669
Are you an operator?

49
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:23,899
I don't know what to do.

50
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:27,839
-- Yeah. Well, because the guys flying, the military drones are
-- pilots. Are they?

51
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:28,490
Ok?

52
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:29,369
I don't know

53
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,039
if you drop

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,130
on people. You probably want some degree of competence.

55
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,130
Let's just, let's let the A is take care of that.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,479
Well, they tried that too and that got a little ugly.

57
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:42,690
Um, so the good news is we've had, like,

58
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,490
autonomous drone

59
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,000
obstacle avoidance

60
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:47,869
for years now.

61
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,270
Right. Like in the lab and

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,350
apparently like the DG I Phantoms have this as a feature.

63
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,630
Well, right. I would expect an expensive drone to have it, but, I mean,

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,029
they're selling them at the gas station for 20 bucks right now. Right.

65
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,470
-- Like that,
-- that's what I love about. Technology is like,

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,229
yeah, when you see that the gas station,

67
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,119
like USB cords and chargers at the gas station, it's like, yeah.

68
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,199
No, clearly this is everybody has this.

69
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,710
Yes.

70
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,880
Well, part of me also wonders

71
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:20,710
who buys some of these cords at the, I mean, some of these cords are super,

72
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:21,029
you

73
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,449
charge

74
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,580
your

75
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,529
phone and you forgot it in you.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,089
I,

77
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,610
so all the gas stations have the USB cords like the charge cables,

78
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:32,100
not the ones you know, that are good and actually can transfer data,

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,110
but just one little charge.

80
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,440
Most of them have like the little,

81
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,000
uh, what do you call it?

82
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,979
Well, I'm going to call it the cigarette lighter plug in,

83
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,520
but of course my Children and anybody under the age of like

84
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:43,369
20 is not going to have a clue what we're talking about,

85
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,929
right?

86
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,529
Ok. So folks just so you're aware

87
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,449
the power plugs in your car, it used to be for cigarette lighters.

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,449
Ok, because we all, everybody smoked,

89
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,250
-- including in their cars,
-- Mike my truck still has one.

90
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,539
My, my truck is from 2001 though. Yes. One of the things you push in.

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,270
I remember as a little kid we'd play with them and we'd, of course,

92
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,669
burn ourselves terribly with

93
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:09,910
who can hold their finger. The closest to it

94
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,699
of a

95
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,509
movie

96
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,238
where the, uh, they, they, uh, the ex presidents' wife got kidnapped. Remember?

97
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,140
And she burned the kidnapper with the thing leaving like little scars on his neck

98
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,548
as a clue.

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,290
I've seen that.

100
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,350
But you know what? I did notice that no gas station or

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
almost nobody carries anymore is USB thumb drives. Those are like at Staples.

102
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,260
And that's it. Like the grocery store used to have them.

103
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,380
They don't have them anymore.

104
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,339
I can't, I was looking locally for one and I actually ended up having to go to Staples.

105
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,250
I don't think I've bought one in forever.

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,640
I, I literally keep, I,

107
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,600
I have a Ziploc baggie that is completely full of

108
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,559
them because when I go to conferences or something,

109
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,040
I get a bunch of them for free

110
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:50,480
and

111
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,859
I don't take them from security conferences.

112
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:56,320
But generally, look, look, here's the thing,

113
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:57,359
let's face it.

114
00:04:57,369 --> 00:05:02,519
If I'm at a normal person conference and they're handing out USB drives,

115
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,720
the odds of it being bad are effectively zero.

116
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,670
Chances are, it might have a virus. But,

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,380
and that's fine.

118
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,140
It's very unlikely though. That'll have like that hardware level tax stuff.

119
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,059
Right. I, I plug it into a Linux machine. I format it

120
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,899
and I don't even look at what's on it because I don't want to.

121
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,950
And I know it's probably marketing materials

122
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,700
but, and, and then I keep them and what I do with them

123
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,019
is when family members or friends say, hey,

124
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,709
I need this or can you give me that or whatever?

125
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,260
It's much easier to just copy a thing to one of them, give it to them and say,

126
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,940
I never want this back.

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,190
And then

128
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,570
80% of the time I get it back

129
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,100
to

130
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,709
that. In fact, I just did this for a neighbor,

131
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,899
an old neighbor some time ago where their, their computer,

132
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,200
they bought a new computer and they basically said, how do I get my data off it?

133
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,269
And

134
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,739
I just said, bring your old computer to me. I'm gonna take your hard drive out.

135
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,130
I'm gonna copy it onto this flash drive and then I'm gonna throw it,

136
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,850
I'm gonna wipe it and recycle it.

137
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,190
Ok? They're like, I don't know what you just said, but ok,

138
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,980
and it was just easier than trying to boot windows and figure out what's going on,

139
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,000
you know, I'm just, no,

140
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,299
I'm just going to copy a bunch of files and give

141
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,290
it to you and you can figure it out from there

142
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,910
anyway. Anyway,

143
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,239
we should

144
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,769
get to the topic of the death.

145
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,609
Oh, and what

146
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:26,980
it

147
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,209
is, say it, Kurt

148
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,920
say it

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,649
Bitcoin.

150
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,820
It's literally over 9000,

151
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,149
9000

152
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,290
a month ago as a joke. And now it's not a joke but it's still a joke. But

153
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,500
-- it's just, it's a mess.
-- It's crazy. I,

154
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:44,609
I

155
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,200
don't even know what to say.

156
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,720
Well, I mean, the good news is,

157
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,839
here's the beautiful thing. If Bitcoin becomes,

158
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,739
reaches a million dollars or if it completely craters out,

159
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,140
it's not gonna have a real substantiative effect on the world.

160
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,980
Like, say, you know,

161
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,399
uh losing all the poodles would

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,640
losing

163
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,779
Poodles.

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,910
Yeah. Well, as an example of something we could

165
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:11,500
live without

166
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:11,839
these.

167
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,040
But

168
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,709
so the beauty is like Bitcoin everybody. Well, all the Bitcoin people, of course,

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,989
you know, Bitcoin is essentially the future blah, blah, blah.

170
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,549
Um And

171
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,809
OK, well, to be

172
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,589
blunt, and I think you also stand with me on this. We're going to tear Bitcoin down.

173
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,380
I in

174
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,100
the sense

175
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,149
of like we're not gonna,

176
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,559
you and I are not Bitcoin fan boys.

177
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,690
I, I'm not and I have, I, I remember when I looked at Bitcoin a long time ago,

178
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,929
I mined a little bit of it.

179
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,630
Well, back then, a little bit was a lot today,

180
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,920
but I remember I mined some and I thought

181
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,429
this, this stuff has no future. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

182
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:51,369
And,

183
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,519
and Bitcoin was at, at, at

184
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:57,119
like a dollar, I think it was a dollar or less back then.

185
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,369
Uh Amazon is a company with real assets,

186
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,630
but like back then it was just a bookstore online. Like,

187
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,279
right

188
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,660
now I get like a dozen Amazon

189
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:06,350
here,

190
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,170
here is the deal though. Is I look at Bitcoin

191
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,070
and

192
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,049
it is completely unsustainable in every way

193
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,119
and it is

194
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,369
anyone who understands anything about it knows that

195
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:24,570
it is. We, we are nearing the edge of a precipice

196
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,609
-- where it is. I don't
-- know better than that

197
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,609
is that

198
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,250
it's completely unsustainable and unworkable

199
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,369
technologically politically and even economically.

200
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,169
Right.

201
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,669
-- Yes.
-- For

202
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,469
the technology I think is what, what is the current saying that,

203
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:47,950
that it takes more electricity to conduct one Bitcoin

204
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,630
transaction than your house uses in a month.

205
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,159
And that apparently Bitcoin is now

206
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,190
one of the leading energy consumers in the world.

207
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,530
Um, it's ahead of like something like 100 and 59 countries or something stupid.

208
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:00,679
Um,

209
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,400
but I mean, ok, well, let's start with the technology, right? Because,

210
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,549
or even some like,

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,469
yeah, where to begin with Bitcoin because it's just so

212
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,789
it's such a fundamentally cool idea

213
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,090
that it is just so completely flawed.

214
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,750
You know what Bitcoin really reminds me of is the whole, oh,

215
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,460
let's build a decentralized peer to peer,

216
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,239
internet and bypass everybody and it's like

217
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,090
super awesome, never work also back calls, also technology, also normal people.

218
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,950
But apart from that cool idea,

219
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:27,789
you know.

220
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,190
Yes. So I think it's a great

221
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,989
-- idea. I agree.
-- Technology wise, I, I love Bitcoin. It is actually pretty sweet

222
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,919
but for example, there's like one tiny little problem of like

223
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,690
it can't handle transaction volumes.

224
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,070
It just can't it. And it never will be able to

225
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:49,280
uh

226
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:49,760
because

227
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,150
of the proof of workout.

228
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:53,210
Yes.

229
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,770
Yes. And, and that is

230
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,979
you just hit on like three important points about Bitcoin.

231
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,219
And let's start with the transaction

232
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,299
problem of

233
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,119
the fact that it

234
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,010
forever takes up.

235
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:08,840
The problem is

236
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,530
one

237
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,059
which one should we?

238
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,380
No, I,

239
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,380
I think the biggest problem initially is that the block size is still one megabyte.

240
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,280
Right? Well, and here's the beauty though, increasing that won't really help it.

241
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,820
It, well, not just that is if you understand

242
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,929
how growth works

243
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,010
when you have kind of your exponential growth curve.

244
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,090
If you double something, let's say we go from one megabyte to two megabytes

245
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:40,489
that's going to buy you like days to weeks, not any sort of long term

246
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,690
growth, right? You need to go up by powers of 10 generally.

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,919
So we would have to go from one megabyte

248
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:47,969
to 10.

249
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:52,840
And the these guys can't, they can't even get on board to go to two megabytes.

250
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,340
They're never going to agree to go to

251
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:56,489
Well, and there there are sort of ways around this.

252
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,460
For example, you could,

253
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:00,309
you could effectively have side chains where you have like a private.

254
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,380
So a great example of this is paypal, right? Paypal started out as an online payment

255
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,099
thing

256
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,340
and then ebay bought them and then the beauty was

257
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,940
because ebay is such a big commerce site,

258
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,570
it's big enough to essentially use paypal and kind of

259
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,450
keep money in house in the sense of like,

260
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,260
I put money into paypal to buy something from ebay.

261
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,830
And then that ebay seller, you know, buy something from another ebay seller.

262
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,440
And so the money just sort of sloshes around paypal

263
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,979
and the money doesn't actually like

264
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,190
leave paypal, right? So,

265
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,840
and that's ideally what you want,

266
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:33,780
if you run one of these systems is you want a big pile of money to come sloshing in

267
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,900
and then you wanted to stay there

268
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,320
and just keep sloshing around,

269
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,359
you know, in circles basically.

270
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:40,900
And

271
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,510
that's actually kind of happening with Bitcoin because one,

272
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,979
my favorite aspect of Bitcoin is everybody's like, oh, Bitcoin's over 9000.

273
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,989
I'm like super awesome.

274
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,869
Hypothetically speaking, you have 100 Bitcoins. How do you turn that into cash?

275
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,520
Exactly,

276
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:59,369
man. I, I've been trying to figure that out because I have a couple of Bitcoins

277
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:00,320
and

278
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:01,679
-- it's
-- like a car right there now.

279
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,570
Yeah. And, and I've been thinking about that.

280
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,869
So here's the fundamental problem and, and well, I'm sure touch on these topics in,

281
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
in a bit is

282
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,390
so there are some places you can spend Bitcoin today.

283
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,150
Like new egg is a great example, right? Where new egg is a

284
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,440
when

285
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,539
you're talking about like actually legitimate places where you like

286
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,539
your new egg knew you were spending money there

287
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,950
and the cops knew you were spending money there.

288
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,719
That would be ok.

289
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,280
-- Right.
-- Yes. Exactly.

290
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:28,479
Exactly. Not,

291
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,409
not, you know. Right. Crap on

292
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,460
whatever. Right. Right.

293
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:35,969
Like, like new egg. Right. New egg is a totally legitimate real business.

294
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,059
And in fact I buy tons of stuff from them

295
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,989
all the time. Right.

296
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,510
They can, they will accept Bitcoin legitimately.

297
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,219
But the issue is if I spend Bitcoin,

298
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,780
the IRS is going to come and get me.

299
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,799
Right, because

300
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,059
it's money

301
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,659
and the IRS is starting to

302
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,000
pay attention to this.

303
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,020
And in fact, they, they,

304
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,840
there was an announcement a couple of months ago

305
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:03,219
talking about some company working with them to identify,

306
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,979
uh, basically Bitcoin users. Right?

307
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:08,780
-- Because
-- there's already been a bunch of those and some of them are really cool.

308
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,289
This one guy did

309
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:10,460
a,

310
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,489
essentially they were able to identify people buying,

311
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,419
um,

312
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,489
sex online, like, and other illegal things.

313
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:20,479
Ah, yes, that was with the machine learning or something, wasn't

314
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,359
it?

315
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:22,909
Um,

316
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,289
yes.

317
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,369
And

318
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,070
so here's the point, right is

319
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:29,239
if I buy real things with my pretend money,

320
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:32,770
then I have to pay taxes on it. And I'm actually just holding it.

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,150
I, I actually, I did research in this. I'm ok. As long as I hold it, it's when I try to

322
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:41,969
like stock that in the sense of you don't pay tax until you realize

323
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,809
I would compare it to collectibles

324
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,049
in terms of, because it's going to be taxed at your tax rate.

325
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,059
Not at, like, when you have stock, there's capital gains and

326
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:54,210
things

327
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:54,570
like that

328
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,510
because it's not a financial instrument per se. It's not regulated.

329
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,200
It's basically baseball cards with

330
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,409
magic crypto.

331
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,190
Right. And I've done,

332
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,609
I did a bunch of research in this because I, I, like, I want to understand

333
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:07,719
what the heck can I do with this? All right.

334
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:11,450
So, if I spend my pretend money and I have to pay real money taxes on it,

335
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,729
I'm thinking that's dumb.

336
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:13,729
Right. I don't want to do that.

337
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:14,840
So can I turn you

338
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:15,200
into

339
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:15,419
Bitcoin?

340
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,059
Uh, no, they do. Actually,

341
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,070
they had a fact about that. No, no, they do not.

342
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,710
And,

343
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,349
and not only that

344
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,950
they, they only

345
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:26,340
people,

346
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,460
no, I'm hoping they cut that one off at the pass,

347
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,359
but the other thing they do is they only deal in us dollar denominations.

348
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:37,059
So

349
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,820
they don't care

350
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,979
how many Bitcoin you had. You have to basically

351
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,460
turn that into us dollars. Right. And so,

352
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:48,719
and that totally makes sense. I get that right. It, it,

353
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,619
whatever.

354
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,940
So anyway, the, the issue now is

355
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,210
how can you turn a Bitcoin into real money,

356
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,960
which you could then obviously just withhold part of

357
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,750
the real money to pay your taxes later.

358
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:03,700
-- The first
-- step is not even, well, the first step is turning it into real money.

359
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,489
The second step is actually getting that real money.

360
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:11,169
-- I, I would say those are the same problem.
-- Right. Because it's, it's, I look into

361
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,609
this and there's a lot of places

362
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,479
that will happily convert Bitcoin into cash in an

363
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,059
account somewhere or on a credit card or whatever.

364
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,460
But I'm talking about, like, actually getting them dollar bills in your hand

365
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,219
because let's be blunt

366
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,849
if you redeem for the sake of argument, 100 Bitcoins online.

367
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,650
So, it's about a million bucks now.

368
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,369
Yeah.

369
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,960
I, I actually want to see somebody holding a suitcase with that money in it before.

370
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:36,609
I'm like, actually going to say that yes, they actually got their money

371
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,039
in,

372
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,890
you know, honestly, it's never going to happen.

373
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:47,010
And, and the reason why is related to how we got down this rabbit hole is the fact that

374
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,719
the Bitcoin network just can't handle a high volume of transactions.

375
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:53,250
In fact, I've got a chart I'll put in the show notes

376
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,260
where

377
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,340
you can graph the number of Bitcoin transactions per day

378
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:03,229
and it's beneath 1 million transactions per day on the Bitcoin network.

379
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,809
And it basically hasn't changed in two years because

380
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,080
the Bitcoin network at this point is saturated.

381
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,809
Well, the best part about the Bitcoin network being saturated is

382
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,049
my understanding is there's like these huge blocks of miners

383
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,710
and I mean, China is talking about basically making Bitcoin illegal.

384
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:19,849
They kind of did.

385
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,859
But, but my my understanding is a substantial number of miners are in China.

386
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,169
Yeah.

387
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,260
Um but, and it's, and it's become such a problem the miners, for example, is now that

388
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,049
somebody on Reddit posted a picture, they bought a new video card,

389
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,169
like one of the new Titans or whatever the heck

390
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:38,299
it is that are commonly used for crypto miners.

391
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,429
And it actually had a sticker on the thing

392
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,510
specifically saying that this product is not intended for

393
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,869
Cryptocurrency mining,

394
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:46,830
right?

395
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,820
Because the problem is apparently these people, well,

396
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,169
they run these cards flat out 24 7,

397
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,570
you know, max rate

398
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,250
which, well, honestly, in my opinion, if you sell me a product and I do that,

399
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,609
I expect it to work for at least a while.

400
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,369
But the problem is apparently they like intentionally

401
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,869
damage and kill these cards.

402
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,050
Um You know,

403
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,219
so that they can then get new ones like say a month

404
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,329
or two from now or whatever or a year from now.

405
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,239
I

406
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,140
understand,

407
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:12,209
you know,

408
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,300
these video card companies are seeing like they're taking

409
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,900
a real hit on these returns and stuff because,

410
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,670
you know, these people like, let's face it, right?

411
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,050
Most video cards are meant

412
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,010
well for people to play games on.

413
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,689
Well, and when you mine Cryptocurrency,

414
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,420
most of these guys are overclocking this stuff to death.

415
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,329
I mean, they're not just running the video

416
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,739
cards and

417
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,290
that's 10% more money,

418
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:32,170
literally.

419
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,489
Yeah, but they run super freaking hot. I mean, I remember,

420
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:36,560
I remember I,

421
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,589
I did some mining on a video card for Bitcoin

422
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,160
back when that was like a thing you could do.

423
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:40,839
This was

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
a million years ago.

425
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,000
And man, uh, yeah, I remember that like tweaking over clocking it just, you know,

426
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,589
as much as you could before you started

427
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,800
hitting too many errors to make it worthwhile.

428
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:55,430
Well, the other thing, these guys spend $0 on cases and cooling because that's

429
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,160
why would you spend money on that?

430
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,239
Uh Some of them do. I've seen some pretty nice rigs

431
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,520
and in fact, cooling was always a big deal for me is I made sure I had lots of fans.

432
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,400
I think there was a vice documentary and they showed this crypto mining like

433
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,579
thing in China and it was just, it was a warehouse

434
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,689
with like four or $5 fans

435
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,189
wasn't there at one point there was a fire at one of the warehouses and you could see

436
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,869
on the Bitcoin

437
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,989
kind of whatever the computing power measure is. I forget it has a name

438
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,510
but you could see where it took a huge dip because this warehouse

439
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,790
caught on fire in a significant amount of Bitcoin mining hardware went offline.

440
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:33,880
Yeah. So

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,939
technologically speaking, there's just so many problems and then, I mean, well,

442
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,800
-- no,
-- hold on, hold on before before we go on.

443
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,810
I, I just want to say

444
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,750
so

445
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:44,920
Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Network today is trans

446
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,250
is dealing with less than 1 million transactions per day

447
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,439
to give me an idea. Visa.

448
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,040
They do

449
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,680
100 and 50 million transactions per day.

450
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:56,880
So you're talking

451
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,040
more than 100 times the volume.

452
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,040
Well, and that's just Visa. There's also a, a

453
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,680
Mastercard Discover,

454
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,239
right?

455
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,060
And now we,

456
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:08,349
we also come back to the idea of these guys are talking

457
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,130
about increasing the block size from one megabyte to two megabytes.

458
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,469
When the reality is they need to increase it to 100 megabytes

459
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,390
to start thinking about things in the context of Visa.

460
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:21,250
Yeah.

461
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:23,050
Right.

462
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,939
Yeah.

463
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,290
So, and I mean, here's the thing politically,

464
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,709
I mean, there's already been, uh, well, not already,

465
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:34,180
there's been a huge crackdown for decades now on, you know,

466
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,660
transfers of cash and other legal,

467
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,579
you know, financial instruments

468
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,219
internationally because, you know, money laundering.

469
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:42,140
Right. Like,

470
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:46,459
I mean, just Google Panama papers, money laundering or whatever. I mean,

471
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,619
you know, what, uh, what is it,

472
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,239
every transaction over $10,000 if you're bringing or leaving with more than,

473
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,219
and that's one thing people don't realize often

474
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,420
is it's not just bringing $10,000 into a country

475
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,020
that will get you in trouble, but it's leaving a country with more than 10 $1000.

476
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,380
Here, here's a question.

477
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,739
If I have a Bitcoin wallet on my computer and I, I cross a border.

478
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,199
Am I carrying more than $10,000 with me?

479
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,890
I, I don't know

480
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:14,750
that

481
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,199
it gets to be a fine line because can that, is that a financial instrument per se?

482
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,290
The IRS has said no,

483
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,689
the IRS has said no, but it, it's still, I mean,

484
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,859
and it would fall into holding, like, say a big pile of expensive baseball cards,

485
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:29,250
I guess.

486
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,770
So. You wouldn't have to say yes or no.

487
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,900
But I will bet you money.

488
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,319
If they discovered it, they would confiscate the bejesus out of your lap.

489
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,339
I do not travel with a Bitcoin wallet, but

490
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,000
that would not surprise me if they did.

491
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:43,589
Uh,

492
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:48,959
however, however, the custom forms now that you say it, they do, they specify cash

493
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,130
or cash

494
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,479
-- equivalents.
-- Uh,

495
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,819
I don't recall anyone talking about cash equivalents, but it's,

496
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,069
it's certainly possible.

497
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:57,719
Anyway,

498
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,560
so the, the topic of the, the block chain

499
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,699
is

500
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,040
and I don't think there's much hope in sight

501
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,119
to

502
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:09,069
increase

503
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,290
it's cash or its

504
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,800
equivalent. So it's essentially

505
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,089
cash, cash.

506
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,109
Right.

507
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,189
Right. Right. But anyway,

508
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:15,380
I,

509
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,910
I do not think we're going to see the Blockchain fix itself in the respective volume.

510
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,380
Well, here's more of the point.

511
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,599
You and I are hugely technical people

512
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,189
and I guarantee you you and I cannot

513
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,709
safely store Bitcoins,

514
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,699
which leads to a really great

515
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:35,569
article. It's actually not hard to do. I mean, it's just,

516
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm talking about storing bitcoins securely in a

517
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,250
way where you can also reasonably sanely,

518
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,410
access them and use them.

519
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,969
-- Uh, no, no, you cannot.
-- Right.

520
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,569
You can definitely securely store Bitcoins, like print them out,

521
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,160
put them in a safety deposit box

522
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,479
or you can store them online. So you can actually use them.

523
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,819
But then of course, there's a good chance you're going to get ripped off.

524
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,119
There's

525
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,540
a beauty.

526
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:01,780
Bitcoin is 15 times more expensive to keep safe than gold.

527
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,180
What, why did you come up with 15 times?

528
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:06,560
Did you?

529
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,540
That's the motley fool's number.

530
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,060
Uh

531
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,449
The Bitcoin Investment Trust,

532
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,290
a popular fund for retail investors carries

533
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,349
a management fee of two percent off assets

534
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:21,219
on an annual basis, which, you know, that's a lot of money anyways,

535
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,510
blah, blah, blah, blah,

536
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,060
blah,

537
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:28,260
a new solution from Coinbase costs 1.2 percent of the Bitcoin's value each year.

538
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,510
In addition to an upfront fee of $100,000

539
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,030
the service is designed for institutional investors,

540
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,739
more than $10 million of the digital currency. Wow.

541
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,709
Yeah.

542
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,540
So see,

543
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,089
that's what gets me is I like you and

544
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,910
I know what it would take to securely store Bitcoin

545
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,920
and it's, it's actually pretty easy to securely store Bitcoin.

546
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,780
The problem is you end up doing it offline, which means you can't use it.

547
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,430
Right. Well, and, and not only that,

548
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,680
if, if I stole all your Bitcoin, they're gone,

549
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:01,359
they're gone and there's nothing you can really do.

550
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:05,599
Whereas if I stole a bunch of gold from you,

551
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,680
you could send the police to my house or even

552
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,760
if you have millions of dollars worth of gold, you can't just sell, you know,

553
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,420
you're not going to the pawn shop with a million dollars worth of gold.

554
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,280
Well, remember we covered that in the previous one with that,

555
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,310
-- the guy that was stealing gold from the Canada mint,
-- that was

556
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,295
one.

557
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:26,295
And I will never forget because an old friend sent

558
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,064
me an email and said I just found your podcast.

559
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:30,614
You, I'm you,

560
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:35,104
you made me proud by talking about a guy shoving gold up his ass in the first episode.

561
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:37,214
And I love that.

562
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,224
The only way he got caught the jeweler was like, wait,

563
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,375
this guy is selling a lot of gold and he works for the mint.

564
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,334
-- Maybe I should tell somebody
-- right?

565
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:45,405
Or not the jewelry. Sorry, the bank,

566
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:45,734
the

567
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,275
bank was like

568
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,250
uh

569
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:53,849
any right? And and this is one of the many problems

570
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,930
that come with Bitcoin, right? There's there are tons of them

571
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,040
and I

572
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,890
I in all seriousness.

573
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,290
So I think the thing that's going to do

574
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,410
it in more than any of these other technical issues

575
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,989
is the electricity use because the amount of

576
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,959
electricity is just going to continue to increase as

577
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:14,270
it becomes more popular because the number of people

578
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,229
mining is going to continue to go up.

579
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:19,430
There's there's a pretty much built in technical death spiral at this point.

580
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,219
Yeah, to like you said to electricity usage.

581
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,719
There's also the built in death spiral due

582
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,939
to simple economics of there's a deflationary spiral because

583
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,520
number one,

584
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,099
there's a finite number of Bitcoins

585
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,979
21 million.

586
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,750
So here's the thing

587
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,890
we're gonna have to at some point really start, like

588
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,750
if we're gonna use Bitcoin for say

589
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:43,750
100 years, we're gonna have to vastly increase mining costs

590
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:45,900
so we can keep using it.

591
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,099
Right. And so the intent though of the creators

592
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,569
was that they would generate 21 million coins.

593
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,290
And it's, we're what, like halfway there now, I think,

594
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,439
and

595
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,540
the idea is

596
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,689
you,

597
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:05,219
you have transaction fees where people kind of tack on, like, for example,

598
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:06,939
it's like shipping and handling, right?

599
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:12,219
And you add that to a transaction and that is what the miners

600
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,540
are going to get.

601
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,619
And there's still going to be essentially minting blocks, so to speak.

602
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,550
But the minting a block won't get you any Bitcoin for free.

603
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,819
You're only going to get the transactions contained within the block,

604
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,609
right? And so the problem is if you have a finite number of Bitcoins,

605
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,670
then it's, it's not finite. It's, it's

606
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,750
negative because people are going to lose wallets.

607
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,079
I was just about to say that is that we have a finite number of Bitcoins 21 million

608
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,969
and it's going to be smaller than that

609
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,229
because we've already had people lose wallets.

610
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,349
There's been thefts, there's been uh where, you know, they just,

611
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,150
they can't be spent or maybe not for 50 years,

612
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,300
but more to the point.

613
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,949
Yeah, like you said,

614
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:53,510
people will lose wallets or destroy them or otherwise somehow just

615
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,829
delete them

616
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,339
and they're gone.

617
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:57,369
They're,

618
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,180
well, for the purposes of computation in this universe,

619
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:04,270
-- crypto cracks them. All right.
-- Yeah, exactly.

620
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,189
And then the whole Bitcoin system is broken anyways. But anyway, so

621
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,280
there's a deflationary spiral because by definition, if these things work at all,

622
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,560
they will become more and more valuable as time goes on.

623
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,390
Which means people will hold on to them and not

624
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,329
use them.

625
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,479
And the whole,

626
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,709
not the whole point. One of the major

627
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,380
points of currency

628
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,579
is to

629
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,369
not only store value.

630
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,619
See people always are like store value, gold blah, blah,

631
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,020
blah and cool storing value is not a bad thing,

632
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,239
but the transfer value.

633
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,739
Uh Yes.

634
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,209
Right.

635
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:41,790
-- What the hell is it good for
-- exactly? If you can't spend it, it, it has no value.

636
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,819
I mean, that's the reality,

637
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,180
-- you can spend
-- it if nobody's willing to spend it because they're

638
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,810
going to hang on to it because it'll be worth more tomorrow.

639
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,609
And this I think goes back to like look at the transactions,

640
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,369
there's about a million transactions a day.

641
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:55,790
What happens when you want to buy a loaf of bread?

642
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,459
-- You cannot, it will take only
-- a million people a day.

643
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,969
Get to buy a loaf of bread globally.

644
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,459
That is

645
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:02,329
correct.

646
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:02,810
Well,

647
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,849
and so this is I have also heard Fan Boys talk about the fact that

648
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:11,550
imagine Bitcoin as like the gold standard and then you have other alt coins,

649
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:15,640
-- alt coins being the like gazillion, other cryptocurrencies that
-- aren't Bitcoin

650
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:16,329
and

651
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,609
theoretically in principle,

652
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:20,520
Yes, but

653
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,439
-- deflationary spiral, the whole thing implodes regardless.
-- I,

654
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,650
I know, I, I agree with you 100%. You can't,

655
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,959
you can't have something like Bitcoin being your supposed backing currency. No,

656
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,000
it, it just, it,

657
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,859
-- it isn't how it works and
-- that doesn't get

658
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,209
rid of all the technical problems or anything.

659
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:40,040
Even if, even if the politician said cool Bitcoins allowed, I mean,

660
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,949
there's still the technical issues and the economic issues.

661
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:44,890
Right.

662
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,500
And then, and,

663
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,280
and we still have all these legal issues which I guarantee you are not gonna go away.

664
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,500
Like, I guarantee,

665
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,400
I will bet a Bitcoin

666
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,209
-- the, the global.
-- Do you want

667
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:57,359
to bet?

668
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,699
-- What?
-- Sorry,

669
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,569
do, do you have a Bitcoin to bet?

670
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,380
Oh, yeah.

671
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:02,160
Not yet.

672
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,969
You're going to win it for me right.

673
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,130
Here's the,

674
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,930
anyways. Yeah, pretty much.

675
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,719
Um, but, you know, it's not like the globe is going to be suddenly like, yeah,

676
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,199
Bitcoin.

677
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:12,170
Cool. It's just like, let's treat it like gold.

678
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,040
No

679
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,439
problem

680
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,170
to

681
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:14,709
just not

682
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,750
-- gonna happen.
-- No,

683
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:17,089
it certainly is not.

684
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:19,849
You know, it's like a suitcase with a million dollars in it.

685
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,260
I guarantee you any law enforcement agency on the

686
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,609
planet is going to do one or two things.

687
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,579
One, they're gonna take it

688
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,430
or two, they're going to take it and charge you.

689
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:30,790
Uh, they're gonna take it and they're probably gonna misplace it.

690
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,900
-- Right.
-- Yeah, like, let's face it. That,

691
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,469
-- that was option.
-- Right.

692
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,750
Um, you know, so Yeah, it's just, it's, it.

693
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,819
Yeah.

694
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,780
And,

695
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,030
yeah, I just, I,

696
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,369
I love the idea of these Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies and stuff, but just

697
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,790
they're not going to work.

698
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,790
And the other thing is like Bitcoin is essentially thinly traded. Like,

699
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,530
uh, you,

700
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,209
you can't say they're not going to work.

701
00:28:56,219 --> 00:29:01,280
I think some of the other cryptocurrencies could have potential. I mean, Ethereum

702
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,050
is like a great idea in

703
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,189
the,

704
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:04,185
but again,

705
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,425
when you build a turning complete

706
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,405
-- language into your Blockchain,
-- you mean,

707
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:08,744
like,

708
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:09,155
except for that

709
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,324
time where they said they would never roll back transactions

710
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:14,844
or not a bunch of money, a bunch

711
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:15,005
of

712
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:15,185
Ether

713
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:18,574
and they kind of did agree to roll it back and blah, blah, blah.

714
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:21,244
And it's been what, three times they've done that now.

715
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:25,665
Well, and then there was that programming error where they meant to get around to it,

716
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:26,285
but they didn't.

717
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:28,454
-- So $300 million worth of Ethereum kind of
-- went,

718
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:30,944
didn't they roll it back again when that happened?

719
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,709
Honestly, I don't know or care at this point.

720
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,569
The whole thing, here's the real point, right?

721
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,180
This whole thing is a lot like the world wide web between 95 and

722
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:42,189
99 and that it was the wild west and completely insane and crazy.

723
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,130
Now we're talking about

724
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,229
hundreds of millions of dollars,

725
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,050
-- but
-- we're

726
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,930
not because let's face it. I bet 80 plus percent of these people just

727
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,449
what they have.

728
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:52,939
The IC

729
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,109
Os

730
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,380
So let's get,

731
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:54,920
this

732
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,810
is not Bitcoins,

733
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,020
IC O are

734
00:29:58,189 --> 00:29:59,739
essentially a giant

735
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,069
combination, MLM Ponzi slash, just straight up rip

736
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,550
offs.

737
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,459
I it's

738
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,790
uh this whole conversation,

739
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,900
the craziest coin,

740
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,050
send us your money

741
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,449
and we will send you

742
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,430
some sort of digital currency. Swears these,

743
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,310
yeah, this is not an offer that's

744
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,300
-- anywhere.
-- Yeah.

745
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,140
Well,

746
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,520
we know we need a reason to have the initial

747
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,339
IC O we're going to use synergy to increase your,

748
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:30,810
your investment by a factor of 9000.

749
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,719
We're

750
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:32,339
gonna take

751
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:32,609
your

752
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,140
initial

753
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:33,599
investment

754
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:33,760
and

755
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:33,920
use

756
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:34,260
it to

757
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:34,739
leave

758
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:37,089
the country.

759
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,569
Actually.

760
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,780
What's really funny is I was,

761
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,229
I was talking to my wife about this the

762
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,920
other day where I was explaining this IC O concept

763
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,489
and she basically said like,

764
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:50,180
well, what, I don't understand this, what, what, why doesn't everyone do this?

765
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:53,829
This sounds like a great idea. If you could just trick people out of their money.

766
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,275
I said because like this is how you wake up dead. You know, you can't,

767
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:59,574
you can't keep doing this

768
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:00,755
without somebody.

769
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,954
If you live in some country with a terrible economy where you only make

770
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,375
a couple of 1000 bucks a month if you're like really high skilled.

771
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:08,135
Guess what,

772
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:14,635
man, the IC OS I've seen have been like legitimate people in like the US, right?

773
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,069
Not all

774
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,310
but I saw more than one.

775
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,619
It's, and it's crazy.

776
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,550
Uh What's this one? Um, a

777
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,560
company called Confit

778
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:31,770
raised a small IC O by selling special CFD designed to allow quote,

779
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,800
safe and trust Cryptocurrency payments.

780
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,199
According to IC O drops,

781
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:40,459
they raised their goal of about 400 grand 400,000 us and quickly disappeared,

782
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:41,439
taking the cash with it.

783
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:44,680
The site is currently a park web server that points to nothing.

784
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,900
The apparent founder and former ebay employee,

785
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,599
Evan Thorn

786
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:49,359
Po

787
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,329
posted a message to a confit

788
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:52,689
reddit board claiming that

789
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:56,170
quote, we are in a tight spot as we are having legal trouble caused by a contract.

790
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,520
We signed,

791
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,880
we signed the contract with insurance from

792
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,790
our legal advisor that there was minimal risk

793
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,729
and it would not be an issue. I can't, won't go into details but he was wrong.

794
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:03,589
It is a problem

795
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,530
unquote.

796
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:09,449
-- Right? And, and look, man, even if
-- that's true, it doesn't like

797
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,130
that's 400 grand gone from. I hate to say it but suckers.

798
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,979
Yes. And now

799
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,390
they're pretty clearly in a developed nation given who these people are and

800
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:22,839
assuming

801
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:25,359
that this guy is actually this guy and it's not some other

802
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:25,920
person

803
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:30,709
that's actually true. That could be the case. Let's assume though. It, it is because

804
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,530
I,

805
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,030
you know what, this reminds me of all the Kickstarter where they're like, oh,

806
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,810
we're going to build uh what was that one?

807
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,310
Oh yeah, it's a little box, three inch cube

808
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,359
and it'll laser edge stuff and

809
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,719
no physics. You just can't do that

810
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,239
or like that underwater scuba breathing thing that

811
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,780
like fits in your mouth like Bat Manhattan,

812
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,449
it's like

813
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:50,260
pulls oxygen out of the water

814
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,739
except you'd have to like,

815
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,239
have like several 1000 gallons a second going through to get enough oxygen.

816
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,540
But

817
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,739
the point being

818
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,459
is these Kickstarter are like,

819
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,579
oh, we spent a whole bunch of money on R and D and stuff and that didn't pan out sorry.

820
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,500
And realistically like,

821
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:07,640
what are you gonna do? Audit them

822
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:12,300
and then what you audit them? And you're like, um so like

823
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,020
$50,000 on like beer and Vegas, like, please explain,

824
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,859
you're gonna sue them,

825
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,619
-- you can sue them but like
-- there's nothing to sue.

826
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,939
I, I know, man, it's,

827
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,160
and that's assuming they're even remotely in a jurisdiction that is well behaved,

828
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,829
you know, some dude in Kazakhstan is kind of like, yeah, good luck with that.

829
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,060
Right? Not to pick on

830
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,489
Kazakhstan. I'm sure it's a fine upstanding judiciary, but

831
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,000
realistically contract enforcement in a lot of the world is not super fun.

832
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:46,219
Right? Well, even in the US, it's terrible.

833
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,459
I mean, you have to go through the court system

834
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,239
and, and you have to think

835
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:54,160
if, and, and really this is the way to do it if you're raising say

836
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,680
400 grand

837
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,030
and I assume that split up over a large number of people

838
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,229
fighting the sodium.

839
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,410
Uh I'm, I'm just going to assume right?

840
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,650
And if you're smart, you're going to use more than one

841
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,090
because if if you keep the investment small enough,

842
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,030
it becomes cost prohibitive to actually come after you.

843
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,750
Right.

844
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,100
And so there's, and no, like you're not going to see a class action lawsuit for 400 K,

845
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,750
right?

846
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,989
Is not enough.

847
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,458
Whereas if you had like an IC O that would say, you know,

848
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:26,310
$100 million and you got it and then you took off.

849
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,110
Yeah. Yeah,

850
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,850
you're gonna have lawyers lined up to come after you for that one. Right

851
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:31,790
to the point.

852
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,340
You don't even have to take off.

853
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,040
You just have to, like, provide something that sort of meets the minimum, legal,

854
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,478
viable product and

855
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,639
whatever. Right. I mean, because here's a question. So these I CS

856
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,889
I gave you the digital currency. What more do you want?

857
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,639
Uh, did they though? I don't know if they did. It sounds like that's what

858
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:49,938
drives me

859
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,629
nuts is like,

860
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:52,889
you don't even have to scam people per se.

861
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,340
You can just actually give them the digital crypto

862
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,360
token, do hickeys and be like, yeah, good luck spending these anywhere.

863
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:01,370
Right. Because

864
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,290
part of what makes money work is people believe money works.

865
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,929
-- And
-- that's the only reason money works

866
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,620
well.

867
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,030
And also because you have things like you have certain types of money,

868
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,139
like us dollars where you have the backing of a major government that

869
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,040
so far hasn't, like, done anything stupid.

870
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,500
Like, uh, you know, all those dollars you need

871
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:19,949
there.

872
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:22,050
Yeah.

873
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,030
Well, no, no, I mean, stupid in the sense of like saying like, oh, you know,

874
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,270
all that foreign debt we have.

875
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,090
Yeah, we're defaulting on it. Good luck.

876
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,639
That, that is very true.

877
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:33,094
I've done that. Thank goodness. Um, some other countries have several times

878
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,324
and like, that blows me away that you have like,

879
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:39,665
developed countries with junk bond status for their foreign debt.

880
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,564
But whatever,

881
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:44,645
-- that's not an argument I want to get into
-- because anyway, anyway, I think

882
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:46,485
-- Bitcoin
-- is just

883
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:49,764
not even Bitcoin, but all of these cryptocurrencies,

884
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,405
the, I think the fundamental flaw with them is

885
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,459
is that to be a savvy investor in these things.

886
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,080
The degree of technological knowledge and economic knowledge that you need

887
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:01,850
is

888
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,590
literally over 9000. Like one thing that got me is some Cryptocurrency.

889
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,419
People were talking about how they had all the technology, right?

890
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,330
And it turns out like the financiers just

891
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:12,600
took them for a ride and they're like, who knew that was possible? And it's like,

892
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,810
uh the,

893
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,169
the, you know what they're doing,

894
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,129
-- that's literally their job.
-- Right. Right.

895
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,179
And,

896
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,030
-- and yes, that is, that is one of the
-- tricky things

897
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:28,750
this shakes out and like, literally we like have a government and by government,

898
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,570
I mean, like a proper government like the US, Canada, Germany or something or the eu

899
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,310
backing one of these currencies and like

900
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,520
properly running it.

901
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,780
This, this is just gonna be a,

902
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,639
a wild west free for all which for some people is exactly what they want.

903
00:36:42,649 --> 00:36:43,320
And that's cool.

904
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:48,239
-- You know,
-- maybe I, I don't think you're wrong

905
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:53,800
and it is, it is likely, I think that one of the other cryptocurrencies could,

906
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,080
could accomplish this and, and let's face, it

907
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,620
is

908
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,439
-- already
-- getting there.

909
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:58,399
I, I,

910
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:58,800
the

911
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
-- fact that, you know, the whole
-- Ethereum

912
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,879
Z cash are the two I'm going to watch, but I think Ethereum is

913
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:09,600
going to be difficult long term just because their Blockchain is turn complete,

914
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,439
you can write, turn

915
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,110
complete contracts. And

916
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,629
because of that fact, you will never be able to secure it properly,

917
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,830
which means people are always going to be stealing tons of Ethereum.

918
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,060
-- What
-- this is also true of the world wide Web.

919
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,489
The world wide Web is a security disaster as we've often discovered,

920
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,899
but it creates much more value and

921
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:33,469
it's worth it. It is possible. I, I don't know if, if you're right or wrong.

922
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,459
Let me put it this way, Ethereum handles the transaction volume of visa

923
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:42,189
and there's say for the sake of argument, $100 million a day in fraud.

924
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,030
Now,

925
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,469
my first thought would be is

926
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,389
how much credit card fraud is there

927
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,000
per day? And I'm guessing it's

928
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,489
more than 100 million.

929
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,110
I,

930
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:51,969
you know,

931
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:55,389
I have no idea but I, I'm certain it is

932
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:57,070
substantial.

933
00:37:57,189 --> 00:37:57,300
Yeah,

934
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,429
because the thing that gets me is is,

935
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,149
you know,

936
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,020
we talk about this with self driving cars though is as

937
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,030
Ethereum gets attacked and gets hacked and gets whatever whacked.

938
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:09,679
Hopefully they're gonna fix it and those problems go away.

939
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,320
Whereas when I look at, like, credit card security,

940
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,639
it's like all the same stupid stuff that's been a problem for 2030 years.

941
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,250
Some of it's gotten a bit better, but a lot of it is still a problem. Like,

942
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,530
well, like the US, you have Chip and signature.

943
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:23,959
It's so,

944
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,090
it's so bad.

945
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,479
Well, it's just funny because I realized I have a because I have a US uh

946
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,850
credit card with chip for some reason and

947
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:33,760
corporate thing.

948
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,909
And I was like, oh,

949
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:38,290
I don't know what the pin number is and I was like looking and I was searching my

950
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,429
and then I realized it doesn't have a pin

951
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,360
nope.

952
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,689
And I was like,

953
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,929
I, I had someone ask me the other day

954
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,929
if, if chip and signature is better than swiping signature. I said

955
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,649
yes, but not much.

956
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:58,080
It's, I'm not going to explain it to you, but just, just know it, it

957
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,229
-- is better but it's
-- more than a penny to clone the cards.

958
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,530
Right. It's still terrible.

959
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,810
We need pins.

960
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,360
But anyway,

961
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:11,360
anyway, uh Right. And I don't feel like we've properly addressed

962
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,570
electricity in

963
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,739
this conversation, we mentioned it a handful of

964
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:14,989
times.

965
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,239
-- Yeah.
-- So, so

966
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,540
the beauty of the banking system is they have a strong incentive to

967
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,030
be cost efficient because essentially they're

968
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,860
all cheap skate bastards because they're bankers

969
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,969
-- Right. That's cool.
-- You heard it here, folks?

970
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:30,870
Yeah.

971
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,530
And, but something like Bitcoin, on the other hand, it's a bunch of miners who

972
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,370
essentially get rewarded for being able to

973
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:40,300
do more computation than the other miners.

974
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,870
And one of the

975
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:46,899
basic facts of the current way the world

976
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,020
does, computing

977
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,520
is more computing requires more electricity unless you get better chips and,

978
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,669
and we do get better chips as time goes on.

979
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,080
But generally speaking, it's a level playing field for access to chips, right?

980
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,989
Everybody goes and buys them from Intel or a MD or whoever, right?

981
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,159
-- It's not
-- like uh well, no, not for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is now using as

982
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:08,810
six

983
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,770
regardless. We're hitting the constraints of P.

984
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,489
And what I was going to say is even if you go to special chips, essentially,

985
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,239
there's not some magic chip fab out there that's only selling to one guy.

986
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:22,570
If you have a chip fab,

987
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,520
it's even funnier than that actually.

988
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:29,350
So I did some research into this at one point because I actually, I still have an,

989
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,159
I have an Asic in my basement that I bought a long time ago

990
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:39,919
and it would make me like negative $48 a month or something if I plugged it in today

991
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,340
because the just

992
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:44,479
the power use is too high.

993
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,770
And, but anyway, well, I guess what a lot of these,

994
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,129
these chip fabs are doing for Bitcoin

995
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:54,629
is they build the gear and then they use it for like three months

996
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,050
and then they sell it

997
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,429
because basically the way,

998
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:02,429
the way this works and the way Bitcoin works with the ever increasing difficulty is

999
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,949
your mining gear is good for 3 to 6 months

1000
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,909
and then it basically becomes too expensive to run anymore.

1001
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,070
And so these,

1002
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,080
these manufacturers are basically milking the golden period out of it.

1003
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,189
And then they're dumping it into the market for like,

1004
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,189
it's not like, like there was back in the day,

1005
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,060
apparently the NSA had their own chip fab and, you know, 2030 years ago,

1006
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,570
that probably meant something

1007
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,590
quite amazing.

1008
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,860
But nowadays, like,

1009
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:32,280
yeah, I mean, if somebody can make a chip that they can sell for that kind of money,

1010
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:32,870
they will.

1011
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,899
And so it's in that respect, it's kind of more of a level playing field.

1012
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,030
Let me put it this way.

1013
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,629
Ok. If I had a billion dollars, I could definitely get some, like,

1014
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,110
pretty good

1015
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,830
Bitcoin mining chips.

1016
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,370
But would they be 1000 times better than what's currently out

1017
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,909
there or even 10 times better than what's currently out there?

1018
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:49,179
No,

1019
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:49,449
at

1020
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,550
best, they'd be the same.

1021
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,530
-- Well, or maybe like, 20% better if
-- you're lucky. But I think they'd be

1022
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,550
the same and

1023
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:57,310
that wouldn't matter in a month

1024
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,590
because the, the difficulty workload is increased.

1025
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:01,040
Right.

1026
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,949
Yeah. And that's my point. Right.

1027
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,209
So it's very much a level playing field that way.

1028
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,560
And so

1029
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,989
this electricity usage will continue because

1030
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,469
you got mine more. Which means,

1031
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,989
I mean, until we invent some sort of computation that doesn't require electricity,

1032
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:18,110
um

1033
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,899
like maybe photonic based stuff or quantum

1034
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,219
based stuff that just magically is better

1035
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:24,479
um

1036
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:25,290
whatever

1037
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,780
it's all

1038
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:26,659
gonna do electricity.

1039
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:31,479
But the trick is you need a Cryptocurrency that doesn't need

1040
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:36,320
the amount of electricity your house uses in a month to conduct one transaction.

1041
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,290
-- Right.
-- And see this is the ugly part though,

1042
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,120
there's an economic incentive in the traditional

1043
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:43,100
payment systems to be more efficient,

1044
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,760
more energy efficient, more

1045
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:47,860
just more efficient, more better with Bitcoin.

1046
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,000
There is that opposite incentive to be more

1047
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,030
wasteful because you increase the work factor,

1048
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,189
you more people start mining, more competition.

1049
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,659
So there's that built in thing to be more wasteful and more inefficient

1050
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,280
and that is not sustainable, especially on a global level for like, well, like

1051
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:10,489
a global currency is going to have to handle a lot of transactions.

1052
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,770
Right.

1053
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,110
And, and so here's the thing I keep wondering

1054
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:19,100
is Bitcoin going to die because financial regulators

1055
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:20,919
decide they should kill it,

1056
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,949
which I don't think it will because a lot of these banks and,

1057
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:27,560
and financial investment firms are actually kind of getting on board now.

1058
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,840
Well, more to the point, people will use it for illegal stuff like they always have

1059
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:31,610
and

1060
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,129
ignoring.

1061
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,510
Right. Right. Right.

1062
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,159
But

1063
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,000
I have a suspicion the electricity is what's going to do it in

1064
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,580
it will make it uneconomical.

1065
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,330
And then the question is what happens because somebody

1066
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,729
has to do mining because the whole system is predicated

1067
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,149
off of people doing the mining and the chains to maintain the chain

1068
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,939
with, with.

1069
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,780
And right now you need huge volumes of electricity

1070
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,620
and I don't think that's ever going to change.

1071
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,840
And so the question becomes,

1072
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:00,989
will,

1073
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,350
will the electricity be a problem from a regulation standpoint of you have

1074
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,209
governments and organizations saying like this is

1075
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:11,449
the worst thing for the environment ever

1076
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:14,959
or this is just a stupid use of electricity,

1077
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,139
you don't need to regulate something that bad because it'll just,

1078
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,030
it'll

1079
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,209
put itself out of business.

1080
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,129
And that's kind of my suspicion actually is that

1081
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:29,429
Bitcoin will end up killing itself because of electricity use, like you said,

1082
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,360
it will become too expensive

1083
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:32,370
and

1084
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,010
-- you know, I
-- guess it'll become uneconomical for most people now.

1085
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,280
There will always, but, and, but here's,

1086
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,810
and then here's where we get to the really ugly side of that.

1087
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,159
The, the alternate side of that is, is

1088
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:45,820
as

1089
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:49,760
if you gain more than what is it, 50% of the Bitcoin mining capability,

1090
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:54,530
you kind of can steer the consensus, which means you kind of control the currency,

1091
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:57,600
that is the intent. However,

1092
00:44:57,939 --> 00:44:59,189
I actually

1093
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,550
-- uh uh someone
-- else what happens when this requires 1.62 gigawatts or whatever.

1094
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,629
So, so actually the that is less of a concern actually, JJ Rusnak,

1095
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,179
he's one of the Fedora Red Hat guys, you know,

1096
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,129
and,

1097
00:45:13,649 --> 00:45:16,219
uh, he did a, uh,

1098
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:18,989
like a thesis on that actually.

1099
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,189
And the thing he pointed out and made a big deal about it

1100
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,000
and he and I argued about this at length at one point was

1101
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:34,790
there's no incentive for a miner to exert that kind of control because if a miner

1102
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,389
tries to say

1103
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,229
that,

1104
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,389
uh, or rather if a miner tries to do something shady,

1105
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:44,840
-- you're going to ruin the Bitcoin network essentially.
-- No, I agree.

1106
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,290
And, but the problem is there's a lot of people, if you have 1000 Bitcoins,

1107
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,750
what are you going to do?

1108
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,260
Opt out?

1109
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:52,080
It's, it's tricky man there, there's not a good answer

1110
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:52,610
and

1111
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:52,870
the

1112
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:54,870
normal people aren't going to know about this.

1113
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:55,860
No, no, it's,

1114
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,100
and that's part of the tricky aspect of this is I think a

1115
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,800
lot of normal people probably see the hype and they see Bitcoins,

1116
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,860
you know, on fire invest now

1117
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:09,449
and there's even funds you can invest in that are buying cryptocurrencies.

1118
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,159
And,

1119
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:12,760
and I think that is kind of the real danger now

1120
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,520
is that you're going to have people tricked out of real money

1121
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,570
because they don't understand what this stuff is,

1122
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,379
right? Because they see, holy cow, look at what's going on.

1123
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,010
I need to get in on this now.

1124
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,649
And in reality, this is how nearly every bubble works.

1125
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,020
I mean, we,

1126
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,209
we've seen it countless times where people

1127
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:32,530
invest money into something they don't understand

1128
00:46:32,899 --> 00:46:34,449
and they end up getting screwed

1129
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:37,620
and that's just, that is the world we live in, I think.

1130
00:46:37,649 --> 00:46:39,310
-- Yeah,
-- we're gonna, we'll put a link to Bre

1131
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:40,520
X in the show notes

1132
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,770
if you're Canadian, you know what I'm talking about.

1133
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,310
I have no idea what you're talking about because

1134
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,229
-- I'm not Canadian
-- biggest stock scandal in Canadian history.

1135
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:47,909
-- Bigger
-- than

1136
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,139
the

1137
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:50,729
biggest mining scandal of all time.

1138
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:51,219
A

1139
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:52,889
mining scandal.

1140
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,169
Yeah. They salted the samples with gold.

1141
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,050
The shares went up like way, way, way, way up, turns out there was no gold.

1142
00:46:59,419 --> 00:46:59,860
Oops,

1143
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,919
-- this sounds like a Bitcoin lesson buried in there somewhere.
-- Kurt.

1144
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:06,199
If it's too good to be true,

1145
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,120
it's

1146
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:08,699
either

1147
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,820
something, a new paradigm shift and amazing and wonderful.

1148
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,090
Thank you for that or it is too good to be true.

1149
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:19,800
It's always too good to be true. It is always too good to be true.

1150
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,850
And I think

1151
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:25,969
that is probably where we should leave it. I, I think

1152
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:30,770
so if, if we were going to pretend we're movie critics

1153
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:34,229
and we're going to rate Bitcoin, we're going to give it two thumbs down.

1154
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:38,939
But the trick is even though we're giving it two thumbs down and

1155
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:41,590
we would have given it two thumbs down years ago as well.

1156
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,270
It's still going up.

1157
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,489
And so

1158
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,399
what, what happens now?

1159
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:51,419
And, and this is, this is part of the beauty of predicting the future

1160
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,179
is it is quite possible. We are completely wrong

1161
00:47:55,409 --> 00:48:00,179
and Bitcoin is going to reach like a million dollars a coin which I, I hope it does

1162
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,860
the transaction

1163
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:05,600
volume and value.

1164
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,120
Uh

1165
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:07,889
that would be,

1166
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,379
but here's, here's part of it as well.

1167
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:14,320
This is one of the other things I think about is by keeping volume low

1168
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,629
on purpose.

1169
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,479
Are they artificially inflating the value?

1170
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,040
And

1171
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:24,120
if there's an X number of liquid Bitcoins

1172
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:26,560
to, to sell and use

1173
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:28,080
out of

1174
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:31,000
whatever, how many million, then, you know, by definition,

1175
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,649
if like 10 people want to buy Bitcoin and

1176
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,879
there's only 10,000 Bitcoins available versus the full 10 million

1177
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,600
-- or whatever the number is now, I forgot.
-- It's like 6 million, I think.

1178
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,100
Yeah, then, then

1179
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,360
that's gonna shoot the price way up.

1180
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,080
Yeah,

1181
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:45,080
I, I know,

1182
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,090
I know, man. I don't know. I guess that is

1183
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,120
we, we don't know, we, we, neither of us believe in this,

1184
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,320
neither of us are going to be investing our life savings.

1185
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:55,879
I believe in

1186
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,729
Bitcoin. I just don't believe it's going to be like the panacea that

1187
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:01,379
I think it's going to crash

1188
00:49:01,669 --> 00:49:03,260
and when it crashes it'll be done.

1189
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,020
I, that is my suspicion.

1190
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:08,860
-- I think it's going to fail.
-- I don't think it's going to fail.

1191
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,290
I think it's going to crash.

1192
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,570
I think it's a bubble and it's going to crash.

1193
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,540
Yeah.

1194
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,000
And I'm, I'm comfortable saying that.

1195
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,840
Now the question though is how high will the bubble go?

1196
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:23,739
And I thought, I thought the bubble was going to burst at 300

1197
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:24,820
right?

1198
00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:27,020
I was clearly wrong.

1199
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,340
Traded. It is. And with the behavior, I would guess 20 or 50,000 easy

1200
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,310
before it crates.

1201
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,439
Because the thing to remember is

1202
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:39,199
like stock prices, right? You, you, you have bids and asks

1203
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,639
and just because somebody let me, but it's like,

1204
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:47,360
remember when oil went over $100 a barrel is because this one trader was like, oh,

1205
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,800
it's like 99 point whatever.

1206
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,530
I'm going to be the first trader ever to bid at oil for over

1207
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,239
100 bucks and bid on like 20 barrels or something stupid like that.

1208
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,629
Just so you could say he was the first person to do that, right? And

1209
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,320
what's gonna happen is some financial firms going like, oh God,

1210
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,620
we need these like right now, like, I don't care, I don't care,

1211
00:50:01,629 --> 00:50:03,030
just buy five Bitcoins.

1212
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,600
I don't care what they cost.

1213
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,800
And that kind of behavior is going to bid this thing up because

1214
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,110
the reality is every normal person holding Bitcoin

1215
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,149
at this point. Like at least half of them would have sold at nine grand

1216
00:50:16,669 --> 00:50:19,290
when you're in like somewhere between a dollar and 100.

1217
00:50:19,669 --> 00:50:20,889
Yes.

1218
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,409
Iii I would sell if I could.

1219
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:30,179
And then the thing is, you know, who's going to give you cash for Bitcoin?

1220
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,020
-- I, I
-- maybe there's a crazy person out there.

1221
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,290
We should start a Bitcoin hedge fund, Kurt then then maybe we could get away with it.

1222
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,010
But anyway,

1223
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,050
I think it's collusion now if we do it so we can't.

1224
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:43,919
Uh,

1225
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,949
-- right.
-- Pretty

1226
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,820
-- sure it's also a wire fraud because I'm not in your country.
-- I,

1227
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,189
I bet we could break a lot of laws

1228
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:51,320
-- or
-- something.

1229
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:52,040
Right.

1230
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,330
Anyway,

1231
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:58,879
-- anyway,
-- I guess the moral of the story folks is, if it sounds too good to be true

1232
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:00,739
and there's a whole pile of economic

1233
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:02,889
economists arguing against

1234
00:51:03,229 --> 00:51:03,250
it.

1235
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:05,219
Maybe don't put your life savings in.

1236
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,790
But, you know, if you want to put like 100 bucks in the Bitcoin or whatever. Yeah.

1237
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,469
Go for it.

1238
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:15,229
-- Although now it's
-- been 100 bucks. Even. How much Bitcoin is that? Like 0.0001

1239
00:51:15,729 --> 00:51:18,090
or a percent of a Bitcoin? Yeah, because math is hard,

1240
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,110
right?

1241
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,409
Um,

1242
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,350
yeah, I mean, it's like I do kind of like go fund me your Kickstarter, right? Like

1243
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:25,949
disposable income. Go for it.

1244
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:29,310
But like, please, for the love of God, don't put your retirement into this.

1245
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:32,520
Yes, I will agree with that. I think that's fair advice.

1246
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,550
It's, uh, you know, caveat emptor buyer. Beware, right.

1247
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,320
It's

1248
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:40,879
anyway. Very good. All right, I'm calling it, man. It was fun.

1249
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:41,530
Uh Bit

1250
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,389
point. I'm sure I can't, I can't wait for the hate mail.

1251
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:46,310
I, I, I'm looking forward to it.

1252
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:48,570
So, thank you everybody.

1253
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,040
You can find a link to the show notes on the website, open source security,

1254
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,989
podcast.com.

1255
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,969
As well as contact info to let us know all the things we got wrong,

1256
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,050
which I'm sure there were plenty

1257
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,989
you can hit us up on Twitter and join a Facebook group

1258
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:05,060
and yeah, let us know what you think. I'm certain we got many things wrong.

1259
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,709
Maybe the next episode could be the, uh,

1260
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,030
retraction episode where we just discuss everything we screwed up with.

1261
00:52:11,189 --> 00:52:11,250
Bitcoin

1262
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:12,929
will crater up before

1263
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:13,500
this

1264
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:13,830
episode.

1265
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:18,669
It would be hilarious if that happened and I would still publish it. But

1266
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:18,879
also

1267
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:19,159
pretty

1268
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,810
tragic for a lot of people's life savings.

1269
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,550
I have a suspicion that Bitcoin is going to go up for a lot longer.

1270
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,750
So we will see

1271
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,149
they did. Well,

1272
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,659
-- Kurt, have a good day. You too.
-- Thanks.
