Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 51 with myself,

1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,479
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,380
and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,158
Hello, Kurt. And today we have a special guest with us, Dan Ed Anel

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,489
who is lead cybersecurity engineer from Miter.

5
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:20,620
Can you say hi, Dan

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:21,579
Dan.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,760
Fantastic.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:24,420
Of

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,879
course, silly

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,709
joke.

11
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:30,840
Funny, funny. Yeah.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,889
Yeah. Thanks for having me on.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,689
No, no, we, we're excited.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,229
So, actually,

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,189
the topic and the Reason Dance here is Dan is the guy

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,380
who's kind of in charge of CV E common vulnerabilities and exposures project

17
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,709
at, at Miter.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,220
And so we thought Kurt and I talk about CV, all the time, but why,

19
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,080
why should we talk about CV E when we can

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,970
get someone who's literally the expert on CV E?

21
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:56,689
Uh I wouldn't quite call myself the expert.

22
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:56,990
Um

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,569
And, and I, and I'm definitely not in charge.

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,259
I'm, I'm one of the, I wear many hats in the, in the project.

25
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:04,959
Um My uh

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,639
I have three roles actually.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,069
So one of the roles I do is about a year

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,639
ago I took over working on communications for CD E.

29
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,360
So that's just the general outreach and writing and,

30
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:16,970
you know, publishing sort of thing.

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,480
Another hat I wear is the operations lead. So we have a small team of tech techs who do

32
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:25,440
um

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,430
all the

34
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,430
technical content production type stuff

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,029
and I, I oversee them

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,269
and then I'm also the CN A coordinator. The CNAs are the

37
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,480
CV E numbering authorities.

38
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:42,099
So those are institutions or entities that can assign CV E ID themselves

39
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,279
without having to ask me

40
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,730
for CV ID.

41
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,160
Every time they want to actually do something and

42
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,389
we'll talk a little bit more about that.

43
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,650
I guess my first question would be to back this up a little bit.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,110
What exactly is the Miter Corporation? And why do they, why do they do CV?

45
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,910
So the Mir Corporation has been around for many, many years.

46
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,919
They started out and continue to be a, a not for profit organization

47
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:12,669
that operates a number of federally funded research

48
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,740
and development centers for the US government.

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,910
So those are FFRD CS.

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,899
So we aren't an FFR DC. We operate FFRD CS. Very subtle difference there.

51
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,179
And the idea is that Mir

52
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:26,360
has

53
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:26,649
a

54
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,979
large number of technical expertise in many different areas.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,339
Uh We, we specialize in systems engineering,

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,380
meaning that we take

57
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,080
uh

58
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:43,410
all these skills and all this experience in building large complicated systems

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,100
and help the federal government and state government, local governments and

60
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:51,800
more and more our international partners build these very complicated,

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,759
either technical creations or

62
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,669
organizational creations. So for example, if you have ever used GPS,

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,929
GPS was created at me,

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,970
if you've ever seen in a war movie, one of the a

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,009
wax planes flying by with the big radar dome on top of the radar, you know,

66
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,369
disk on top that was, that was developed at MTR.

67
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,720
So we don't actually make stuff, but we help,

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,080
make the projects happen and we help our sponsors in the government and their uh,

69
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:22,679
the people who work with them

70
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,770
do things better. We are for the public good.

71
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:29,660
That is our, you know, one of our, our, our, our driving forces. So,

72
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,679
you know, we, we are doing all that work in a

73
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,979
not for profit setting because

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,669
unlike other contractors who

75
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,800
for better or worse are in it for the money,

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,130
we're not really in it for the money, we are in it because we believe in the mission.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,539
So I can literally blame you for my phone map not working in London.

78
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:50,130
Sure.

79
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:50,490
Yeah.

80
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,250
Or you could blame the eu because, you know,

81
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,970
that's, it's, they were probably, I

82
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,589
blame the, the narrow roads,

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,149
tall buildings and the fact that it looks like they gave

84
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,589
a child a crayon to draw the map of that city.

85
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,130
So

86
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,339
well, it's

87
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,850
that they let the cows do it

88
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,190
-- anyway.
-- Anyway. All right, cool.

89
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,529
That, that is a fantastic explanation of my, in fact, I've been working with Miter

90
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,209
for a long time and

91
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,488
I didn't know most of those things. So, so awesome. Thank you.

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,070
So, now that we know what miter is, I think the natural question next is,

93
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,559
so what's CV E?

94
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,760
Right?

95
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:31,059
So back in uh back, back in the, in the heyday of, of early internet, back in 1999

96
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,140
the world was, was a little different than it is today in that

97
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,739
there wasn't a common way to identify vulnerabilities between different tools.

98
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,829
This was sort of the root case that caused all this.

99
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,250
So one of our, one of the people working with the Steve Christie,

100
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,500
who is the one who came up with

101
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,239
the CD idea,

102
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,480
he was tasked with

103
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,820
looking at the different scanning tools that Meer

104
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,760
was using for just looking at their own internal systems.

105
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,910
And he noticed that when he looked at one tool,

106
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
it gave a list of vulnerabilities that were

107
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,589
discovered and he looked at another tool,

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,290
it gave a different list of vulnerabilities,

109
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,760
but he had no way of knowing if they were the same vulnerabilities or not.

110
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,839
So

111
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,549
he started asking the question, why is this, why,

112
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,869
why should I have to do all this leg work to

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,130
figure out if this vulnerability is the same as this vulnerability?

114
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,750
Do I have 20 vulnerabilities or only 10 or 15?

115
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,619
So, he

116
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,700
developed this idea with some other people at Miter

117
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,989
and

118
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,100
convinced Homeland Security. It was a good idea.

119
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:33,029
I guess Homeland Security is the primary sponsor behind this project.

120
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,760
So it started out as a minor project,

121
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,589
sort of, we,

122
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,920
we do some internal projects just to kick start some things.

123
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,540
But then when we found the sponsor in

124
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,730
Homeland Security or Homeland Security didn't exist,

125
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,510
then I forget who it was before Homeland Security.

126
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,359
Strictly speaking,

127
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,390
we uh

128
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:49,109
we,

129
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,279
you know, that was the creation of the project.

130
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,269
And since then, it has had the mission of uniquely identifying vulnerabilities.

131
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,130
And once they are uniquely identified, giving them a name

132
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,510
and

133
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,910
using that name as a pivot point around which

134
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,369
tools and other conversations, other research can happen.

135
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,230
So that, you know that when you're talking about a particular vulnerability

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,519
that, you know, you know,

137
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,350
that that vulnerability is what is

138
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,149
different and unique from other vulnerabilities.

139
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,829
OK. So why don't, why don't you explain the name

140
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,589
a little bit because I know actually

141
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,459
it sounds like this should be boring and straightforward,

142
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,579
but the CV E names have actually have

143
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,429
a bit of a fascinating story behind them and, and how

144
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:30,619
that's where we are today.

145
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,339
So you mean the actual CV?

146
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,019
But what does it look like for someone who maybe doesn't know anything about CV?

147
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,609
E like what does it look like?

148
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:40,579
And let's explain what they used to look like versus what they look like today,

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
right? So when it started the, the,

150
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,720
again, the internet was a very different place. Um And the the

151
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,760
understanding of how far this could go was a little different.

152
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,500
So

153
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,640
the original CV ID was

154
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:58,640
CV E hyphen the year hyphen a four digit number.

155
00:06:59,429 --> 00:06:59,880
Um,

156
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:00,390
you

157
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:00,609
should,

158
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,250
they were can

159
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:03,790
as well, not just. Ok.

160
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,500
Yeah.

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,660
So this is prehistory. So

162
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:11,480
originally the way that something was given a CV ID number was that it was,

163
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,079
it was made a candidate

164
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,880
and there was a board that oversaw

165
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,149
the, uh the assignment. So

166
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,450
as opposed to having like an operations group looking at these things,

167
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,649
doing the research and then spitting out the results,

168
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:30,200
there was a board of, of people who had some idea of what vulnerabilities are,

169
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:30,940
how they worked.

170
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:36,040
And that board would vote on whether or not a candidate would become a CV ID.

171
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,809
So

172
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,059
uh the process I believe was something would get nominated to be a candidate,

173
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,929
it would get submitted,

174
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,739
it would get it be assigned a candidate number, AC A N number.

175
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,519
And then they would do what we call counting decisions,

176
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,369
which is, is it a vulnerability per the CV definition of vulnerability?

177
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,119
And

178
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,750
how many vulnerabilities is it actually

179
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,450
uh is it one, is it five, is it two depending on the situation

180
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,290
of the, you know, depending on the details of the bug that they're looking at

181
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,399
and then the board would, would vote

182
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,839
and uh when they voted for something to be given

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,799
us to be, to be given the, the full CD status,

184
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,010
it would become

185
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,609
the CV E version of that number. Instead of the can version of that number.

186
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:24,399
The hilarious part of that is you think about the number of I DS we

187
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,329
have today and if we had to have people actually voting on all of them,

188
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,019
it's,

189
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,200
it's just comical at best. Right.

190
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,289
But again, I mean, we were talking about what,

191
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,000
a couple of 1000 maybe back in the day and now we're,

192
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,409
we're in excess of 10,000 per year.

193
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:41,630
Yeah. And this problem actually, I mean, it's, it's the,

194
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:42,359
the

195
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,369
ridiculousness of it extends not only to thinking that a board of people could do it,

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,239
but that even a small team could do it for all

197
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,570
the possible vulnerabilities that are out there in the world.

198
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,669
And

199
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,409
you know, this has been a problem with CV E since uh since then,

200
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,190
the internet has grown, the number of vulnerabilities.

201
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,289
Well, just the amount of software,

202
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:05,489
the number of lines of code has increased exponentially, right?

203
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,989
The number of vulnerabilities therefore has increased

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,890
exponentially if not at a higher rate.

205
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,630
Um

206
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:16,950
Funny how code works. Um The funding and the staffing for CD has been flat

207
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,140
the whole time,

208
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,510
maybe a little bit of an increase. But in general

209
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,729
CV E today is a team of less than 10 total FTE for all the different parts of CV E,

210
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,880
the number of people doing content

211
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,460
is less than five.

212
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,409
So that's for all vulnerabilities that are out there in the

213
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:42,309
world in every domain that everybody wants everything from an IO

214
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:47,390
device to a skateboard, to a toilet seat, to their computer operating system.

215
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,960
Well, and I think that brings up a good point because, you know,

216
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:53,929
when I first started dealing with CV, it was back in about, I think 2001, 2002,

217
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:54,330
you know,

218
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,429
and you guys covered kind of all the major guys like Microsoft HP Cisco whatever.

219
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,619
And that was fine back then.

220
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,719
But yeah, now literally everybody and everything is a software developer, right?

221
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,559
I can't think of a single device that costs more than 50 bucks

222
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:10,000
that doesn't have software in it to some degree. Now, you know, even

223
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,169
a

224
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:15,109
I think it was Miko, I'm gonna butcher his last name. The guy from

225
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,030
uh oh

226
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:16,900
shoot Mio,

227
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,750
what's his name?

228
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:20,739
Yeah,

229
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,450
he was up

230
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:21,609
in

231
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:21,969
the show.

232
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,369
Yes, he talked,

233
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,070
he gave a talk attended in the Netherlands a

234
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
few weeks ago and he pointed out that IKEA,

235
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,179
right? The the the people who make your cheap furniture, right?

236
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,299
They have a smart light bulb

237
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,039
that based on what he's seen is actually one of the best

238
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,539
designed smart light bulbs out there.

239
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,460
IKEA,

240
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,780
the guys who make, you know,

241
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:46,440
flat pack furniture and really yummy meatballs and cinnamon rolls.

242
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,780
They actually have great coders working on their systems.

243
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,090
Like apparently the smart light bulb is up update.

244
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:57,020
It's pretty opaque to the network, you know, they, it's hard to hack

245
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,409
and that's that's IKEA.

246
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:00,900
Um,

247
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:06,760
and then you have car manufacturers, you have health care devices. You've got

248
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,710
aerospace stuff. Right.

249
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,119
You've got fly by wire airplanes that are completely networked now.

250
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:13,989
Um,

251
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,309
and it's just ridiculous. Uh, the, the, the, the, the

252
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,200
not ridiculous, it's actually wonderful.

253
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,000
Also frightening because there's so much

254
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,940
code out there and so many vulnerabilities

255
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,719
and we need to manage those somehow.

256
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:28,260
Well, and I think Schneer

257
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,200
said it best when he said it's, you know, these aren't just computers anymore.

258
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:31,909
This is a

259
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,330
or rather these aren't cars or fridges anymore. It's a computer

260
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:39,729
that makes your food cold or it's a computer that moves a two ton box of metal around,

261
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,369
you know, at upwards of 60 miles an hour typically.

262
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:43,890
Um So yeah, we,

263
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,960
we've crossed that threshold of like these

264
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,309
vulnerabilities can now very easily kill people,

265
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,869
right?

266
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,140
And I think what's important is that, you know, again,

267
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,000
it's not just about naming the vulnerabilities, it's about managing

268
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:58,539
the disclosure and the hopefully fixing of these vulnerabilities. CV.

269
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:02,429
E is just a small part of the bigger vulnerability management space.

270
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,440
And, you know, we recognize that we're not, we're not the end game.

271
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,919
Some people consider getting a CV ID sort of their goal and that's it.

272
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,280
But really the CV idea is just the start once you've

273
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,099
identified the thing that's when you can actually start fixing it

274
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,739
and managing how that gets disclosed, who knows about it when they know about it,

275
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,419
how it fits into scanning systems

276
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,909
or other risk management processes,

277
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,900
how a company will work with other companies when they

278
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,750
have shared code bases that share the same vulnerabilities.

279
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,940
Um How you can update these things, you know,

280
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,619
the actual processes for firmware updates or software updates or

281
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,270
you know,

282
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,840
whatever all these different pieces come out of

283
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,599
just the fact that there's a vulnerability.

284
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:44,929
But until it's named,

285
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,109
you can't easily collaborate and coordinate outside of your own,

286
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,039
your own infrastructure.

287
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,469
And that's where CV fits in.

288
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,640
So we try to, we try to keep ourselves humble.

289
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,650
Um You know,

290
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,000
we're trying to position ourselves as just a small piece of infrastructure.

291
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,179
But just like if the plumbing went away,

292
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,000
life would become very difficult.

293
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,440
If CV E wasn't here, life would also be difficult or something like CV E

294
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,729
so well.

295
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,890
And I think that that coordinations aspect you mentioned is a

296
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,940
good thing to bring up because I think a lot of people

297
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,380
are blissfully unaware of what actual software is in their devices. And I mean,

298
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,869
um I know we discussed this a few shows ago, well, many shows ago,

299
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,380
but somebody actually went

300
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,400
and apparently figured out got a list of all the

301
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,669
open source software that was included in uh Mercedes cars.

302
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,109
Now,

303
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,070
Josh, you were talking about this, I think,

304
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,849
and it was over 100 pieces.

305
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,849
I remember this. It was, I think it was a proper security research organization

306
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,409
and,

307
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,539
and it was a ton of stuff but it was

308
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,890
also some incredibly old libraries at the same time,

309
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,630
which is, I mean,

310
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,289
it's totally unsurprising because let's face it any time you've got developers,

311
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,489
they basically are going to go to github

312
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,299
or somewhere they're going to pull in what they need

313
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,890
and they're never going to think about it again.

314
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,119
I mean, that's just the reality of how it works.

315
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,429
Yeah.

316
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,989
Well, especially something with the lead time that, you know, of building a car.

317
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,340
You know,

318
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,330
I can't even imagine what the software is like on some of these airplanes where,

319
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,340
you know, we're talking about 1020 year lead times to build these things.

320
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:11,580
Yes.

321
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,710
And now, actually,

322
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,450
I do have some knowledge about that because I know the FAA

323
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,599
has very strict rules about what they will allow on an airplane.

324
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,979
And I believe to date

325
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,380
there is no general purpose software actually flying the plane.

326
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,409
It's very specific and very, very well tested. And in fact,

327
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:29,739
they, they, you have to justify every line of code

328
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,109
in these things.

329
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,070
But of course, there are people trying to soften those rules, which I,

330
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,619
I imagine it will eventually happen.

331
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,340
And so then, yes, someday, uh, Linux

332
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,890
will fly your airplane. So,

333
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:40,619
Linux

334
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,799
and right now,

335
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,950
Linux or some other operating system is probably powering your MRI or your,

336
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,080
you know,

337
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,320
so, you know, it's,

338
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,770
these, uh, these issues,

339
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,869
this vulnerability management problem is becoming literally life and death.

340
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:57,659
Uh,

341
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,580
well, look at all the pacemakers and in fact,

342
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,780
this is what Steve Christie is doing now, isn't he?

343
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:03,909
Is? He's working on the meds

344
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,099
stuff and,

345
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,510
and talking to him and just paying attention to what's going on.

346
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,020
It's like,

347
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,940
I hope I never need anything implanted into my body

348
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,260
ever because I don't want that crap in me.

349
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,890
You hear about the pacemakers and the insulin pumps and it's just,

350
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:17,940
it's madness.

351
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,099
Yeah, that, that whole community is, is some of them are aware of it.

352
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,880
Some of them are blissfully unaware of it.

353
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,119
Um The ones that are aware of it are trying real hard to bring

354
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,520
the standard up.

355
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:32,479
But in general it seems like and I talked to Steve, he's probably said this, you know,

356
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:32,729
they,

357
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:33,789
the whole meds

358
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,719
environment is probably 15 years behind where the internet is today where the,

359
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,119
where the it environment is

360
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,469
and

361
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,719
considering the difference between not getting your

362
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,940
email and not getting your insulin.

363
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,150
You kind of wish it was the other way around.

364
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,510
Yes, I will agree with that.

365
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,929
Ok. So anyway, let's move on to happier topics.

366
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,080
So we've kind of talked about CV E what it is.

367
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,409
We understand why it's useful. I suspect.

368
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,270
So I guess the question now is, let's say I'm a guy

369
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,169
with a project on github

370
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:09,080
and someone says, I think I found a security issue in your thing. What, what do I do?

371
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,520
Now,

372
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,309
right, let's say I want a CV E ID. What now?

373
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:13,880
Alright. So

374
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,030
getting a CV ID is much easier than it used to be.

375
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,659
Um and it's very so it's the the

376
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,239
the easiest method

377
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:26,559
is you go to our website, we have a web form that was put up last year

378
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,340
CV E form.miter.org.

379
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,070
And of course, put a link to that in the show notes

380
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,989
and you fill out the information that's requested on the form.

381
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:41,880
And if what you've sent us is enough information that makes it clear that this

382
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,219
is a unique vulnerability or looks like it's going to be a unique vulnerability.

383
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:47,299
We send you the CV ID right back

384
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,650
now that CV I at that point, depending on the information you give,

385
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,369
you've given us may or may not show up in our database.

386
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,460
So getting the CV

387
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,880
is one part of it,

388
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,559
having it published in the database is a second part of it.

389
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,859
So

390
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,040
what you need to give us in order to get

391
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,910
a CV ID comes down to some very basic information,

392
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,699
but it's important information because again,

393
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,449
we need enough information to know that this

394
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,420
is a unique vulnerability and not just us,

395
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,270
anyone who is consuming the CV database.

396
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,709
The CV list has to know that they are looking at something new

397
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:24,260
and they have to understand what the implications are of that new vulnerability.

398
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,219
So

399
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,108
we need to know

400
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,219
the product

401
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:31,469
seems straightforward, but we sometimes don't get that.

402
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,339
Let's clarify this one though because

403
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,530
you say product, but doesn't necessarily mean you're a company selling something.

404
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,339
You can literally have a project on github

405
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,739
and that could be the product in this instance. Right.

406
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,209
Absolutely. Yes. Products a bad term because of that,

407
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:46,869
um,

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,989
where the product is the term we use. But yes, it's whatever

409
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,630
software that you're dealing with, whether it be a library

410
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,000
or a piece of hardware or you know,

411
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,680
an operating system or some component of an operating system, you know,

412
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:05,040
it's up to the person writing this up to be as specific

413
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,239
as they need to be as far as what exactly it is that

414
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,780
has the vulnerability in it,

415
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,010
the more specific, the better obviously,

416
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,689
along with that is versioning,

417
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:15,959
we need to know if it's affecting a particular version,

418
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:20,770
everything before or up to or after a particular version, right?

419
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,459
That versioning information is important because CV acts as a snapshot

420
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,380
in that we're not continuously updating this information.

421
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,060
If somebody comes to us and says this needs an update,

422
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,819
we will update the information in the list.

423
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,770
But if somebody is looking at a CV entry from five years ago and it says

424
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,069
all versions of this software, well,

425
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,239
does that include all versions up to the point when it was published or all

426
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,104
that have come out since then

427
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,074
you wouldn't know.

428
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:47,775
So you need to give some kind of,

429
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:51,155
you know, again, the more specific, the better it needs to indicate where,

430
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:55,505
you know, where on the timeline of that, of that software's life cycle.

431
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:00,645
You are actually saying everything is affected as of this time in this way.

432
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,079
Um So product inversion

433
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,010
and then

434
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,319
a general understanding of what the problem is. Now,

435
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,959
we usually, when we publish CV entries, if you look at CV entries, you, they,

436
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:20,000
they usually are of the form flaw in product version of software

437
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,989
um

438
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:22,719
creates

439
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,310
an impact

440
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,400
when

441
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,439
a certain attack happens.

442
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,199
And that's the form we like, that's the cognitive information we need, we need,

443
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:34,479
we like to see again what the flaw is in general.

444
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,310
Uh

445
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,599
Let's

446
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,979
OK. Great, great. So buffer

447
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:39,680
overflow cross

448
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,030
scripting. There's, there's

449
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,790
CWE, right. AC we

450
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:46,430
is the type of law which is a common weakness enumeration, right?

451
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,530
We do, we do well, you know, we,

452
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,599
we're that close relationship with the government and

453
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,989
the military. Uh the

454
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,790
um

455
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,869
Yeah, and CWE actually is a great shortcut for that if you,

456
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,910
if you can nail CV E or CWE to it,

457
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:05,329
that again, that gives us a lot of information that we need right there.

458
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,479
Um We also need

459
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,920
a reference CV I DS can only be published in our list.

460
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,239
If there is a public reference for them,

461
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,489
we will not publish something in our list unless there

462
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,579
is a reference A URL that we can include,

463
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,699
that says the information that is here in

464
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,500
this CV entry

465
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,689
is also out here at this public reference.

466
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,189
What can that public reference look like? It could be a

467
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:34,430
advisory, security advisory.

468
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,770
It could be

469
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,939
a

470
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,089
patch note, it could be a,

471
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:41,430
um,

472
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,030
a code update

473
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:44,750
uh

474
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,869
as long as it's public and it includes

475
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,630
at least if not more, hopefully the information that you've given to us,

476
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,699
that's, that's good enough for a reference.

477
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,959
So C DS, therefore, I'm not used for things like,

478
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,079
uh let's say you've internally, let's say you're a company

479
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,900
and you are developing your software and you find a bug

480
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,119
and that bug never goes public.

481
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:09,329
That shouldn't have a CV idea. I know Kurt will have a discussion about this,

482
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:09,589
but

483
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:15,770
this is a matter of debate in the board right now, but, but this is how this is,

484
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,140
this is what we're saying right now.

485
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:17,819
Um

486
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,050
-- So
-- one thing to keep in mind for our listeners is like

487
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,260
CV E has a bunch of rules and a bunch of processes

488
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,540
and these have changed drastically over the years and they continue to evolve. So,

489
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,329
you know, because part of, you know what the reality is,

490
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,989
the software environment has also continued to evolve and change quite a bit.

491
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:35,640
You know, I,

492
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,689
I would not have guessed that I would have software on my light bulbs 20 years ago.

493
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,119
Right? I would have thought you were crazy.

494
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,319
Um

495
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,880
And, well, I still do, but, you know,

496
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,469
you would be wrong

497
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,920
all the while through all that evolution,

498
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,819
we also need to create some sense of order and consistency

499
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,810
in what's in the database. So

500
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,310
the data, the CB list is going to change over time, like the,

501
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:01,949
the, the how it looks, what information has in it that will inevitably change,

502
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:02,670
but

503
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,780
it can't change so dramatically that it will

504
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,410
cause the consumers of the CBD list problems.

505
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,670
And that's, that's the balance that the CD E team is constantly trying to,

506
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,300
to keep is we want to be responsive to what

507
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,390
people need and to the evolving nature of vulnerability management.

508
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,650
But

509
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,020
people are expecting it to look a certain way to

510
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,989
sound a certain way to taste a certain way,

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,339
right?

512
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,040
It's the new Coke problem, right?

513
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,050
If we change things too quickly and in a really bad way, people will reject it

514
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,079
and you know, we don't want that we want it to remain useful,

515
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,099
but then you can bring back the old one and be the hero.

516
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,319
See, I, that was

517
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,530
a

518
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,589
or,

519
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,760
or, or, you know, we, we did it,

520
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,579
we did it so that we could find a cheaper way

521
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,920
to do it because there's that whole corn syrup conspiracy.

522
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:45,729
But

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,089
anyway,

524
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,060
but uh

525
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,510
yeah, so um so it's tough.

526
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,920
It's, it's a, it's a difficult problem because we do have so many stakeholders,

527
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,130
you know, we, we, we look at

528
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,119
if you consider all the stakeholders

529
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,150
that are involved in this project, you've got

530
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,650
our government sponsors, the people actually paying for it.

531
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,599
You've got

532
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:03,359
um

533
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:05,599
the software vendors who are

534
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:06,219
uh

535
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,380
have vulnerabilities that they're trying to manage the

536
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,270
software vendors who are using our information to

537
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:13,270
um

538
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,939
to load their scanners or their, you know, other databases with information.

539
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,790
You've got individuals who are looking to

540
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,310
use CV E or, or derivative of CV E to understand their risk.

541
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,359
Um You've got uh researchers who are

542
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,180
trying to find vulnerabilities and everything and,

543
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,189
you know, trying to,

544
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:36,959
you know, some of them are maybe doing it to try to make a name for themselves.

545
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,219
Some of them are doing it because it's the

546
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,959
right thing to do and that's what interests them.

547
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,040
Um

548
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,479
You've got the press who again, you know, because CD acts as a pivot point,

549
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,579
the press needs to know that they are all talking about the same thing too

550
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,109
when they are having these public discussions about, you know, oh,

551
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,729
there's a flaw in Xy and Z.

552
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:55,640
Um

553
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,959
So we've got all these different people,

554
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:02,380
all these different entities that need stuff out of CV.

555
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,219
And that's a lot to joke,

556
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,479
but we're trying.

557
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,599
Um

558
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,989
So

559
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,310
I, I, and then one other thing before I lose, lose the thread,

560
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,239
what you need to submit CD ES.

561
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,469
So I said the product, the version, the type of vulnerability

562
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:18,380
of reference and then

563
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,449
a description.

564
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,479
So this is, this is the biggest change that's happened in the last year

565
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,329
up until this past year,

566
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:32,400
all the descriptions you saw in the CV E list were written by the content team at CV E.

567
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:34,000
Uh

568
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,630
There is an analyst who would sit down and write it up

569
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,010
and then submit that into our C MS.

570
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,150
So every single

571
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,989
vulnerability that needed to be published had to be handcrafted.

572
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,689
And obviously, that does not scale.

573
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:53,459
And that was one of the big reasons why CV was falling behind on requests.

574
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,349
We'd have lots of people sending requests in

575
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:59,229
and they wouldn't hear anything back because we had this immense backlog

576
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,109
and that was just bad and

577
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,589
probably, you know, bad planning.

578
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:04,420
You

579
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:04,790
guys,

580
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,810
you guys have pretty much cleared out the backlog now and you, you know, CV,

581
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,140
assignments are happening pretty quick.

582
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,380
Well,

583
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,739
let me rephrase that well formed CV E assignments are happening pretty quickly

584
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,180
because I've run into this problem with the DWF

585
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,959
as well where I've had people request CV S

586
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,589
with very little or mangled information and then they get very upset with

587
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,959
me when I don't give them a CV right away because I'm like,

588
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,819
I don't understand this. You need to explain it better,

589
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:30,400
right? And that's it. They have to explain it. Now.

590
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,709
There we are, we are asking people when they submit CV ID requests as you are

591
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:39,900
with the DWF to give you to include the description, description writing is,

592
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,739
is surprisingly hard

593
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,160
um for a number of reasons, one,

594
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,550
not every like right now CV E is exclusively in English

595
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,109
that's going to change. By the way, we're heading toward a direction where

596
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,869
we can handle unicode.

597
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,510
We can't right now.

598
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:59,579
Um But in general, you know, analysts in the CBE team only speak English,

599
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:00,790
only read and write English.

600
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,630
So they, we haven't been,

601
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,089
had to have the capability to support any language other than English

602
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,719
as we allow people to write their own descriptions

603
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,869
as long as they are following the guidelines that we've set.

604
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:15,760
If you are a Spanish software company

605
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:17,510
and you want to

606
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,099
publish a CV ID for your,

607
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,280
you know, software that's only used in Spain

608
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,319
and it's only in Spanish,

609
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:25,829
you can do that. Now,

610
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,189
um the CV entry might show up in our directory as in Spanish,

611
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,270
but then

612
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:34,109
you know your public, the people who actually need to see it,

613
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,280
they will be able to understand it

614
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:38,020
because it's, that's who your, who your customers are.

615
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,699
Um where we've, we've been working with Japanese,

616
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,390
the

617
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,030
Japanese government through JP CERT CC for a number of years.

618
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,750
And they are starting to bring in more Japanese companies for the same reason to,

619
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,349
to give them more access to CV E

620
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,859
and they are going to be

621
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:57,589
publishing in Japanese once our database is ready for it.

622
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,410
Um

623
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,000
So that Japanese only software

624
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:05,880
can be covered by CV and the public in Japan can utilize

625
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,719
the information that we are publishing without having to translate it.

626
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,380
So um that description writing,

627
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,949
it's putting a little more of the burden on those who are submitting information,

628
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,300
but the benefit is more information can get in there from

629
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,550
a more diverse set of people and it can scale better.

630
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,780
Well, I think it's also part of the maturing, you know,

631
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,880
aspect of the information security ecosystem, right?

632
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,599
Like if you look back 20 years ago,

633
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:35,239
the number of people that had the skills to research and request A CV

634
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:39,459
was maybe a couple 100 now, you know, it's well into the thousands, right?

635
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:43,959
There's tons of people doing good research and requesting CV S that are like,

636
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:48,479
I, I've actually had some CV requests that are like so well formed, I almost cried

637
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,449
like they were just amazing,

638
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,270
you know,

639
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
um I just,

640
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,689
I'm recently dealing with an issue where a security vendor

641
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,359
found something and like the security advisory they wrote up

642
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,670
was like eight pages long. It was super detailed.

643
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,959
They had, you know, like it literally you read this advisory and it's like, oh,

644
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:07,760
I completely understand this issue now,

645
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:08,640
you know.

646
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,489
Um So that's one thing I'm finding is I think it's

647
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,329
ok for us to start raising the bar now because,

648
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,560
you know, everybody's getting better at this

649
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,719
and you know, as more countries develop different legal,

650
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:26,469
you know, reasons to do vulnerability management, right?

651
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,550
What they will need to include in advisories,

652
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,079
what they'll need to include in things like CV, that's going to be different

653
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,819
all over the place. So one size will not fit all,

654
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:36,150
you know,

655
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,640
the EU will have certain standards or individual countries

656
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,020
in the EU will have their own standards.

657
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,630
The US is developing their standards, but it's probably going to be more on a

658
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,150
uh a domain level like health care will

659
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,880
have standards and automotive will have standards,

660
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,069
but there won't be an omnibus standard for everybody.

661
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:50,910
Um

662
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,900
You know, and so we need to be flexible, we need to allow for,

663
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,449
for that and there needs to be a common bar below which we don't fall.

664
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:58,800
But

665
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,569
from there, we should be able to accommodate

666
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,099
anybody who needs to use this kind of resource without

667
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,810
in a way that they don't have to rebuild it. You know, we're not saying we're the best

668
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,319
out there.

669
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,109
Um

670
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,709
But we're saying we have this infrastructure, let's use it

671
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,109
and let's make it better.

672
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,410
So let's say, for the sake of argument, our listeners are now really gung ho on CV.

673
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,510
They want to get their CV S

674
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,459
so much so that they may want to become what's called a CV numbering authority.

675
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:28,099
-- How would they go about that?
-- Right. So the CN A program,

676
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,430
so CNAs are

677
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,979
entities, as I said before, they're entities that can assign their own cvs.

678
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,760
Why would they be doing this? Well,

679
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,380
if you're,

680
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,229
let's say you're a company and you have a vulnerability management

681
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,390
process that you follow at some point in that process,

682
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,489
you'll want to assign a CV ID to vulnerabilities that you found

683
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,489
in the past. You've had to go to Mir,

684
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,719
ask for the CV ID.

685
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,150
Um, let's assume that we're, we're doing it in a timely manner.

686
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,560
You'd get the CV ID back from us and then you'd be able to move forward from there.

687
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:01,209
Wouldn't it be easier if you just had a block of CD I DS

688
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,930
just, you know, 1015, 20 of them,

689
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,229
depending on how many vulnerabilities you think you'll have.

690
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,000
And you could just take one off the stack and put it in there.

691
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,410
You can put that all into a nice automated system.

692
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,530
It would all just be, you know, work magically.

693
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,969
That's the idea is that we are trusting these people

694
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:17,869
to

695
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,650
assign CV S per the rules that we have called the CN A rules.

696
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,540
And in those CN A rules are the counting rules that I mentioned earlier.

697
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,560
And as long as they're following those rules, we give them a block of CV IDS,

698
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,140
they assign them

699
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:37,109
and they describe them and then when they're ready to go public,

700
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:40,079
they just have to send us the information that we need

701
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,420
in the format that we need

702
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,119
and it gets published,

703
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,869
we should speak briefly about the counting rules because I think

704
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
that's probably the most complicated aspect of all of this.

705
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,050
And without question, the most confusing for a new person.

706
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:53,770
Yes,

707
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,859
So what is the vulnerability? Josh, what's a vulnerability?

708
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,020
It's whatever I say it is Dan. And I will take no arguments against that.

709
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,300
Kurt. Kurt. Kurt,

710
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,500
what's the vulnerability?

711
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,020
Whatever Josh says? Right. Kurt.

712
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,439
Well, so for the purposes of what is a CV E vulnerability, I've typically gone with,

713
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,229
um

714
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:15,170
the,

715
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,130
the sort of the lowest common denominator is that it

716
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,930
needs to be something that has a negative impact and

717
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:23,880
is trigger

718
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,290
or controllable by an attacker.

719
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,849
So, for example, we can't just, you know,

720
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,770
if you have some random race condition that just

721
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,040
happens and the server crashes once in a while,

722
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,209
you know, and there's no way for an attacker to influence that behavior.

723
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:38,790
That's, that's not really a security flaw, it's just a regular old, you know,

724
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,250
your software is terrible flaw.

725
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:41,739
Um So that,

726
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,810
that is generally what I've gone with as

727
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,369
my framework for defining what is a vulnerability.

728
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,410
So

729
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:51,030
you two are, are slightly divergent in your definition

730
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:51,969
of vulnerability.

731
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,050
The question is who is right? If Josh is the one editing the podcast, he's right.

732
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:57,849
Um

733
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,910
So,

734
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:00,699
but um yeah,

735
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:02,280
but this is the problem.

736
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,329
You go to, you go to 10 engineers, you're going to get 12 answers as far as what?

737
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:10,729
So how do you decide what a vulnerability is? Well,

738
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,119
if you say that, well,

739
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,630
anything that anyone says is a vulnerability is a vulnerability,

740
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,089
you're going to have arguments, especially

741
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,500
when you're dealing with things like PC I

742
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,410
compliance or just any audited compliance exercise where

743
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,599
the auditor says, well,

744
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:29,550
this says you have 50 vulnerabilities and you look at it and go well,

745
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,849
that's actually only one vulnerability and we took care of it like yes,

746
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,849
but you have 50

747
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:34,530
right?

748
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:37,290
So people, if you, if you're,

749
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,390
if the understanding of what the vulnerability is, is,

750
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,239
is not clear or what the implication of a vulnerability,

751
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,800
not all vulnerabilities are equal.

752
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,939
Um You have these arguments,

753
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:48,810
you have these discussions and this problem has been

754
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:52,000
discussed in academia for years continues to be discussed.

755
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,489
There are many definitions for vulnerability

756
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,270
CV ES definition for vulnerability is

757
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,939
the counting rules.

758
00:32:59,079 --> 00:32:59,689
So

759
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:05,729
inside our CD E rules document or CN A rules document, there is the appendix C again,

760
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:08,369
we can link to the rules document and appendix C.

761
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,619
We have all of the CV, the counting rules for for assigning a CV ID.

762
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,050
The first section is what we call abstraction

763
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,260
abstraction. Is, is it a vulnerability

764
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,500
in the past? This is more complicated today. It's a little

765
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,810
simpler. There's really three tests.

766
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:27,449
The first test is if the developer of

767
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,989
the software says it's a security vulnerability,

768
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,250
it's a vulnerability.

769
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,640
So that that one's easy, right?

770
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,780
If Microsoft says this is a security vulnerability, then it is

771
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,339
and we're just, and that's just the positive case, right? If somebody says it, if a

772
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:46,079
developer of the particular bit of code says it's security vulnerability,

773
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:46,599
then it is,

774
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:51,619
let's say that they don't say it's a vulnerability or there's no, no answer there.

775
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,079
So then the next question is, does it show that there is a uh uh a

776
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,479
security

777
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,839
boundary that is crossed because of this

778
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,959
bug?

779
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:02,439
Right?

780
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:05,329
There's an unintended consequence from this bug that

781
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:07,280
showed that a security boundary has been,

782
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,600
has been breached.

783
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,759
That one's a little trickier, right? Because then it's a matter of, well,

784
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,509
what does that mean? What does it mean to have a security boundary um broken?

785
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,309
Sometimes it can be very straightforward, sometimes not,

786
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:22,768
we just recently had this come up in a private discussion where,

787
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:27,228
you know, this one set of set U ID utilities can be used to escalate to root and it's,

788
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,967
you know, it's a very fine line with set U ID utilities

789
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:30,868
is,

790
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:31,739
you know,

791
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:35,309
is doing stuff as root sort of a security breach

792
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:37,099
or not when we're talking about set U ID apps,

793
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:37,309
right?

794
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:37,539
And

795
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,040
yeah, it, it got a little bit hair splitting.

796
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,739
But um so yeah,

797
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,739
it can definitely get a bit complicated there as to what is a security boundary,

798
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:46,789
but it, it, you know,

799
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,248
you can at least sort of think of it in those

800
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,789
terms and it helps whittle it down a little bit.

801
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,569
So, you know, that abstraction thing, I mean,

802
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,819
that's usually that's the biggest argument, right?

803
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:58,668
Because you have a vendor who says something isn't a vulnerability and you have, or,

804
00:34:58,678 --> 00:35:00,468
and a researcher who says that it is,

805
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,530
it's hard to know who's right. Um

806
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,449
So

807
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,389
I'm, I'm, I'm looking at the actual rules here, so I want to get this right.

808
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,649
So the first question,

809
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,989
it's so obvious, right?

810
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:13,429
It's so

811
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:13,959
obvious.

812
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,689
-- So it's
-- actually

813
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,540
quite simple.

814
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,500
It is and it isn't right. It's simple. Once you accept that this is how you do it

815
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,110
again, we're not saying this is the best. We're not saying this is the only,

816
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,320
but we're saying this is the one we use consistently.

817
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:30,679
And that is that's important having that consistency

818
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:34,370
because so for example, there are other vulnerability databases out there.

819
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:37,280
And if you look at the number of vulnerabilities that they have identified,

820
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,469
it's typically bigger than CBES,

821
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:42,639
the number of them is bigger. So why?

822
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:47,199
Well, one is maybe they scaled better and they can process these more quickly. OK.

823
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:47,840
Fair.

824
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,250
Uh Another argument might be that they have looser guidelines

825
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,949
as far as what one vulnerability is versus five vulnerabilities.

826
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,260
And a good example there is we had a customer report like,

827
00:35:58,449 --> 00:35:59,219
you know, they,

828
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:00,649
they claim to have found dozens of

829
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,590
cross site scripting vulnerabilities in a product.

830
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,459
And it was just a single function, right?

831
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,409
That had multiple, you know, that processed multiple text fields.

832
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:09,610
And so in the cases of CV E,

833
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,360
that would be a single vulnerability, right?

834
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,419
Because there's that single underlying root cause even though there's, you know,

835
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:17,370
multiple avenues of exploitation like essentially a whole

836
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,340
pile of text fields in the web interface.

837
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,820
There's just that one underlying, you know,

838
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,540
um

839
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,659
function that just needed a, you know, an escape for HTML when it output

840
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,209
data, right?

841
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:33,459
And so that's a good example of where the actual person requesting it

842
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,780
was effectively trying to get one CV E per like text field,

843
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,909
right? Because they wanted a big pile of CV S

844
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,399
um you know, because they're an auditor, right?

845
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,659
So they wanted a big pile of CV S to show their clients,

846
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:45,219
right?

847
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,719
And, and so, you know that again, it's, it's, it's a, it's a tight walk,

848
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:54,459
a tight rope that we're walking, trying to, trying to balance these things between,

849
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:57,840
you know, completeness, but also just definition,

850
00:36:58,169 --> 00:37:01,810
we're going with this definition and it, it, it's not the best definition,

851
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,699
it still leads to some ambiguity,

852
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,560
but it, at least we feel is good enough and it's good enough to,

853
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,800
to wrap the rest of the program off of it.

854
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,449
And again, this has evolved since the beginning.

855
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,120
This is much simpler than it used to be.

856
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:14,929
Um

857
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:19,629
So you've got the counting rules which include things like, is it a vulnerability?

858
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,479
Is it independently fixable? Um Which is another thing if, if,

859
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,739
like you were saying,

860
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,149
you know, there might be a situation where it manifests a number of times,

861
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,239
but you fix it in one place in the code and it's fixed everywhere.

862
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,199
That is a single vulnerability,

863
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,129
um

864
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:39,340
if it's a part of a shared library or protocol, that's a factor.

865
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,919
Um We need to, you know, understand how it

866
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:42,870
uh if

867
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,229
it should be a separate vulnerability or if it's

868
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,389
in a vulnerability that's some in part in,

869
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,750
in like that shared library.

870
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,750
So if there's already a vulnerability for the shared library,

871
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,560
should you sign a va separate CB ID for

872
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,879
software that uses that shared library?

873
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:59,520
So a great example there Dan is heartbleed,

874
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,080
which almost everyone knows about right?

875
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,479
Heartbleed was basically one CV E ID.

876
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:07,840
That's right. Although I think heartbleed actually got two accidentally

877
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:13,580
due to a due to a communication and coordinate issue. But

878
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,280
yeah, but that would be

879
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:14,629
that,

880
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,780
that right? It makes sense that it's one CV ID because it is one

881
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,659
vulnerability, it manifests in

882
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,219
hundreds of thousands of software, however many software packages we're using it,

883
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:26,540
right?

884
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,260
But using us that,

885
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,179
you know, had that vulnerability in it.

886
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,500
So um

887
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:32,080
yeah,

888
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,129
so that's, yeah, that's an excellent example.

889
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:35,870
And I, I think that that, I mean,

890
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,439
because that's one thing I run into a lot with a lot

891
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,909
of people is CV E stands for common vulnerabilities and exposures database.

892
00:38:41,129 --> 00:38:43,739
And so it primarily tracks vulnerabilities and exposures,

893
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,389
but people forget that it also tracks the fixes, right?

894
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,110
When a vendor says here we release this update that fixes this CV E,

895
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,719
you know, we're, we're tracking the fix.

896
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:56,479
And so one thing to keep in mind too is that CV is not just, you know, for the,

897
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,659
the vulnerability portion of the vulnerability,

898
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,540
but also for the fixed portion of the vulnerability.

899
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,760
And so, yeah, I mean, that's, that's something I've taken into account, you know,

900
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,639
where we've had.

901
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:06,780
Um

902
00:39:07,129 --> 00:39:09,360
I remember there was one really weird case where it was actually

903
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,879
two distinct like CWE vulnerabilities fixed with like one line of code.

904
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:18,050
And so then it becomes like, well, is that like one or two vulnerabilities?

905
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,560
It's got one fixed, like, you know what's going on here, right?

906
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:22,989
Um Actually we just had that at Alastair

907
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,800
where we had a security issue that was basically one fundamental flaw in the code.

908
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,760
It was literally one line of code,

909
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,169
but there were two very different.

910
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,209
In fact, we were, we were tracking them as two separate issues and then we realized,

911
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:37,090
holy cow, this is,

912
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,409
this is the same thing even though they looked incredibly different

913
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,250
when you were actually trying to exploit it.

914
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,510
And funny enough, they were independently identified as well,

915
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,000
which made it and at the same time, totally different things.

916
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,689
Same fix, right? So see the ID for them both.

917
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,540
That's a good, actually, that's a tangential topic.

918
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:53,580
I,

919
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,469
I think I've talked with you Dan about is what's the upper

920
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:59,129
bound for how many CV S A piece of software can have?

921
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:02,419
And I was working on the hope and assumption that it would be at most.

922
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:05,360
Hopefully, one CV per line of code.

923
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,489
And apparently that assumption is wrong.

924
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,659
Well,

925
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,659
so,

926
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,719
right. So um

927
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,510
so, I mean, I guess the question is there, I mean, does that fall into the whole split,

928
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,429
merge decision?

929
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:17,260
Right.

930
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,129
Um

931
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,139
So CV E has, if you look in our, in our list, we list,

932
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:26,770
there might be some entries that have that say they have been split or merged.

933
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:28,719
So a split is where you have a single CV

934
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:31,330
ID that actually turns out to be multiple vulnerabilities.

935
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,860
And so it

936
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,969
gets split,

937
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,149
you have

938
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,090
multiple vulnerabilities that are

939
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,600
that we merge together into one

940
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,929
uh for, for some reason. Uh

941
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:44,570
And then you have the duplicate,

942
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,520
the idea of there being two CV ideas that are identical,

943
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,629
they are exactly the same thing and then, you know,

944
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,929
one wins over the other and there's a whole logic tree for who wins in that case.

945
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:58,590
So, you know, in this elastic problem was example,

946
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,929
it could be a duplicate or it could be just a merge, right? Two different

947
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,939
22, the same vulnerability that manifested in two very different ways

948
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,010
and had two very different. Um

949
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:10,479
uh Was it, was it two different

950
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:11,550
uh

951
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,199
uh impacts

952
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:14,399
uh no,

953
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:19,959
the impact it sort of it was it involved um user permissions and one involved doing

954
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:24,520
an operation to kind of become a user with higher privileges and the other was just

955
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,389
an operation on data.

956
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,280
But fundamentally, it was a logic error in the way we decide

957
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,350
what kind of permissions a user has.

958
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:34,879
So it was a single

959
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,719
route,

960
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:38,800
but they looked very different

961
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:42,729
in terms of what was happening and, and what the bad thing was that was going on.

962
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,080
Yeah, see II I now

963
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,399
I'm sure

964
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,080
this, this would be a great thing to debate, right?

965
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:51,679
So the question is, what is the debate matter?

966
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,629
I did email you and you told me one is fine. So

967
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,199
don't be getting me in trouble here. No, no, no, no.

968
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,840
Well, what I mean by debate is that you could sit down, I mean,

969
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:05,179
that answer came after debate after we discussed it internally and sort of look

970
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:06,560
at, figure it out, right?

971
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:11,260
So the question is really for you and elastic is so the next time this happens,

972
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,520
will you be consistent?

973
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,860
Yes. Oh, that, absolutely. And that,

974
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:15,689
you know, I,

975
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,850
I've been doing CV ES for longer than I can remember and consistency is key, right?

976
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,370
Even if you're wrong, as long as you're consistently wrong, you're at least that,

977
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:25,239
that's better than being random.

978
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,639
Right. That's right. And that, that is exactly right.

979
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,189
So these, these counting rules,

980
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,729
again, there's still a lot of weight room in these things.

981
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:32,729
And what, what we,

982
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,550
what we especially like about having CN A is that they take

983
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,040
these rules and hopefully they're going

984
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,770
to build them into their internal processes

985
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:43,399
and if a company is worth its salt, it's going to be doing things consistently,

986
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:44,649
you know, mature organization,

987
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:46,570
they have processes and procedures that they follow

988
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,719
because that's even if they are wrong,

989
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,000
it's how they do their, their job. Right.

990
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,060
And so you get an output that's, that's predictable

991
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,395
and that's what we want. These are the starting point. CNAs

992
00:42:57,564 --> 00:43:01,425
and we'll go back to them when we have to think through a problem where there,

993
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:02,725
there might be an inconsistency.

994
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:04,824
But if you're consistently inconsistent

995
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:08,074
with a certain set of rules, you know, for example,

996
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:10,655
there are some companies who will only assign CV I

997
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:14,104
DS to things that they consider to be critical.

998
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:14,945
OK.

999
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,909
So strictly speaking in the CD rules, that's not quite right.

1000
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,860
It should,

1001
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,179
they should be assigning to any vulnerability and

1002
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:25,530
it shouldn't matter on the criticality of it.

1003
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,879
That is not a factor in counting criticality is not a factor

1004
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,370
C CBS S score is not a factor.

1005
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,139
It is strictly the, the, the facts about the vulnerability on a technical level,

1006
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:38,070
not the risk that's inherent in there.

1007
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,469
But if the company is consistent in

1008
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:42,830
doing that and their customers are expecting that

1009
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:46,110
it makes it harder for us to say they're wrong

1010
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,540
because the market does drive a lot of this v

1011
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,870
you know, again, we're just part of vulnerability management.

1012
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,030
We want to encourage proper vulnerability management practices

1013
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:58,750
and we try to do that with our rules. But at the same time,

1014
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:01,830
who are we to say to Microsoft, you're doing your job wrong.

1015
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:06,129
Well, that brings up a good point because we've also had some recent debate about,

1016
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,350
you know, traditionally CV S are for issues that are public

1017
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,510
and there are some vendors that have flat out said, you know,

1018
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,780
if somebody reports an issue to us and we fix it, we'll assign that A CV.

1019
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,669
But if we internally find an issue, we will not assign a CV.

1020
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,669
You know, we'll just quietly fix it and go about our way.

1021
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,229
Um, or another vendor that would, you know, essentially with the logic,

1022
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,229
apparently of, well, it has an auto updater.

1023
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,699
So you're gonna be forced to update. So we're not going to give it a CV.

1024
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,620
Um You know, and so we're obviously the board is having some debate over, you know,

1025
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,179
what does public mean now.

1026
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,540
Um So these things do evolve a bit and

1027
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:36,870
I,

1028
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:38,889
I think one of the key pieces though is to

1029
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:43,000
start educating consumers of these software and CV S,

1030
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,780
you know, that maybe,

1031
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,389
maybe they want to ask

1032
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,709
their vendors to do more CV. S or, you know, or quite frankly, maybe

1033
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,510
a lot of these orgs will probably be quite happy without CV. S, right?

1034
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,459
Because, you know, once

1035
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,790
I've had the experience of like,

1036
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,550
literally you can know about a security flaw and that's great.

1037
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,929
But the minute it gets a CV, it starts like a 30 day countdown clock, you know,

1038
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:03,709
for the organization to deal with it.

1039
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:05,639
And, you know, and so they, in,

1040
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:08,110
I've had literal cases where people report issues and they

1041
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,830
kind of don't want it to get a CV until,

1042
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,610
like the very last minute because then

1043
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,060
they don't have to deal with it till then, you know. So

1044
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,780
that's something to keep in mind for our listeners is

1045
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,729
that there's a lot of different organizations wrapped around CV,

1046
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:20,510
both on the

1047
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,399
producing CV. ES

1048
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,179
uh and consuming CV S side.

1049
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,959
And a lot of them have different, you know,

1050
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,600
process and political motivations for kind of

1051
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:33,429
wanting CV S early or wanting CV S later or not at all.

1052
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,760
Or, you know, wanting a lot of like, I actually had one open source project argue,

1053
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,239
they wanted more CV S for like, they,

1054
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,729
they had like three issues and they wanted one issue split up into like four things.

1055
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,250
And I was like,

1056
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,800
that makes no sense at all. Right.

1057
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,629
But they wanted a lot of CV S to show that they were fixing them quickly,

1058
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,620
which is, and then you have companies who are like, well, if, if we have a lot of CV S,

1059
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:56,030
it shows that we have vulnerabilities in our products and that's bad,

1060
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:56,899
right?

1061
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,110
And then the company next to, but then the company next to them will say rightly, no,

1062
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,929
it means that people are finding the vulnerabilities

1063
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:06,020
and that you're fixing them as opposed to if

1064
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,489
we don't know about them somebody else is

1065
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,179
exploiting them and you don't know about it.

1066
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,719
There is

1067
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:09,899
a,

1068
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,850
there's a line of,

1069
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,899
if you're above the line,

1070
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,739
you have too many CV I DS because your software is terrible. Right?

1071
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,209
And if you have zero, that's kind of the same problem.

1072
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:25,459
It's that, that magic middle, that, that we need. Right? Some CV E I DS are good.

1073
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:27,219
Too many or none are bad.

1074
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:27,939
Well,

1075
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:29,679
and part of the thing to remember about this too

1076
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:31,520
is we don't have very good data for this.

1077
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,879
I mean, for number one, you know, security issues tend to be, you know,

1078
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:37,840
it's we don't have a good sample size because these things are self selected,

1079
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,489
self reported.

1080
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,570
Some companies kind of bury them quietly.

1081
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,260
Um The other thing is we don't have really good data on, you know,

1082
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,250
when are these issues actually reported versus

1083
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,909
when do they actually get fixed and released

1084
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:48,770
combined with severity, right?

1085
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,679
Like if you take a week to fix a low severity flaw, like great,

1086
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,530
like kind of that's actually pretty good versus, you know,

1087
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,889
you take two years to fix a high severity flaw.

1088
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,429
Well, what if that high severity flaw is very complicated and was found internally,

1089
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,360
you know, it is very difficult to explain. That's

1090
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,860
so that's one thing, I mean, I know Stephen Christie has given talks on this,

1091
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,239
you know, about how your, all your security metrics,

1092
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,239
especially if you base them on CV, are completely wrong.

1093
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:11,989
That's right.

1094
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:12,479
Yeah,

1095
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:15,340
it, it is one indicator of a, of a bigger, uh,

1096
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,679
sort of health measure.

1097
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:18,560
Um,

1098
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,040
I think it, actually this makes me think of cholesterol.

1099
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,629
Um,

1100
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:24,870
because I'm kind of hungry. Um, but, uh,

1101
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:28,189
but no, there's, there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. Right.

1102
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,229
You can't, you, you know, you hear, eat a low cholesterol diet.

1103
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,280
Well, yes and no,

1104
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,110
you're supposed to have a certain level of certain types of cholesterol, right.

1105
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,520
And even a little bit of bad

1106
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,760
cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you're unhealthy.

1107
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,560
It just means you have a little bit of that. Right.

1108
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,800
When it gets too high, that's a problem. The good cholesterol gets too low.

1109
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,639
That's a problem.

1110
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:49,580
So, I think, you know, that people have come to understand that

1111
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,780
hopefully they'll, they'll think of

1112
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:54,439
vulnerability disclosure in the same way.

1113
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,189
Well, to me, the biggest part of CV is,

1114
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,959
you know, if an organization

1115
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,929
like, does CV, that means that they have a pretty high, you know,

1116
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,699
minimum competency standard.

1117
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,959
Right. Because you basically can't do CV S without having some sort of security team

1118
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,120
and some sort of security process.

1119
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:15,050
And then even more ideally, you know, if that vendor is a CV numbering authority,

1120
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,080
that means they're, you know, even more competent.

1121
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,419
Um, and so, for me, you know, when I see these vendors that have zero CV.

1122
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:23,810
S or don't even know what CV is, it's like, oh, dear,

1123
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:26,310
you know, do you have a security team

1124
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:26,639
at

1125
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:29,550
all. You know, that's, I start to wonder things like that. And

1126
00:48:30,379 --> 00:48:32,760
so I, I think that's one thing is, you know,

1127
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,260
people need to understand that CV is a good indication of security maturity, right?

1128
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,820
Especially if they're being fixed. If there,

1129
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,689
if there's a ton of CV S in a product that have never been fixed,

1130
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:43,169
that's also a good indication that maybe, you know,

1131
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:45,139
things aren't so good with that product,

1132
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,719
right?

1133
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:48,919
And I think a good, a good example of what you just said is that there are a number of,

1134
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,100
of national level um

1135
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,360
uh uh processes that have started that will include as part of it

1136
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,229
CV assignment. So,

1137
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:01,879
uh again, you know, J PC has been involved with this with us for a long time,

1138
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:05,370
but Korea and Malaysia are both actively building out a

1139
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:09,169
vulnerability disclosure process that is rooted in national law,

1140
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,040
not just sort of best practice, but actually in the books

1141
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,000
of how vulnerability should be disclosed by vendors within their country

1142
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,620
and how that's all going to get administered.

1143
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:22,689
Um The EU is working on similar things in different countries. So,

1144
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:26,360
you know, there there's that understanding that this is,

1145
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,729
this shows maturity, this shows that you're actually,

1146
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,889
you know, doing the right thing and doing,

1147
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:34,540
you know what's best for your business and for your customers.

1148
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,969
So it's crazy man. And then to CV E is like the one ring that binds them all then

1149
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:39,989
it's U PC

1150
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:40,239
code.

1151
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,010
That's

1152
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,219
awesome. I like my analogy better.

1153
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,570
We, yeah, and, and the CN A program, one of the, the,

1154
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,270
the way we're hoping to scale it is, is speaking of, of

1155
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,979
models, you know, you've got your,

1156
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:55,260
your uh

1157
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,000
uh ISBN number on books, right?

1158
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,500
Those are given out by a central authority,

1159
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,370
but they are not individually given out for each book that gets published.

1160
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:06,989
A block is given to a publisher and the publisher takes those and publishes them.

1161
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,229
So we're doing the same thing on the national level.

1162
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,570
So individual vendors might have their own CV ID.

1163
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,439
Uh The Netherlands might have a block that's given

1164
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:16,239
to them and then they distribute it out.

1165
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,270
Kurtz DWF has a block that they're given and they distribute that out.

1166
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,129
Um

1167
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:22,989
So, you know, with that,

1168
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,179
that helps federate out the operations of this so that we scale better and again,

1169
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:29,979
it's more flexible, more people can do it the way they need to do it

1170
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:30,850
well.

1171
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,120
And it's also important just so our readers don't get

1172
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,879
or our listeners don't get the wrong idea is that,

1173
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,840
you know, there,

1174
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,540
there's a difference between the governance model and the operations model.

1175
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,280
So the governance model is very much

1176
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:43,310
similar to DNS because quite frankly, that works and that works well.

1177
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,939
You know, we have these hierarchies like

1178
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,800
JP Cert does Japan, which makes sense because I don't speak a lick of Japanese.

1179
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,580
And I'm also asleep whenever they're working.

1180
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:51,760
Um,

1181
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,340
conversely on the operations model, you know, we have a lot of,

1182
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,629
sort of cross communication and

1183
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:01,229
in fact, currently I believe, well, we even have two individuals,

1184
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,949
Josh Pressers being one of them and Larry Cash

1185
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:03,929
being the other

1186
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:04,729
who

1187
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:07,250
uh, exist as CNAs

1188
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,129
in multiple hierarchies or Josh maybe. Yeah.

1189
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,290
Well, because technically you're an individual CN A

1190
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:16,419
-- and AC N A with an elastic,
-- right? I'm AC N A with TWF, not with miter,

1191
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,989
but yeah, elastic is also AC N A with lighter.

1192
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:19,379
So,

1193
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:19,860
so

1194
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,159
the thing to remember is, you know, it's, it's, for example,

1195
00:51:22,169 --> 00:51:24,850
Josh exists in these sort of two hierarchies, right?

1196
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,469
On the one hand, you exist in the elastic CN A and

1197
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:30,909
also in the DWFCN A hierarchy or, you know, Larry cash

1198
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,399
dollar who exists in the miter hierarchy and also the DWF hierarchy. So,

1199
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:36,270
um

1200
00:51:36,919 --> 00:51:40,219
well, like most things in life, you know, we've, we've learned that we have to,

1201
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,739
you know, where the boundaries get drawn is kind of squishy and, and messy,

1202
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:45,260
right? But

1203
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:48,629
like you said, there's also we, we're trying to keep that separate as we,

1204
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,860
as we grow this thing, that's an administrative boundary and that's there because

1205
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:54,479
there needs to be lines of communication and escalation

1206
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,090
if there's a problem or if there's something,

1207
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,500
you know, we need to communicate whatever

1208
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,739
the operation side we're definitely pushing toward a more peer to peer model

1209
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:05,219
where people are, can can submit things directly.

1210
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:07,750
They don't have to necessarily go through a chain of command.

1211
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,830
They might need to if like it's a national level, Cert,

1212
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:11,709
the,

1213
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:16,229
the all the people in Japan might want to go through JP Cert because

1214
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:20,110
JP Cert told them to and JP Cert certainly wants that for reporting purposes.

1215
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,540
But then, you know, that's their decision.

1216
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,570
Another country might say, yeah, just send it all to me

1217
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,219
directly and we don't care, you know,

1218
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,139
so that you know that we don't,

1219
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:32,899
we don't want to have this hierarchy and this structure

1220
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:35,530
weigh everybody down from being able to do the assignment.

1221
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,090
It's more the

1222
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:42,209
training and documentation and best practice, you know,

1223
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:44,330
learning the best practices and communicating

1224
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,750
and knowing who you can talk to when there's a problem,

1225
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,570
that's where the administrative structure comes in.

1226
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,899
So it's again like all of this is very hybrid

1227
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:53,840
and we're going to see how it goes.

1228
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:55,290
Awesome.

1229
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,320
Alright, I think it's it's time to bring it home, Dan,

1230
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,899
do you have any any parting words for the audience?

1231
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,080

00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,889
how best to get you involved with the program?

1239
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:30,770
Fantastic.

1240
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,330

Hashtag We have links to Twitter.

1244
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,520
I'll have a link to Dan's Twitter probably in there

1245
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,840
so you can follow him and ask him silly questions

1246
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,649
and we have a Facebook group.

1247
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:51,760

1248
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,669
thank you so much.

00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:56,310
This has been a fascinating conversation. Kurt, thank you as always everyone.

1250
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,600
