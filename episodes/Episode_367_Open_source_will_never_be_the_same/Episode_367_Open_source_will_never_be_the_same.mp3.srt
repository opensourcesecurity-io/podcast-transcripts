Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:12,920
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime and totally not evading sanctions.

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,549
-- Josh Pressers,
-- have I ever evaded sanctions? You know, so I have, I was it a sanction?

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,010
I don't know.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,489
So I have a story, I will tell that I don't think I've told on the podcast before.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,799
Is this going to be one of those stories?

6
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,424
Is it going to be replayed in a court of law at some point when you're on the stand?

7
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:30,764
I'm certain the statute of limitations has passed on this.

8
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:31,475
But

9
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,095
the first time I went to Germany ever,

10
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:38,345
I had a friend who is like, I would like you to bring some

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:42,965
-- Alberto beef jerky with you.
-- Oh, that's not sanctions. That's like, that's,

12
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,540
you're not allowed to import meat into Europe because of

13
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:45,979
ma

14
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,409
we'll get to that, right? And I'm like, ok, sure. So I'm like, how much do you want?

15
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:53,040
He said, I literally want as much as you can bring. And I thought, ok,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,849
I never,

17
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,500
I've never been to Europe. I didn't think twice about this.

18
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:02,500
So I put a ton of it in a suitcase, right? Like a lot. And as we're landing in Berlin,

19
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,949
they play a video and they're quite explicit in the

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,199
video that no meat products are allowed in Germany.

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:07,809
And I'm like,

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,059
I'm going to go to jail, like, I have a suitcase full of meat products

23
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:15,790
and I'm sitting there thinking like, what am I going to do?

24
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:19,949
Should I like, throw this away? Should I tell them what's going on?

25
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,139
I'm, I'm, I'm like freaking out, right?

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,319
And

27
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,260
now mind you an important aspect of this that

28
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:29,230
I did not realize prior to going to Germany is

29
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,459
my heritage is very German.

30
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,699
And so like when I would walk around in Berlin,

31
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,830
everyone would just speak German to me assuming I was

32
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:39,500
a German citizen because I look like a German citizen.

33
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:43,349
And so I'm standing in line waiting for the customs guy and I'm like,

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,660
I'm just gonna open the suitcase and be like, take it like you, I'm sorry,

35
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:47,190
I didn't know.

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,410
And I'm standing there and standing there and standing there

37
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,199
and all of a sudden the guy looks up at me and he goes, you can go and I'm like, thank you.

38
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,180
And I'm like, like, be cool, be cool, like be cool.

39
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:00,400
And I was like, as soon as I got out of eyesight, I'm like,

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,889
I've never run through an airport so fast in my life and

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,300
then I get there and I give it to the guy,

42
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm like, did, you know, I'm not supposed to bring this.

43
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:06,699
He's like, oh,

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,600
it's fine. I logged a complaint with the government. This should be legal.

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm like, no, should be, is not the answer here. Like, no,

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,399
you, you knew I shouldn't have brought this.

47
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,220
-- I'm pretty sure
-- this should be legal is not,

48
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,500
we're not a valid defense in a court of law.

49
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:22,570
I know.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,539
But anyway,

51
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,899
that is my, I guess sanctions story and, and

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,550
not sanctions. But yeah,

53
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,720
you get the point anyway

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,119
anyway.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,410
Oh my goodness.

56
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,979
-- Well,
-- and that actually reads us.

57
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,300
I've been thinking about this because open source travels across

58
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:41,429
borders in a way that almost nothing else does.

59
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,729
And I don't mean it just like people pull it down and

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,770
use it but people embed it and people like it goes everywhere.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,070
And so there's this story where I PM I tools.

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,369
So I PM, I stands for intelligent platform management interface.

63
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,100
And it's a fancy way of saying instead of going to the

64
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,929
server and plugging a keyboard and monitor and a mouse into it,

65
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,080
wouldn't it be nice if you could do that over the network?

66
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,520
Is even when the things turned off.

67
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,399
So you could like turn the server on and like have bias level access,

68
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,669
install an os tweak it, fix it. Yeah.

69
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:15,210
Well, that's what I PM I does because when you have more than about 50 servers

70
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,449
you need I PM I

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,639
and if you have like 50,000 of them

72
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,139
you really need I PM I

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,320
anyway

74
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:28,210
uh so I PM I tools is, well, it's I PM I tools and it apparently got,

75
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:32,119
-- what's the word I want to use? I'm totally spacing out. Suspended,
-- the suspended.

76
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,130
-- Yeah, like archived
-- the get up account of the author,

77
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:35,960
the author

78
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,500
and everybody of course is like blah, blah, blah. Why?

79
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,389
Well, and the simple answer is sanctions compliance.

80
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:46,070
Like he works for a company, it's a Russian company

81
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,759
that um apparently is involved with the import

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,710
of tech that's being used for weapon systems.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,270
So that company got sanctioned.

84
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,080
So his account is sanctioned.

85
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,740
And I, and I feel like on the one hand, this is a giant nothing burger of, you know,

86
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,059
company gets sanctioned.

87
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,139
Employee, get sanctioned sanctions, take place, you're not allowed to do that.

88
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,259
But it does raise some interesting questions sort of from a risk perspective

89
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,460
because on a related note,

90
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,860
we have Docker

91
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,070
basically saying

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,209
the free teams thing is cool and all.

93
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,029
But uh you got 30 days to either start paying or get your data out of here.

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,640
And then my understanding is once that 30 days passes,

95
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,769
if you don't get your stuff out,

96
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,269
then you have 30 more days to actually download

97
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,929
it and then they're going to delete it.

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,140
-- So you have like 60 days from a few days ago to get your stuff out of there or
-- pay.

99
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,790
There's another piece to the Docker story is there also, like if you're there,

100
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,750
there's no

101
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,829
what, what I

102
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,829
I may get this wrong.

103
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,760
But my understanding at this moment is if you are like a truly open

104
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:45,859
source project,

105
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:49,549
you may apply for like an open source license.

106
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,010
But if you are like one of those pseudo open

107
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,429
source projects where you're maybe backed by a company

108
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,359
or you're, you're using your open sources consulting or things like that,

109
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,640
then you have to pay them $300.

110
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,440
Yeah. And it's the consulting thing. So like technically curl

111
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,299
wouldn't make the cut off because he does consulting for Curl.

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
A lot of projects do this.

113
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,269
Yeah. Right. It's very common. So a lot of projects won't technically.

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,350
Yeah, because I mean, you could just make millions of dollars doing this. It's crazy

115
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,309
and by millions of dollars we mean tens of dollars.

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Ok.

117
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,250
So I want to start with the the sanctions thing because I think

118
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,890
there's another piece to this that we don't talk about very often.

119
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,149
Another thing we're starting to see in the open source universe

120
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,029
is

121
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,630
the question is coming up of, for example,

122
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,910
do any developers who work on this software

123
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,109
live in China?

124
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,720
And obviously there are like governments of the world that

125
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,209
aren't particularly friendly to China for a variety of reasons.

126
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,429
And so they asked this question and now when they work with a vendor,

127
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,739
they will ask the vendor is any of the software

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,350
in your product of Chinese origin or Russian origin or,

129
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:59,350
you know, pick a country that the, the, the United States government doesn't like.

130
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,309
-- Well
-- and stupid question.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,149
But what exactly do they mean like would a Chinese national working

132
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,109
legally in America with a green card count as Chinese origin?

133
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,910
My understanding is no,

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,769
they specifically want software that originates from China because I think

135
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,910
NVIDIA got in trouble for this where they had software from.

136
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,049
I don't even remember what country it was now.

137
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,070
This was like years and years and years ago.

138
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,350
I I if I'm recalling correctly, we get the point

139
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,769
is we have historically ignored borders and open

140
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,480
source because let's face it on the internet.

141
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,079
A border is a meaningless construct.

142
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,100
But we are now reaching a point

143
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:35,660
where these huge governments and these huge companies

144
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:39,070
are basically, they've lifted the window shade and they're like holy crap.

145
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,600
Where did all this open source come from?

146
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,670
And they're starting to ask these questions like, where did it come from?

147
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,589
Who wrote it?

148
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,670
Does it use certain encryption algorithms? Maybe that are on our don't use list?

149
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,420
Does it? You know what I mean? And so

150
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,260
I feel like this is almost a new era of open source we're entering

151
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,570
where the companies are starting to ask the questions.

152
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,420
And now we have to figure out like what does this mean

153
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,299
in the broader sense of open source and risk appetite

154
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,299
and securing our software and securing our infrastructure and like it is

155
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,739
an enormous elephant to eat.

156
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,500
Yeah.

157
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,500
Well, and I'm not sure

158
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,380
that

159
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,369
we can, because I, I've been thinking about this, like,

160
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:22,209
in the S

161
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,829
bomb context, wouldn't it be cool to have an S bomb? That's like your bill chain?

162
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,730
So that, for example, if you're dependent on a Docker container that is

163
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,190
maybe going to go missing in a month or two because, you know,

164
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,980
it's part of an open source project that can't pay for it.

165
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,260
And so they're going to get removed from the github

166
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,929
Docker registry that's going to impact your BUILD C

167
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,239
I CD pipelines and your whole availability thing,

168
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,010
you know, wouldn't it be great to have a list of all the authors that ever contributed

169
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,890
it and what their legal status is for the purpose of sanctions.

170
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,420
And the reality is we're just,

171
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:51,329
we're not going to have that data to that level anytime soon.

172
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,510
Right. It's just not going to happen

173
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,489
soon, eventually, maybe if there's enough demand

174
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,290
and

175
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,350
for the majority of us, we don't care like I use True Naz.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,679
And there could be a news article tomorrow saying true Nas

177
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:10,450
is, you know, actually controlled by the Mars aliens that want to subvert

178
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,559
the world government.

179
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:12,970
And I'd be like, cool,

180
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,790
I still want my pluck server to run,

181
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,559
you know. Right. That's the thing, right.

182
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,950
This whole open source thing is we can do sort of incremental change,

183
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,410
but we can't throw it out, we can't replace it, we can't,

184
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:27,230
like, we can't do anything significant. It's, it's like road infrastructure.

185
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,200
You know, whenever I, um, you know,

186
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,859
there's all these famous intersections that have

187
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,558
been intersections for thousands of years,

188
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,669
like in Greece and in Europe and they will continue to be

189
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,000
intersections there because people need to drive their vehicles through there and

190
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,039
we can't build a building there. Like traffic needs to go through.

191
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:42,969
So

192
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,320
sure,

193
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,760
I think what's going to happen though is we're going

194
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,919
to see this sort of classic thing where it's gonna be

195
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,679
sort of complaints, driven, enforcement of like, oh, you know,

196
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,840
this person works for this company.

197
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,349
They're saying, you know, somebody kicks up a fuss and then

198
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,700
somebody like Microsoft can't ignore that. They can't be like, oh, it's ok.

199
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,640
We'll just let their account sit,

200
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,090
like

201
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,479
has to suspend the account.

202
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,799
-- Yes, I mean, I get that. I
-- don't think Microsoft right now is trying to verify

203
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:15,239
-- the nationality and employer of every account on github.
-- It's certainly not.

204
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,599
And the thing to remember too is when you're talking

205
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:21,059
about some of these services used by open source Micro

206
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,390
Soft has very little to gain by

207
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,659
suspending accounts like this or, or rather not suspending the accounts,

208
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,510
I should say, right?

209
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,039
Where if they try to put up a fuss,

210
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,270
what do they get?

211
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,270
I mean, sure, the open source community might be like, oh, good job Microsoft,

212
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,070
but the people writing them big checks are gonna be like, no, that's not,

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,190
that's not how it works.

214
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,590
Well, it's like the whole D MC A thing. Take down content on youtube and stuff.

215
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,580
Right

216
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,130
here we are two decades later,

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,489
still a problem.

218
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:50,030
People still

219
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,000
haven't left youtube

220
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,369
and, and I think this also then kind of ties into the Docker situation of,

221
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,669
we like to think about some of these services as the company is

222
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,669
ha has the the the true intentions of open source in mind.

223
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,809
And the reality is like companies are companies and they have to do things

224
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,599
that helps keep them alive,

225
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:15,809
which may not line up with the things the open source universe wants.

226
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,159
And I'm not in any way bashing Docker for this.

227
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,780
I'm certain this was a business decision and they probably

228
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,320
put a lot of thought and discussion into it.

229
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,690
But this is one of the realities of the universe we exist in, right? Like

230
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,479
open source owes you nothing as we've said many times before. But additionally,

231
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,739
companies don't owe you free services either.

232
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,619
No.

233
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,049
But part of, well,

234
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,750
one of the arguments against is that Docker only became

235
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,900
popular because of people using their free service and adding

236
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,760
Docker

237
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,330
hub and registry are only valuable

238
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,500
because of the network effect of having everything in there. And what do they have

239
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,390
in there because it was free

240
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,440
and, and part of this not really a second argument,

241
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,619
but one thing I would say is 30 days is not a long time.

242
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:01,700
No, no,

243
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:03,409
I agree.

244
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,690
And a good example of this is to, for example,

245
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,489
to get on the joint Mastodon registry web page.

246
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,820
One of the requirements is you have to commit to giving at least,

247
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,210
I think it's three months warning if you're going to shut down your incident

248
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,890
to give people time to move

249
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,289
for,

250
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:22,849
for the kind of infrastructure behind Docker like the number of things using

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,130
the Docker Registry,

252
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,830
three months probably isn't enough time. I

253
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,890
think six months to a year would be the bare minimum

254
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:36,229
you could reasonably justify here. So that part I definitely don't agree with.

255
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:36,909
But anyway,

256
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,690
so all of this put together,

257
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,320
here's the thing I keep thinking of in my mind

258
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,380
is

259
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,729
when you and I were young

260
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:45,960
nearly. I,

261
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,210
I know that's fine.

262
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:47,940
It was 20

263
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:48,210
years

264
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,549
ago.

265
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,789
It was 2020 nice track.

266
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:51,750
But

267
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,789
so back in the day,

268
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,650
there wasn't all this open source infrastructure that you could use, there was no

269
00:11:58,989 --> 00:11:59,260
github

270
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,450
there. What was it? Source forge existed

271
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:02,080
for

272
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:02,409
C

273
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:06,770
-- A? There were things but there
-- were some things but they definitely,

274
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,239
but we didn't rely on them as much because part

275
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,270
of it is they just weren't as reliable and,

276
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,210
and that's part of it.

277
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,359
And I think that is

278
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:16,840
an aspect of open source that

279
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:21,039
it's changed substantially. And I think we have to think about

280
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:25,530
what that means. I mean, so kind of, one of my, one of my new favorite examples will be

281
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,559
in, in,

282
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,619
what was it, the last podcast I think, you know, I,

283
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,400
I kind of made the off the cuff remark of if Amazon, if Aws collapsed, you know,

284
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,919
society would cease to function.

285
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,880
And someone on, on master, I was like, oh, that's, you know, that's not true.

286
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,950
And I'm like, you know what I think it might be.

287
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,510
Yeah.

288
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,070
But the point is, I mean, think about things like if

289
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,140
github disappeared

290
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,909
open source as we know it would be probably crippled beyond

291
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,989
a level, we can comprehend

292
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,219
the

293
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,419
reason.

294
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,669
That's bad. Remember when Ruby gem sort of got hacked but not really.

295
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,159
I

296
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,539
recall this. It was,

297
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:01,820
you know

298
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,869
how they recovered.

299
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,200
There was one developer highly trusted

300
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,880
who had checked out the entire thing a few days earlier.

301
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,450
That's like the toy story.

302
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:12,260
Yeah,

303
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,229
exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,400
It's the exact same story basically.

305
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:18,049
Yeah, like toy story developer was pregnant, working from home,

306
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,109
had a copy of the film that was a few days out of date

307
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,599
and yeah, somebody oops and deleted everything

308
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,330
and

309
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,049
thank goodness that lady had a copy at home that was offline because

310
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,049
yeah,

311
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,609
and that's the thing. Like there's, yeah, we can't recreate github

312
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,250
that way. That's not sustainable.

313
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,299
I'm reminded of like, like here's a great example youtube downloader has a,

314
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,830
they made a change in youtube the way it does the file. I DS or something.

315
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,229
And so youtube Downloader broke and it's literally a one line patch to fix it,

316
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,080
which I did on my system because I wanted it to work

317
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,130
and they haven't cut a release yet.

318
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:51,284
So it's broken for basically all users of youtube downloader.

319
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:54,424
And apparently the reason is their automated build pipeline is not working

320
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,065
and they want to fix that and then do a release.

321
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:57,604
They don't want to manually do whatever, don't care.

322
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,965
But the point is something as simple as a one line patch.

323
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:02,674
The, the issue

324
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:03,354
on github

325
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:07,015
for this is several 100 messages now. And like

326
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,554
and rightfully so because

327
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,445
most people they can't

328
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:11,364
do this,

329
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,159
you know, and then there's the alternate suggestion of you can pip install,

330
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,409
pointing directly at a G

331
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,650
repo. You can actually do, did you know you can do a pip install of like pointing at a G

332
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,500
URL. I, I

333
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,289
-- don't know
-- that

334
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,619
-- I believe N PM does it
-- also? Ok. Cool.

335
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,070
And again, even just getting that to work like telling people, oh, it's easy,

336
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,760
just install GIT and then run this command.

337
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:31,390
Yeah,

338
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:33,650
like a lot of software

339
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,359
users can't do that,

340
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,260
but it's not that easy. You have to install Python, you have,

341
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,840
there's like there's a lot of moving parts to that.

342
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,669
Well, you'd have Python already if you're running youtube downloader. But

343
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,429
you know, but the point is like, and this is a simple one liner patch.

344
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,510
And now you're talking about like, oh, maybe the repo disappears,

345
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,950
right? And now, now imagine telling a project

346
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,210
you can't host in github

347
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:01,119
anymore. You have to host it yourself.

348
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,679
That is not a reasonable suggestion.

349
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,729
And you and I have set that up and we know how much work that is.

350
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,700
That's the thing.

351
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,789
Yeah.

352
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,890
Well, and not just that,

353
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:16,590
not just the setup setup is easier than keeping it running for decades.

354
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,109
Setup is easy.

355
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:19,909
The one thing I'm

356
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,309
well and speaking of github,

357
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,039
for example, it it out that thing about, you know,

358
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,359
does anybody else like aggressively hit fork on

359
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,150
repo so they have a copy in their account

360
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:29,630
and people are like that waste space. And I'm like,

361
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,549
no, this is not how

362
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,669
github or enterprise data storage works.

363
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,030
And one thing I'm realizing is the vast majority of

364
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,270
people have no idea how this works because like,

365
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,190
why would they like, I have no idea how a modern car factory works.

366
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:42,809
You know,

367
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,510
I've seen the pictures of like the horse like where the horse is dragging

368
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,820
the model T Ford around the factory and a strong man or no,

369
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,489
sorry, it was a strong man, not a horse.

370
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,049
Remember the first assembly line that Ford built, right?

371
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,539
And like

372
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,669
you again,

373
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,190
there's by definition,

374
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,719
the infrastructure that we really rely upon tends to be

375
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:05,049
hidden and silent, especially when it works and works well.

376
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,909
It's just quietly working in the background.

377
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,030
That's right.

378
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,669
And

379
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,869
like open source is a great example of this. When open source works,

380
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,059
everybody ignores it.

381
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:17,000
And then when, for example, the Russian developer who wrote CO J is like,

382
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,109
I need to make a living, I need to, you know, get paid

383
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,190
and I'm not getting paid by doing this open source.

384
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,880
So I'm going to basically give it up and go get a real job

385
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,479
and everybody's like uh oh

386
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,299
-- and then there's no step to it like we don't have it. Like,
-- I mean, it's very,

387
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,710
as you describe this, I feel like this is the story of security

388
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:41,460
where everyone ignores their infosec team until they get popped

389
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,030
and then they're the most important team they have.

390
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,739
And it's like, yeah,

391
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,570
remember all that stuff we've been telling you for years you've ignored

392
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:47,979
like

393
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:49,739
guess what?

394
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:50,909
And

395
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,280
open source is just like that when open source works,

396
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,830
no one cares and no one thinks twice about it.

397
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,580
But when it doesn't work, holy cow, everything collapses

398
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,020
well,

399
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,760
and we've come to be so reliant on this

400
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,950
because there is no option to open source there.

401
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,839
You can't write this stuff yourself. I cannot write a you

402
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,819
-- downloader script.
-- Oh my goodness, stop using this excuse. Come up with a new one.

403
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,650
We know,

404
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,890
-- you know.
-- But I mean, that's the thing is people seem to think, oh,

405
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,530
how many people say, oh, I could rewrite curl in a weekend.

406
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,209
No one can do that.

407
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:21,368
And the people who think they can are very mistaken.

408
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,010
But I think going, I mean, if we,

409
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,188
you keep saying

410
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:29,489
no one can rewrite all this stuff. Not economically.

411
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,718
I like the way Toma described it in that I'm not a supplier podcast

412
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:38,588
a couple of episodes ago where he talks about things become open source because

413
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,269
they are a commodity resource.

414
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,438
They don't become a commodity resource because they're open

415
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,468
source and that kind of turns it around.

416
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,699
And I think that's part of the challenge is we have open source stuff that be

417
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,050
it came into existence because

418
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:58,290
it was turning into a functionally a commodity.

419
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,199
But now we're running,

420
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,979
we have critical infrastructure that is things like Docker and github

421
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:04,709
and

422
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:08,030
Git lab and probably a million other things.

423
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,050
Perfect example, like if Docker registry hub went away tomorrow,

424
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,170
basically every container service on the planet would

425
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,415
absolutely if github,

426
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,805
right. These are services that are like

427
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,974
they're, they're the same critical level

428
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:23,944
to society as electricity is now.

429
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,104
I can go buy a generator at Home Depot.

430
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,505
I can't go buy a github

431
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,574
or a Docker at home. No, I'm serious.

432
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,305
Like

433
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:36,275
you can like for about 15 to $20,000 you can very easily get a whole home

434
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,685
generic generator that runs on propane or gas

435
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,704
with automatic cutting and all that stuff.

436
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,505
No problem.

437
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,410
But

438
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,869
there's no alternative. Like I cannot run a github for myself, let alone for the

439
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,069
the

440
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,839
1000 projects. I need for my web dependency.

441
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,349
There are organizations that maintain internal repositories

442
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,130
of the stuff they use and you should

443
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,709
mind you like that is not a bad decision because then you keep things forever.

444
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,229
But even if

445
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,550
you have an internal repository, if github

446
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,589
died,

447
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,760
you're probably still screwed because my

448
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,589
suspicion is you're probably using github

449
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,069
for

450
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:15,286
the actual software you use, ignoring all of those dependencies.

451
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,526
You have a backup of off to the side.

452
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,485
Yeah. Yeah. Unless you have those Hermetic builds and a

453
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,095
system to support the Hermetic builds, that itself is Hermetic

454
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:26,176
to make sure you have everything

455
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:27,365
and, and honestly,

456
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,906
it's just not worth doing because like my internet goes down for like a

457
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,385
couple of minutes every couple of months

458
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,995
when tell us does maintenance or something.

459
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:33,776
You know, github

460
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:34,745
has github

461
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,735
been down recently ever, like reddit was down this week for a few hours

462
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,125
down.

463
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,881
I don't remember the last time github

464
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:45,732
-- went down but I know it occasionally blips for a little while and then
-- you

465
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:45,871
just

466
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,982
basically, I, yeah, I've played video

467
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:53,241
and that's the thing is the infrastructure nowadays is reliable enough that

468
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:56,702
it doesn't make sense to build your own complete backup to it.

469
00:19:56,911 --> 00:20:00,092
Whereas like 20 years ago you had to because it was so unreliable,

470
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,062
you didn't have a choice.

471
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:01,842
Right. Right.

472
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,602
And I think this is where now

473
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:04,802
I,

474
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,432
I hate to say regulation because I feel like I

475
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,802
just default to that is the answer to everything.

476
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,479
But I think like we've reached a point where a lot of these services are

477
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,180
like

478
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,770
in the public's interest to have some level of like regulation and,

479
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,410
and stipulations on how they should and shouldn't work.

480
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,890
Like

481
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,319
-- this is,
-- this is kind of why I'm glad Microsoft bought github

482
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,390
is Microsoft is big and they get stability like

483
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,680
you still can't like on your windows machine type make their

484
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:34,890
Pr N

485
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,410
and watch it fail because Pr N is a reserve D OS device name.

486
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:39,869
Is

487
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:40,130
it?

488
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,050
-- Yeah,
-- printer

489
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,270
pr N

490
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:44,890
12,

491
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:45,699
there's a

492
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,069
whole bunch of stuff that's reserved but like to this day

493
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,839
you want to get ad OS based program working that expects Pr N to be a printer,

494
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:53,729
it'll work.

495
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,589
That's it

496
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,520
like.

497
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,949
And so no, no, but from like from that regulatory boring, it just works point of view.

498
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:01,369
Yeah,

499
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,920
Microsoft is probably about the best entity that could have bought

500
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,660
github and not try to monetize it in some horrific way.

501
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,380
I mean

502
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,089
given time

503
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,310
they're not done yet,

504
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,579
we still to merge it with linkedin.

505
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,770
Oh

506
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,770
my goodness. The things that just entered my mind I will never speak of,

507
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:19,619
but

508
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,810
I think this is one of the things open source needs to be aware of.

509
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,689
And II I have no answers. Mind you, I have no, I don't even have ideas in this space.

510
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:34,560
I just think these are the sort of problems we have

511
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:39,130
been able to ignore for the last what 30 plus years

512
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,750
that open sources existed. And I think

513
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,699
we are reaching a point

514
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,359
where we can't ignore them anymore because I think we're going

515
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,109
to see some of these things happen more and more often.

516
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,109
Well, I think we're beginning to realize we might have systemic risk.

517
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,000
Right.

518
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,739
No, no, no.

519
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,680
Because like for example,

520
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,689
Silicon Valley Bank does have some unique properties and that they have like

521
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,349
a big herd of depositors that all talk to each other on Twitter.

522
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,579
And like when they decide to do a bank run, they

523
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,979
like it was a marathon.

524
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,890
-- Well,
-- there wasn't much running, right. Just click the mouse.

525
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:10,329
And so I think the thing is,

526
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,939
are, do we have a few unique open source projects that are risky

527
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:16,900
or is this a systemic risk of,

528
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:17,619
you know,

529
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,300
are we going to see like

530
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,329
let's put it this way if, if 100

531
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,859
if you and I got to pick 100 core open

532
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:26,040
source developers that quit and never do open source again,

533
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,530
we could basically cripple the world

534
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,849
probably it would definitely be tough to, to bring some of that,

535
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:35,650
I guess resource usage back.

536
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,010
But now

537
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:40,109
I, I would let's, I want to turn this on its head

538
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:45,609
if elect and this is an idiotic thing to say. But if electricity went away,

539
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,550
the computers don't work either.

540
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:52,310
But why are we certain we will have electricity tomorrow?

541
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:53,869
Well, outside of Texas

542
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,540
grids are

543
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:55,569
and

544
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,780
ok. No, I'm sorry, I'm going to throw

545
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,369
under the bus for this one because

546
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,310
they do not have a well regulated grid. Like it is provable.

547
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,439
Like they keep having massive outages.

548
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,300
They claimed it was a feature and it might have been until

549
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,650
-- a couple of years ago when it turns out that's
-- the thing.

550
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,000
Like electricity is well regulated. We understand it. Well, like I,

551
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,359
you can do backups or replacements at multiple levels.

552
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:17,689
Like I could do a home generator.

553
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,969
We could, you know, there's different things I can do.

554
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:24,280
But with software, like I can't replace curl curl, I need curl.

555
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,219
Stop it. That's stop talking about rewriting curl.

556
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:31,969
Like I, I feel like you're going to go senile someday and just rewrite curl.

557
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,380
That's going to be what you do and everyone's gonna be like, oh,

558
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,790
there's old man curt rewriting curl again.

559
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:38,800
That's all you talk about

560
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:40,189
it.

561
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,930
Oh, my goodness. No. Anyway,

562
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,140
I think this is one of the things I

563
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,729
keep thinking about now is like electricity and water

564
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,089
and roads

565
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,890
and all of these things

566
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,319
I don't think are any different now than open

567
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,040
source software or even github to a degree.

568
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,540
Like,

569
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,180
I think they are the same sort of critical

570
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:08,040
infrastructure except we don't talk about open source or github

571
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:11,290
as critical infrastructure. We talk about them powering

572
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,209
other critical infrastructures like nuclear plants or dams or whatever.

573
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,180
But

574
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,849
I think this is a conversation

575
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,709
that whether we want it or not,

576
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,920
it's going to happen because I think we're going to

577
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,569
see more and more events until we can't ignore it.

578
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,630
Now. Don't get me wrong

579
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,270
as humans. There is nothing we are better at than ignoring

580
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,020
until it's too late.

581
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,729
Like

582
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:36,839
we like just look up rivers on fire

583
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,959
if you want to know what I'm talking about.

584
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,189
A very simple example is electrical transformers, right?

585
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,469
They have 12 to 18 month lead times on building

586
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:47,079
these things because they are horrifically complex and complicated.

587
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,849
And essentially

588
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,060
the way we've dealt with it in Ukraine is everybody's just sending them stuff

589
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,579
and all the other orders are getting backlogged,

590
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:57,140
right?

591
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,069
Kachi just made them priority.

592
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,209
Canada is sending transformers

593
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:01,920
like

594
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:05,180
because we we just and we're pulling them from spares like we're not

595
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,699
making new ones magically in a week because if we could build the transform in a week,

596
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,119
well, we'd have been doing that in the first place, right?

597
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:12,300
And so

598
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,680
like transformers are very much a critical path component of the electrical grid.

599
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:17,420
And

600
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:18,439
but the

601
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,770
for the majority of the time, you know, transformers

602
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,089
die once in a while, but there's no major event that wipes out a pile of transformers.

603
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,229
And I think that's maybe the difference is like

604
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,599
we have github,

605
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,020
we don't have

606
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,670
like

607
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,319
six different competing gith hubs

608
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,219
or six different competing Docker registries.

609
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,060
We have

610
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,550
-- a and that's especially in software
-- Well,

611
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,890
there are competing Docker registries now and I

612
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,089
suspect they're going to get a lot more popular

613
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,020
name. Three.

614
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,000
So the three Docker registries I would name and I can name more than three. Mind you.

615
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,969
There's the, the Kubernetes one.

616
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:57,003
That was what GCR dot IO that just got renamed like Ks dot IO, I think.

617
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,483
Anyway, they're renaming it.

618
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:00,993
There's the Amazon container registry, there's the github

619
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:04,133
container registry. Microsoft has a container registry.

620
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,282
Do you want me to keep going?

621
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,182
And fun fact, how do you get the darker tools to use them?

622
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,083
They won't even make it a configuration variable.

623
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:12,782
It's hard coded into use the darker registry for a lot of these. You

624
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:15,762
-- can
-- change that in the configuration file.

625
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,666
It's not super pleasant though, I will admit because I've

626
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,345
see and that's I've done some work and also Red Hat has a registry,

627
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:23,426
there's lots of registries.

628
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:24,156
But anyway,

629
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:28,225
it, it, it can be done, but it's not pleasant is how I would describe it.

630
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:29,026
But we,

631
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:31,625
so the tooling already doesn't support having multiple

632
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:33,745
registries and kind of pulling from multiple sources.

633
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,265
-- We would need to do a lot of work for that to work.
-- Well,

634
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,359
I mean, I, I think what we'll see the answer will be

635
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,959
the container name is just going to also contain the registry name, right?

636
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,300
-- They're, they're functionally name space in that regard and whatever
-- that's fine.

637
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,489
And what's interesting then

638
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,729
why is this not a problem for things like N PM, js.org or for Rust crates

639
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:54,260
or is it a problem for them?

640
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,349
-- It isn't
-- a problem yet. Well, wait, you mean them hosting all of this data or?

641
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,250
Well, what I'm saying is,

642
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,959
is this a Docker registry problem or is it

643
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:07,239
a systemic problem with having one registry for X

644
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,219
or one resource for X

645
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:11,540
I? I think you're asking the wrong question.

646
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,819
Docker is a company N PM and Rust are foundations.

647
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,020
-- And so that's what I'm saying is, is that a meaningful difference or not?
-- It?

648
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,280
I maybe, yes, I think it is

649
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,900
because if N PM ran out of money,

650
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,719
it would become a huge problem.

651
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,550
It's just, it's a well funded foundation because, well,

652
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,040
it's critical infrastructure for lots of,

653
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,959
lots of other companies. And that makes sense.

654
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,069
Docker is a company

655
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:39,250
and if they don't make money, they can't exist like that's just how companies work.

656
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,699
And so this is a perfect example is maybe the systemic

657
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:46,119
risk mostly limited to companies and not the nonprofits if so.

658
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:46,859
Ok, cool.

659
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,699
Like open source is probably going to be OK,

660
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:51,209
it'll be ugly for a bit once we lose some companies

661
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,680
maybe or you know,

662
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,420
like basically do we need to decompose these into

663
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,810
having multiple entities or is it just we,

664
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,050
they need to be under nonprofits?

665
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,530
Maybe

666
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:05,239
I can't answer that because all of these foundations are still using github,

667
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,329
generally speaking to drive

668
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,369
everything. Actually, the N PM.

669
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,930
Did N PM Microsoft, I think technically has control over N PM now,

670
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,689
don't they?

671
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
But I believe and don't II I may be getting this wrong.

672
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,640
So I apologize in advance and, and please tell me on, on

673
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,300
Mastodon or something, but I think

674
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,579
N PM

675
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:27,430
is controlled by Microsoft. But is there a foundation behind it?

676
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,579
I'm less, I'm less certain now that I talk about this.

677
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,260
That's

678
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:30,959
what I'm saying.

679
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,369
When I talk about systemic risk, if,

680
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,239
if the systemic risk can largely be addressed by having it run under a nonprofit?

681
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,859
Cool.

682
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,939
Like that's a relatively in the scheme of solutions. That's a simple one.

683
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,420
-- I
-- mean,

684
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,699
sometimes, but look at

685
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,329
open SSL is a nonprofit and they've had, uh, well, it's,

686
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:50,969
it's a little better now but they had huge cash flow problems in the past.

687
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,569
Well, I mean,

688
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:54,010
cash flow problem is going to be an issue regardless of how

689
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,189
it's structured or who you are because you just need resources,

690
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,729
right? So, I mean,

691
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:57,859
I,

692
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:59,030
I

693
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,900
don't think Open SSL would have worked as a company.

694
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,400
I suspect it would have been worse than as a nonprofit.

695
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,359
Yeah, I mean, look at Mozilla,

696
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:09,500
let's pick on Mozilla, you couldn't have a web browser company today.

697
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,719
There's just, there's no way

698
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:13,729
unless you have some like bizarre niche and you see

699
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:15,660
that in like opera and brave and some of these,

700
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,540
these, you know, I guess third party browsers, but fundamentally speaking,

701
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:23,569
-- you've got Google.
-- Well, you've got Chrome and Safari.

702
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:24,109
Yeah,

703
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,069
those are used by a larger company to drive other things they want to do

704
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,540
and everyone, if you're not using it,

705
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,449
you should totally use Firefox because it's awesome.

706
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:34,810
We can,

707
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:37,380
Kurt and I can get into argument now about how he doesn't like

708
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,170
the Firefox profile manager and I keep telling him to suck it up.

709
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:45,410
It does too. You just type about profiles and you get a terrible looking screen

710
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:46,439
but,

711
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,430
but it's good enough, suck it up anyway. All right,

712
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,969
we've been talking for 30 minutes and I feel like

713
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:54,189
I have more questions than answers at this point.

714
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,609
And maybe that's good. I don't know.

715
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,630
Well, here's my hope is that some academics start looking at the open source market

716
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,239
as they have at financial markets and, and maybe start looking for,

717
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:08,800
like, are these systemic risks? Are they, how do we look at them?

718
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,319
What are the risks like we need a lot more research and understanding here?

719
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,739
You know what I think?

720
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,739
I think we are at an inflection point

721
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:18,040
in open source

722
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,729
and I don't know what it's going to look like on the other side of this, but I feel like

723
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:26,380
something big is going to change in the next couple of years.

724
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,520
I suspect it's just gonna keep limping along as it has.

725
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,010
I don't, I don't know, this one feels different to me.

726
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,510
One thing I'm really curious about though is the interaction of A I chat

727
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,790
GP T and code creation and code improvement and code editing with open source.

728
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,069
Because no, like I've been using chat GP T to write code and it's

729
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,349
pretty good. Actually,

730
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,040
it can do certain things very well. It can't do it.

731
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,260
That is a complicated topic.

732
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:53,015
Probably discuss another day.

733
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:58,824
But the one takeaway I have from using chat GP T is chat GP T is a heck of a power tool.

734
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,805
And the more powerful the user, the more powerful that tool is

735
00:31:02,064 --> 00:31:03,354
I have had

736
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,755
a very different experience than you I think.

737
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:08,464
Well, so what I'm saying though is is if you want somebody

738
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:11,724
to basically if you want chat GP T to write web browser

739
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:12,685
related code,

740
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,880
you or I doing it versus a actual web browser developer driving it,

741
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,459
they're going to get better results.

742
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,959
And so what I'm saying is I,

743
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:25,199
I suspect chat GP T might be a heck of a power tool for these projects to start using.

744
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:28,400
I think that is a different conversation to the one we're having.

745
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:31,930
And I'm not going to address that in any meaningful way right now.

746
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,199
I think fundamentally

747
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,069
at the end of this conversation,

748
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,790
we are going, I mean, sadly,

749
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,319
we have to wait to see what the future of open source looks like.

750
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,160
But I think the future of open source will not look like the past.

751
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:46,540
And that is exciting and terrifying at the same time,

752
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,540
I'm not, I just, I can't see the economic incentives changing significantly.

753
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,650
I don't think it's going to be economic incentives.

754
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,410
I, I honestly, and you're going to hate this I regulation.

755
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,359
I think it's going to happen.

756
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,260
I think that's part of the story.

757
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,069
And I think what's really fascinating is all the regulators

758
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,619
I've seen so far talking about this seem to understand that

759
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,469
you can throw companies that use open source under the bus,

760
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,560
but the developers, they're in violet and that is fascinating that they get that.

761
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,810
So let's put this conversation on hold.

762
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:15,089
I'm going to end this show because we're

763
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,150
going to be talking to someone from the sovereign

764
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,000
fund in the very near future.

765
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,780
And so we will have a literal expert on this topic. We can ask questions to,

766
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,359
well, not just an expert, but this is like

767
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,329
representative of actual government policy and understand

768
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,180
and I'm hopeful we're going to get a glimpse into the future.

769
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:36,540
So I'm ending it now before we drag on much longer. Thank you, Kurt.
